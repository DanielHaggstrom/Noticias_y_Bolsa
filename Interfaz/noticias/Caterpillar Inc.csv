0;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2019-10-23T11:30:11Z;Caterpillar blames trade tensions as it warns on profits;US industrial bellwether slashes outlook as sales dip more than expected;US industrial bellwether Caterpillar slashed its profit forecast for the year, blaming trade tensions and uncertainty in the global economy, as it posted a bigger than expected decline in quarterly revenues.The manufacturer, known for its bulldozers and building site machinery, said third-quarter sales dropped 6 per cent year-on-year, mostly because of weak demand for construction and mining equipment from dealers that supply kit to customers.“We believe dealers reduced inventory due to uncertainty in the global economy, resulting from trade tensions and other factors,” said chief executive Jim Umpleby on a call with analysts.Caterpillar lowered its full-year earnings forecast to between $10.90 to $11.40 a share, down from a previous range of between $12.06 to $13.06, reflecting “modestly lower” sales in 2019.The gloomy outlook is evidence of how the trade conflict between China and the US, sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariffs on a range of imported goods, is weighing on companies that sell products internationally.Caterpillar said it was moving to lower output and looking at ways to cut overheads. “We’re taking actions to reduce production levels to reflect dealer order patterns and will be ready to increase production, if order levels improve,” added Mr Umpleby.Shares in the company fell 5 per cent in pre-market trade, but were up 1 per cent later on Wednesday at $135.09.Caterpillar’s revenues were $12.8bn in the penultimate quarter of the year, which missed analysts’ expectations for $13.6bn, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts.Dealers reduced their machine and engine inventories by $400m in the third quarter, compared with an increase of $800m in the same period a year ago.The decline in revenues was spread across all Caterpillar’s major segments — construction, resources and energy industries.In construction, the group’s largest area, revenues edged up in North America supported by road and non-residential building construction.However, there was a deterioration in the Asia-Pacific region amid competitive pressures in China, although management said it expected stimulus measures from Beijing to provide a boost.Profits fell to $1.5bn, or $2.66 a share, in the three months ended in September, down from $1.7bn, to $2.88 a share, in the year-ago quarter, shy of Wall Street’s expectations.
1;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2019-07-24T12:19:02Z;Caterpillar hit by deceleration of US shale boom;Weaker equipment demand from Permian knocks industrial bellwether;A slowdown in the US shale boom made itself felt in the most recent results of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, which on Wednesday reported a sharp dip in sales to the energy sector.The industrial bellwether recorded an 11 per cent drop in revenues from the oil and gas industry in the second quarter, citing “lower demand for new equipment in the Permian Basin”.The company retained its full year profit guidance of $12.06-$13.06 a share, but said it expected to come in at the lower end of this — assuming a recovery in oil and gas by the end of the year. Shares in Caterpillar were down 4 per cent in pre-market trading.The US shale boom has driven up American oil production exponentially in recent years, but lately investment has slowed and recent indicators have highlighted a deceleration in production growth.Despite the weaker results in energy, Caterpillar was boosted by stronger demand from the construction sector, where sales jumped 5 per cent, and natural resources, which rose 11 per cent. Overall revenues were up 3 per cent at $14.4bn for the quarter, with consolidated operating profit up 2 per cent at $2.213bn.“Sales and revenues increased this quarter, including a record performance from Construction Industries, which reflected our strong competitive position globally,” said Caterpillar chairman and chief executive Jim Umpleby.“Our strong operating cash flow in the quarter allowed us to repurchase shares and pay dividends of about $1.9 billion. This is in line with our intention to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders.”
2;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar lifts quarterly dividend to record level;Industrial bellwether lifts quarterly payout by 20%;Caterpillar on Thursday boosted its quarterly dividend to a record level and said it expected to boost both buybacks and payouts to shareholders over the next four years.The industrial bellwether lifted its quarterly cash dividend by 20 per cent to $1.03 per share — the highest in the company’s history — payable August 20. It also said it planned to boost the dividend in each of the next four years by “at least a high single-digit percentage”.With the remaining cash flow, Caterpillar expects to buy back shares on a more consistent basis “with the goal of at least offsetting dilution in market downturns”. The company had $7.1bn in cash at the end of the first quarter.The Illinois-based company also said it expected to boost machinery, energy and transportation services sales to $28bn by 2026, up from $18bn last year.The update comes after Caterpillar last month boosted its full-year earnings outlook and reported stronger-than-expected quarterly sales aided by higher demand in its mining and construction businesses.Caterpillar shares, which were up 9 per cent year-to-date as of Wednesday’s close, were little changed in pre-market trade.
3;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2019-04-24T12:50:47Z;Caterpillar revenues boosted by mining and construction equipment;Demand for new road equipment in North America drives building unit;Higher demand in its mining and construction businesses helped industrial bellwether Caterpillar beat forecasts for first-quarter sales and prompted it to boost its full-year earnings outlook.The Illinois-based company said sales rose 5 per cent from a year ago to $13.5bn, ahead of analyst estimates for $13.4bn, according to a Refinitiv survey. Caterpillar shares slid 1 per cent in pre-market trade.Sales in Caterpillar’s resource industries jumped 18 per cent as “mining production levels and commodity market fundamentals remained positive”.Meanwhile, higher demand for new equipment, primarily to support road construction, in North America drove revenue in its construction unit up 3 per cent. Revenues in energy and transportation were flat.The company, known for its bulldozers, backhoes and other large machinery, reported a profit of $1.9bn, or $3.25 a share, up from $1.7bn, or $2.74 a share, in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.94 a share exceeded analysts’ expectations for $2.85.Andrew Bonfield, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, said the company’s profit margins had come under pressure from tariffs and higher steel costs, but over the course of the year it expected price increases to keep margins steady.“Overall we expect price realisations to offset manufacturing cost increases,” he said.He said profits in the first quarter had been hit by the strength of the US dollar, particularly against the euro, and there had been some weak spots including sales to the oil and gas industry in North America.Overall, however, the group was “very confident” in its end markets, with resource industries a particularly strong point.Mr Bonfield added that the North American construction market continued to be “very strong” and he did not expect any change to that picture in the US.In China, which has been the focus of concerns about economic slowdown, Mr Bonfield said the company now expected the market to be stronger this year than in 2018.Investors have been concerned about the impact on Caterpillar of a slowing Chinese economy, amid a crackdown on debt-fuelled spending and the US-China trade war. However, the latest batch of results could help ease fears about the impact of the trade spat and slowing global growth.Caterpillar boosted its full-year earnings outlook to between $12.06 and $13.06 a share, citing a benefit of 31 cents a share from the US tax overhaul.Caterpillar shares are up 12 per cent year-to-date as of Tuesday’s close, having declined 19 per cent last year.
4;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2019-02-26T17:33:09Z;Caterpillar hit with two-notch downgrade by UBS;Analyst warns of peak 2019 profits amid construction slowdown;Caterpillar was the victim of a rare two-notch downgrade on Tuesday as UBS flipped the stock from “buy” to “sell” and warned of peak 2019 profits amid softer equipment sales to the construction and energy industries.UBS analyst Steven Fisher cautioned in a note on Tuesday that investors have yet to account for cyclical pressure and a possible earnings decline in 2020. The investment bank is forecasting a roughly 8 per cent drop in earnings per share in 2020 on a year-over-year basis, with growth in demand from the mining sector and continued share buybacks unable to fully offset headwinds in construction and oil and gas, Mr Fisher said.UBS expects Caterpillar’s sales in the construction segment to fall 8 per cent next year amid lower demand. Energy and transportation sales are seen dropping 5 per cent, weighed down by slower investments in pipelines. Both views are below Wall Street’s consensus forecasts, Mr Fisher noted.“We believe ~55% of [Caterpillar’s] end markets likely already have peaked or will peak in 2019, including North America construction, China construction, and Oil & Gas,” he wrote in a research note.Mr Fisher cut Caterpillar’s stock to a “sell” and lowered the price target to $125 from $154.Shares were trading at $137.29 midday Tuesday, down 2.9 per cent. Caterpillar has gained 8.5 per cent since the start of the year, coinciding with a broad rally for industrial stocks amid rising hopes for a US-China trade deal.Illinois-based Caterpillar, known for its bulldozers, backhoes and other large machinery, faces a slowdown in Chinese economic growth. The company cautioned that it expects just a “modest” increase in global sales in 2019, including flat results in China, where rapid growth had fuelled sales over the past two years. Weaker sales in the world’s second most important economy also contributed to fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations last month.Despite the company’s downbeat forecast, analysts tracked by Refinitiv rate Caterpillar’s shares a “buy” with a price target of $143.19, on average. Sixteen of the 28 analysts have “buy” ratings, while only two analysts rate the stock a “sell.”
5;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2019-01-28T19:46:58Z;China warnings from Caterpillar, Nvidia rattle Wall Street;;US stocks faced hefty losses on Monday after warnings of a sluggish Chinese economy rippled across Wall Street.Caterpillar, the maker of construction and mining equipment, issued a weaker earnings outlook than expected for 2019 with sales poised to flatline in China. Nvidia added to investors’ concerns by making a surprise cut to its fourth-quarter revenue guidance, saying demand for gaming chips in the region had deteriorated.Monday’s fresh warnings of trouble in China — just days before US and Chinese officials meet in Washington — gave Wall Street reason to believe that a long-running trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies is taking its toll, both on the Chinese economy and US corporate earnings. Nvidia’s downbeat outlook echoed warnings from other tech giants including Apple, which shocked Wall Street early this month with a rare cut to its revenue forecast, citing slow iPhone sales in China.The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” was sitting more than 2 points higher at 19.53.Morgan Stanley’s chief US equity strategist Michael Wilson advised clients to “dismount” from the bull market amid continued volatility and mixed signals from the initial batch of fourth-quarter earnings.“We’ve gotten close enough on a bull that is becoming increasingly dangerous and we struggle to see the upside in hanging on just to see how long we can,” Mr Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “We think it is better to hop off now and rest up for the next rodeo.”Technology and industrial shares were among the worst performers in the S&P 500, which tumbled as much as 1.5 per cent. The benchmark index was down 1 per cent in midday trading amid a 1.8 per cent decline for the tech sector. Industrials fell 1.3 per cent, while healthcare dipped 1.4 per cent and communication services fell 1.4 per cent.Energy shares also retreated, down 1.4 per cent, as the worsening outlook for China renewed concerns that a slowdown could hit oil demand. West Texas Intermediate lost 3.3 per cent to trade at $51.91 a barrel. Brent crude slipped 2.9 per cent to $59.85 a barrel.The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.1 per cent. Shares in Caterpillar, by far the worst performer in the Dow, sank 9 per cent to set a pace toward its worst single-day drop since August 2011.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.3 per cent, battered by falling shares of semiconductor groups. Nvidia was down 15.5 per cent. Advanced Micro Devices declined 7 per cent, while shares of Intel and Texas Instruments also saw red.Other companies with exposure to China also felt pressure on Monday. Shares of Boeing, MGM Resorts, smartphone glass maker Corning, auto parts supplier BorgWarner and engine builder Cummins were in negative territory.The US dollar softened, with the DXY index down 0.1 per cent at 95.711.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped 1.2 basis points to 2.7386, while that on the two-year note declined 1 basis point to 2.5897.
6;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2019-01-28T19:00:52Z;Caterpillar joins litany of manufacturers hit by China slowdown;Shares in earthmover group fall nearly 10% and drag down Wall St indices;China’s flagging economy is taking its toll on global businesses, with industrial bellwether Caterpillar and US chipmaker Nvidia on Monday blaming their disappointing prospects on the country’s faltering growth.The warnings follow fears raised by a succession of companies in the US, Europe and Asia about the widening global ramifications of the Chinese slowdown.Beijing last week revealed its economy had grown at 6.6 per cent last year, its slowest annual rate in almost three decades, as a crackdown on debt-fuelled spending and the US trade war rattled Chinese consumers and hobbled corporate investment.Caterpillar said it expected only a “modest” increase in worldwide sales this year and no growth in China — a sharp slowdown in what had been a booming market for the earthmoving equipment group in the past two years.Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, cut its fourth-quarter earnings forecast by $500m, or about 19 per cent, pointing to a slowdown in sales to gamers in China as well as weaker business from its data centre customers.Jensen Huang, Nvidia chief executive, described the three months to January as “an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter.”Shares in both companies fell sharply, with Caterpillar down more than 9 per cent and Nvidia 15 per cent, contributing to a 1 per cent decline in the S&P 500 index in afternoon trading on Monday.Warnings from some of the world’s largest US manufacturers about their diminished prospects in China, including Apple and Ford, have roiled the financial markets for weeks, raising questions about whether the decade-long post-crisis international expansion is nearing an end.The technology sector has been particularly hard hit, and not just in the US. Shares in Japan Display, a supplier to Apple, also fell almost 5 per cent on Monday after the company warned of “harsh” earnings impact from the US-China trade war and the slowing Chinese economy. In addition to the recent warning from Apple, Samsung this month projected its first drop in quarterly operating profits for two years, similarly blaming the China slowdown as well as highlighting the trade war between Washington and Beijing.Intel, another chipmaker, last week reported weak revenues for the fourth quarter of last year and gave disappointing guidance for the first quarter of this year. Bob Swan, its interim chief executive, warned: “Trade and macro [economic] concerns, especially in China, have intensified.”Caterpillar joins automakers and other industrial groups in scaling back expectations. Alcoa, the aluminium group, said recently it expected worldwide demand for the metal to rise at its weakest pace since the great financial crisis, with growth in China slowing to 4-4.5 per cent, compared to a 6.5 per cent increase estimated for 2016.Jaguar Land Rover, the car manufacturer, said last month it planned to cut thousands of jobs, in part because of a slowdown in the Chinese market.Caterpillar gave its disappointing guidance as it reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, in part because of a fall in sales in China compared to strong sales in the final three months of 2017.The company says China represents only 5 to 10 per cent of its revenues, but the sharp slowdown in sales there is expected to have a noticeable impact after two years of very rapid growth.
7;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-10-24T04:43:43Z;Rising costs at US manufacturers unnerve investors;Stocks gyrate as concerns grow about tariffs adding to inflationary pressures;US industrial companies unnerved investors on Tuesday with reports of rising prices and costs for products ranging from earthmoving equipment to Post-it Notes, raising concerns about tariffs squeezing profits and adding to pressure on global inflation.Third-quarter earnings reports from companies including 3M, Caterpillar and United Technologies highlighted their plans to raise prices to recoup costs that have been boosted by labour shortages and the wave of tariff increases led by the US and followed by other countries around the world.There were also signs of weaker demand in some markets, adding to investors’ fears of a squeeze on earnings if companies could not pass on their increased costs. The IMF said this month that it expected the steady expansion in the world economy to continue into 2019, but warned that growth might have peaked in some big economies.Shares in 3M and Caterpillar lost 4.4 per cent and 7.7 per cent, respectively, as the news from US manufacturers exacerbated investors’ anxiety. Global stock markets were already tumbling before the US companies reported, following a drop in Chinese equities. The S&P 500 fell 2.3 per cent before clawing back most of its losses and closing 0.6 per cent lower.Chinese equities have suffered a torrid few weeks, with the CSI 300 index of companies listed on the mainland falling nearly 6 per cent since the start of October, as mounting geopolitical risks, including the trade impasse with the US, continue to rattle investors globally.The sell-off has forced Chinese authorities to take action in the past couple of weeks, including a plans to cut personal income tax, to support the economy and revive confidence in the world’s worst-performing major stock market this year. The CSI 300 has suffered a volatile few days, with the index up 1.75 per cent at midday on Wednesday.Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment group, said it would increase prices globally for its machines and engines by 1-4 per cent at the start of next year, reflecting healthy order rates and rising costs for materials and freight.Andrew Bonfield, the company’s chief financial officer, told the Financial Times that he expected price rises would more than offset the higher costs of tariffs and transport.However, investors were troubled by Caterpillar’s report of a $400m fall in its backlog of orders during the quarter, to $17.3bn at the end of September.Joe O’Dea, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said investors were on alert for any sign of a slowdown. “It’s with a market backdrop that is extremely anxious about rates of change,” he said. “We are moving from what has been a very strong growth environment to seeing that slowing.”Mr Bonfield agreed that investors were watching closely for a downturn. “We’ve gone through a very long bull market, people are concerned about calling the end of the cycle,” he said.However, he added: “Demand is very strong, our backlog is very strong.”Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jefferies, said investors’ expectations for Caterpillar’s long-term earnings had become “kind of crazy”, and might need to be reset for a more realistic outlook, even if revenues and profits continued to grow next year.“The growth that’s already baked in is 10 per cent,” he said. “Is it going to be 5 per cent, or will it be 15 per cent? That matters a lot.”3M, the industrial and consumer products group that makes Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes, cut its projection for 2018 earnings by about 4 per cent. It said quarterly sales volumes had fallen in every region except Asia-Pacific, but that those declines were offset by rising prices.The company said it expected a $100m impact from tariffs next year, but like Caterpillar predicted that “our pricing will more than offset that and raw material price increases”.Ultimately, these tariffs get all passed on to the consumer in one form or another. It’s just tax on the consumerOther manufacturers also said they expected to raise prices in the future. Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies, told analysts on a call that the group’s lift business Otis, which is suffering from falling profits because of increased costs this year, would “start to see some recovery next year and even more the following year”.He said: “Ultimately, these tariffs get all passed on to the consumer in one form or another. It’s just tax on the consumer.”Consumer goods companies have similarly cautioned about rising input costs in recent days, and are trying to push up prices in response.This week, Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex tissues and Andrex toilet roll, said “significant commodity inflation” had dented margins and operating profit. It expected additional costs of pulp, raw materials and other commodities to hit the upper half of its previous estimate of $675m-$775m for the year.Rising concerns over tariffs, global growth and potentially peaking corporate earnings hit markets around the world on Tuesday. The FTSE All-World index slid 1.4 per cent, and is on track for its worst monthly performance since mid-2012 — the peak of the eurozone crisis.Growth-sensitive sectors including energy, materials and industrials were the worst-hit. Industrial stocks have slumped almost 10 per cent this month, and materials companies are down more than 20 per cent since their January peak.Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, said that as well as concerns about tariffs, “you have worries about a global slowdown in growth, and investors here are taking that to heart. There is the idea that this is as good as it gets in the US and the rest of the world is already rolling over.”Additional reporting by Patti Waldmeir, Alistair Gray, Robin Wigglesworth and Nicole Bullock
8;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-10-23T17:31:24Z;US industrials: input error;The cost of capital is being re-priced higher;“Great quarter guys!” is simply not good enough any more. Tensions in the capital markets are high and investors are looking for the faintest reasons to ding companies. The latest victim of such psychology: Caterpillar.On Tuesday, the industrial equipment company reported its best third-quarter earnings per share in history, a jump of nearly 50 per cent over last year’s period. Increases in both sales volume and selling price easily overwhelmed the effects of tariff-driven, higher-priced steel and freight costs. But even that small nod to cost inflation and trade wars spooked the market. Caterpillar shares dropped nearly a tenth on Tuesday. The worry is what it did not say. Caterpillar chose not to raise its profit outlook, which could portend something darker around the corner.Higher input and freight levies should not surprise. A global economic expansion should naturally lead to rising prices (as well as the monetary tightening already under way in the US). The question is whether the effects of tariffs and the trade war are becoming political, self-inflicted wounds. The earnings report of another industrial titan, conglomerate 3M, also roiled its shareholders on Tuesday. Among other disappointing news, 3M said that the earnings drag from higher material costs — including tariff costs — would be roughly double their previous estimate. Tariffs specifically would cost it an extra $100m. 3M insisted that pricing increases make up for higher costs. Caterpillar has done the same. Yet 3M still downgraded its organic sales growth and earnings forecast for the rest of 2018.According to Credit Suisse, with nearly a quarter of companies reporting results, almost 80 per cent of them have beaten earnings estimates. That kind of overachievement is belied by the sustained fall in equity prices. There is unquestionably a re-pricing of the cost of capital currently under way. When the cost of capital is rising, even growing earnings can lead to lower valuations.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

10;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-10-23T12:32:46Z;Caterpillar knocked back by concerns over rising tariff-related costs;;Investor concerns over rising input costs as a result of the Trump administration’s tariffs overshadowed a bump up in earnings outlook and a better than expected set of third-quarter results from industrial bellwether Caterpillar.Shares in the world’s biggest earthmoving equipment maker tumbled nearly 7 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday as management detailed the costs from the ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington.Caterpillar said the trade dispute, which has pushed up steel and aluminium prices and prompted retaliatory action from trading partners, resulted in $40m in extra costs for materials during the third quarter.“Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs,” it said in a statement. “Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices and tariffs.”Caterpillar said cost increases were more than offset by higher prices for its products and aggressive cost cutting during the third quarter, however. It added that it now expects the impact of tariffs to come at the low end of a previously provided range of $100m-$200m for the second half of this year.Still, the comments on higher costs — coming just days after Honeywell flagged potential costs in the “hundreds of millions of dollars” from higher Chinese and US tariffs — further rattled investors, who were already on edge over the prospect of slowing growth in China.For the three months to the end of September, Caterpillar took in $13.5bn in revenues, an 18 per cent rise from the prior year period and well ahead of the $13.2bn that the market was expecting. Sales in its three bigges units — construction, resource, and energy & transportation — all grew strongly, clocking in gains of 16 per cent, 35 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.Net income was $1.7bn, or $2.88 per diluted share, also topping expectations for $2.72 a share.In a sign of its ability to offset higher input costs, Caterpillar also nudged up its outlook for the year. It sees earnings per share for 2018 at $10.65-$11.65, up from the $10.50-$11.50 range it gave just three months ago.Shares in Caterpillar have been on something of a rollercoaster ride this year. Having risen sharply at the start of the year on signs of renewed sales growth following several years of weak demand, the stock was knocked back this summer by trade concerns. It has lost more than 18 per cent of its market value so far in 2018, with the bulk of that incurred since the start of October.
11;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-07-30T12:24:53Z;Caterpillar aims to shrug off trade war impact with prices rises;World’s biggest earthmoving equipment maker confident demand will support margins;Caterpillar said it had yet to see any impact of the US’s trade war with China and was confident its decision to push through price increases in an effort to offset up to $200m of higher material costs as a result of the Trump administration’s recent tariffs.The world’s biggest earthmoving equipment maker exceeded market expectations as it reported record earnings for the second quarter, thanks to what it said were healthy order rates, a solid backlog and strong demand from sectors such as oil and gas and mining.The Illinois-based company has been regarded by investors as a potential casualty of a trade war and its shares are often the target of selling pressure when tensions between the US and its trading partners, particularly China, flare up: it has lost 9.5 per cent of its market value so far in 2018.The shares slid another 2 per cent on Monday to close at $139.75, even though management brushed aside the trade war concerns. “Our business in China continues to be strong. We haven’t seen an impact of the trade tension on our business,” said Jim Umpleby, chief executive, on a call with analysts on Monday.Caterpillar acknowledged that the Trump administration’s tariffs, which have pushed up steel and aluminium prices, and prompted retaliatory action from trading partners, would see a rise in material costs of between $100m and $200m in the second half of this year.It aimed to mitigate the effect of higher materials costs, as well as rising freight costs, by raising prices on its equipment by 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent, and by cutting costs.The company said it expected to report profit per share this year in the range of $10.50 to $11.50, up from $9.75 to $10.75 previously. On an adjusted basis, the range rises to $11 to $12 a share, up 75 cents.Joseph Creed, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times the company had “a number of different levers” at its disposal that made it “confident we can raise the outlook” for earnings despite increasing prices for equipment.A more comprehensive review of Caterpillar’s pricing typically takes place in January, giving it a longer timeframe to assess the impact of tariffs.For the three months ended June 30, Caterpillar reported a 24 per cent increase in sales to $14bn compared with an average of $13.9bn in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. Revenue from machinery sold in Asia Pacific was up 39 per cent from a year ago to $3.2bn.Earnings more than doubled to $2.82 a share, a record for the second quarter, from $1.35 a year ago and comfortably above market forecasts for $2.58 a share. Adjusted earnings were $2.97 a share.The company’s board also authorised a new $10bn stock buyback programme, effective January 1, 2019, that replaces the previous one from 2014..
12;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-05-14T03:00:51Z;Executives learn how to lead digital disruption;Courses help leaders embrace technological change rather than fall victim to it;Over the past decade, Caterpillar has placed remote monitoring sensors on 700,000 of its Big Yellow construction machines. The sensors capture information such as how often equipment is used and for how long, which can help customers improve efficiency and save money — but it was hard for them to turn the data deluge into useful insight.“A chief financial officer doesn’t need access to the same data as an engineer, but our dashboard displayed the lot, slowing customers down,” says Kjeld Jespersen, Caterpillar’s Switzerland-based global product manager for digital services.So, the 49-year-old Dane introduced a user interface (UI) that lets people search for data most relevant to their role, which increased the number of subscriptions to Caterpillar’s remote monitoring service. The project is one example of digital transformation — using technology to transform a business.Many companies are trying to transform their businesses — often radically — to keep abreast of rapid technological advances. However, poor leadership is cited by McKinsey, the consultancy, as one of the reasons such complex projects often fail. This might explain a rise in the number of people seeking executive education courses that can help them manage digital transformation.Jespersen is one such example. He began his UI project before enrolling in the Leading Digital Transformation course at Switzerland’s IMD, in 2016. He says the programme gave him the idea of testing UI designs with customers.“Previously, we used internal engineers who speculated on what customers wanted,” says Jespersen. “Now we understand what customers need. That is important, as they expect to access data with a single mouse click, like they are buying products on Amazon.”Participant numbers for the $13,000 Driving Digital Strategy course at Harvard Business School in Boston have risen from about 60 in 2013 to 100 today, says faculty co-chair Sunil Gupta. “Part of the reason for the increase is that legacy companies are trying to manage potential disruption from new digital entrants like Uber and Airbnb and avoid becoming the Kodak or the BlackBerry of the world,” he says, referring to companies which failed to adapt.The threat of disruption spurred German telecoms company Deutsche Telekom to last year create levelUP! — a custom digital transformation course — with Duke Corporate Education, part of Duke University in the US. “Competition is coming not just from traditional telcos but also digital providers, like Facebook and WhatsApp, who are offering telephone calls and broadband,” says Oliver Knipping, Deutsche Telekom’s vice-president for product, innovation strategy and regulation.Christina Schulte-Kutsch, vice-president of leadership development and culture, adds: “[Increased competition] could put our whole business model at risk.”The 39-year-old German says the Duke course has helped to create a culture that can enable transformation. “The programme has laid the groundwork for change by bringing 700 executives from across departments together, helping to break down silos that can prevent innovation,” she says.Digital transformation can lead to friction, Schulte-Kutsch adds. The company has traditionally been a conventional hierarchy, focused on keeping risk low and maintaining reliable service delivery, she says. “But we have to have the ability to react to the market and that starts with getting the right company culture in place.”Some executives enrol in digital transformation courses to become technically proficient. “They don’t need to develop a machine learning algorithm, but they need technical fluency — including data analysis skills — to form and lead a digital strategy,” says Andrew Stephen, at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, who heads a digital marketing and analytics course taught in the UK and Melbourne.‘Now we understand what customers need. They expect to access data with a single click, like they are buying from AmazonThe supply of executives with those skills is limited. “There’s a constant onslaught of new technology, so it is hard even for seasoned executives to get to grips with everything.”Arguably the best way to lead digital transformation is through hands-on experimentation with technology, according to Annie Faulkner, director of the Leading Digital Transformation programme at ESMT Berlin.Participants — 25 per course — come from several industries including finance, and use technology such as virtual reality to come up with a solution to a company problem or opportunity. “We help executives to look outside their industries to come up with a new technology product or service,” Faulkner says.One course alumnus, who works for an engineering equipment maker, is using virtual reality to help engineers pinpoint problems in faulty machines. The technology has sped up repairs, reducing downtime and maintenance costs, says Faulkner.The challenge for business schools is to support participants as they implement complex transformation projects in the workplace. “There is huge student demand for that,” says Evgeny Káganer of Spain’s Iese, who teaches a three-day digital transformation course in Madrid, Munich and New York. “But it’s hard to do that because the diversity of projects would require advice tailored to each participant. We do not have the time.”Prof Káganer says that Iese is considering using Circles, a videoconferencing application, to help alumni seek advice and exchange ideas. “But we are not a consulting firm,” he adds. “We help executives to develop a transformation blueprint, and they implement it.”Digital transformation requires a fast change in business model, according to Michael Wade, IMD professor of innovation, strategy and director of the Leading Digital Transformation programme.“Innovation is not new, but the pace of change is accelerating and the environment is less predictable than it has been in the past, so adapting is vital to success,” he says.To develop agility, companies must monitor new competitors, technology, regulation and markets that could impact their business, Prof Wade says. “You need to trust the data and use it to make better, evidence-based decisions on whether and how to react to emerging trends,” he adds.“To execute a transformation plan, you need to tear down bureaucracy and empower employees across the organisation to try new things,” adds Prof Wade. “If you have a long decision-making process, you will not be able to move quickly enough to capitalise on fast-changing technology.”If a project is not working, managers must quickly deploy resources to new ideas, he says. “You cannot be afraid of failure, as it’s a learning opportunity that will help you improve your strategy. The road to digital transformation is long and arduous.”
13;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-05-06T14:57:57Z;Investors deliver harsh verdicts on earnings calls;Negative responses reveal anxieties about the durability of the bull market in stocks;Caterpillar’s earnings report for the first quarter should have been a slam dunk.The US blue-chip beat Wall Street estimates for sales and profits and it increased full-year estimates. But the good news quickly faded when Bradley Halverson, the chief financial officer, told analysts on the earnings call that the outlook “assumes that first quarter adjusted profit per share will be the high watermark for the year”.The shares tumbled more than 6 per cent that day, leading the broader market lower.Some 10 years into a bull run in the stock market, investors are paying particularly close attention to what executives are saying during earning calls, searching for signs of how long the good times are going to last.“There have been more surprises in calls than there normally are,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, noting that “there is always more focus on what a company is expected to do versus what they have done because the market is forward looking”.Tesla’s founder Elon Musk shocked investors with his combative demeanour on an earnings call last week. His company’s shares, which were already under pressure in recent weeks, tumbled as much as 8.6 per cent on Thursday after Mr Musk cut off a question about whether the company would need to raise money.“Boring bonehead questions are not cool,” he declared.Everyone who held on through the volatility to get to this earnings season is not getting rewarded. They are saying, ‘Give us the next leg of the US equities story’Brian Duperreault, AIG’s chief executive, was faulted by some analysts for a lack of specificity as he failed to quell concerns about the pace of the insurer’s turnround.During an earnings call, Erik Bass, analyst at Autonomous Research, told Mr Duperreault that he had picked up some “confusion” about the group’s financial targets. He asked what the chief executive’s target was for return on equity, and whether the insurer might hold an investor day “to discuss this in detail”.Mr Duperreault replied that he had no plans for an investor day, but would “certainly think” about it. Although he had provided a new target for the group’s general insurance business, he said: “You can work out the arithmetic on the ROEs.”Shares of AIG dropped nearly 10 per cent at one point during Thursday’s session.The nervousness among investors is particularly noteworthy because of the strength of earnings. By Friday, with 81 per cent of companies in the S&P 500 having reported results for the first three months of 2018, a blended rate of actual and estimated earnings showed growth of 24.2 per cent per share year over year, according to FactSet. That is on pace to be the largest rise since the third quarter of 2008.Some 78 per cent of companies that have reported have beat Wall Street forecasts, on track to be the highest ratio since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008.Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, said that while he “would not say there is more focus than usual” on earnings calls, “there is more frustration”. The S&P 500 is up just 0.2 per cent since earnings season got into full swing in mid-April.“Everyone who held on through the volatility to get to this earnings season is not getting rewarded,” he said. “They are saying, ‘Give us the next leg of the US equities story.’”Companies with good news, by contrast, have been rewarded. Apple, for example, used its conference call to ease worries about iPhone sales, which were triggered by warnings from key suppliers about slowing orders from a large smartphone maker, presumed to be the Cupertino-based company.Apple not only reported strong sales for the three months ending in March but a robust outlook for the current June quarter.Luca Maestri, Apple’s finance chief, explained that the company had purchased some components in advance — an unusual move analysts believe may account for the misleading signals coming from its suppliers.“Our inventory level has gone up,” he said. “It’s just a temporary event. We decided to make some purchasing decisions, given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time.”Apple’s stock ended the week at a record high.
14;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Caterpillar bulldozes past estimates, lifts outlook;;Strong demand for construction equipment in North America along with the recent upswing in oil prices helped Caterpillar bulldoze past Wall Street’s sales and profits expectations for the first quarter.The heavy machinery maker also sharply increased its full-year earnings outlook to $9.75 to $10.75 per share, compared to the $7.75 to $8.75 a share range it gave just three months ago. Shares in the company jumped more than 4.5 per cent in pre-market trading.“Based on our strong first-quarter results and higher demand across all regions and most end markets, we are raising our outlook for 2018,” said chief executive Jim Umpleby.Best known for its hulking yellow machines that dig mines and transport earth, Caterpillar has been benefiting from the recovery in global commodity prices, which has helped spur demand for new machines, as well as continued growth in the North American construction sector.For the three months to end of March, Caterpillar took in $12.8bn in revenues, a 31 per cent jump from the prior year period and easily blowing past the $11.98bn that the market was expecting. Sales in its three main units — construction, resource, and energy & transportation — all grew strongly, clocking in gains of 38 per cent, 31 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. All geographic regions it operates in reported sales growth of between 31 and 46 per cent.Net income came in at $1.66bn, or $2.74 per share, during the quarter, easily topping estimates of $1.22bn, or $2.02 a share.Shares in Caterpillar have been on something of a rollercoaster ride this year. Having risen sharply at the start of the year on signs of renewed sales growth following a couple of years of weak demand, the stock was knocked back in recent weeks amid trade concerns. The shares suffered a near 6 per cent one day drop last month after China retaliated against US tariffs with its own levies. The stock has since recovered somewhat as President Donald Trump’s attention has shifted to other issues.However, Caterpillar cautioned on Tuesday that its outlook excluded any potential trade risks. As it noted:The outlook assumes continued global economic growth. Any potential impacts from future geopolitical risks and increased trade restrictions have not been included in the outlook.
15;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-03-23T20:25:39Z;Wall St sell-off resumes as trade worries dominate;Yen and Swiss franc gain ground and gold price jumps;Friday 20.00 GMTWall Street suffered further heavy losses — with the three main equity indices all registering their worst weekly declines for more than two years — as the possibility of a global trade war continued to fuel investor risk aversion.Market uncertainty was ratcheted even higher after Donald Trump threatened to veto a $1.3tn spending bill passed by Congress overnight, raising the prospect of a government shutdown.He later said he had signed the bill but his actions did little to reassure participants already unsettled by a steady steam of personnel changes in the White House, as well as getting to grips with the Federal Reserve’ s latest policy comments following its meeting this week.But it was the growing trade tensions between the US and China that grabbed the market headlines.On Thursday, the S&P 500 sank 2.5 per cent — its worst day in six weeks — after the Trump administration unveiled plans to impose 25 per cent tariffs on as much as $60bn in annual imports from China.“The announcement has further heightened concern over the risk of a trade war which could deliver a negative shock to global growth,” said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.“Those concerns have been reinforced overnight by the announcement that China is planning retaliatory tariffs on US imports.”Strategists highlighted that while China’s response— tariffs on about $3bn of US exports to China — had technically been a reaction to previously announced US tariffs on steel and aluminium, it nevertheless showed relative restraint.“We still think China will opt to underreact rather than overreact,” said Elsa Lignos, global head of FX Strategy at RBC Capital Markets.Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics said that the economic impact of the tariffs imposed by the US would be small — even if they were implemented in full — and agreed that any Chinese retaliation was likely to be moderate.“But fears that the rest of Mr Trump’s presidency will be punctuated by protectionist announcements and actions may continue to weigh on investor sentiment.“In short, markets will be more affected than the economy.”The uncertainty over US trade policy helped support “haven” currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, with the former reaching its highest level against the dollar since November 2016.That added an extra layer of pressure on Japanese stocks yesterday, and the Nikkei tumbled to a five-month low. amid a broad retreat for Asian equity markets.Gold also stood out as it reached its highest point for more than a month. There was a more muted reaction from the bond markets following sharp gains for US Treasury and German Bund prices on Thursday.Oil markets were also back in the news as Brent, the international crude benchmark, climbed back above the $70 a barrel mark for the first time since the start of February.It did not take long for US stocks to reverse an opening rally, and the S&P 500 finally settled at 2,588, down 2.1 per cent on the day and 6 per cent for the week — its worst five-day showing since January 2016.It was the S&P’s lowest finish since February, and left it on the verge of correction territory — defined as a 10 per cent decline from its cyclical high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.8 per cent on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite ended 2.4 per cent lower.The Vix index of implied equity volatility — watched as a gauge of stock market stress — hit its highest level in five weeks.In Europe, the pan-regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.9 per cent to its lowest close since early 2017, while the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt tumbled 1.8 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London shed 0.4 per centIn Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 4.5 per cent, while China’s CSI 300 index fell 2.9 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 2.5 per cent.The dollar index, a broad measure of the US currency, was down 0.5 per cent as the euro rose 0.6 per cent to $1,2368. The greenback declined 0.5 per cent against the yen at ¥104.73, and was 0.4 per cent lower against the Swiss franc at SFr0.9456.Sterling, meanwhile, was heading for its highest finish against the dollar in almost two months, following signs of progress on Brexit negotiations and after the Bank of England’s policy meeting this week was seen by many as setting the stage for an interest rate rise in May.The pound was up 0.3 per cent against the dollar at $1.4137, although the euro was 0.2 per cent higher at £0.8744.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was down 2 basis points at 2.81 per cent, while that on the 10-year Bund ended unchanged at 0.53 per cent.Oil prices were stronger, as signs of continued supply cuts by major producers came against a backdrop of persistent expectations for a collapse of the nuclear deal with Iran.Brent crude settled at $70.45 a barrel, up 2.2 per cent, while US West Texas Intermediate was up 2.5 per cent in late trade at $65.90.The price of gold rose1.3 per cent, or $17, at $1,345 an ounce — its highest since February 19.Additional reporting by Michael Hunter in London, Edward White in Taipei and Alice Woodhouse in Hong KongFor market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
16;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-03-22T21:29:44Z;Donald Trump to impose 25% tariffs on $60bn of Chinese imports;US targets strategic sectors such as robots and high-speed trains in fight over IP;The Trump administration announced plans on Thursday to impose tariffs on up to $60bn in annual imports from China, raising fears of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies and sending US stocks sharply lower.In what the White House billed as a historic move against “economic aggression”, President Donald Trump said his administration had concluded that Beijing had for decades unfairly acquired US intellectual property and needed to pay the price.The tariffs, Mr Trump said, would “make us a much stronger, richer nation”. They would also help address the US’s $375bn trade deficit with China, he added, calling it “the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. It is out of control.” The move to impose 25 per cent tariffs on a list of products due to be unveiled within 15 days marks an escalation of Mr Trump’s campaign to put “America first” through protectionist measures this year.US equities suffered their biggest falls since February 8, with the benchmark S&P 500 dropping 2.5 per cent and slipping into the red for the year. Among the stocks hit hardest were Caterpillar and Boeing — US companies seen as potential targets in a trade war — which both fell more than 5 per cent.US companies and business groups, along with Republicans in Congress, criticised the tariffs as a misguided tactic to tackle what many see as a valid concern over China’s intellectual property practices.“Hitting billions in goods with tariffs runs the risk of putting a bigger dent in the pocketbooks of American families across the country,” said Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate finance committee.We can’t be in a position where China can go out and buy US technology in a variety of ways that are troubling to us. These are things that if China dominates, it’s bad for the worldMr Trump turned his fire on China as his administration offered a concession on trade to allies including the EU, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and South Korea. A senior official on Thursday said they would be exempted at least temporarily from steel and aluminium tariffs announced this month.China’s ambassador, Cui Tiankai, called the US accusations of IP theft “totally groundless” and also warned that Beijing would stand up for itself. “We don’t want a trade war,” he said. “But we are not afraid of it . . . We will certainly fight back and retaliate. If people want to play tough, we will play tough with them and see who will last longer.”China’s Ministry of Commerce said on Friday it was planning tariffs on 128 US products accounting for roughly $3bn in imports.US officials said they would take aim at President Xi Jinping’s strategy to lead the world in high-tech industries, targeting 10 key sectors identified by the Chinese leader in his “Made in China 2025” plan. They include robotics, aerospace, maritime and modern rail equipment, as well as electric vehicles and Biopharma products. In addition to new tariffs, Mr Trump ordered the US Treasury to come up with a plan to impose new restrictions on Chinese investment in similar sectors within 60 days.Such a regime would run in parallel with the Committee on Foreign Investment, which examines foreign investments for potential threats to US national security. The committee has taken an increasingly dim view of Chinese acquisitions in recent years.Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative, said the targeted Chinese products would not include many consumer items and had been chosen via an “algorithm” to minimise harm to US consumers while maximising the impact on China.“We can’t be in a position where China can go out and buy US technology in a variety of ways that are troubling to us,” Mr Lighthizer told a congressional hearing on Thursday. “These are things that if China dominates, it’s bad for the world.”In a nod to allies, which want the US to work within the global trading system, Mr Trump is also ordering his officials to launch a case at the World Trade Organization against what Washington claims are China’s biased technology licensing rules. The Trump administration argues that such rules in effect block many US companies from competing in the Chinese market.Mr Trump has often criticised the WTO but the US has been seeking support from the EU and Japan since last year for actions against China’s intellectual property practices. Those allies have insisted that any moves should include proceedings at the WTO. Peter Navarro, the former academic who runs the White House office of trade and manufacturing policy, said the tariffs were part of a new National Security Strategy that the Trump administration presented in December, which labelled China a strategic competitor and cited its “economic aggression” against the US.The strategy, he said, represented a “seismic shift” from the previous approach of treating China as an economic partner, which dated back to the Nixon administration.“This is a historic event,” Mr Navarro said. “President Trump should be applauded for his courage and vision on this.”The administration appeared to take a more deliberate approach in rolling out the new tariffs on China than it did with steel and aluminium tariffs earlier this month, which were roundly criticised by US business groups and Republicans in Congress, partly for the chaotic way in which they were unveiled. White House officials stressed to reporters that the China move had been the result of strenuous inter-agency deliberations.

17;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Caterpillar: metamorphosed;Every global economic and domestic political tailwind is in its favour;Caterpillar is enjoying a Make America Great Again moment. The heavy equipment maker had languished since the collapse of the commodities supercycle. Now its sails are swelled by global economic tailwinds and US political ones to boot. On Thursday it reported its 2017 earnings, revealing revenue and earnings per share rocketed 22 and 56 per cent. The shares were already up 70 per cent in the last year. But there is plenty of puff left in the rally.While a lower US tax rate has grabbed the most attention, US tax reform has another important feature for capital equipment manufacturers. For the next five years, businesses can immediately expense the full purchase rather than depreciating capital expenditures over several years. This means they capture the tax benefit immediately. As analysts have noted, this fillip extends to used equipment.North American annual construction equipment sales peaked in 2005 at more than 232,000 units but since the financial crisis have not exceeded 175,000. That suggests now is the time for a snapback.Caterpillar’s fine results also coincide with the Trump administration talking down the dollar, intentionally or otherwise. More than half of Caterpillar sales occur abroad and a weaker greenback makes foreign sales more lucrative just as commodity prices are rising and capex budgets are poised to expand.Between 2014 and the end of 2016, Caterpillar shares lost about a third of their value. Since that trough, the stock has risen nearly three-fold. Meanwhile, the group took out costs and waited patiently for a recovery that came more quickly than could have been predicted. A presidential cheerleader-in-chief has only added to the exuberance.Negatives include an inquiry into potential abuse of foreign tax shelters and a stretched earnings rating of about 20 times. But with bigger tides running in Caterpillar’s favour it can be expected to make further headway.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

18;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2018-01-25T13:20:17Z;Caterpillar climbs on earnings beat, bright outlook for 2018;;Caterpillar shares rose 3 per cent before the market opening in New York after the global manufacturing giant beat market expectations for fourth quarter earnings and said the sales growth momentum is expected to continue in 2018.Seen as a bellwether for global economic growth, Caterpillar reported sales and revenues for the three months to the end of December up 35 per cent to $12.9bn compared with $9.6bn in the year earlier period.Caterpillar shares had already risen over 75 per cent in the past year, before the earnings release.Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share, at $2.16, compared with $0.83 for the year earlier period and came in well above market expectations of $1.77. The adjustment to earnings included a $2.37bn charge related to US tax reform, including writing down deferred tax assets because of the reduction in the US tax rate as well as a charge for mandatory repatriation of non-US earnings, the company said.“After four challenging years, many key markets improved in 2017, and our global team delivered strong results,” CEO Jim Umpleby said in a statement.“Caterpillar is beginning 2018 with strong sales momentum resulting from strong order rates, lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog. Additionally, there are positive economic indicators across most of the world and in many of the company’s end markets,” the statement added, leading Caterpillar to forecast 2018 earnings per share, excluding restructuring costs of about $400m, of $8.25 to $9.25.
19;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-10-24T18:37:54Z;Strong US earnings lift confidence in global outlook;Earnings up at industrial companies including Caterpillar and United Technologies;Confidence in the outlook for the world economy has been boosted by strong earnings statements from some of the largest US industrial companies, reporting strength in sectors including aerospace and construction.Caterpillar, United Technologies, General Motors and 3M were among the companies that reported earnings above analysts’ forecasts for the third quarter, helping to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new record high.A number of companies cited strong or improving markets in China as an important factor in their results, but reports from North American and European markets were generally strong, too.Caterpillar, which makes earth-movers and other equipment, sharply increased its estimate of expected earnings for 2017, and United Technologies and 3M also raised their projected ranges for the year.Brad Halverson, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, said the company had focused on structural cost reduction during the downturn in the construction and mining markets, which were now picking up.“It was extremely tough for us, but now we’ve done that,” he said. “And now we’re getting the benefit.”The Asia-Pacific region was Caterpillar’s strongest. Sales there rose 31 per cent, with about half the increase coming from growth in China, driven by rising construction and infrastructure investment.United Technologies, which makes aircraft components and equipment for buildings, has faced difficulties in China, the largest market for its Otis elevator division. But Akhil Johri, chief financial officer, told analysts on a call that while the company was not “out of the woods” there, order volumes were rising and the decline in prices appeared to have slowed.3M, which makes Post-it notes and a wide range of other products, reported 23 per cent organic growth in sales in China and Hong Kong for the quarter, compared to 3.6 per cent in the US and 3 per cent in western Europe.Inge Thulin, 3M’s chief executive, said it was “good to see broad-based growth across all geographic areas”, and the company had “very high confidence as we move into 2018”.Not every US industrial company has been reporting strong earnings. General Electric, the largest US manufacturer by market capitalisation, last Friday reported a fall in earnings per share and sharply reduced its guidance for the full year.Its results were the hit by the weakness of its division making and servicing equipment for the electricity industry, fuelling speculation that the group would have to cut its dividend, which sent its shares down 6 per cent on Monday.The car manufacturers also showed signs of weakness on Tuesday, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reporting lower sales and GM cutting production in their key North American markets. However, FCA managed to raise profits more than analysts had expected by boosting its margins, and its shares closed 5 per cent higher at €14.88. GM shares were up about 2.5 per cent by noon in New York.US companies have been highlighting the prospect of possible corporate tax reform as another reason for optimism about the outlook.Mr Halverson of Caterpillar said: “It has been our number one priority, and we are actively engaged in [Washington] DC on how a US company can be internationally competitive . . . We have been at a disadvantage for a long period of time.”Additional reporting by Mamta Badkar and Patti Waldmeir
20;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Caterpillar shares jump on rosier outlook, upbeat quarterly results;;Caterpillar shares rallied in pre-market trade after the maker of construction and mining equipment lifted its full-year outlook and posted upbeat quarterly results citing strength in North American on-shore oil and gas markets, Chinese construction and investments by miners.Shares in the Illinois-based company jumped 7.5 per cent to $141.50 after it said it now expects to report full-year earnings per share of $4.60, up from its previous estimate of $3.50. It also revised its adjusted EPS outlook higher to $6.25.Caterpillar also projects full-year sales and revenues of about $44bn — the high end of the $42bn to $44bn range it announced in July.The rosier outlook comes as demand for heavy equipment is boosted by strength in key markets in China and North America and the company said it is working with its supply chain to “increase production levels to satisfy customer demand for those markets that have improved”.The Illinois-based company said net income rose to $1.06bn or $1.77 a share in the three months ended in September, compared with $283m or 48 cents a share in the year ago period. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast earnings of $1.11.Revenues rose by more than $2bn or 24 per cent from a year ago to $11.4bn, against analyst forecasts for $10.65bn — that left the company on track for its first annual sales increase since 2012.The company said: “The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, with about half due to improved end-user demand and about half due to favorable changes in dealer inventories. The improvement in end-user demand was across all regions and most end markets. The favorable change in dealer inventories was primarily due to a decrease during the third quarter of 2016″Sales of construction equipment, its largest revenue driver, rose nearly 37 per cent to $4.85bn , following a particularly weak pricing environment in the year ago quarter. A regional breakdown showed sales improving 27 per cent from a year ago in North America and 31 per cent in Asia Pacific — with about half of that occurring in China.Caterpillar endured some painful periods under former chief executive Douglas Oberhelman, whose investments to boost production globally and expand the company’s mining equipment range came amid an economic slowdown in China and as commodity prices began their protracted slump.Under Jim Umpleby, who took the helm in January, the company has moved to cut jobs and lower costs. The shares have also rallied on investor hopes of an infrastructure spending boom under US president Donald Trump.Caterpillar shares are up 42 per cent so far this year.
21;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-07-25T15:42:59Z;Recovery in construction lifts Caterpillar outlook;Better China sales spur 5% jump in shares on hopes for heavy machinery demand;Caterpillar boosted its sales and profits forecast for a second time this year, spurring optimism that its business is on track for a sustained revival following years of weak demand for its iconic yellow machines. The US-based global manufacturing giant said on Tuesday that it expects revenue of $42bn to $44bn this year after it previously projected $38bn to $41bn, as the continued rebound in global mining and construction activities helps spur demand for new machines.Caterpillar shares jumped by as much as 5.1 per cent to hit a 5-year high of $113.69. It later trimmed those gains to trade 4.5 per cent higher at $113. The recovery in sales is being driven largely by construction in China and demand for parts as ageing equipment requires repairs. Investors have been betting that the US company would benefit from a US infrastructure boom promised by the Trump administration, but that has yet to materialise as the White House remains mired in political controversy. On Monday, Caterpillar had reported a global rise in machine sales of 7 per cent for the three months to the end of June, buoyed by strong demand in Asia Pacific, especially in China where economic growth has boosted construction sales. “As demand increased, we continued to control costs and generated higher profit margins,” said Caterpillar chief executive Jim Umpleby. “While a number of our end markets remain challenged, construction in China and gas compression in North America were highlights in the quarter. Mining and oil-related activities have come off of recent lows, and we are seeing improving demand for construction in most regions.” The heavy machinery maker said it now expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $5.00, well up on the $3.75 it had forecast just three months ago and sharply higher than the $2.90 it had originally pencilled for the year. The guidance upgrade came as Caterpillar beat Wall Street expectations for its second-quarter results. For the three months to end of June, sales were up nearly 10 per cent at $11.3bn, well above past analysts’ estimates for $10.88bn. Net income was $802m, or $1.35 per share for the quarter, up from the $550m recorded in the prior year period and ahead of the $1.04 the market was expecting. “CAT is in the cycle sweet spot, demonstrating massive leverage as the cycle normalises and revenues return faster than costs,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann wrote in a note after the results.“The question is sustainability . . . with the commodity recovery faltering and with Chinese support for its property and infrastructure potentially fading, the sustainability of these growth drivers is a key question, in our view.”

The Peoria-based manufacturer is a big exporter and when it prospers green shoots should appear elsewhere in the Rust Belt. Investors and dealers in industrial equipment appear convinced by the Trumpian vision. Caterpillar stock traded nearly seven per cent higher on Tuesday after the company almost doubled adjusted earnings per share over the corresponding period of last year. Its outlook for the rest of 2017 is optimistic.The commodities cycle is now working in Caterpillar’s favour. Sales of $9.8bn benefit from real demand in China. Revenues from Asia of $1.1bn increased by a quarter year over year. Rock-bottom steel prices last year contributed to lower manufacturing costs for Caterpillar, which the company locks in for a period ahead. Pricing pressures on equipment are meanwhile subsiding — an overhang of used equipment allowed customers to drive hard bargains last year.A sustained upturn in the oil and gas credit cycle could prove beneficial for Caterpillar’s energy and transportation segment. As unused rigs are dusted off, service revenues should pick up. New orders should follow.However, sales are habitually strong in the first quarter, as dealers stock up for the rest of the year. The risk is that they are preparing for a wave of demand that may not materialise. Indeed, total annualised and seasonally adjusted construction spending in the US was recently just one per cent below its last peak in March 2015. Nevertheless, Caterpillar expects its construction-related revenue to grow up to five per cent this year, because its backlog from new orders has increased.The global reflation trade has delivered a 38 per cent annualised return to Caterpillar shareholders since January 2016. To sustain the momentum, the hard hats who build roads and drill for shale oil need to buy into Mr Trump’s vision too and buy Caterpillar equipment from US dealers. This is where the president’s rhetoric meets the acid test of capital outlay.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
23;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-04-25T14:44:30Z;Caterpillar lifts forecasts on signs of global mining recovery;After years of weak demand, big equipment maker reports better than expected sales;"Caterpillar shares rose more than 6 per cent on Tuesday after the US big equipment maker raised its forecast for 2017 sales and revenues because of what it said were signs of recovery in the global mining industry, and in China. After years of weak demand for its yellow machines, a staple of construction sites and mines around the world, Caterpillar reported stronger than expected first-quarter sales of $9.8bn, up from $9.5bn in the year earlier quarter ended March 31. In its first quarterly earnings statement since federal agents raided three of its offices last month, Caterpillar said most of that strength came from resource industries. Overall sales were up 12 per cent in its Asia Pacific region too, due to stronger construction equipment sales in China “resulting from increased infrastructure and residential investment”. Caterpillar, viewed as a bellwether for the health of commodities, energy and construction markets worldwide, also raised its forecast for full-year sales to $38bn-$41bn, up from $36bn-$39bn forecast in January. The company’s future has been under a cloud recently because of uncertainty over the possible outcome of a federal investigation which appears to relate to its offshore tax strategy involving a Swiss subsidiary but could also include questions about its exports to sanctioned nations, legal experts said.Caterpillar cut its forecast for 2017 earnings per share from $2.30 to $2.10, due to a rise in expected restructuring expenses to $1.25bn, up $750m from the previous forecast. The company said it had cut its workforce by 6,100 full-time staff in the first quarter, down to 95,300 from 101,400 at the end of the year earlier quarter, as it announced the closure of facilities in Belgium and Illinois.But after taking account of restructuring costs, the company now expects adjusted full-year earnings of $3.75 per share, well up on the $2.90 previously forecast for 2017. ""There are encouraging signs, with promising quoting activity in many of the markets we serve and retail sales to users turning positive for both machines and Energy and Transportation for the first time in several years,"" said chief executive Jim Umpleby in a statement. But he warned: “While we are raising the full-year outlook for sales and revenues, there continues to be uncertainty across the globe, potential for volatility in commodity prices, and weakness in key markets."" On Monday, Caterpillar had reported stronger than expected global machine retail sales for the first quarter, up 1 per cent for the three months to the end of March, the first increase in more than four years. “Caterpillar earnings are volatile and unpredictable, but there are well supported reasons to think that the upswing off the bottom could continue to surprise upwards over the next two years,” Barclays analyst Robert Wertheimer wrote in a note.Caterpillar shares rose 6.6 per cent in response to the company’s higher sales and optimistic comments about the future. The company’s previous year’s sales were hit by the prolonged global commodities and mining slumps but President Donald Trump’s promise of an infrastructure spending boom — which has yet to materialise — boosted Caterpillar’s shares after his election. Analysts are now predicting that 2017 could produce a global recovery in construction equipment sales. "
24;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Caterpillar shares jump despite earnings guidance cut;;"Caterpillar on Tuesday cut its forecast for full year earnings per share because of higher restructuring costs, even as it forecast stronger than expected sales and revenues for 2017, which could suggest a recovery in global markets for construction, energy and mining.
In its first earnings statement since federal agents raided three of its offices last month, Caterpillar said it expects earnings per share of about $2.10 for 2017, down from a previous full year forecast of $2.30 per share.But the company, viewed as a bellwether for commodities and mining markets, raised its forecast of full year sales and revenues to a range of $38bn to $41bn, up from $36bn to $39bn previously forecast.Caterpillar also reported first-quarter 2017 sales and revenues of $9.8bn, compared with $9.5bn in the year earlier quarter. But first quarter earnings per share fell to 32 cents for the quarter ended March 31, from 46 cents per share a year earlier.“Restructuring costs expected in 2017 are significantly higher than the prior outlook primarily due to ongoing manufacturing facility consolidations,” the company said in a statement, adding that it expects to incur about $1.25bn in restructuring costs this year, up from $750m in its previous outlook, including recently announced plant closures in Illinois and in Belgium.But Caterpillar was upbeat about sales.“There are encouraging signs, with promising quoting activity in many of the markets we serve and retail sales to users turning positive for both machines and Energy and Transportation for the first time in several years,” said new chief executive Jim Umpleby in a statement. “While we are raising the full-year outlook for sales and revenues, there continues to be uncertainty across the globe, potential for volatility in commodity prices, and weakness in key markets.”On Monday Caterpillar had reported stronger than expected global machine retail sales for the first quarter, up 1 per cent for the three months to end March, the first increase in more than four years.Caterpillar shares rose 4.9 per cent in premarket trading after the first quarter results were released. The company’s sales have been hit by the prolonged global commodities and mining slumps but President Donald Trump’s promise of an infrastructure spending boom – which has yet to materialise – boosted the company’s shares after his election.
The company will face questions later today when it hosts a conference call with investors, over the raid of three of its facilities last month in Illinois, which appear to relate to its offshore tax strategy involving a Swiss subsidiary but could also include questions about its exports to sanctioned nations, legal experts said."
25;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-04-24T16:23:21Z;Caterpillar gains after retail sales rise for first time since 2012;;Has Caterpillar finally dug itself out of its multi-year sales slump?Shares in the US heavy-machinery maker rose by the most in 10 weeks on Monday after the company reported its first increase in three-month rolling machine sales in four-and-a-half years.Worldwide machine sales reported by dealers rose 1 per cent for the three months to March, compared with the year-ago period, Caterpillar said in a regulatory filing. That’s the first three-month increase since November 2012, which sparked hopes among investors that demand for the company’s yellow loaders and excavators could at last be on the mend.Caterpillar has cautioned in its recent quarterly earnings that the rebound in commodity prices over the past 12 months has yet to translate into an increase in equipment purchases. Mining companies have remained cautious and opted to trim costs by renting or buying used equipment.Indeed, demand from the resource sector remains in the doldrums, with rolling three-month sales down 19 per cent in March. Demand has been coming instead from the construction sector in Asia, where sales are up 56 per cent year-on-year during the period. Another relative bright spot was the oil and gas sector. Sales of the engines, motors and pumps used in oil wells were up 15 per cent compared to the year-ago period.The trading update comes a day before Caterpillar is due to report its first-quarter earnings. It sent shares in the company up as much as 2.8 per cent to $96.72.The gain takes the stock’s advance over the past 12 months to more than 23 per cent. The rally comes despite the move by US law enforcement authorities to raid the company’s headquarters and two other facilities in Illinois earlier this year as part of a long-running tax investigation into financial transactions involving CSARL, a Caterpillar subsidiary in Switzerland.
26;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Caterpillar shares rise as Goldman sees 30% upside;;Caterpillar shares after analysts at Goldman Sachs added the heavy machinery maker known for its yellow loaders and excavators to its “conviction buy list” and said they see a 30 per cent upside.Shares in the Illinois-based company rose more than 2 per cent to $94.34 as analysts at Goldman reiterated their buy rating and said their $120 price target implied a 30 per cent premium to where the stock is trading.The upbeat view comes as Jerry Revich, an analyst at Goldman Sachs said demand for machinery, — which is considered one of the most discretionary parts of mining capital expenditure budgets and was hurt during a protracted slump in the mining and construction industry — is at an inflection and added that “we now believe the global reduction in mining capex is over as 35% of mining companies have introduced higher capex guidance for 2017 for the first time in four years”. He also added that demand for construction machinery is in the early stages of a recovery.Mr Revich also said he sees scope for higher-mid-cycle earnings per share of $8 and pointed to the downbeat sentiment on the stock. The average mutual fund is underweight Caterpillar by about 20 per cent and on the sell-side 36 per cent of analysts currently have “buy” ratings on the company, below the historical average of 45 per cent and a peak of 71 per cent.The news offered some reprieve to Caterpillar shares that have been hurt in recent weeks after US law enforcement authorities raided the company’s headquarters and two other facilities in Illinois as part of a long-running tax investigation into financial transactions involving CSARL, a Caterpillar subsidiary in Switzerland. .While Mr Revich acknowledged the litigation risk surrounding the IRS allegations, he noted that the company’s market value is down $4bn since the beginning of March on what is expected to be a $2bn dispute based on the company’s disclosures and correspondence with the SEC.Caterpillar shares are now up nearly 2 per cent year-to-date.
27;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-03-27T04:00:11Z;Big digger makers bet on 2017 as their rebound year;Manufacturers of construction equipment hope sales will grow markedly after tough period;Diggers, bulldozers and trucks are grinding back into gear on building sites around the world, fuelling hopes of a full-blown recovery in the construction equipment industry after years in the doldrums.Purchases of such heavy-duty machinery plummeted after 2011, as construction activity in wealthy countries faltered after the financial crisis and the rapid pace of economic growth in many developing nations slowed, notably in China.This hit sales at manufacturers including Caterpillar of the US, Japan’s Komatsu and Sweden’s Volvo, and things deteriorated further with the commodities crash of 2014 and 2015.But renewed Chinese spending and increasing infrastructure investment elsewhere in the world — with potentially better prospects in the US following the election of Donald Trump as president — are set to underpin a rebound for the construction equipment industry, according to analysts.Some companies are already witnessing signs of revival. “We began to see a pick-up towards the second half of last year and certainly this year has started fairly robustly around the world,” says Graeme Macdonald, chief executive of JCB, the privately owned UK group.“One swallow doesn’t make a summer [but] there’s definitely momentum in the market — we are seeing it from our customers and dealers.”Global unit sales of construction equipment grew last year for the first time since 2011, but only by 1 per cent, according to the consultancy Off-Highway Research.This year, however, it is forecasting a 9 per cent jump in sales, to 760,055 pieces of equipment. The last sales peak was reached in 2011, when more than 1m pieces were purchased.A driving force of the anticipated growth in 2017 is the replacement of ageing machines bought around six to seven years ago that are now coming to the end of their working lives.If sustained and widespread, this could prove an inflection point for the construction equipment industry. In spite of generating total revenue of $70.1bn last year, the market is 30 per cent smaller in US dollar terms compared with its peak, Off-Highway’s data show.Industry leader Caterpillar’s construction machines business has fared better than its two other divisions, which supply mining equipment and generators, and turbines and compressors, for the energy and transport sectors. But at $15.7bn last year, the company’s revenue from construction machines was down more than a fifth compared to 2011 levels.“This has been a very meaningful global downturn,” says Stephen Volkmann, analyst at Jefferies. “It was a combination of the Asian [economic] bubble bursting, the commodities bubble bursting back in 2012, then on top of all of that the economic uncertainty we’ve had in both Europe and the US until recently.”Like in other areas of manufacturing, a big swing factor was China, which in 2011 accounted for four in every 10 construction machines sold. Its demand for equipment rocketed on the back of a massive government stimulus programme, but as that wore off the market shrank to just a quarter of its former size.As Beijing once again starts to splash out on big-ticket infrastructure projects, hopes are rising that the worst is over.“The whole mood of the industry in China has got much stronger,” says David Phillips, managing director at Off-Highway Research. “Business confidence is back. Things aren’t back to where they were before 2011, but [there is] a much more optimistic note.”Evidence of China’s rebound came as Caterpillar noted a pick-up in activity throughout the second half of last year.Another country poised for growth is India, where the government has pledged to plough almost $60bn into its strained infrastructure. That bodes well for JCB, which has a strong presence in the subcontinent but has suffered from falling orders in other key markets, including Russia.An upside to years of tough conditions is that many manufacturers, having undertaken painful measures for self-preservation, could now be in a stronger position. Caterpillar alone has axed more than 30,000 jobs since the end of 2012.“We expect some tailwinds to [profit] margins at Caterpillar through more fully implemented lean manufacturing, in addition to cost cuts,” says Robert Wertheimer, analyst at Barclays.But there are nevertheless reasons for caution. Political uncertainty continues to dog the economic outlook in Europe, while Brazil — Latin America’s biggest economy — is still pulling itself out of recession.In spite of a rally in stocks linked to building since the election of Mr Trump, it could take up to two years for shovels to break ground on his plans to renew US infrastructure, say analysts.Amy Campbell, head of investor relations at Caterpillar, is cognisant of these factors.“We do have an increase for China plugged into the outlook, but not really any other regions in the world,” she says. “Our outlook takes into account what we expect to continue to be some volatility and what we deem as some uncertainty right now in the global economy.”
28;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-03-02T22:31:42Z;Caterpillar raided by US federal agents as part of tax probe;Shares of heavy machinery maker suffer biggest one-day drop in 8 months;Caterpillar shares suffered their biggest one-day drop in eight months after law enforcement authorities searched the company’s headquarters and two other facilities in Illinois as part of a tax investigation. Shares of the heavy machinery maker fell 4.3 per cent on Thursday after the company and law enforcement officials confirmed that agents of the Internal Revenue Service, the US Commerce Department Office of Export Enforcement and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had conducted searches at three Caterpillar facilities.Caterpillar said in a statement that a search and seizure warrant was executed, and documents and electronic information collected, apparently in connection with a long-running tax investigation into financial transactions involving CSARL, a Caterpillar subsidiary in Switzerland. Caterpillar said it was “co-operating with law enforcement”. Last month the company said in its 2016 10-K filing that it had received a grand jury subpoena from the US district court for the Central District of Illinois on January 8 2015. “The subpoena requests documents and information from the company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning US and non-US Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-US subsidiaries and the movement of cash among US and non-US subsidiaries). “The company is co-operating with this investigation,” Caterpillar said. “We currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.” Caterpillar said the warrant executed on Thursday was broadly drafted but “we believe the execution of this search warrant is regarding, among other things, export filings that relate to the CSARL matter” first disclosed in a 10-K filing in 2015 and later updated in the most recent 10-K filing.The US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations said in a 2014 report that Caterpillar had adopted “a tax strategy that shifted billions of dollars in profits away from the United States and into Switzerland, where Caterpillar had negotiated an effective corporate tax rate of 4 to 6 per cent”. According to the report, Caterpillar bought parts and resold them to dealers overseas, assigning the profits to the Swiss subsidiary and lowering its US taxes. Caterpillar, hit by a prolonged slump in global demand caused by weak commodity prices that have hurt its customers, has been one of the companies singled out by industrial analysts as likely to benefit from any infrastructure spending boost from President Donald Trump. Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s departing chairman, met Mr Trump last week at the White House where the president joked about his fondness for Caterpillar bulldozers.

The company confirmed in a statement:“Law enforcement is present in various Peoria-area Caterpillar facilities executing a search warrant. Caterpillar is cooperating.”A representative for the US attorney’s office in the Central District of Illinois said that agents from the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation Division, the Office of Export Enforcement at the US commerce department and the FDIC conducted searches at three Caterpillar facilities in Peoria, East Peoria and Morton, Illinois.Caterpillar is headquartered in Peoria.The prosecutors’ office said that no arrests have been made and that it was not immediately clear whether the searches were continuing.According to the US Commerce Department’s website, the Export Enforcement office focuses on “sensitive exports to hostile entities or those that engage in onward proliferation; prohibited foreign boycotts; and related public safety laws.”Caterpillar disclosed in a regulatory filing last month that it had received a subpoena from the US district court in central Illinois requesting “documents and information from the company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-US subsidiaries and the movement of cash among US and non-US subsidiaries).”It said in the same filing that it had received additional subpoenas connected to that investigation regarding, among other things, “the purchase and resale of replacement parts” by Caterpillar and various foreign subsidiaries.“The company is cooperating with this investigation,” the filing said. “The company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.”"
30;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-01-31T16:24:32Z;Caterpillar to move global HQ to Chicago;;Caterpillar said on Tuesday that it was moving its global headquarters to Chicago, as the heavy-machinery maker becomes the latest US company to set up shop in the Windy City after decades in more distant locations.“Since 2012, about two-thirds of Caterpillar’s sales and revenues have come from outside the United States,” said Jim Umpleby, Caterpillar’s chief executive. “Locating our headquarters closer to a global transportation hub, such as Chicago, means we can meet with our global customers, dealers and employees more easily and frequently.”Caterpillar said the move will initially involve just a small number of senior executives, who will move into a leased office space beginning in 2017. It expects 300 employees to be based in Chicago once the new location is fully operational.But as a result of this and “challenging market conditions”, Caterpillar said it has abandoned plans to build a new headquarters complex in Peoria, the central Illinois town where it is currently based.Caterpillar is the latest high-profile company to make the move to Chicago. Motorola Solutions, the telecoms group whose global headquarters left the city 40 years ago, returned in August. Kraft Heinz, which started selling cheese to Chicago merchants in 1903, has moved its headquarters back downtown. ConAgra Foods recently merged its operations in Omaha with its suburban Illinois office to create a new head office in Chicago’s imposing Merchandise Mart building.
31;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2017-01-26T23:26:04Z;Dow theory bulls invigorated by record high transports average;Caterpillar downbeat over lengthy wait for infrastructure boon;"The Dow Jones industrial and transportation averages on Thursday both closed at new highs in a bullish signal for one of Wall Street’s oldest investment theories. The two US equity benchmarks, which date back to the 19th century, have not recorded highs one after another since December, after which the duo began to diverge as the Trump trade that propelled stocks to fresh peaks lost momentum. Transports track 20 US railways, airlines, and freight companies, and is seen as a good barometer for the overall economy. It has risen 13.7 per cent higher since the election of Donald Trump in November. The industrial average gauges a broader set of 30 companies that are prominent names in their respective sectors. It has gained 9.6 per cent since the election.According to the Dow theory that is still widely tracked by investors, when both the industrials and the transports make new highs together, it foreshadows good news for both the economy and corporate America — a cue to traders that it may be time to buy.Mr Trump’s election has helped to push stocks higher amid expectations that his policy plans will ramp up growth and reduce tax and regulatory burdens on US companies.“US markets . . . are roaring into 2017 obsessed with a simple narrative: fiscal policy — especially tax reform — will quickly and effectively substitute for far less accommodative US monetary policy,” observed Peter Cecchini, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. However, some strategists have warned that as stocks rise and valuations push higher, investors have priced in little room for policy mistakes from the new administration or unexpected surprises elsewhere.""Positioning, profits and policy are consistent with one last melt-up in risky assets,” analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Thursday. Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, echoed that cautious stance, saying, “there is a growing risk that some stocks may be getting caught up in the hype and ahead of their short to medium term prospects”. Underscoring that risk, Caterpillar the world’s biggest maker of heavy machinery, posted upbeat fourth-quarter earnings but delivered a gloomy outlook, noting that the company would have to wait until 2018 before it saw benefits from tax reform and infrastructure spending under US President Donald Trump.The group noted that “prospects for tax reform and an infrastructure spending bill in the US are encouraging” but added that they do not expect to see “meaningful effects” of these changes until sometime in 2018.The stock has been a significant beneficiary of the Trump trade, rallying by almost 16 per cent from the election to Wednesday’s close of trading, more than double the rise notched by the broad S&P 500 index.However, the shares pulled back by 1 per cent to $97.22 on Thursday, trimming a drop of as much as 2.2 per cent."
32;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Caterpillar issues downbeat outlook on ‘challenging’ economic environment;;Caterpillar shares slid in early trading after the US heavy machinery maker said sales declined more than expected during the fourth quarter and issued a downbeat outlook warning that the “overall environment remains challenging”.For the three months to end of December, sales and revenues fell 13 per cent to $9.6bn, shy of the $9.8bn analysts had expected, with sales down in all regions except Asia Pacific, and across all major business categories.The company said its operating loss widened to $1.26bn in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $175m in the year ago quarter. The loss was driven by an unfavourable $1.087bn charge tied to mark-to-market losses tied to pension and other postemployment benefit plans and a goodwill impairment charge. Stripped of those, the company’s operating profit improved by $279m.Adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share however eclipsed analysts’ estimates of 66 cents.“Our results for the fourth quarter, while slightly better than expected, continued to reflect pressure in many of our end markets from weak economic conditions around much of the world,” Jim Umpleby, chief executive, said.The results saw Caterpillar’s workforce shrink by 9.7 per cent to 95,400 at the end of 2016, from a year ago. Including the so-called flexible workforce, the company’s total global workforce decreased by 12,300.Caterpillar’s shares, which fell to a five-and-a-half year low of $56.36 at the start of 2016, finished last year up 35 per cent, gaining more than 17 per cent in the months since Donald Trump’s surprise election victory in November, fueled in part by expectations that the vast increase in infrastructure spending that Mr Trump has promised would spur demand for Caterpillar’s machines.Caterpillar said that “prospects for tax reform and an infrastructure spending bill in the US are encouraging” but added that they do not expect to see “meaningful effects” of these changes until sometime in 2018.And looking ahead the company added “while better economic growth and increased infrastructure spending may be on the horizon” the availability of used equipment could continue to have a negative impact on sales in construction industries next year.While Caterpillar said it sees early signs of “modest recovery” in some of its businesses, and pointed to higher commodity prices and improving construction sales in China as positives for its business next year, it did caution that miners’ capital spending next year is expected to be flat and that rail remains challenged with low traffic volume.“We continue to execute in a challenging economic environment and are focused on improving operating margins, profitability and shareholder returns,” Mr Umpleby, said. “While we see signs of positive activity in some of our key end markets, the overall economic environment remains challenging”.Caterpillar expects revenue in the range of $36bn to $39bn, compared with analysts’ estimates of $38.1bn. Its earnings outlook of $2.90 a share, trailed expectations of $3.08.Shares in Caterpillar slid 1.7 per cent in pre-market trading.

She had spent 10 years in the business, however, brokering spare parts.“We were dating and I found it very interesting that it might be the biggest small industry you’ve never heard of,” he says. He also, he adds, found that the system the aerospace industry used for buying and selling parts “archaic”.The participants included well known groups such as Boeing, Airbus, GE and Honeywell — some of the biggest companies in the world — but they were “buying and selling parts using technology from the 1980s”. Mr Boccarossa had founded a few start-ups and he and Ms Murphy sensed a chance to combine expertise.Two years ago, Ms Murphy launched Air Spares Unlimited — an online brokerage for landing gear, wheels and brakes — and brought in Mr Boccarossa, now her husband, to be its chief executive.The company is one of many that form the core of the technology scene in Chicago, which tends to tilt away from the glamorous social media apps of the US coasts, and toward start-ups serving other businesses or the industries that have deep roots in the region, such as manufacturing and logistics. Even the better-known Chicago-born Groupon, the site which offers daily deals on goods and services to retail customers, has strong connections to the city’s corporate past. It is housed in the former home of Montgomery Ward, the mail-order catalogue giant that was an antecedent to ecommerce.One reason for the Chicago tech scene’s low-key approach, Mr Boccarossa says, is that tech talent in the city has “realistic business expectations”.“They understand that this isn’t building an app so I can take a picture to send to my friends; this is building software so people can buy wheels to land a plane,” he says. “We’re building real B2B technology . . . you have real companies here who look at real revenue streams to solve real-life problems.”If you’re a start-up you need a paying customer, and there’s a lot of them in ChicagoLinda Darragh, who taught Mr Boccarossa at the Innovation and Entrepreneur Initiative at Northwestern University’s Kellogg business school, says the diversity of Chicago’s economy — in which no industry accounts for more than about 15 per cent of city GDP — is a leading driver.“I see Chicago as basically a Petri dish for entrepreneurs to test and build tech-enablement for existing established industries, so you start looking at what industries are in Chicago, it’s all over the place — it’s everything from healthcare to transportation,” she says. “So there’s a lot of opportunity to really get into the ecosystem of an industry and improve upon it.”UI Labs provides those kinds of opportunities. It is a public-private, non-profit “innovation accelerator” that receives funding from major industrial companies such as Caterpillar, GE and Deere, and from the government. One focus, says Caralynn Nowinski Collens who heads the organisation, is manufacturing. UI Labs is running more than 30 industrial projects through its labs and its factory floor.“We have so many legacy strengths in old-line legacy industries — not the sexy ones, but things like construction or manufacturing,” she says.Trend of moving out to the suburbs is now being reversedThe city has bolstered those roots with over 100 entrepreneurial environments, including accelerators, incubators, co-working spaces and innovation hubs, says Mark Tebbe, chair of Chicago Next, a tech-focused group connected to the city’s economic development organisation.The group has created industry-specific incubators for financial technology linked to Chicago’s long history with the futures industry, with water — given the city’s place on the shores of Lake Michigan — and with manufacturing. “You have a diversified base of businesses [and industries] to work with,” says Mr Tebbe, a former tech entrepreneur. “This makes for a strong customer base — if you’re a start-up or a tech company, the one thing you need is a paying customer and there’s a lot of them in Chicago.”Jodi Navta, chief marketing officer for Coyote, the logistics company that last year was sold to UPS for $1.8bn, agrees. “Being the epicentre of the Midwest is good for a lot of reasons: there are a lot of businesses that we can help locally, a lot of carriers that we can build relationships with that are local,” she says.A diversified business landscape gives rise to companies like SMS Assist, which in June raised $150m from Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, giving it a $1bn valuation. SMS manages 25,000 property management subcontractors in over 135,000 client locations. “You wouldn’t think of a maintenance company with 100 to 150 code-writing technologists,” says its chief Mike Rothman.Four Kites is a logistics company founded by Matt Elenjickal, who spent years working in supply chain management. He says one reason such low-glamour companies have taken off in the city is because local venture capital firms are willing to take risks on businesses that may not generate headlines.“There are a lot of VC firms in Chicago who really focus on B2B, who focus on these industries that are not sexy,” he says.*This article has been amended since original publication to clarify SMS Assist’s business operations."
34;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Moody’s downgrades Caterpillar on soft market conditions;;Moody’s on Tuesday downgraded its ratings of heavy machinery maker Caterpillar, saying it did not expect “any meaningful recovery” in the company’s core markets until 2018.The ratings agency cut its long- and short-term ratings for Caterpillar and affiliated entities to A3 from A2, and Prime-2 from Prime-1 respectively.The downgrade comes as Caterpillar grapples with fluctuating energy prices that have prompted some North American companies to cut back on drilling activity, as well as weakness in other developed markets and in emerging economies. Caterpillar recently warned that analysts’ estimates of its profits next year were “too optimistic considering expected headwinds,” and in October cut its 2016 profit estimate for the third time. Its chief executive and chairman Doug Oberhelman has announced his intent to retire next spring.Earlier this year, Moody’s switched Caterpillar’s outlook to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’, citing numerous pressures it faced from weak demand in certain divisions. While Caterpillar has a long history of withstanding cyclical downturns, Moody’s said in April, the latest falloff “will be the longest and most severe in the company’s history.”That view was underscored in Moody’s report on Tuesday, in which senior vice-president Bruce Clark wrote:“Moody’s expects that CAT’s operating performance and credit metrics will remain under pressure through 2017 due to soft end market conditions in global mining and construction markets, its sizable investment in the Resource Industries segment, and price pressure resulting from high levels of dealer and used equipment inventory in the market. We do not anticipate any meaningful recovery in CAT’s markets until 2018, and new machine sales are unlikely to begin to be realized until well after a market recovery is evident. Even with such a potential recovery, Moody’s believes that the company’s key credit metrics around cash flow, leverage and returns are likely to remain modest for the A3 rating level until 2019.”Moody’s set its outlook on Caterpillar’s rating at stable, noting that its sizable restructuring programme would “yield meaningful performance benefits over the long term,” although they could take a while to implement.
35;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
36;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-12-01T16:31:49Z;Caterpillar says Wall Street view for ’17 profits ‘too optimistic’;;Caterpillar said on Thursday that Wall Street’s projections for its 2017 profits are “too optimistic,” as the world’s largest maker of heavy machinery faces headwinds from a sluggish global economy and dropping commodities prices.The company said in a regulatory filing that the Reuters consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share of $3.25, which excludes restructuring items, is “too optimistic considering expected headwinds”.Caterpillar has struggled as falling oil prices prompted North American energy companies to cut back on drilling activity, as well as weakness in other developed markets and in emerging economies.In October, the group cut its 2016 profit estimate for the third time. It also unveiled plans for chief executive Doug Oberhelman, a 41-year veteran of the company, to retire in March.Meanwhile, Caterpillar said that the Reuters consensus for 2017 sales of $38bn was a “reasonable midpoint expectation”.Caterpillar shares, which were up as much as 1.9 per cent ahead of the news, recently traded 0.7 per cent higher.
37;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-11-09T08:21:22Z;US chief executives write open letter to Trump seeking reassurances;Businesses express concern about threats to trade, but see opportunities in tax cuts;"Chief executives from more than 1,100 US companies, including Boeing, Coca-Cola and Caterpillar, have written an open letter to Donald Trump, warning of “an urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions” after the election.The letter comes as business executives on both sides of the Atlantic have expressed concern about uncertainty and threats to trade in the wake of Mr Trump’s victoryBut some US corporate chieftans see opportunities in possible tax cuts and deregulation.In the chief executives’ letter, prepared for whichever candidate won the presidential election, they say they are committed to reuniting the country “after this particularly difficult election, and warn that businesses and communities cannot prosper “in a country that is divided and distrustful”.Other signatories to the letter, organised by the National Association of Manufacturers, include the chief executives of Pfizer, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Eli Lilly and Cargill.In Europe, Emma Marcegaglia urged Mr Trump to reach out. “We hope to see signals of reconciliation and reassurance rapidly. The United States are and will remain the most important partner of the European Union in shaping a fair and rule-based globalisation to the benefit of all.“The 45th President of the US is an entrepreneur. We hope that his decisions will be driven by political and economic reason,” she added.US businesses and industry groups were generally not supporters of Mr Trump. Only 17 per cent of trade associations thought his presidency would be best for their members, compared with 39 per cent favouring Hillary Clinton, a recent survey by the Financial Times found.Not one chief executive of the 100 largest companies in the US had given money to Mr Trump’s campaign by August, according to the Wall Street Journal.Companies including United Technologies and Ford were attacked by Mr Trump during the campaign for relocating production out of the US to Mexico and other countries with lower labour costs, and every business with an international supply chain or market is nervous about potential disruption from new trade barriers.But businesses are also looking for opportunities to work with his administration to achieve their policy goals, including measures to stimulate economic growth.Jay Timmons, president of the NAM, said: “When you have an economy that’s not working as it should, with people being displaced out of jobs, frustrated with their economic progress and with their families’ standing, then you’re going to have this kind of negative response and reaction . . . But the solution is what the business community offers.”One clear gain for businesses in Mr Trump’s programme is his proposed cut in federal business taxes to 15 per cent, from the current 35 per cent.The big US banks are likely to see Mr Trump’s victory as a positive. He has sent mixed signals on financial regulation, but said he wants a policy that is “close to dismantling” Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Wall Street reform act. That law imposed a host of tough rules on the banks and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has held them to higher regulatory standards.Some analysts suggest that Mr Trump’s rhetoric may run ahead of reality.“Trump has said he’s going to tear up Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act; I don’t think he can do either,” said John Stadtler, head of the financial services practice at PwC in New York.“I don’t think he’ll be able to undo the CFPB either, but he will certainly drive change.”Still, Mr Trump has also suggested he wants tighter regulation of banks through a “21st century Glass-Steagall”: the 1933 law that kept commercial banks out of investment banking and insurance, which was repealed in 1999.The most positive news for the banks is the senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have been critical of the big banks, will be shut out of policymaking.Privately, many top bankers said they resented the way Ms Warren’s wing of the Democratic party appeared to have taken control of financial policy. In particular, they said they worried that potential candidates to serve as Treasury secretary — including Larry Fink, the chairman of BlackRock — seemed to have been blacklisted by Ms Warren, because of their experience on Wall Street.However, if a Trump presidency means that a December interest rate rise is less likely — and financial markets suggested it was, late on Tuesday — then banks will not be pleased. A steeper yield curve normally means higher income for banks, which earn big chunks of their profits from the difference between short-term and long-term rates.Trump has said he’s going to tear up Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act; I don’t think he can do eitherFor retailers and consumer goods companies tax reductions could help, but Mr Trump’s immigration and trade policies could have a bigger and more damaging impact, analysts said.Neil Saunders, an analyst at Conlumino, said: “Mr Trump’s policies could be quite far-reaching for retail, especially in terms of the labour market becoming more restricted [if immigration is curbed] and products becoming more expensive if import taxes are introduced. The latter is a major issue given how interconnected supply chains are.”Mr Trump has already singled out Mondelez International, which makes Oreos, for shifting some of its production to Mexico.However, Mr Saunders added that Congress could temper Mr Trump’s more radical proposals.Another industry that could benefit from Mr Trump’s presidency is oil and gas. He has proposed opening up new areas for oil and gas development, including federal lands and waters that are presently closed to exploration, and promised to “rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions”.Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry group, said there was “not a lot” of detail about Mr Trump’s plans, but his pledges could mean he would stem and reverse the “tsunami” of new federal regulations on oil and gas put forward by the Obama administration.Mr Gerard added that Mr Trump’s support for new pipeline projects could help unlock investment that had been held up by objections raised by the Obama administration.Some companies in other sectors may have less of a free hand. Mr Trump’s victory could be bad news for AT&T’s proposed $85.4bn takeover of Time Warner.The combination of America’s largest telecoms group by market value with the owner of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros was announced last month. The deal faces a year of regulatory scrutiny.But in a speech last month Mr Trump said he would block the transaction. “AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” he said."

Third quarter results for the maker of heavy equipment came spattered in block quotes and bold font, with phrases like “lean” and “variable manufacturing costs”. The old economy is not so easily evaded, though. Caterpillar tried to showcase its discipline, but a weak commodity outlook still plagues it.In February Caterpillar predicted revenue and earnings per share for this year of $42bn and $3.50. Its latest reduction cuts this to just $39bn and $2.35. Even as commodity prices have turned up they have not rallied enough to prompt greater mining activity.Caterpillar shares have rallied 25 per cent so far this year. Management says results next year will not change. If so, the boldfaced manoeuvres should lead to an earnings snap-back.

39;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-10-25T16:43:49Z;Caterpillar cuts 2016 profit target for third time this year;Demand for construction and mining equipment shows little sign of recovery;"Caterpillar on Tuesday cut its 2016 profit target for the third time, as the manufacturer of construction and mining equipment also signalled it could endure a fifth consecutive year of no sales growth in 2017.The US company, best known for its yellow excavators, has been hit hard by sluggish global economic growth and the downturn in commodity prices.Caterpillar said the recent recovery in commodity prices had yet to translate into increased mining activity or a rise in equipment purchases. Mining companies are trying to adjust their balance sheets and cost structures, and may continue to delay equipment purchases, it added.“Economic weakness throughout much of the world persists and, as a result, most of our end markets remain challenged,” said Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive, who announced plans this month to retire in March.“In North America, the market has an abundance of used construction equipment, rail customers have a substantial number of idle locomotives, and around the world there are a significant number of idle mining trucks.”Brad Halverson, chief financial officer, told analysts ""the mining industry is talking more positively . . . but we aren’t seeing it in our order activity"".As a result, Caterpillar said it expected revenues to be about $39bn this year, down from the $40bn to $40.5bn range it gave just three months ago and the $47bn recorded in 2015.Headline earnings per share are expected to be about $2.35, or $3.25 excluding restructuring costs. This is down from previous guidance for these earnings measures of $2.75 and $3.55 given in July.Caterpillar saw little sign of improvement next year, saying revenues for 2017 will not be “significantly different” than 2016, which could make it the fifth straight year where it would not record sales growth. Mr Halverson also said China was a relative bright spot for Caterpillar, while Europe continues to recover in spite of the UK’s vote in June to leave the EU. “At this point we have not had any significant impact to our business from Brexit but we remain concerned about how it will impact growth,” he added.In early afternoon trading in New York, Caterpillar shares were down 1.5 per cent at $84.68.The tough trading environment was underscored by Caterpillar’s third-quarter results, in which sales and profit fell short of analysts’ expectations.For the three months ended September, revenues fell 16 per cent to $9.16bn, with all business lines recording double-digit declines. Operating profit for the quarter tumbled to $481m, from $925m in the prior year period.The state of US manufacturing was also in focus after another sector heavyweight cut its guidance for 2016.3M, the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape, reduced its full-year earnings per share target range to $8.15 to $8.20, down from its previous forecast of $8.15 to $8.30.It blamed sluggish global demand for consumer electronics, which has weighed on sales at 3M’s electronics and energy division.The unit makes components used in mobile phones and computers and was the only one out of 3M’s five major businesses to record a sales drop during the third quarter.The business reported sales of $1.3bn for the three months ended September, a 7.5 per cent drop from one year earlier."
40;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-10-17T16:56:06Z;Doug Oberhelman to retire as Caterpillar chief;Management shake-up follows prolonged downturn in heavy machinery maker’s sales;Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive is to retire in March after weak commodity prices and an economic slowdown in China led to a prolonged downturn in the heavy machinery maker’s sales.Doug Oberhelman, a 41-year veteran of the company, took over in 2010 at a time when the market for his company’s products was riding high on a commodities and mining boom and seemingly endless prospects for Chinese growth. Caterpillar's shares traded flat after the announcement of the management changes on Monday. He will be succeeded as chief executive by Jim Umpleby, a 35-year Caterpillar veteran who leads energy and transportation for the group. Dave Calhoun, a member of the board, will become non-executive chairman. “During the last four years, Caterpillar has faced unprecedented global economic conditions that have significantly impacted the industries served by our customers, as those industries and economic growth in many regions around the world have slowed or severely contracted,” Mr Oberhelman said, referring to sluggish economic growth and struggles in the energy sector that have pushed the industrial bellwether’s annual revenue down to $47bn last year from as high as $65.9bn in 2012. “The future is bright,” he added. In July, Caterpillar cut its full-year sales and profits forecast for a second straight quarter, highlighting the struggle to call a bottom to the downturn in global emerging markets and fresh risks created by the UK’s vote to leave the EU and geopolitical turmoil.Mr Oberhelman has been criticised for investing heavily in boosting production globally and expanding the company's mining equipment range, at just the wrong time. But Charles Yengst, of Yengst Associates, a machinery market consultancy, says “decisions to make investments are long term, they’re not just made for tomorrow . . . some of the decisions Caterpillar has made [in the last 40 years] have not looked very wise at the time but 15 to 20 years afterward they look like they did the right thing”. He added: “The whole board was behind him on all of this.” During his tenure, Mr Oberhelman was also credited with slimming down the company, cutting the workforce by 20 per cent, or 30,000 jobs, in the past four years, Caterpillar said. “We think Mr Oberhelman did a good job managing a difficult terrain over the past couple of years, sharply cutting costs in the face of a severe downturn in demand,” said Jim Corridore, of CFRA Research. Mr Corridore maintains a sell recommendation on the shares because of “our expectations of continued demand shortfalls and lack of positive catalysts on the horizon”.

42;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-09-02T13:06:33Z;Caterpillar to close Belgium plant risking 2,200 jobs;Decision part of a global restructuring that could involve cutting up to 10,000 positions;Caterpillar announced on Friday that it was planning to close a large production plant in Belgium, sparking political uproar and attempts by workers to occupy the site.The decision, which could cost up to 2,200 jobs, is part of a global restructuring plan announced in September that could see the company cut as many as 10,000 jobs worldwide in the coming years.In a statement, the US construction-equipment manufacturer said it had to “contemplate actions to reduce manufacturing capacity and take operating costs out of our business to align with lower demand”. The site’s activities are set to be transferred to an existing plant in Grenoble, France, and to other plants outside of Europe.Belgium’s state broadcaster, RTBF, reported that about 60 workers had responded to Caterpillar’s announcement by seizing bulldozers and attempting to block the entrance to the plant.The closure threatens to cause a political storm in Belgium, where the right-leaning coalition government of prime minister Charles Michel is facing accusations from opposition parties of failing to do enough to support jobs and the country’s manufacturing base.Elio Di Rupo, Belgium’s former prime minister and leader of the country’s francophone Socialist Party, described the move as an “absolute catastrophe”, while Zakia Khattabi, joint-leader of the French-speaking green party, Ecolo, said the closure was a symptom of “an exhausted economic model”.The plant, in Gosselies, is located in one of the most economically deprived parts of Belgium, close to the city of Charleroi, a former bastion of the country’s industrial revolution that has since endured decades of decline.Caterpillar said it would now begin the formal “information and consultation process” on the closure of the plant. It promised a “constructive dialogue with the employee representatives in order to minimise the global impact”. The company’s leaders are set to meet Mr Michel and regional leaders to discuss the step.The decision by Caterpillar comes after it announced this week that as many as 250 jobs will be shed in Northern Ireland as it closes one of its several plants there.The company cut its full-year sales and profits forecast for a second straight quarter in July, highlighting the struggle to call a bottom to the downturn in emerging markets, and fresh risks created by Brexit. Caterpillar is continuing to suffer from weak demand for equipment used in the mining and energy sectors.
43;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-08-21T12:32:41Z;Caterpillar explores data mining with Uptake;How an industrial behemoth and an agile tech start-up took lessons from each other;When Doug Oberhelman sat down last year at Chicago Ideas Week to discuss one of his latest ventures, the chief executive of Caterpillar had swapped his usual conservative business attire for a black leather jacket and jeans.No doubt it was a reflection of the company the 63-year-old was keeping. Sitting on stage with him was a similarly dressed Brad Keywell, co-founder of the tech start-up with which the world’s largest maker of mining and construction machinery has a tie-up. Listening to them were hundreds of the Windy City’s keenest geeks and techies.But Mr Oberhelman’s new look was more than skin deep. Caterpillar, best known for its hulking yellow machines that dig mines and transport earth, has — alongside many industrial behemoths — increasingly looked to big data to raise profitability as capital spending from its customers has slumped. It is collaborating with a number of start-ups specialising in products from drones to predictive technology, Groupon co-founder Mr Keywell’s Uptake being one of them.These ventures — where big meets small, slow meets fast, old meets young and machinery meets software — are fertile ground for culture clashes. But Caterpillar and Uptake have taken lessons from each other, which they say resulted in fundamental improvements to both companies.“It’s the marriage of silicon and steel,” says George Taylor, head of marketing and digital at Caterpillar.“When you think about a large corporation, they’d think big a lot then they’d start big, [but] act slow. Uptake has helped us to think big, and act fast and small. It’s a really powerful juxtaposition to a business like us and it makes us nervous a bit still.”The two companies first formed a partnership about two years ago. Uptake, which was reported last year to have a $1bn valuation and in which Caterpillar has an undisclosed stake, uses its proprietary software to trawl the immense amount of data collected from Caterpillar’s clients to predict when a machine needs repairing, preventing accidents and extended downtime, and saving money.Caterpillar conducted a study of a large mining company’s malfunctioning machine, which had resulted in 900 hours of downtime and $650,000 in repairs. If the technology from the two companies’ project had been applied, the machine’s downtime would have been less than 24 hours and the repairs only $12,000.In many ways Caterpillar and Uptake could not be more different. The former is nearly a century old and headquartered in the depths of rural Illinois, surrounded by landscape reminiscent of the crop-spraying aircraft scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest. It employs more than 100,000 people across the globe.By contrast, Uptake’s 500-plus staff work in a contemporary open-plan office located in a historic downtown Chicago building, which 100 years ago housed one of the city’s original start-ups — the Montgomery Ward mail order catalogue company.The companies have seconded staff to each other’s headquarters but they are swapping more than employees and developing technology together.Caterpillar says that Uptake’s focus on speed and agility is helping it become more nimble as a company as well as allowing staff more flexibility with experimentation. One of the inevitable byproducts of size for a company like Caterpillar is risk aversion — the default instinct is to protect the brand — and bureaucracy. Reducing those handicaps can give large companies an edge over rivals.“It’s the internet of things [as] applied to us, that’s what’s really starting to explode,” Mr Taylor says. “[It’s about] solving customer problems.” But they have to, he says, “get it out there fast”.Caterpillar’s customer expectations are high, as companies increasingly benchmark the performance of business apps alongside personal smartphone technology, irrespective of complexity, intensifying pressure on Caterpillar to get new products and updates out rapidly.Greg Goff, Uptake’s chief product officer, credits the public commitment of Caterpillar’s senior executives with keeping up the project’s pace. But another vital component has been that Caterpillar says it is more willing to allow decision making further down the chain of command — something Mr Goff has noticed.“With a big company, decisions tend to be fragmented . . . and often get escalated,” Mr Goff says. “They’ve learned how to empower people a little more to make decisions. And we’ve learned how to navigate their organisation and who to get into the meetings.”He explains: “Often who makes the decision is a difficult thing to find, just because there’s a lot of stakeholders.”Uptake’s comfort with moving fast led to a separate project, which began as a strict 100-day challenge to find a way to better control inventory: Caterpillar had no method for tracking when its dealers sold a part it had supplied them. The project demanded a system that could extract the data from Caterpillar’s 175 global dealers’ disparate databases and integrate them.In the past, Caterpillar would have been reluctant to show its senior executives a project before it was almost complete, but the combination of a tight deadline and rising comfort levels with presenting work in-progress encouraged them to try it.The company plans to deploy this new system over the next two years and expects to cut 10 per cent of its total after-market parts inventory costs.The lessons have been far from one-sided, however. Mr Goff says that the Uptake team has become far more open about showing Caterpillar its progress — as assumptions it had made about working with a large company did not, they found, necessarily apply to Caterpillar.Mr Goff adds that Caterpillar has made Uptake far more disciplined about communicating with its business partners over what to expect next, including developing a formal process around preparing clients for software updates.“We grew very, very fast and sometimes that growth outpaced our maturity,” Mr Goff says.He adds that Caterpillar’s scale enables Uptake to learn more rapidly than other start-ups because it is dealing with such a large number of dealers across the world instead of just a few. The same applies to data protection, he says.“There are local, national and international laws that we’re understanding and abiding by much more quickly than most start-ups.”While it is difficult to imagine Caterpillar’s Mr Oberhelman and his staff at the Peoria headquarters all adopting jeans and leather jackets — or even start-up uniform hoodies — there has clearly been much exchange of lessons between these two very different companies.Tom Bucklar, director of innovation and digital at Caterpillar, says: “I don’t think they could have achieved what we’ve achieved by themselves, nor could we, and isn’t that at the end of the day the best kind of relationship?”If a driver operating Caterpillar equipment in a remote mine, or driving a truck down a highway for a long time, starts to feel sleepy, his head may briefly slump, or his eyes divert away from their main focus.However brief that moment, back at Caterpillar’s headquarters in Peoria, Illinois, a sensor can detect the movement, register it and respond by sending a prod, such as a vibration, into the cab to rouse the driver, improving efficiency and safety. This is thanks to a collaboration with Seeing Machines that began in 2013.The world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment is hoping to beat the competition using tie-ups with a variety of start-ups, and investments through its venture capital subsidiary in Silicon Valley, investing in early-stage companies.This way, Caterpillar gains insight into technology without committing excessive funds into one area.For example, this year the company has invested in funds that focus on early-stage companies that are reducing costs in oil and gas.
44;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Caterpillar cuts 2016 forecasts further as mining struggles;Weak commodity demand and strong dollar weighs on US heavy machinery maker;Caterpillar cut its full-year sales and profits forecast for a second straight quarter on Tuesday, highlighting the struggle to call a bottom to an emerging market downturn amid fresh risks created by Brexit and geopolitical turmoil.Weak demand for equipment used in the mining and energy sector continued to weigh on its business while the strong dollar and weaker capital spending in Europe ate into its overseas sales.Brad Halverson, chief financial officer, said in an interview that the slump in demand was not only a reflection of the broader economic environment but the fact that miners had until a couple of years ago bought more heavy equipment than they needed, which was weighing on replacement demand.On a more positive note, he said dealers had started to see demand for spare parts to rebuild 50 tonne mining trucks, although this year it was expecting to sell only 100 new trucks compared with previous years when it sold between 600-700.“If you go back historically, we’ve not had more than two years down [in sales] since the late 20s, 30s, before it has started to recover,” Mr Halverson said. “For us to be in our fourth year . . . is something we’ve not experienced.”Although the US heavy machinery maker, best known for its yellow excavators, said commodity prices appeared to have stabilised, they remained at low levels and the group warned that the fallout from the Brexit vote in the UK and turmoil in Turkey added to the lack of predictability.Mr Halverson said that the company had contingency plans in place in case the various difficulties in Europe were exacerbated. It is reducing costs by $2bn this year and is prepared to take out further costs if necessary, while spending on areas such as adding digital equipment to its machinery which it sees as a key growth opportunity.If you go back historically, we’ve not had more than two years down [in sales] since the late 20s, 30s, before it has started to recover. For us to be in our fourth year . . . is something we’ve not experiencedThe company warned that more lay-offs were expected in the second half as it tried to adapt to the tough trading environment. “World economic growth remains subdued and is not sufficient to drive improvement in most of the industries and markets we serve,” the company said in a statement.Caterpillar said it expected sales and revenues to be in a range of $40bn to $40.5bn in 2016. This compares with its previous outlook of $40bn to $42bn issued in April, the $40bn to $44bn guidance in January, and the $47bn recorded in 2015.It expects profits to come in at a midpoint of $2.75 a share this year, or about $3.55 excluding restructuring costs. This is down from the guidance given in April for $3 a share (or $3.70 a share excluding restructuring costs) and the forecast of $3.50 a share (or $4 a share excluding restructuring costs) issued in January.The cut in forecast comes as second-quarter revenue tumbled 16 per cent to $10.3bn. Sales fell in all categories and drove profit down to 93 cents a share, compared with $1.31 per share last year.Adjusted earnings — which exclude restructuring costs — came in at $1.09 a share, ahead of forecasts of 96 cents a share.The recent recovery in commodity prices has yet to translate into increased mining activity or a rise in equipment purchases. Mining companies are trying to adjust their balance sheets and cost structures, and may continue to delay equipment purchases.Analysts at Jefferies also noted that Caterpillar has 20 “key facilities” in the UK and said potential trade restrictions stemming from the country’s decision to leave the EU could impact businesses.

The Washington-based Business Roundtable, which represents the chief executives of large companies, said on Wednesday that its members expected the US economy to grow by 2.1 per cent in 2016, down from a forecast of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter, according to the group’s latest survey.The US economy, the world’s largest, grew at an annual rate of just 0.8 per cent in the first quarter, according to official figures, but most economists expect this to accelerate in the coming months. The chief executives surveyed were modestly optimistic about sales and their own plans for investment and hiring over the next six months. The broad view of the bosses was that May’s weak payrolls report — just 38,000 jobs were added, compared with 123,000 in April — was probably an aberration. But they also continued to have a far more subdued view of the broader economy, said Doug Oberhelman, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, the world’s largest seller of mining and construction equipment.“A 2.1 per cent growth forecast is not optimistic. Our CEO group is not at all happy with a 2.1 per cent growth rate,” Mr Oberhelman, chairman of the Business Roundtable, said ahead of the Fed’s June policy announcement on Wednesday. As expected, the central bank kept interest rates unchanged.While a further 25 basis point increase in interest rates might seem modest, the global market turmoil that followed the Fed’s first hike in almost a decade in December last year was a reason for caution, he said. “We have got to be very careful with rising interest rates and when they go,” he warned. US growth now faced a slew of risks, ranging from a possible UK exit from the EU following next week’s referendum, to the protectionist agenda dominating the economic debate in this year’s US presidential election, Mr Oberhelman added. A climate of uncertainty was making it hard for businesses to make investment and hiring decisions, he said. Mr Oberhelman declined to address specific campaign proposals, such as Republican candidate Donald Trump’s plans for a ban on Muslims entering the US, and punitive tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods.But he warned that “global engagement” had to remain central to any US growth strategy. John Engler, the former Republican governor of Michigan who now serves as president of the Business Roundtable, said that his business group and others were concerned by the antitrade rhetoric in the campaign.They are continuing to push Congress to pass a major Pacific Rim trade deal, negotiated by the Obama administration with Japan and 10 other countries, before the next president takes office early next year. “There is, on [trade], a fundamental difference in how we view the world compared to the leading presidential candidates,” Mr Engler said. Mr Trump has expressed outright opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, while Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, has been sceptical about it.A difference of opinion applied to immigration as well, with many US businesses now engaged in a global battle to recruit talent, Mr Engler said. He likened this phenomenon to the contest to sign professional athletes, with US and other teams often recruiting beyond their own borders. “We want to be able to do the same thing with scientists and engineers,” he said. 
46;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-05-25T03:01:03Z;China’s equipment makers aim to scoop out overseas market share;Construction sector ramps up competition for Caterpillar, Komatsu, Deere and others;China’s construction equipment makers are ramping up the competition against global leaders such as Caterpillar, Komatsu and Deere and appear set to discount products to build market share, a new study has found.The Chinese companies — which include Sany, Zoomlion and XCMG— are likely to boost their market share outside China to around 15 per cent by 2025, up from an estimated 7 per cent currently (see chart), according to research by UBS Evidence Lab, which analysed about 15,000 construction equipment dealerships around the world.“We think the Chinese are making moves to expand further into the west and we think they have a very good chance to take market share, if they are fully committed to doing so,” said Steven Fisher, UBS analyst.He said that the biggest competitive advantage of the Chinese companies was a relatively low cost base that allowed them to offer discounts in the region of 15 to 40 per cent to equivalent premium brand equipment.This will allow them to take market share in Europe and the US, where the presence of Chinese brands in dealerships remains fairly scarce. The biggest operational challenge for the Chinese, Mr Fisher said, lies in providing aftersales support to dealerships, especially by ensuring that spare parts are supplied quickly and in sufficient quantity.“We don’t generally assume that Chinese products are going head to head with Caterpillar and Deere,” Mr Fisher added. “But our point is that a discount on a base level product can end up applying pressure further up the chain.”The UBS Evidence Lab found in its analysis of the 15,000 dealerships that Chinese manufacturers “have increased interest in expanding more aggressively” and — if they maintain this — may be able to scoop up about 1 per cent in market share outside China per year over the next decade.The effect of this would be a reduction in the available profit pool for western giants such as Caterpillar, Metso, Komatsu, Sandvik, Volvo, Deere, Terex and others, the UBS research report said.However, the challenges before the Chinese companies in terms of market dynamics appear considerable. In the US, for instance, Chinese brands had only a 3.7 per cent presence in the dealerships surveyed (see map), defining a struggle for brand recognition. “Presence” in the survey was measured by the proportion of points of sale for Chinese brands versus other brands sold in dealerships.In emerging markets, though, the Chinese firms have made greater inroads, buoyed by infrastructure projects financed through Chinese financial institutions. In Kazakhstan, Chinese construction equipment brands had a presence in 42 per cent of dealerships, an 11 per cent footprint in Brazil, a 24 per cent presence in Russia, and in Iran — where business by European and US corporations has been limited by sanctions — Chinese equipment was on sale in 92 per cent of dealerships.The lending firepower of China’s two policy banks— the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China — is likely to enhance the prospect of contracts for Chinese construction equipment makers in coming years. The two banks already lend almost as much as the six western-backed multilateral development institutions put together.However, the Chinese companies tend to be more heavily mired in debt. Zoomlion is the most egregious, with a total debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) multiple of 21, while XCMG and Sany have multiples of 15.3 and 8.1 respectively. Caterpillar and Komatsu are considerably lower, while Deere has a multiple of 10.9.But in spite of the heavy debt loads carried by Chinese companies, their appetite for overseas acquisitions appears to have remained undiminished. Zoomlion made a cash bid for Terex, the US company, earlier this year, though the result of that overture is still uncertain.LiuGong, a Chinese machinery maker with a debt multiple of 16, has made no secret of its intent to boost overseas revenues to 50 per cent by 2020, up from 35 per cent of total revenues now, UBS said. Sany, for its part, announced this year that it had acquired another US-based dealer for earth movers, calling it part of an “aggressive” expansion of the company’s earth moving dealer network.
47;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-04-22T21:13:41Z;Caterpillar says business in Brazil has ‘basically tanked’;Mining and construction equipment group cuts full-year sales and profit forecasts;Caterpillar on Friday said its business in Brazil had “basically tanked” as the country suffers from intensifying political turmoil and a deepening recession.The comments by chief financial officer Bradley Halverson came as the world’s largest seller of mining and construction equipment — which is seen as a bellwether for global industrial demand — cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts.Caterpillar’s overall first-quarter sales dropped 25.5 per cent to $9.46bn, while earnings fell 77 per cent to 46 cents a share. Latin American sales sank 43 per cent led by Brazil and Mexico, with low oil prices hitting demand for mining equipment.Brazil is in the midst of its deepest recession in decades, as the commodities slump takes its toll on exports and as President Dilma Rousseff fights against impeachment.“The Brazilian market has been important for us for a long time,” Mr Halverson told the Financial Times. “We’re really not seeing anything positive happening in Brazil — our business has basically tanked. Fiscal reforms are needed urgently …and more co-operation from the [political] parties.”He added: “They are going to have to work really hard to maintain a business-friendly environment. In terms of what we’re seeing, we’re slightly below the bottom and it is not getting any better.”Caterpillar is not the only multinational whose business is suffering as a result of the turmoil in Brazil. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola this week cited the country as the emerging market for which the outlook was a specific concern.Caterpillar estimated revenues for this year would be $1bn lower than forecast at between $40bn and $42bn. This will push earnings to between $3 and $3.70 a share against a previous outlook of $3.50 to $4 a share, the company said.Caterpillar is facing a fourth year of falling sales as low commodity prices and a slowdown in China hit economies from Brazil to Russia, crushing investment in machinery. The company said it had seen signs of improvement in the construction market in China and Europe.However, the improvements were not enough to slow the decline in sales. The revised outlook also came on the back of worse than expected pricing for its equipment.We’re really not seeing anything positive happening in Brazil — our business has basically tanked. Fiscal reforms are needed urgently …and more co-operation from the [political] partiesMr Halverson was optimistic about the outlook for the US, outside the energy industry. “There are positive signs in the US,” he said. “If you’re not around oil and gas I’d say sentiment is a lot more positive than last year at this time.”After years of strong growth in China, industrial companies such as Caterpillar and Japanese rival Komatsu have been braced for lower overall construction equipment demand on a longer-term basis.“While first-quarter results were about as we expected, sales and profit were well below the first quarter of 2015,” chief executive Doug Oberhelman said. “Sales declined across the company with substantial reductions in construction, oil and gas, mining and rail. While many of the industries we serve are challenged, we remain focused on what we can control.”The company’s shares, which had tumbled as oil prices dropped, have risen 15 per cent this year, outpacing Komatsu’s 2.4 per cent increase. They slipped 1.2 per cent to $77.74 on Friday.
48;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-04-12T17:53:12Z;Corporate winners and losers amid the oil price crash;Airlines are beneficiaries of cheap fuel but consumer goods groups are not getting a big boost;Oil price crashes have profound consequences. The fall in crude after the 1997 Asian financial crisis ushered in today’s oil and gas supermajors after a flurry of megamergers that included BP’s tie-up with Amoco, Exxon with Mobil and Texaco with Chevron.The latest collapse in oil is having an enormous impact — even though the benchmark Brent price has rebounded in 2016, it is still about 60 per cent down since mid-2014.Oil and gas: Debt fears flare upRosneft runs to stand stillSaudi Arabia loses oil shareUS oil and gas sector reboots to surviveOil price: ‘Shot in the arm’ misses economic targetBut the consequences of this oil decline have not been the ones that history might suggest would occur, either within or outside the oil industry.Thousands of jobs have been axed as rigs have been idled and investment slashed across the sector.However, with the exception of Royal Dutch Shell’s acquisition of smaller rival BG Group, there has so far been nothing like the wave of large deals that followed the late 1990s oil downturn.That is because this downturn was preceded by a period of virtual “free money” following the 2008 financial crisis, says Tony Hayward, chairman of Glencore and former chief executive of BP.“Much of the industry was massively overleveraged in a way it wasn’t in 1998 and 1999,” he adds, and that is leading to bankruptcies in the US shale industry, and preventing consolidation.But what of the rest of the corporate world?Conventional wisdom says cheap fuel is good news for airlines, makers of gas-guzzling cars, and other companies able to produce or ship goods less expensively for shoppers with wallets fattened by lower pump prices.Conversely, a low oil price is supposed to be bad news for power generators using renewable energy and electric carmakers.But the reality has been more complicated in an oil price rout that has been deeper and longer than many experts predicted, and is happening in a world that has changed considerably since previous crashes.One of the biggest differences between the latest oil price downturn and past declines is the way consumers have responded to the extra cash in their pockets coming from cheaper fuel.Moody’s says lower oil prices will not translate into the expected strong spending on some consumer goods because many people are focused on saving.Expectations have failed to match reality in many parts of the power sector, too, thanks to the pronounced changes the industry has experienced since previous oil crashes.For one thing, the oil-fired power plants that generated as much as 18 per cent of global electricity in 1980 now produce about 5 per cent, so lower crude prices do not threaten wind farms and solar parks as much as might be imagined.The number of countries with renewable energy targets has soared from just 73 in 2010 to 164 in 2015, data from the International Renewable Energy Agency show.That is one reason the oil rout has failed to dent healthy annual growth in renewable power-generating capacity.Sales of fuel-hungry sport utility vehicles have jumped, but government incentives have to some degree protected the much smaller electric car industry.Monthly sales of electric cars and other vehicles in the US have fallen since the oil price started to decline in mid-2014, but they have risen in Europe, according to figures from Jato Dynamics, an automotive research firm.For consumers, lower oil prices mean less expensive petrol, leaving more money in their pockets to spend on other items, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.This increase in disposable income is, in theory, good news for consumer goods companies — selling food, soap powder and toiletries — which also gain from lower fuel costs. But the reality is more nuanced.Consumers in oil-importing countries, such as India, benefit. But Sarah Solomon of Euromonitor International says those living in oil-exporting countries like Russia “are seeing their economies squeezed. Added to this, many emerging markets are experiencing currency weaknesses and this increases import costs, pushing up inflation, which can more than offset lower energy prices.”Unilever said in January that lower oil prices were helping its laundry business through reduced input costs, but hindering the sales growth of bulk tea, much of which is sold to Middle Eastern countries.Finally, as Ms Solomon points out, consumers do not necessarily spend the savings they make on lower energy bills. Globally, savings as a percentage of disposable income increased slightly in 2015.Moody’s said last month it now expects the effect of low oil prices on US packaged food companies, such as Kraft Heinz, to be “moderately positive” instead of “strongly positive”.Brian Weddington of Moody’s says: “Consumers have remained cautious spenders, which has resulted in heavy price competition . . . Thus, we expect that companies will reinvest much of the cost savings from cheaper fuel in promotions and marketing to at least maintain sales volumes.”Airline executives finally have a smile on their faces. After seeing fuel become their single biggest cost in the era of high oil prices, carriers are now celebrating the plunge, writes Tanya Powley.But while airlines are natural winners, how quickly they can reap the full benefits from cheap oil has varied significantly across the industry.This largely comes down to an airline’s hedging contracts. Fuel typically accounted for about one-third of carriers’ operating costs before the oil rout, and many airlines opt for the predictability that hedging oil purchases several months forward allows.US carriers, which are generally less reliant on fuel hedging, have enjoyed the biggest boost so far from cheap oil.Executives at American Airlines will be lauding their decision to abandon hedging in 2014, which has enabled it to enjoy lower fuel costs faster than many rivals. This contributed to record net profits for 2015.In January, Delta Air Lines said its fuel costs for last year were down 44 per cent compared with 2014.European airlines have had to be more patient. Both flag carriers and budget airlines on the continent tend to hedge 12 to 18 months out, so some have had to wait until this year to secure big benefits from cheap oil.“Most large European airlines are starting to see major benefits now,” says Oliver Sleath, analyst at Barclays. “They’re moving from paying an average effective rate of $90 to $100 a barrel in 2015 down to $60 to $70 a barrel in 2016.”The axing of investment projects by oil and gas producers has taken its toll on manufacturers that count energy companies among their most important customers, writes Michael Pooler.The energy sector accounted for one-third of corporate capital expenditure globally in 2014, but investment cuts will shrink that share to a quarter by 2017, according to Standard & Poor’s.In the US, the fortunes of the energy and manufacturing industries are particularly intertwined. This is highlighted by how the US manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, a measure of the sector’s health, started falling when the oil price began declining in mid-2014.“Oil has generally been a leading indicator for industrial confidence in the US,” says Matthew Spurr, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “Once manufacturers realised we were in the lower-for-longer scenario, the PMIs started to reflect that.”Those affected include Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction machinery. Cheap commodities contributed to a 15 per cent fall in revenue in the company’s 2015 results, with the effect of lower crude prices hitting its unit that supports drilling and well servicing.The oil price collapse is also reverberating in South Korea, the world’s biggest shipbuilding nation. Its three giants of the industry — Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering — have recorded much reduced orders for energy platforms and drill vessels.Elsewhere, an expected lift for chemicals companies that make their products from oil derivatives has largely not materialised.This is partly due to reduced demand for chemicals in the energy industry, says Jeremy Redenius, analyst at Bernstein.Falling oil prices have led to a boom in sales of large, fuel-hungry cars, writes Peter Campbell.In the US, Europe and China, sales of sport utility vehicles and so-called “crossover” cars have outpaced traditional saloons.Large vehicles have higher margins for carmakers, and are also attractive for consumers because they offer better visibility and more storage space.SUVs became the best-selling type of car across Europe for the first time last year, according to Jato Dynamics, an automotive research firm, after sales rose 24 per cent to 3.2m units.SUVs accounted for 22.5 per cent of all cars sold in Europe, with demand rising in the 29 countries analysed by Jato. More than 1m crossover cars were sold last year.“Similar to the shift towards SUVs in the US car market, Europeans are clearly favouring these vehicles,” says Felipe Munoz, an analyst at Jato.“Both economic and social factors such as the lower fuel prices and the growing appeal of SUVs’ benefits had a big influence on this sales boom.”Between 2010 and 2014, unit sales of SUVs rose from 12 per cent of the Chinese market to 23 per cent.In the UK, several big manufacturers have seen demand for large cars rise in recent years.In February Jaguar Land Rover said the Range Rover Evoque, the luxury compact SUV built in Halewood, Mersyside, was the fastest-selling vehicle ever.Last month Nissan expanded production of its Qashqai crossover at the company’s Sunderland plant, after saying that annual output of 300,000 cars was not enough to meet rising demand.Tumbling oil prices have hurt the biofuels industry around the world, writes Pilita Clark.The sector’s fortunes depend heavily on government support for renewable fuels in most countries. But where crude prices go, biofuels generally follow, so the oil rout has had a negative impact on the industry.“It’s been significant,” says Claire Curry, analyst at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research group.In the US, the biggest biofuels producer, ethanol prices have fallen from nearly $3.50 a gallon since mid-2014, to less than $2 this year. Ethanol is usually blended with petrol for use in cars and other vehicles.The shares in some large US biofuels companies have followed a similar path to ethanol prices. For example, the stock of Green Plains of the US has fallen more than 40 per cent in the past year.In Europe, Germany’s CropEnergies, one of the sector’s larger producers, suspended output at its Ensus refinery in the UK just over a year ago.That contributed to an 11 per cent decline in CropEnergies’ revenues during the first three-quarters of its 2015-16 financial year, but has helped ease concerns about too much capacity in the industry.The sector’s woes have also paved the way for some consolidation.For example, last year Pacific Ethanol of the US bought Aventine Renewable Energy, an Illinois-based ethanol producer.Global investment in biofuels had already dried up before oil prices began to fall, plunging from more than $25bn in 2007 to well below $5bn in 2014, as governments curtailed their support.This is the sixth part of a Financial Times series entitled ‘Oil: Lower for Longer’, looking at the consequences of the fall in crude prices.
49;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-03-29T07:11:02Z;Construction machinery sales upswing likely after long downturn;Manufacturers in line for return to growth after years of falling sales;Global sales of construction equipment such as bulldozers, diggers and dump trucks are expected to expand in 2017 after five years of shrinkage, according to Off-Highway Research, a consulting firm.Machinery manufacturers including Caterpillar of the US and the UK’s JCB have been hit since 2012 by falling demand, which is rooted in China’s economic slowdown and the negative impact this has had on industries including construction and mining.Off-Highway Research is expecting a rebound in global unit sales of construction machines in 2017, driven by the gradual replacement of ageing vehicles and its prediction of an improvement in commodity prices.The consultancy said unit sales should increase 5 per cent next year, based on on analysis of data from about 1,500 interviews with machinery manufacturers and dealers.The construction machines business, which generated $78.3bn in revenue last year, has shrunk by almost a quarter in dollar terms since peaking in 2011.Off-Highway Research said China’s deepening economic slowdown and falling commodity prices were responsible for unit sales of construction equipment declining 17 per cent last year to 685,536.With sales shrinkage in North America and Japan in 2015, the only major markets to record increases in unit terms were Europe and India.“[The year] 2015 was worse than expected for the global construction equipment industry,” said David Phillips, managing director of Off-Highway Research.“ Emerging markets were generally weak — the only significant exception being India — and developed regions of the world were not strong enough to offset the painful declines we saw in countries such as China.”Sales of equipment in China tripled between 2007 and 2011 in dollar terms, when the country accounted for four in every 10 construction machines bought.But since then, weaker building activity means that unit sales last year were down 72 per cent compared with 2011.While this has hit Chinese machinery manufacturers such as Sany and XCMG, which face inventory and factory overcapacity, the effects have also been felt by Sweden’s Volvo and Komatsu of Japan.Caterpillar last year warned it could cut up to 10,000 jobs by 2018 as the company forecast a fourth year of falling sales.“Very few companies around the world are as profitable as they were three or four years ago — largely because of the downturn in China,” said Mr Phillips.“When it comes, the recovery is likely to be gradual, reflecting weak business confidence and the uncertain geopolitical outlook around the world.”Off-Highway Research is predicting a 3 per cent decline in global unit sales of construction machines this year.Alongside weak demand, another problem for machinery manufacturers is the large number of idle vehicles that can be sold second hand for much lower prices compared with brand new.
50;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-03-08T18:25:48Z;Trump hits list of corporate targets on campaign trail;CEOs hit back at Republican candidate’s stance on manufacturing being moved abroad;"Donald Trump used to love Apple products, Oreo cookies and Carrier air-conditioners. But as the New York property developer has made the transition from billionaire businessman to frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, he has made some of those same companies and firms the target of his “Make America Great Again” campaign.While Mr Trump plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border to keep out illegal immigrants, he has also vowed to target US companies that move manufacturing overseas — whether Apple in China or Carrier and Mondelez, the Oreo-maker, in Mexico — via a combination of tariffs and the presidential bully pulpit.He has singled out a number of American companies on the campaign trail. But one of his favourite targets is Komatsu, the Japanese construction and mining equipment manufacturer that competes with Caterpillar in the US and around the world.From Iowa to Florida, Mr Trump has bashed the company, saying a weaker yen — which he blames on Japan’s monetary policy — has forced a friend of his to buy Komatsu instead of Caterpillar. But as with many of Mr Trump’s statements during the race, it raises more questions than it answers. The Japanese company actually manufactures construction and mining equipment at three factories in the US where it employs several thousand employees.And while Mr Trump asserts that he would help companies such as Caterpillar — which he wants to use to build the wall — the head of the company has criticised some of his policies. In his capacity as the new head of the Business Roundtable, an association of US chief executives, Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar chief executive, has said that Mr Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on US companies that include Ford, would be “very dangerous” since US multinationals depend on open markets.“We’re 5 per cent of the world population. 95 per cent of our potential customers are elsewhere. We’ve got to learn and figure out how to deal with that,” said Mr Oberhelman.Back in spring 2013, Mr Trump’s biggest problem with Apple was the size of its iPhones.“I have a lot of Apple stock — and I miss Steve Jobs,” he said in a Facebook post. “Tim Cook must immediately increase the size of the screen on the iPhone,” he urged, or Apple would “lose a lot of business” to Samsung’s larger smartphones.Mr Cook, Apple’s chief executive, delivered a bigger screen in late 2014, unlocking huge new growth for the iPhone. But now Apple is in Mr Trump’s sights again. The leading Republican presidential contender said in January he would “get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries”. Last month, he called for a boycott of Apple products until the company complied with a judicial order to help investigators break into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook before he killed 14 people in California in December.Only one Apple product, the high-priced Mac Pro desktop computer, has its final assembly in the US today but the company sources several components domestically, including the iPhone’s glass screen and some iOS device processors. Apple points to a study by Analysis Group, a consultancy, that found it supported 361,000 jobs at US suppliers in 33 states.Nonetheless, increasing its US manufacturing base has not been without challenges for Apple. In one high-profile case, in 2013 it invested $578m in an Arizona supplier of sapphire, GT Advanced Technology. But GT filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014 after struggling to meet Apple’s production standards and its sapphire facility is now being converted into an Apple data centre.Mr Cook told 60 Minutes, the CBS News programme, in December that it was not wages but skills that kept most of Apple’s manufacturing outside the US.“China put an enormous focus on manufacturing,” Mr Cook said, as its schools prioritised “vocational” skills. “You can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.”“Oreos, I love them, but I’ll never eat them again.”Mondelez International was one of the first companies that Mr Trump lambasted after launching his campaign, accusing the snack maker at a rally last summer of moving production overseas at the expense of US jobs.Mondelez, which makes Oreos, pointed out the errors in his claims that its Chicago bakery was shutting, that it was instead building a plant in Salinas, Mexico, and that by implication there would be no more Oreo production in the US.Mondelez clarified that it was shifting nine production lines to an existing Mexican plant it is upgrading, which would result in the loss of 600 jobs. It added that the Chicago bakery would remain one of its largest production sites in the US in terms of headcount, and said Oreos would still be made in several US plants.Talking to CNBC last October Irene Rosenfeld, Mondelez chief executive, said: “My most sane message to Mr Trump is to get your facts straight.”Mr Trump might not be planning to eat any more Oreos, but his attachment is set to remain in the public eye. Mondelez points out that he has featured in an Oreos commercial.And not long after he hit out at Mondelez, comedian Stephen Colbert featured Oreos in a skit on The Late Show, where he binge-ate the cookies as he mocked the businessman. The segment has had more than 3m hits on YouTube.The decision by Carrier, part of United Technologies, to move 1,400 jobs making air conditioning equipment from Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico, would normally have attracted little attention. But one of the workers captured on video the moment staff were told about the move.The video — in which workers yelled obscenities at an impassive manager — has racked up 3.5m views in less than a month. It has also, inevitably, drawn comments from Mr Trump.“We cannot allow this to keep happening!” the candidate wrote on Facebook. “It WILL NOT happen under my watch!”Carrier responded that the closure had been a “difficult decision”, reached following a “thorough evaluation” of its manufacturing operations.The weeks since Carrier’s February 11 announcement have shown the kinds of pressures that lead companies to make such decisions. On February 19, Dave Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, met Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies, to propose a $90bn cash-and-share offer for UTC.Neither the bid nor Honeywell’s subsequent abandonment of it has made any difference to the plight of the Carrier workers or the 700 from another part of UTC made redundant at the same time.However, if Carrier sought to move the jobs while he was president, Mr Trump has said he would tell the company it would face a 35 per cent tax for bringing units manufactured in Mexico into the US.The controversy has had some immediate effects. Carrier and UTC have had to undertake to hand back to Indiana the $1.2m tax abatement awarded as an incentive to keep work in the state.Mr Trump likes to say that he has a friend who “always orders Caterpillar, and recently he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because they’ve cut the yen . . . to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete”.One problem: any “tractors” bought by Mr Trump’s friend may well have been made in the US. Komatsu runs large factories in Chattanooga, Tennessee; Peoria, Illinois, and Newberry, South Carolina.When asked for more details about what his friend was buying, Hope Hicks, spokeswoman for Mr Trump said “pass”. Komatsu declined to comment on anything relating to Mr Trump. However, it confirmed its basic policy is to make some crucial components — such as pumps for hydraulic shovels — in Japan, while assembly takes place close to the market. That means the yen’s decline from Y80 to the dollar in 2012 to Y114 today has helped Komatsu, although economists doubt the yen is greatly undervalued. William Cline of the Peterson Institute puts its fair value at Y108.But the company also exports products from the US, including mining equipment to countries such as Australia, which complicates any discussions about the relative impact of the yen on US jobs.Komatsu says its US sales peaked in 2005, fell off heavily after the Lehman shock, and have since recovered in line with competitors — showing more sensitivity to US demand than to the yen. Yet on top of a brutal slowdown in China, where Komatsu’s monthly orders are down 40-50 per cent on a year ago, the company now finds itself cast as the villain in a new Pacific trade war.Reporting by Demetri Sevastopulo, Tim Bradshaw, Lindsay Whipp, Robert Wright and Robin HardingWhite House Countdown: Sign up for our daily US election email."
51;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-01-28T21:31:52Z;Caterpillar warns of another difficult year;Wall Street stocks trade with little direction, after Fed leaves interest rates unchanged;Caterpillar, the US heavy machinery maker, warned of another difficult year ahead as it reported a fourth-quarter loss.For the fourth quarter of 2015, Caterpillar lost $87m, or $0.15 a share, but excluding restructuring costs, it earned $0.74 a share, higher than analysts’ expectations of $0.69 a share. That boosted the company’s stock price by 4.7 per cent to $61.08.The collapse in global commodity prices and slowdown in China has weighed on the company, and Caterpillar said it “does not anticipate improvement in world economic growth or commodity prices” this year.In an interview on CNBC, chief executive Douglas Oberhelman said: “2016 is going to be rough and challenging again.”The world’s largest mining and construction equipment manufacturer by sales now expects revenues to be in a range of $40bn to $44bn in 2016, a drop from the $47bn recorded in 2015. Sales fell by a fifth compared with a year ago to $11bn. The company said a steeper than expected drop in oil and the strong dollar wiped about $3bn from sales in 2015.Shares in Canadian miner and fertiliser companyPotashCorp slipped in New York trading after it cut its quarterly dividends by a third, after fourth-quarter earnings halved compared with the previous year.The market for fertilisers is strongly linked to global growth and prices weakened towards the end of 2015. Jochen Tilk, chief executive, said there was a “more cautious outlook” in 2016.This month PotashCorp — which last year was interested in bidding for German rival K+S and was itself once a target for BHP Billiton in the heady days of the past decade’s mining boom — shuttered one of its Canadian mines.Fourth-quarter earnings were $201m, or 24 cents a share, compared with $407m, or 49 cents a share, a year ago. Full-year earnings will be 90 cents to $1.20 a share, PotashCorp said, lower than analysts’ estimates of $1.32 a share.Facebook shares jumped 15.5 per cent after the largest social networking site delivered a blistering quarter of revenue growth that showed a re-acceleration in revenue growth.Its best one-day performance since going public in 2012, Facebook’s market value climbed to $311bn on Thursday, making it the sixth largest company in the world by market capitalisation.A near-52 per cent jump in fourth-quarter revenue, driven largely by mobile advertising, and a 17 per cent rise in daily active users rekindled enthusiasm for a company whose shares have fallen in recent weeks.Brian Pitz, analyst at Jefferies, said the 2015 holiday season was a “watershed moment” for mobile ads. “FB has built a remarkable ad platform that enables marketers of all stripes to serve targeted ads to nearly every consumer on the planet,” he said.Elsewhere, Artisan Partners, a shareholder in Johnson & Johnson, has stepped up its pressure on the world’s largest healthcare company, by sending an open letter to its management and directors calling for a break-up of the group.The letter was sent and published a day after the Financial Times reported that Artisan was sounding out activist investors about taking a stake in the group and pushing for a radical shake-up of the $280bn company.Shares in J&J climbed 1 per cent on Wednesday and rose 0.1 per cent on Thursday.Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher a day after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in a widely anticipated move on Wednesday.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,893.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent at 16,069.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent at 4,506.68.
52;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Whole Foods downgraded on sales concerns;Texas-based grocer faces increasing competition from discounters;Whole Foods was among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 after analysts at BMO downgraded the upscale grocer chain, citing concerns that same-store sales will not pick up this year.Shares in Whole Foods had fallen 5.16 per cent to $28.85 by the close, after analysts at BMO downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “market perform” and lowered the price target to $23 from $26. The company now has just three “buy” ratings, 23 “hold” ratings and four “sell” ratings, according to Bloomberg data.Same-store sales, a key industry metric, slowed for three consecutive quarters and turned negative last quarter. Sales were hurt last year after the Department of Consumer Affairs said the grocer “routinely overstated the weights of its pre-packaged products”, which resulted in consumers being overcharged.The Texas-based company has also faced increasing competition from grocers that offer healthy foods at cheaper prices.Analysts said their survey indicated that the grocer’s price perception among consumers had not improved despite recent efforts.“We see risk that [comparable sales] may not reaccelerate in 2016 (despite easier comparisons) absent more aggressive pricing actions, which in our view suggests potential for greater-than-expected gross margin pressure,” Kelly Bania, an analyst at BMO said.She added that Whole Foods could expect to keep higher prices in certain categories as it communicates that it has higher quality standards. The main risk to this was indicated in a recent survey, however, that showed the reason people shopped at the grocer less frequently was because of cheaper offerings at other stores.Shares in Whole Foods fell nearly 34 per cent last year.Caterpillar, the US manufacturer that rode the commodities boom as the mining industry snapped up its trucks and diggers, was falling out of favour.Analysts at Goldman Sachs became the latest to cut their recommendation on the shares to “sell” from “neutral”, warning of further retrenchment by Caterpillar’s customers in the mining industry. The move helped send Caterpillar shares 5.03 per cent lower.“Given the significant supply build-out in the current cycle, our in-house view remains for an extended multiyear commodity deflation cycle that could be similar to that of the 1980s and 1990s, which we believe will drive a challenging backdrop for CAT earnings growth and relative performance,” said analyst Jerry Revich.News of a management shake-up at Twitter was not well received by investors. Shares in the social-media site fell 4.60 per cent to $17.02 a day after chief executive Jack Dorsey announced that four senior executives were leaving the company and that Twitter would appoint two new board members.A renewed sell-off in crude saw US stocks begin the week on the backfoot, with the energy and materials sectors once again battling for the title of the worst performing sector on the benchmark S&P 500.Shares in DR Horton fell 4.73 per cent to $26.40, after the largest US homebuilder by market capitalisation reported a slowdown in home orders in its fiscal first quarter.The Texas-based company said sales orders climbed 9 per cent in the three months ended in December, compared with 35 per cent in the year ago period.By the close, the S&P 500 had declined 1.56 per cent to 1,877.38, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.3 per cent to 15,890.08, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent to 4,518.25.
53;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2016-01-23T00:07:15Z;Oil rally drives strong rebound in US stocks;S&P 500 ends up after a bruising start to the week for investors;US stocks rebounded on Friday to deliver their first weekly gain in 2016, providing welcome relief to investors after a bruising start to the year.Equities took their cue from the price of oil which rallied on Friday and has led the stock market so far this year. Buying in the US also followed gains in markets elsewhere amid indications of more central bank support in Europe.“The correlation to oil is still intact and that gave people a little confidence today,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. “It has been a horrific start to the year. A bit of a relief rally or stabilisation was not unexpected.”A 2 per cent gain on Friday left the S&P 500 up 1.4 per cent on the week, as 355 stocks on the benchmark index advanced. Even with the rally over the last two days, investors have still lost 7 per cent in US stocks in 2016, among the worst starts to a year in history.Sentiment turned in part because of dovish comments on Thursday from Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, which many in the markets viewed as signalling that further stimulus measures could be unveiled in March.Investors are now looking to next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve for any clues on a change in rate expectations.The slide in equity markets and strengthening of the US dollar have rapidly unravelled investor expectations that the Fed will be able to lift rates four times this year, as the central bank seeks to normalise policy. Instead, traders put the odds on just one rate rise this year.Despite the risk-on tone at week’s end, investors and strategists were reluctant to say the equity market had hit a bottom in part because the concerns that prompted selling remain.Concern about the implications of an economic slowdown in China for the rest of the world has fuelled global stock selling.Since hitting a 12-year low at midweek, crude has jumped by more than 18 per cent as hedge funds unwound bearish bets, buying back futures. The Brent oil benchmark rose 10 per cent Friday to settle at $32.18, after hitting a 12-year low of $27.10 a barrel on Wednesday, but a worldwide crude glut remains.Economists with JPMorgan warned on Friday that the risk of recession in the US over the next year was more than a fifth — above the historical average — as a number of high frequency economic indicators drag.
54;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2015-12-15T17:14:18Z;US industrial heartland frets as Fed rate rise looms;Strong dollar and commodity price collapse have some talking of an industrial recession;If the Federal Reserve proceeds as expected and raises US interest rates for the first time in almost a decade on Wednesday it will be an affirmation of what Janet Yellen and her fellow policymakers see as the strength of the US recovery.It will also be at odds with what many in the US’s industrial economy are seeing.From manufacturing behemoths like Caterpillar and Deere & Co to companies supplying the industrial sector the common theme in recent months has been that, thanks to a strong dollar and a collapse in commodity prices, tough times are back. Some are going so far as to declare the arrival of an industrial recession.While the Fed appears unlikely to let that stop its well-flagged move to raise rates for the first time since 2006 there are signs that concerns about the dollar and the industrial economy are likely to influence what it does after that.“It is something that makes us more cautious in terms of raising rates,” Ms Yellen, the Fed chair, said earlier this month of the strong dollar and its drag on the economy.The messages emerging from the US industrial heartland remain pretty stark.At WW Grainger, an Illinois-based industrial supply company which sells everything from lightbulbs to electric motors and safety gear, sales in the US are down 5 per cent on last year with government purchases the only segment offering any growth. The company has been warning investors for months that it is facing a “tough industrial economy” which may last into 2016.At Fastenal, which similarly relies on supplying the industrial sector, management has gone a step further. “The industrial environment is in a recession,” Fastenal’s chief financial officer told analysts on an October conference call.It is a really tough time here now. In many of our markets we are back to 2009 levels again, which is a story you are not really reading aboutFor Cummins, the diesel engine maker, a collapse in US demand for trucks has added to the woes it was already facing from the slowdown in big emerging economies such as Brazil and China and forced lay-offs.“It is a really tough time here now,” Tom Linebarger, Cummins’ CEO, said in a recent interview. “In many of our markets we are back to 2009 levels again, which is a story you are not really reading about.”Those sorts of anecdotes translate into a broader view across US manufacturing that the Fed may be pulling the trigger too early if it raises rates now.In a recent survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, 55 per cent of companies still considered the US economy too weak to raise rates before 2016. Less than a third thought the time was right.“There clearly is a sense that this [a Fed hike] is going to happen,” said Chad Moutray, NAM’s chief economist. “But there still is a lot of nervousness out there about what that means.”Much of the focus in the lead-up to the Fed move has been on strong employment numbers — where the big growth has been in professional and other services — and inflation that is creeping back up towards the Fed’s 2 per cent target rate.But the data on America’s industrial sector have been far less encouraging. Industrial production, new figures for which will be released on Wednesday, has contracted in three of the last six months while the Institute of Supply Management’s latest monthly survey of factory orders pointed to a US manufacturing contraction.Behind those figures are the strong dollar and falling US exports which saw US companies export $15bn less in October than at their all-time high in July 2014.Jason Furman, chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, predicted on Tuesday that net exports would “continue to be a headwind” in 2016. “It is more likely to be taking something off our growth rate rather than adding to it.”While the Fed has traditionally shied away from talking about the dollar, Ms Yellen and other senior Fed officials have been increasingly willing to acknowledge the importance of foreign exchange movements explicitly.Stanley Fischer, vice-chair of the Fed’s board of governors, has dubbed the dollar upsurge since the summer of 2014 a “sizeable shock”. Lael Brainard, another Fed governor, said this month it would take a 1 percentage point cut in the federal funds rate to insulate US employment from the effects of a 15 per cent strengthening in the inflation-adjusted exchange rate. Given rates were already near zero, this implied delayed lift-off and a shallower path of future hikes, she added.The comforting fact for the US economy may be that its industrial sector and exports are now less important than they were. Manufacturing makes up only 12 per cent of US gross domestic product. Exports of goods and services represented 13 per cent of GDP in 2014, a far smaller share of output than in other OECD countries such as Germany.Still, the woes of US manufacturers are real and will weigh on Fed policymakers’ minds.Kevin Logan, an economist at HSBC, argues the impact of the strong dollar is likely to be a more cautious path forward for the central bank. US GDP has risen by 2.2 per cent over the past four quarters. But, if the drag from the decline in net exports were stripped out, it would instead have expanded by 2.9 per cent, he estimates.“It suggests to me that the Fed is not going to be very aggressive in the coming year,” he said.
55;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Caterpillar warns lower Chinese demand will limit sales;Beijing efforts to rebalance economy set to put ceiling on construction equipment sales;"Caterpillar, the world’s largest mining and construction equipment manufacturer by sales, has warned that it does not expect Chinese demand for excavators to recover to the peaks of 2010-12.Tom Pellette, group president for construction industry equipment, made the remarks as the Chinese economy recorded its slowest growth rate since 2009 in the third quarter, due to declining construction and factory activity, which many economists do not believe has bottomed out yet.The forecasts also highlight Beijing’s efforts to rebalance the economy away from its traditional drivers such as manufacturing and investment and towards consumer spending. It also demonstrates the impact of the stimulus programme, which the government unleashed during the global financial crisis, had on demand.Mr Pellette said industry-wide sales of hydraulic excavators between 10-90 tonnes, will reach the “23,000 range” in China this year. That compares with a total of more than 27,000 sold in March alone in 2011 and more than 112,000 for the whole of 2010, which was the peak year for the market. The company does not disclose figures for sales of its own products by country.“That shows how far off the peak we are,” Mr Pellette told the Financial Times in an interview. “My expectation is within China and globally that the market will pick up to a level above where we are in 2015. But for China specifically, our expectation is that the market will rebound but we are not planning [for it to] get back to 2011/2012 levels.”Despite the immediate headwinds, Mr Pellette is optimistic about the long-term future for the company’s business in the world’s second-largest economy in part because the urbanisation of the country has some way to go. Caterpillar also cited the government’s plan to double both the gross domestic product and income base between 2010 and 2020.“There is still fantastic growth and that will drive a strong need for our products’ services, but just not at the level seen in 2011 and 2012,” Mr Pellette said, adding that some of that demand will also come as China becomes “more and more involved in the global economy” with investments in places such as Africa and Latin America.The US-based group with its distinctive bright yellow machines is often dubbed a global bellwether, with its sales giving investors insights into the state of economies from China to Brazil. Last month’s decision to lay off more than 10,000 people and further slash costs highlighted uncertainty around the world. The company has not disclosed the extent to which its cost reduction and job cutting programme will affect its Chinese operations.Tumbling oil prices — in part due to declining Chinese demand as well as high levels of production — has forced energy majors to slash capital investment. Caterpillar’s moves to expand its existing cost-cutting programme last month suggested that a revival in global demand was going to take some time.In the shorter term in China, Mr Pellette said: “We haven’t seen a big turn in terms of improvement on the ground yet; it’s still a struggling market place with some signs of hope with the optimistic among us.”One glimmer on the more immediate horizon is China’s introduction next year of European-style emission standards for non-road engines, such as Caterpillar’s excavators, said Qihua Chen, Caterpillar’s country manager for China. The group said it is the first engine manufacturer to receive Chinese certification from the environment ministry for larger engines.Mr Chen said that he was “absolutely” already seeing demand for these types of non-road vehicles, but as owners of existing vehicles are not required to replace their machines, demand is not expected to surge."

On a per-share basis, profits came in at $1.24, missing Wall Street’s estimates of $1.31.Revenues fell 1 per cent to $8.19bn, below estimates of $8.31bn. The company said the figure would have been up 3 per cent if not for the impact of foreign exchange rates.“While overall results were in line with our 2015 financial outlook, the quarter reflected the headwinds and challenges that we have been dealing with throughout this year,” said Kenneth Chenault, chief executive.American Express has been working on increasing marketing, incentives and technology because its lucrative arrangement with wholesale club Costco is set to end in the US next year.Net income in the US card services segment, its biggest, dropped 11 per cent from the same period in 2014 even as revenues rose 5 per cent.The increase in revenues was helped by rising spending among card members, which could come as good news ahead of the key holiday shopping season.Caterpillar delivered more bad news to investors, cutting its profit forecast just one month after it shocked the market when it sharply revised down its sales and revenue guidance and announced 10,000 job cuts.The maker of trucks and diggers used by the mining and construction industries forecast earnings a share this year to be about $3.70, or $4.60 excluding restructuring cost.That is a big fall from its previous forecast of $4.70, or $5.00 excluding restructuring costs.Its shares, which have fallen 23 per cent this year, rose 2.9 per cent on Thursday.Caterpillar, which generates 60 per cent of its pre-tax profit from outside the US, has been hit hard by the slowdown in emerging market economies.It reduced its 2015 sales forecast last month by another $1bn to $48bn and said it expected revenue to decline an additional 5 per cent in 2016, marking a fourth straight year of decreases — a first in its 90-year history.Markets cheered after 3M announced a restructuring plan. The large US manufacturer is cutting 1,500 jobs as its sales fell last quarter and profits stagnated. 3M shares rose 4.1 per cent to $156.The company, whose products include Scotch tape, Post-it notes and Band-Aids, said positions would go in the US, Europe and Latin America.It also reported that its sales dropped 5.2 per cent in the third quarter to $7.7bn, while profits were little changed at $1.3bn.Dow Chemical investors feasted on a blast of encouraging news that sent company’s shares up as much as 8 per cent at one point.The company, which last year faced pressure from activist investor Third Point to split in two, said it was examining options for its agrosciences division, a $7.3bn business that makes insecticides and herbicides.Alongside the potential sale of the division, Dow added it was scaling back investment in a Kuwaiti joint venture.It also lifted its dividend, which left the stock up 5.3 per cent at $50 by markets close in New York. Before Thursday’s bounce, they had climbed 4 per cent for the year.The stock market rallied on Wall Street amid a flurry of corporate earnings and a European Central Bank meeting that stoked hopes for more stimulus.The S&P 500 index was up 1.7 per cent to 2,052.51, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.9 per cent to 17,489.16 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.7 per cent to 4,920.05.

In response, energy and mining companies have cut capital expenditure and focused on returning cash to shareholders, weighing on demand for equipment.Stockpiles of major food commodities have depressed some crop prices and hurt demand for agricultural equipment.Analysts at Goldman Sachs are cautious on the sector and have warned that, while the oil and gas sector accounts for 4 per cent of machinery sales, there is “similar excess supply and high capital stock across mined and soft commodities,” which accounts for about 32 per cent of machinery sales.Machinery stocks are also exposed to a possible decline in demand from commodity exporting countries. Aside from Caterpillar, shares of Joy Global fell 1 per cent to $15.59 and shares in Terex Corporation fell more than 5 per cent to $16.83.Twitter shares fell 0.7 per cent to $26.60* after analysts at Citi warned over optimistic Wall Street’s forecasts for how much US advertising the company would generate next year.They said the consensus forecast was too high considering a combination of slowing user growth and heavy volume of ads in Twitter feeds in the US.

58;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2015-09-24T16:40:22Z;Caterpillar sends warning on global demand;Industrial bellwether says 10,000 jobs at risk from emerging market slowdown;Caterpillar has sent a sharp warning on the outlook for global industrial demand as the bellwether for economies from China to Brazil said it could slash more than 10,000 jobs and expected 2016 to mark an unprecedented fourth year of falling sales.The announcement, which sent the US group’s shares tumbling 6.5 per cent by midday and weighed on the S&P 500 index, comes as concerns over a slowdown in China and other emerging markets ripple through global markets.Orders for Caterpillar’s bright yellow equipment are seen as a prime indicator of the health of the global mining, energy and construction industries. Mining and energy have been hard hit by sharp falls in the price of oil and other commodities, and construction revenues have fallen from North America to Asia.Caterpillar generates 60 per cent of its pre-tax profit from outside the US, and slowing emerging markets had already forced it to cut 31,000 jobs and close or consolidate more than 20 manufacturing facilities since 2012. In its latest warning, it singled out that “the most significant decline” in its revenue forecasts for next year stemmed from its oil and gas business.On Thursday, the Illinois-based group cut its 2015 sales forecast by another $1bn to $48bn and said it expected revenue to decline an additional 5 per cent in 2016, marking a fourth straight year of decreases — a first in its 90 year history.It announced plans to cut annual costs across the group by $1.5bn, with 4,000-5,000 job losses by the end of 2016, and a possible cut of more than 10,000 jobs by 2018. As of June 30, Caterpillar had 126,800 employees.Other savings will come from closing or consolidating plants representing about 10 per cent of its manufacturing footprint. The measures will cost Caterpillar about $2bn.The lowered revenue outlook and need for further cuts suggests that the slowdown in many economies has yet to reach its nadir, analysts said.“Much of the strength in profits across multinationals in recent years was driven by gains abroad. [It’s] tough to make the same kind of profits unless we get a major offset from our own back yard or in the developed world,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. “That is a large hole to fill and will take time.”Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive, said it was “facing a convergence of challenging marketplace conditions in key regions and industry sectors — namely in mining and energy.” Caterpillar remained committed to industries such as mining, oil and gas, construction and rail, he said, but “we have to manage through what can be considerable and sometimes prolonged downturns”.Much of the strength in profits across multinationals in recent years was driven by gains abroad. That is a large hole to fill and will take time.Caterpillar’s shares fell 6.5 per cent to $65.63 by midday, bringing their year to date fall to 28 per cent, compared with the S&P 500’s 6.9 per cent decline.Rivals such as Komatsu of Japan are also suffering from the slowdown. Demand in China for the Japanese company’s largest hydraulic excavators, for example, has dropped by about 50 per cent or more every month between January and July, the latest month for which it has disclosed figures.Other suppliers to the oil and gas industry have cut tens of thousands of jobs amid falling revenues, while United Technologies, which sells Otis lifts to China, has cut its earnings outlook.Despite the bleak macroeconomic environment, Caterpillar said that its earlier cost savings programme, which cut more than 8m square feet of manufacturing space, had helped drive gross margins to their best level in two decades. It had increased its market share in some products, it added.Additional reporting by Ed Crooks in New York
59;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Caterpillar reverses on commodity worries;US stocks slide after jobs report leaves room for Fed to raise rates;Caterpillar shares slid on Friday after analysts at Baird grew gloomier on the company’s outlook as commodities remain under pressure amid China-driven volatility.They downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “outperform” and lowered their price target to $77 from $89.The bank took a more optimistic view on the stock earlier this year on “signs of stabilisation in key commodity categories” but argued on Thursday that their bull thesis was losing ground amid increasing turmoil in China.Those concerns “resulted in another leg down for commodities as questions surrounding demand added to excess supply concerns,” said Mircea Dobre, an analyst at Baird.A deterioration in mining, continued pressure on oil and gas prices and softening demand for construction equipment have made it challenging for bookings to rebound in the near term, according to Mr Dobre.Caterpillar derived 95 per cent of its 2014 revenue from sales of machinery and power systems.Mr Dobre pointed to recent comments from mining equipment maker Joy Global, saying the company confirmed further deterioration in the commodity space.On Thursday, Joy Global lowered its full-year outlook citing the rout in global commodities and slowing global growth.“Against this backdrop, upside from the resources business appears increasingly unlikely, while peer original equipment manufacturer commentary and results are suggesting that fundamentals can actually get worse rather than better in the near term (a combination of volume declines and price compression),” Mr Dobre said.Shares of Caterpillar, which have declined 20 per cent so far this year, fell nearly 2 per cent to $73.10.Gap shares declined 1.8 per cent to $32.41, after the retailer said same-store sales, a key industry metric, declined 2 per cent in August. This was worse than expectations for a 0.4 per cent drop.A breakdown of the retailer’s divisions showed that comparable sales were worse than expected at the Banana Republic and Gap brands, declining 11 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. Analysts had forecast a fall of 2.2 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively.Old Navy, however, topped forecasts with same-store sales rising 6 per cent last month.Shares of Vince Holdings, an upscale New York-based retailer with an urban aesthetic, fell 44 per cent to $5.22 after the company cut its full-year forecast.Vince now expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of 31 to 37 cents a share, below its previous outlook for 85 to 90 cents a share.For the year, the company projects sales in the range of $285m to $295m, lower than its previous guidance in the range of $340m to $350m. This missed expectations for $342.4m.The news came alongside a second-quarter loss of 14 cents a share, while sales fell 10 per cent to $80m, worse than analysts’ forecasts.Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported a profit of 14 cents a share, also shy of analysts’ estimates.BP shares fell more than 5 per cent to $30.70 in New York after analysts at Bank of America downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “neutral”.US stocks slid after the August jobs report left room for the Federal Reserve to raise rates this year.The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,921.22 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 16,102.38.

60;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2015-07-30T18:23:38Z;Corporate giants sound profits alarm over China slowdown;Large companies revise sales targets amid weaker growth and stock market turbulence;Some of the world’s largest companies have sounded the alarm about the slowdown in the Chinese economy, warning that weaker growth would hit profits in the second half of the year.Car companies such as PSA Peugeot Citroën, Audi and Ford have slashed growth forecasts while industrial goods groups such as Caterpillar and Siemens have all spoken out on the negative impact of China.The warnings are a sign that China’s weaker growth and its stock market rout this month are creating a headache for global corporates that have long relied heavily on the world’s second-largest economy to drive revenues.Audi and France’s Renault both cited China as they cut their global sales targets on Thursday, with Christian Klingler, sales chief at Audi parent Volkswagen, predicting “a bumpy road” in the country this year.Peugeot slashed its growth forecast for China from 7 per cent to 3 per cent while earlier this week Ford predicted the first full-year sales fall for the Chinese car market since 1990.US companies have also been affected. “In Asia, the China market has clearly slowed,” said Akhil Johri, chief financial officer at United Technologies, the US industrial group at the company’s earnings call last week. “Real estate investment, new construction starts and floor space sold are all under pressure.”“Companies thought that China was the land of opportunity, but it’s not living up to that promise,” says Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Euler Hermes. “They realise the business environment is changing for the worse.”China’s slowdown, which follows years of extraordinary growth, has been particularly startling in recent months, with figures last week showing that the country’s factory activity contracted by the most in 15 months in July.The poor figures coincide with a time of turbulence on the Chinese stock market. The Shanghai Composite shed 8.5 per cent on Monday, its steepest drop since 2007.The fall came despite a string of interventions by Beijing to stem the slide in equities, including a ban on short selling and an interest-rate cut.In quarterly reporting season, effect of a slowing China has been a prevailing topic with companies, write Nicole Bullock and Eric Platt.Continue readingIn the consumer goods sector, brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Thursday that volumes fell 6.5 per cent in China as a result of “poor weather across the country and economic headwinds”.Among industrial goods companies, Schneider Electric, one of the world’s largest electrical equipment makers, reported a 12 per cent fall in first-half profit and cut guidance because of “weak construction and industrial markets” in China.Jean-Pascal Tricoire, chief executive, said there was “persistent weakness in China” which showed little sign of going away soon.Siemens, the German industrial giant, on Thursday said sales in China fell 8 per cent in the quarter and Chinese new orders slid 2 per cent when adjusted for currency swings.“Does China stabilise? That’s probably the billion-dollar question,” said Joe Kaeser, Siemens chief executive.David Finch, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: “Companies are starting to understand that the slowdown is part of a structural adjustment to a less growth-intensive model rather than just a cyclical downturn.”“That said, the government is doing its best to smooth the impact and we expect further interest rate cuts and liquidity injections this year,” he added.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock in New York and Catherine Bennett in Paris
61;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
62;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2015-07-23T13:12:00Z;Caterpillar cuts forecast on gloomy global outlook;A strong US dollar compounds the impact of weakness in China and Brazil;Caterpillar cut its full-year forecast as the strong US dollar compounded continuing weakness in China and Brazil, along with uncertainty in Europe.Having a global view is proving painful for Caterpillar, the US company that enjoyed the boom in mining and rapid growth in emerging market economies.Alongside its second-quarter results, Caterpillar, which is headquartered in Peoria, Illinois, offered a downbeat assessment: “While economic conditions in the United States are modestly positive, the global economy remains relatively stagnant. Many of the key industries we serve remain weak, and we haven’t seen sustained signs of improvement.“Continuing economic weakness in China and Brazil, as well as uncertainty in the eurozone and over Greece, haven’t helped confidence.”That gloom, along with the stronger dollar, prompted the company, which makes a range of trucks and diggers used in mining and construction, to cut its full-year sales forecast to $49bn from an earlier prediction of $50bn.The 50 per cent drop in crude prices in the past year, along with declines in copper, coal and iron ore has squeezed demand for Caterpillar’s engine sales and equipment used in energy construction sites.The US is the one bright spot for the company. Caterpillar made nearly 44 per cent of its revenue from North America last year.The 2015 earnings guidance was unchanged in a range of $4.70 to $5 a share.In Latin America machine sales fell 50 per cent. The region accounted for nearly 12 per cent of the company’s overall sales in 2014.For the quarter as a whole, Caterpillar made $1.27 a share, modestly ahead of analysts’ expectations for $1.26 a share. Shares of Caterpillar, which have declined 30 per cent in the past year, fell 3.6 per cent to $76.88 by close of trading in New York.
63;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2015-04-26T14:54:59Z;Apple set to be latest to suffer dollar impact;Currency strength set to wipe more than $2bn from quarterly sales;A surge in the US dollar has already wiped more than $20bn from first quarter sales at the largest US companies, a sum larger than revenues generated by Intel, Caterpillar or Goldman Sachs in the first three months of the year, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.With the US earnings season approaching the halfway stage, that figure is likely to jump further. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, reports results on Monday and warned in January that the currency move could slice more than $2bn from quarterly revenues.So far during the current reporting period, General Motors, IBM, Procter & Gamble, Amazon and Johnson & Johnson have experienced $1bn-plus haircuts on sales as they translated revenues earned abroad back into US dollar terms.Known as “top-line growth”, revenues reflect how quickly a business is growing. In recent years, large multinational US company’s sales have benefited from the combination of a weaker dollar and robust expansion across emerging market economies.However, a sustained rise in the dollar since last summer and weakening global activity has weighed heavily on a host of blue-chip US companies.While 71 per cent of S&P 500 companies have eclipsed first-quarter earnings expectations, 55 per cent of corporates have failed to beat revenue forecasts, according to S&P Capital IQ.“Top-line growth is incredibly challenged. The dollar is even a bigger problem than people thought,’’ said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG.However, US equities indices have reclaimed record territory, with investors cheered by overall earnings topping lowered expectations of analysts. The S&P 500 closed last week at a new peak of 2,117.69, while the Nasdaq has surpassed the dotcom bubble high set in 2000.“While earnings are not great, they’re better than expected,’’ said Mr Greenhaus.The analysis of earnings statements, slide presentations, conference calls and executive commentary spanned more than 100 of the roughly 190 S&P 500 constituents that have reported first-quarter results.The FT analysis showed a $20.1bn reduction in sales, which would have lifted the groups’ reported revenues of $762bn by 2.6 per cent. When excluding financials, sales would have been more than 3 per cent higher. While the technology industry has been particularly exposed to the shift in the dollar — it generates more of its sales abroad than any other sector — a broad swath of companies have warned of the effects.$20.1bnReduction in sales of the more than 100 S&P 500 constituents that have reported so farMcDonald’s, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Tyco, Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, Caterpillar and PepsiCo were among the dozens that pointed to currency swings when delivering results.“Currency has been powerful headwind for all multinational companies,” said Dan Kelley, portfolio manager at Fidelity. “It is something companies are having to think differently about — what the implications are going forward and whether it makes sense to alter their cost structures.”Only half of the companies disclosed enough information to calculate the dollar’s effect on sales — itself a somewhat nebulous figure as executives must consider changes to underlying operations, volume of goods sold and divestitures or acquisitions along with foreign exchange swings.
64;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;US growth helps Caterpillar beat results forecasts;Lift in profit forecasts signals worst is over for mining and construction equipment maker;Resurgent demand for mining and construction equipment in North America has offset sales slumps in China and Latin America to help Caterpillar report better than expected first-quarter results.Shares in the company jumped as much as 4.5 per cent on Thursday in premarket trading after sales fell less than feared and the company lifted its profit forecast for the year.Caterpillar sales fell 4 per cent to $12.7bn during the first three months of the year. The market had been bracing for a decline to $12.3bn.Net profit rose 20 per cent to $1.1bn, or $1.81 a share, as the company continues to aggressively cut costs.The collapse in global crude oil prices over the past nine months has hit demand for Caterpillar’s products.However, in a sign that the worst is perhaps over, the company said first quarter sales in its energy and transportation unit, which accounts for more than a third of group revenue, have stopped falling and were flat at $4.7bn.North America was the sole bright spot with sales in all product groups in the region up during the quarter.By contrast, sales in Latin America, fell 23 per cent as the fallout from the Petrobras corruption scandal paralysed large swath of the Brazilian economy.In Asia, sales fell 21 per cent amid slowing China growth and the currency headwind from the weaker yen.Although the company said the outlook for the year remains challenging, it expects earnings per share to be $4.70, or $5 per share excluding restructuring costs this year amid tighter cost controlThe previous outlook was for earnings of $4.60 per share, or $4.75 excluding restructuring costs.After sliding from a peak last year of more than $111, the shares closed 1 per cent lower at $84.79 in New York trading.
65;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2015-01-27T17:34:03Z;Oil price fall cuts Caterpillar outlook;Falling oil price could lead to first three-year revenue fall since the Great Depression;The steep drop in oil prices will help cut Caterpillar’s earnings by more than 20 per cent this year, the world’s largest maker of heavy equipment warned on Tuesday, as a prolonged mining slowdown and weak global economic growth continue to plague its profits.The forecast, coupled with a 25 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, sent Caterpillar’s shares down more than 7 per cent at $79.85 by the close of New York trading.The company said lower oil prices would hit its construction segment and its energy and transportation business, which provide equipment, engines and turbines for drilling and well services in oil producing regions. If 2015 sales fall as forecast, it would be the first time since the Great Depression that Caterpillar has experienced three consecutive years of falling revenues.“The recent dramatic decline in the price of oil is the most significant reason for the year-over-year decline in our sales and revenues outlook,” said Doug Oberhelman, chief executive.The slide in crude prices could cause oil companies to slash capital spending by 20 per cent, or $28bn, by 2017 from last year, Morgan Stanley analysts estimate.Caterpillar said it expected world economic growth to “only improve modestly in 2015”, with continued weakness in copper, coal and iron ore prices further hitting its struggling mining business.Mr Oberhelman said the strong US dollar, which he expected to continue rising, would hurt US manufacturers, though Caterpillar’s global production footprint would help offset the impact.The group now expects 2015 earnings of $4.75 a share, excluding restructuring costs, far below Wall Street’s $6.67 consensus forecast. The company lowered its 2015 sales forecast to $50bn, down about 10 per cent from 2014.The Illinois-based company has slashed thousands of jobs and slowed production in response to a slowdown in spending by mining companies, which has cut into sales for about two years.Weakness in mining and construction sales were partially offset in the fourth quarter by strength in Caterpillar’s energy and transport equipment division. Sales in that segment rose 11 per cent, to $6.2bn, while construction equipment sales slipped 9 per cent to $4.4bn and mining equipment sales fell 10 per cent to $2.4bn.On Monday, the company reported that retail machine sales had fallen 12 per cent in the three months to December, driven by weakness in mining, which fell 22 per cent. Sales to the construction industry fell 9 per cent, but rose 5 per cent in North America, in a sign of the nascent US housing recovery.Fourth-quarter earnings fell from $1bn, or $1.54 a share, to $757m, or $1.23 a share. Sales for the three months to December were down 1 per cent to $14.2bn.Excluding restructuring costs, the company reported earnings of $1.35 a share. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.55 a share on $14.18bn in revenues.
66;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Caterpillar falls on downgrade due to oil and gas exposure;Exposure to oil price accounts for about 12% of company’s revenues;Caterpillar was among the worst-performing stocks on the US benchmark on Monday, after JPMorgan analysts downgraded the mining and construction equipment maker for its exposure to oil and gas.Analysts at JPMorgan cut Caterpillar to “underweight” from “neutral” and lowered their price target to $80 from $95.At a time when the price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has fallen more than 50 per cent since mid-June last year, Ann Duignan, an analyst at JPMorgan, said Caterpillar’s direct exposure to oil and gas through services and products used in exploration and production accounts for about $6.5bn, or 12 per cent, of its total revenues.The company also has indirect exposure to mining, US construction and emerging markets where growth is expected to be pressured by lower oil prices. North American construction accounts for about 17 per cent of Caterpillar’s revenues, and of that Ms Duignan estimates 5 per cent “may be leverage to oil and gas states”. Canadian Oil Sands, which is also expected to experience a slowdown in demand, represents about 3 per cent of total revenue.“Overall, Caterpillar’s combined indirect exposure may be as much as 15 per cent of its revenues — implying that upwards of 30 per cent of its total revenue may come under increasing pressure in 2015-16,” said Ms Duignan. The stronger dollar is another factor that could hurt Caterpillar’s competitiveness.Shares of Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $87.03 and are down nearly 21 per cent in the past six months.Shares of Isis Pharmaceuticals gained nearly 11 per cent to $69.19, after the company announced a collaboration with Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, to develop drugs to treat autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Isis will get $35m in upfront payments and an additional $800m in licence fees. Isis will also receive tiered royalties.Shares of drugmaker Biogen Idec declined 1 per cent to $337.77 after analysts at Nomura downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy” and lowered their price target to $378 from $407. M Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura, lowered his sales estimates of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, following slower US sales growth based on data from IMS, which tracks drug prescriptions and sales.Mr Somaiya lowered his US multiple sclerosis drug sales estimates for Biogen by 3 per cent in 2015 to $6.3bn and by 4 per cent to $9.8bn in 2020.The S&P 500 was dragged lower by the energy sector, which fell 4 per cent, as the price of Brent crude fell more than 6 per cent to $52.90. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, fell to fresh five-and-a-half year lows, below the $50 a barrel mark. Diamond Offshore Drilling, down 9 per cent to $33.99, Denbury Resources, down 8 per cent to $7.30, and Noble Energy, down 10 per cent to $42.39, were the worst-performing energy stocks on the US benchmark.The S&P 500 slid 1.8 per cent to 2,020.58, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9 per cent to 17,501.65. The Nasdaq Composite eased 1.6 per cent to 4,652.57.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

Revenues climbed 67 per cent to $102.5m in the period.The company lowered its fourth quarter sales guidance from $109m-$111m to $107m-$108m, below estimates for $111m.“When companies lower their guidance with little explanation or acknowledgment – guidance implies material deceleration in a key revenue segment – it’s tempting to shoot first (downgrade) and ask questions later,” Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said. “But we believe our long thesis is still intact.”Unique visitors increased 19 per cent from a quarter earlier to 139m, slower than the 24 per cent rise recorded in the previous quarter and below expectations from at least three investment banks.Yelp’s average monthly mobile unique visitors grew 46 per cent to 73m, slower than the 51 per cent growth in mobile users in the previous quarter.“At the highest level, we view the slowing visitor growth as the most worrisome metric,” Tom White, an analyst at Macquarie, said.Yelp shares fell 19 per cent to $57.17 and are down 17 per cent this year.Shares of Dr Pepper climbed 2 per cent to $66.95, after the company beat earnings expectations and raised full-year earnings guidance during a challenging time for soda makers.The beverage maker reported net income of $188m, or 96 cents a share, on revenue of $1.58bn.This was ahead of analysts’ estimates of 88 cents a share, on sales of $1.54bn.The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast to $3.56 to $3.62 a share, up from its previous forecast of $3.43 to $3.51.Tractor Supply was a leader on the S&P 500 as its shares advanced 16 per cent to $71, after third-quarter earnings and sales comfortably beat expectations.The US retail farm store chain reported net income of $76.6m, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $1.36bn, beating expectations for 51 cents a share on sales of $1.32bn.The company also raised 2014 sales and earnings per share outlook to the high end of the previously provided ranges.“[The] third quarter marked Tractor Supply’s 26th consecutive quarter of positive traffic growth, highlighting one of the things that makes this growth story so unique: consistency as a needs-based retailer, particularly amid a volatile retail backdrop,” Gary Balter, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said.Shares of 3M Co, maker of Post-it notes, climbed 4 per cent to $145.05 after the company reported a 6 per cent rise in third-quarter profits.Caterpillar shares gained 5 per cent to $99.27 after the company beat third-quarter earnings.The company also raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $6.50 a share, excluding $450m in restructuring costs, compared with the previous forecast for $6.20.Strong blue-chip earnings helped lift US stocks after Wednesday’s sell-off.The S&P 500 gained 1.2 per cent to 1,950.82.

68;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2014-10-23T16:48:36Z;Caterpillar upbeat on global growth prospects;Heavy equipment maker’s optimism based on change of tack in developed economies;Caterpillar said there was “a reasonable likelihood” that global growth could improve next year, as the world’s largest maker of heavy equipment raised its 2014 earnings forecast.The company said “growth-oriented monetary policies” of developed economies could support modest improvement, along with the potential for increased infrastructure investment in the US, India, Brazil and Turkey.The decision by some developing countries to raise interest rates to control inflation or protect exchange rates has constrained growth, but “we’ve seen the first monetary policy easing in the third quarter of 2014”, which could buoy growth, Caterpillar said.Despite “cautious optimism” about the prospect of growth, the company noted that uncertainties remain, including unrest in the former Soviet Union, Africa and the Middle East.“In addition, the Chinese government’s push for structural reform has slowed growth some and the ongoing uncertainty around the direction and timing of fiscal policy and monetary policy in the US could temper business confidence.”Mike DeWalt, head of investor relations, told analysts that there was “a lot of room” for Europe to improve “if they can ever get economic growth to kick back in”.The Illinois-based company raised its 2014 earnings forecast from $5.75 a share to $6.00 because of cost savings from its restructuring plan. It forecast $55bn in sales for the year – after lowering the range to $54bn-$56bn last quarter – and said sales would be flat to slightly up next year.Its shares were up more than 5 per cent in early New York trading.Caterpillar has cut thousands of jobs and slowed production as capital spending by mining companies slowed, hitting sales for around two years. The deep mining slump has been somewhat offset by a modest recovery in construction equipment sales, particularly in the US.Energy and transport equipment sales rose 13 per cent to $5.59bn as North American customers bought engines in advance of the implementation of new emissions standards. Construction equipment sales slipped 2 per cent to $4.47bn, while mining equipment sales fell 19 per cent to $2.17bn compared with a year earlier.The Asia-Pacific region and Latin America saw retail sales fall 11 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, but North American sales rose 11 per cent.Caterpillar reported earnings of $1.02bn, or $1.63 a share, compared with $946m, or $1.45 a share, in the same period last year. Sales rose 1 per cent to $13.55bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.36 a share on $13.19bn in revenues. Excluding restructuring costs the company reported earnings of $1.72 a share.
69;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Few US ‘reshorings’ go ahead, study finds;;"“Relatively few” of companies’ announced “reshorings” of manufacturing to the US have actually gone ahead and the trend’s effect on employment has been a “drop in the bucket,” research by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology academic suggests.The work, by Jim Rice, deputy director of MIT’s Center for Transportation and Logistics, throws into doubt expectations that the US economy might enjoy significant growth in manufacturing employment through job repatriation.However, Mr Rice told the Financial Times that some manufacturing had returned to the US as companies moved production from single large centres in China to smaller plants closer to the world’s main consumer countries.“If you look at the number of people they’re employing, it’s probably going to be a drop in the bucket when you compare it to overall employment,” Mr Rice said.The preliminary results of Mr Rice’s research – conducted with Francesco Stefanelli, a visiting researcher – suggested that many companies that had said they would repatriate jobs to the US had not actually done so.The research probed the reality behind announcements by about 50 companies – including General Electric, Apple, Whirlpool and Caterpillar – to be moving jobs back from overseas to the US.“In the majority of cases, the companies involved plan to invest in US-based production capacity; they have not actually made the move,” an article containing the findings reads. “The data indicate that there are relatively few published instances of reshoring.”Mr Rice did not say which companies had announced reshoring but not gone ahead, but an article on the early results says technology companies have been particularly prone to the practice.Even among reshoring projects that had gone ahead, Mr Rice said, some had produced only modest employment growth. One widely touted case – the return of some manufacturing of Wham-O Frisbees to California – had led to the setting up of a factory employing eight people.Among the highest-profile announced reshoring projects, GE in 2012 invested $1bn in moving some of its domestic appliance production for the US market back from Mexico and China to the US. Both Apple and Google have moved some electronics production back from Asia to the US.Mr Rice said some companies had moved production back to the US because of narrowing wage differentials with China and concerns over the security of long supply chains. However, he said that reflected an apparent trend away from concentrating manufacturing in one low labour-cost country and distributing it to centres worldwide to cut down on travel time and cost.“Transportation costs vary significantly by the type of product,” Mr Rice said. “If you’re talking about electronics, it’s going to be a different story from someone making furniture.”The researchers had also monitored for cases where US manufacturers moved more production to China from the US but were not yet able to say whether such moves were still under way and on what scale.“There’s always movement,” Mr Rice said. “It’s a sea change. The waves are going to keep coming, but we don’t know how big or how fast.”"
70;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Caterpillar’s shares underline problems of economic forecasting;Be wary of current 3% consensus for US growth next year;Selling picks and shovels in a gold rush made Samuel Brannan California’s first millionaire in 1849. Brannan wasted his fortune and died in poverty. Caterpillar, which sells mechanised shovels and much else to modern Forty-Niners, is not making its shareholders poor, having returned an annualised 13 per cent for the past decade. But Thursday its shares had their second-worst day this year after Cat lowered sales estimates, and are now down a tenth from 2012’s peak.Cat is often used as a guide to global demand, and even more so Chinese demand. Yet, the HSBC purchasing managers' index for Chinese manufacturing came in the strongest since the start of last year, beating expectations for the first time since October. Industrial metals jumped on hopes that China would start sucking in raw materials again.Also Thursday came the all-too-frequent midyear cut to the International Monetary Fund’s economic forecasts, although it maintained its prediction of 4 per cent global growth in 2015.Big investors typically spend a lot of time trying to predict economic developments. History suggests their efforts are wasted. Both official and consensus forecasts for the US – the most closely-watched economy – have overestimated growth every year bar one of the past seven.Each time, economists guessed a year ahead that growth would return to the long-run trend of 2.5-3 per cent growth, only to be forced to cut back as reality intruded. The one time they proved too pessimistic was for 2010, when they anticipated too slow a recovery from recession.To be fair, the past few years saw the biggest financial crash since 1929, the near-default of the US and fears of the break-up of the euro, none of which were in economists’ models.Even so, investors should be wary of the current 3 per cent consensus for US growth next year, exactly in line with the year-ahead forecasts in July 2010 and July 2011. The final result was nowhere close.
71;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2014-07-24T16:48:04Z;Builders slide as profits and home sales dip;;US homebuilders slumped on Thursday as two of the sector’s largest companies reported second-quarter profits shy of Wall Street forecasts and a new report showed a slide in new home sales.Results from DR Horton and PulteGroup fell short of expectations despite comments that demand has improved across much of the country from executives with each company.DR Horton, which builds homes across 27 states, said profits fell 23 per cent from a year earlier to $113.1m, or 32 cents per share. Sales climbed 28 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn, in line with forecasts.The company was forced to take a $55m charge relating to the Chicago housing market, which executives characterised as “very weak”. William Wheat, chief financial officer, noted DR Horton “[did] not have another concentration of underperforming communities” on the scale of the Chicago market.Rival PulteGroup struggled to jump start sales growth. Revenues rose less than 1 per cent from a year earlier, trailing forecasts.Sentiment across the sector soured further after figures from the Department of Commerce showed an 8.1 per cent decline in new home sales in June and a steep downward revision to May figures.“We still think the housing market will continue to recover given the upbeat news in most other housing indicators,” Daniel Silver, an economist with JPMorgan, said. “However, the persistent weakness in the new home sales data in recent years suggests that conditions are not completely favourable across the housing market.”Since the year’s start, the Philadelphia Housing Index, a gauge of the homebuilding industry that holds a market capitalisation above $95bn, has fallen 5 per cent.DR Horton shares slipped 12 per cent to $21.93 while PulteGroup declined 3 per cent to $19.24. Peer Lennar dipped 3 per cent to $39.26 and NVR fell 3 per cent to $1,131.67.The tech sector also remained in focus on Thursday, as better than expected results from Facebook offset declines at two closely followed industry peers.Facebook shares surged 5 per cent to $74.98 after the company’s profits eclipsed Wall Street forecasts and its mobile advert network continued to grow.The shares have now doubled from when they were first sold in a May 2012 public offering best remembered for technical failures on the opening day of trading.Wall Street analysts said the scale of the rise in profit margins was the biggest surprise. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, Facebook’s operating margin climbed to 59 per cent in the quarter from 44 per cent a year earlier.Results at Angie’s List and TripAdvisor failed to excite investors.Shares of Angie’s List, the contractor and plumbing review site, tumbled 19 per cent to $8.21 after the company forecast third quarter sales as much as 7 per cent below consensus expectations.TripAdvisor shares declined 5 per cent to $101.79 after the tech company reported earnings below analyst forecasts, despite a 31 per cent jump in sales.Analysts with broker Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their rating on TripAdvisor to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ following the quarterly results.Overall, the Nasdaq technology index rose 0.6 per cent to 2,185.03.Under Armour, the maker of sports apparel, led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said sales surged 34 per cent from a year earlier to $610m, buoyed by sales of new running shoes.Shares of the company, which also lifted its full-year sales outlook to as much as $3bn, soared 15 per cent to $69.55.Caterpillar remained under pressure after executives warned it was “too soon to suggest” that its mining business, which underpinned much of its success earlier this decade, was turning around.Caterpillar net revenues fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $14.2bn as sales in its resource division slid 29 per cent. Shares fell 3 per cent to $105.04.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 1,987.98, reaching a new record earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 2.8 points lower 17,083.80. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 1.6 points to 4,472.11.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
72;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Cost-cutting Caterpillar raises forecast;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of heavy machinery, has urged the US to enact tax reform as it continues to cut costs in the face of a long-running slump in mining equipment sales.Brad Halverson, chief financial officer, said reform would quell the prevalence of merger deals which US multinationals use to move their headquarters to countries with lower corporate tax rates. Recent so-called inversions have included Medtronic’s $42.9bn acquisition of Dublin-based Covidien and AbbVie’s $54bn take over of the UK’s Shire.“There seems to be consensus that our tax system should make companies like Caterpillar that operate globally from the US competitive on a global basis,” he said, noting rivals JCB in Sweden and Komatsu in Japan, among others. “When they have [tax] rates in the mid-20s . . . that creates a good environment for them – we need that environment here.”An influential senate subcommittee is currently investigating Caterpillar for its use of complex offshore tax strategies that have allegedly saved the group billions of dollars. Caterpillar denies any wrongdoing.Mr Halverson said that if the US enacted tax reform and passed an infrastructure bill, “we’d be creating more jobs here at Caterpillar”.The comments came as Caterpillar reported second-quarter profits that beat expectations and raised its 2014 earnings forecast to $5.75 a share, including 45 cents of restructuring costs, from an earlier forecast of $5.55.The company has cut thousands of jobs in the face of a slowdown in mining that has hit sales for around two years. But the deep mining equipment slump has been slightly offset by a modest recovery in construction equipment sales.The company narrowed the range of its 2014 guidance for sales to $54bn-$56bn, from $53.2bn-$58.8bn, because of lower forecast sales of construction equipment in emerging markets.Sales of mining equipment during the quarter fell 29 per cent to $2.2bn compared to a year earlier. Construction equipment sales rose 11 per cent to $5.4bn, on strong demand in North America, while energy and transport equipment sales fell 2 per cent to $5.18bn.On Wednesday the company said that global retail sales of machines had fallen 10 per cent in the three months to June, compared to a year earlier, led by a 38 per cent drop in mining equipment. Sales of construction equipment rose 3 per cent during the period, while energy and transportation equipment sales fell 10 per cent.North America again represented a lone bright spot, with retail machine sales up 14 per cent during the quarter, while all other regions reported declines of more than 18 per cent.Caterpillar reported net income of $999m, or $1.69 a share excluding restructuring costs, compared with $960m, or $1.48 a diluted share, in the same period last year. Sales fell 3 per cent from $14.6bn to $14.15bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.52 a share on sales of $14.46bn. Shares in the company were down more than 3.5 per cent, to $104.39, in midday trading in New York.The company also announced a $2.5bn share repurchase programme.
73;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2014-07-08T16:49:23Z;S&P warns of ExIm Bank risk for Boeing;;Dissolution of the US’s Export-Import Bank could have a “significant” long-term impact on Boeing, the commercial aircraft maker which receives more than a third of the bank’s credit, Standard & Poor’s has warned.Boeing could be forced to finance more of its overseas sales directly, according to a report from the credit rating agency, and could find itself in a more difficult financing position than Airbus, its European rival, when negotiating aircraft sales.ExIm, the US export credit agency, has been caught in the crossfire of the latest political shootout between Republicans affiliated with the Tea Party movement, who want to shut down or reform the bank, and the party’s business-friendly party moderates.To stay in operation ExIm needs to be reauthorised by Congress by September 30. Republican conservatives in the House of Representatives call the bank an instrument of “corporate welfare” and crony capitalism and are threatening to withhold reauthorisation.According to S&P, the air transport industry accounted for 45 per cent of ExIm Bank’s lending last year. Boeing alone accounted for more than a third of the bank’s commitments between 2007 and 2013.The report said that, if the bank were deauthorised this year, there would be no effect on Boeing’s credit quality or ability to finance deliveries this year or next.But it went on: “The long-term impact of ExIm’s dissolution on Boeing’s credit quality . . . could be significant, especially in a future downturn.”Boeing’s competitive position against Airbus, its main rival in the commercial airliner business, could suffer because Airbus would still be able to offer credits from the German, French and British export credit agencies.“This could be a deciding factor for some new aircraft contracts, especially in emerging markets and for sales to start-up or financially weak airlines,” S&P wrote.Boeing said the S&P report was consistent with what it had said all along about the bank.“The elimination of ExIm would put Boeing and thousands of companies in our US supply chain at a competitive disadvantage to Airbus and its European suppliers,” it said.The report added that General Electric, Caterpillar and United Technologies were also significant beneficiaries of ExIm loans, but the amounts financed generally accounted for less than 2 per cent of those companies’ annual revenues. ExIm-financed sales accounted for around 30 per cent of Boeing’s deliveries immediately after the 2008-9 financial crisis and would cover around 18 per cent for 2014.ExIm and its allies say it performs a role commercial banks are not willing to take on and that it is an essential tool for US companies competing for overseas sales. Many of those companies’ foreign competitors enjoy export-import financing from their governments on far more generous terms.The conservative lawmakers attacking ExIm are trying to put the Republican establishment on the defensive as they seek leadership positions in the party.Boeing’s shares were down 2.1 per cent at lunchtime in New York at $126.37.
74;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Caterpillar lifted by construction rebound;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of heavy machinery, raised its 2014 earnings forecast as a more sustained rebound in the US construction industry helped offset the continued mining slump.The Illinois-based company increased its 2014 earnings forecast from $5.30 a share to $5.55, including 55 cents of restructuring costs, as it reported a better than expected 5 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.Brad Halverson, chief financial officer, said the construction rebound was partly because of a weak comparison last year. But he said the company was pleased with its performance, including boosting its construction operating margin to 13.6 per cent from 5.5 per cent last year.“Clearly in North America, construction is a bright spot,” he said. “Our sales to users are up and we’re hearing anecdotally . . . pretty positive stories about quoting activity and we would say that confidence is growing.”Mr Halverson said the company was more cautious about construction sales in Europe and reiterated the company’s stance that the European Central Bank needs to be more aggressive.“They have some important decisions to make,” he said. “Our view would be that more aggressive stimulus policy would be helpful in Europe.”The company reaffirmed its 2014 guidance for sales in the range of 5 per cent above or below $56bn. But Caterpillar said construction sales would grow twice as fast as previously forecast, at 10 per cent, and would offset a 20 per cent decline in mining machinery sales.A mining slowdown has weighed heavily on Caterpillar sales for about two years, leading it to downsize. But construction equipment sales have trended upward in recent months in a sign of a modest economic recovery.Sales for Caterpillar’s mining equipment segment during the quarter fell 37 per cent to $2.1bn, compared with the same period last year. Construction equipment sales rose 20 per cent to $5.1bn, driven by North America, while energy and transport equipment sales rose 8 per cent to $4.8bn.On Wednesday, the company said retail machinery sales in the three months to March fell 12 per cent compared with the same period last year, driven by a 46 per cent drop in mining equipment sales. Construction sales rose 9 per cent. March was the 16th straight month Caterpillar logged a drop in retail machinery sales.North America represented a lone bright spot in overall sales, with retail machine sales up 6 per cent during the quarter. Sales in Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Europe, Africa and Middle East region all fell 20 per cent or more.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, reaffirmed the company’s forecast of global economic growth of about 3 per cent. But he said geopolitical risks, including China’s attempt to move its economy to a more sustainable growth model and the crisis in Ukraine, could derail a “fragile” global economy.Caterpillar reported net income of $922m, or $1.61 a share excluding restructuring costs, compared with $880m, or $1.31 a diluted share, in the same period last year. Sales were relatively flat at $13.24bn.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.24 a share on $13.14bn in sales. Shares in the company were up more than 2 per cent, to $105.50, its highest level in nearly two years, in midday trading in New York.
75;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Caterpillar probe shifts focus to US tax code;;US Republicans used an investigation into Caterpillar’s tax strategy on Tuesday to highlight problems with US corporate tax rules, saying bashing companies such as the heavy machinery maker focused on the wrong issue.Caterpillar has been accused of using a Swiss affiliate to shift 85 per cent of the profits it makes from selling parts to defer or avoid paying $2.4bn in US taxes, according to a report by Carl Levin, a Democratic senator.Those moves form part of a hearing by the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations, which is chaired by Mr Levin. Caterpillar moved $8bn in profits from the US to Switzerland to take advantage of a special 4 per cent to 6 per cent corporate tax rate it negotiated with the Swiss government, according to the report.“We’ve got the wrong people on trial here. The tax code should be on trial,” said Republican senator Rand Paul, a potential US presidential candidate. He added that Caterpillar deserved an apology for the “inquisition” and should be given a reward for keeping jobs in the US instead of moving them overseas.John McCain, the top Republican on the subcommittee, did not sign off on the Levin report. Mr McCain, who has supported past tax-related investigations, said the US has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, which is an incentive for corporations to find legal ways to avoid paying taxes in the US.“It’s an argument for broader tax reform,” said Mr McCain of the US corporate tax rate of up to 35 per cent.Congress has been wrestling with broad tax reforms including corporate tax rate cuts to 25-28 per cent, in addition to ways for companies to repatriate an estimated $2tn in cash held overseas. But lawmakers and the Obama administration have yet to reach an agreement.Mr Levin said the tax code should be reformed but the question was whether Caterpillar’s strategy was appropriate in avoiding $300m in taxes a year. No personnel or business activities were moved from the US to Switzerland after the company’s tax strategy changed in 1999, the report said.Caterpillar and PwC, its tax adviser, have denied any wrongdoing and said all US tax laws were obeyed. The Levin report said Caterpillar had paid PwC more than $55m since 1999 to develop a tax strategy aimed at redirecting profits to Switzerland.Mr Levin cited an email between senior PwC officials in 2008 that said: “We’ll all be retired when this come up on audit.” PwC managing director Steven Williams, who wrote the email, said during the hearing that his words were inappropriate.Our average effective [US] tax rate is 29 per cent. That’s one of the highest for a multinational manufacturing company. As an American company, we pay the taxes we owe, not morePwC and Caterpillar officials were also worried that the Swiss affiliate did not show any business substance purpose, which is needed to avoid a US tax bill, according to Mr Levin and the report.Robin Beran, Caterpillar’s chief tax officer, acknowledged that there are no warehouses or manufacturing facilities in Switzerland for the parts business, but noted that Caterpillar is carefully examined by US tax officials, who sit outside his office. They have cleared the company’s taxes through 2006 and are working on later years.Julie Lagacy, Caterpillar’s vice-president of finance services, agreed with Mr Levin that the tax rate in Switzerland is much lower than in the US. But she said the Swiss affiliate was established in 1960 and the restructuring of the parts business was aimed at servicing Caterpillar’s growing global business.“Our average effective [US] tax rate is 29 per cent,” Ms Lagacy said. “That’s one of the highest for a multinational manufacturing company. As an American company, we pay the taxes we owe, not more.”Republican senator Ron Johnson said Caterpillar was doing exactly what lawmakers wanted global US companies to do, which was manufacturing in the US and exporting products overseas. He said criticising companies such as Caterpillar risked pushing them to move manufacturing operations overseas.The company is the latest target of Senate inquiries into US companies accused of using overseas affiliates to avoid billions in US taxes. Past hearings focused on Apple and Hewlett-Packard, but Mr Levin said Caterpillar’s moves showed that tax avoidance was not just a strategy used by tech companies.
76;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2014-03-31T22:04:03Z;Caterpillar accused of ‘shifting’ profits;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of heavy machinery, used a Swiss affiliate to shift 85 per cent of its parts profits to defer or avoid paying $2.4bn in US taxes, according to a report by Carl Levin, a Democratic US senator.The company moved $8bn in profits from the US to Switzerland to take advantage of a special 4 per cent to 6 per cent corporate tax rate it negotiated with the Swiss government, according to the report from Mr Levin, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.Caterpillar’s tax strategy will be the subject of a subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. Julie Lagacy, Caterpillar’s vice-president of finance services, and Robin Beran, the company’s chief tax officer, are among the witnesses for the hearing, along with representatives of PwC, its tax consultant and auditor.The company is the latest target of Senate inquiries into US companies accused of using overseas affiliates to avoid billions in US taxes. Past hearings focused on Apple and Hewlett-Packard, but Mr Levin said Caterpillar’s moves showed that tax avoidance was not just a strategy used by tech companies.“Caterpillar is an American success story that produces phenomenal industrial machines, but it is also a member of the corporate profit-shifting club that has shifted billions of dollars in profits offshore to avoid paying US taxes,” Mr Levin said. The report cited Caterpillar officials praising the decrease in its US tax burden.However, Senator John McCain, the top Republican on the subcommittee, has not signed off on the report, reflecting differences over the findings. Mr McCain, who has supported past tax-related investigations, will discuss his disagreements at the hearing. But Mr Levin said the report was a bipartisan effort and his staff had worked closely with Mr McCain’s staff on the investigation.Caterpillar had paid PwC more than $55m since 1999 to develop a tax strategy aimed at redirecting profits to Switzerland, the report said. In exchange for a small royalty, Caterpillar transferred rights to the profits from an international parts distribution business to a wholly controlled Swiss affiliate, CSARL.As a result, Caterpillar’s overall tax rate has fallen over the past 14 years. At the same time, its offshore earnings have continued to rise, jumping to $17bn in 2013, from $11bn in 2010.Two Caterpillar tax officials had warned the strategy had no business purpose other than to avoid taxes and raised these concerns through an anonymous letter to top company officials in 2004, according to the report.Caterpillar is an American success story . . . but it is also a member of the corporate profit-shifting club that has shifted billions of dollars in profits offshore to avoid paying US taxesIn her testimony, Ms Lagacy plans to say that Caterpillar pays a 29 per cent effective tax rate, which is higher than the average 26 per cent US corporate rate. For the past three years, the company paid $1.8bn in federal income taxes.She will emphasise that the Senate focus is on the sale and purchase of replacement parts by Caterpillar’s non-US affiliates, which by law are not subject to US taxes or in other cases subject to deferred US taxes.“This is a standard multinational business structure entirely consistent with the letter and spirit of US tax law,” Ms Lagacy said in her written testimony, adding that the company stands by its structure.The Senate report emphasised that no personnel or business activities were moved from the US to Switzerland and most of the parts business remained in the US after the tax strategy shifted in 1999.Caterpillar will argue in its testimony that CSARL is not a shell and that it is a major operating company that employs hundreds of workers in Geneva, who make decisions on pricing and discounting, in addition to monitoring dealer and customer service performance.PwC said on Monday: “Our advice was founded on years of extensive work overseas and in the US and included detailed analyses of Caterpillar’s global operations and the impact of various potential business reorganisations on Caterpillar’s tax position.” PwC said it stood by its work.The Senate decided to look at Caterpillar after a 2009 federal lawsuit in which a former employee accused the company of shifting profits overseas to avoid US taxes. The company denied the allegations and in 2012 settled the suit.
77;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2014-03-30T11:23:45Z;Caterpillar faces US grilling over tax;;Caterpillar executives are in line to be grilled this week by the senate committee that has taken Apple, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard to task for allegedly exploiting loopholes to avoid billions of dollars in taxes.The influential senate permanent subcommittee on investigations is set to turn its sights on the world’s largest maker of heavy machinery on Tuesday for its use of complex offshore tax strategies that have allegedly saved the group billions of dollars.Michigan Senator Carl Levin, who leads the subcommittee, has taken a hard line on corporate and individual tax avoidance, lambasting “abusive tax schemes” that have become standard practice for many corporations.The probe will focus on the role of Switzerland in reducing Caterpillar’s US tax bills, in what the subcommittee said was a continuation of “its examination of the structures and methods employed by multinational corporations to allocate income outside of the United States”.The company has said it was co-operating. But in a preview of what is likely to be its argument at the hearing, Caterpillar said in a statement that its tax strategy fits the mould of a company “with a large manufacturing and distribution footprint in the United States and around the world”.“Caterpillar’s effective tax rate averages about 29 per cent, which is relatively high for a company with substantial earnings generated from business activities outside the United States,” it said.The transactions the senators are set to delve into illustrate the baroque complexity and intricacy of the measures taken by US multinationals to boost offshore earnings and shield themselves from one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.In the late 1990s, Caterpillar, one of the biggest exporters in the US, put Switzerland at the heart of its overseas operations in a move that reduced its tax bills and added hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line. PwC, which helped create the tax structure, is also set to testify on Tuesday.The shift reduced Caterpillar’s overall effective tax rate from 32 per cent in 1999, when its non-US activities accounted for a quarter of profits, to 27 per cent in 2004, when non-US activities accounted for nearly 60 per cent of profits.Offshore earnings have continued to rise. They were $17bn in 2013, up from $11bn in 2010.Caterpillar has not denied that it sought to minimise tax but has insisted that its efforts were legal, appropriate and transparent.Revelations about the company’s international tax planning thrown up by a 2009 lawsuit are also likely to face scrutiny. In that suit, Daniel Schlicksup, an employee, alleged Caterpillar inappropriately avoided paying $2bn of US tax by shifting $5.6bn of profits to Switzerland. The company denied the allegations and later settled the case.Caterpillar’s tax affairs exemplify some of the practices that are under attack from governments at home and abroad, as they seek to fill gaping holes in their public finances. But the company is hoping to escape the drubbing meted out to others in the political spotlight.“We look forward to a meaningful and respectful conversation with the senators,” it said.
78;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2014-03-21T18:29:30Z;Caterpillar faces US Senate tax inquiry;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of heavy machinery, has become the subject of a US Senate inquiry into allegations the company avoided taxes through a complex international structure, say people familiar with the matter.The influential senate permanent subcommittee on investigations could hold a hearing as early as the first week of April, said the people, who did not wish to be named. The Illinois-based company declined to comment.The subcommittee, led by Michigan Senator Carl Levin, has made tax avoidance by corporations and individuals a priority, by leading inquiries into technology companies and Swiss banks. Last year, it grilled Apple executives over allegations that the company exploited loopholes to avoid paying billions of dollars in tax.The Caterpillar investigation is likely to provide an insight into how multinationals have radically restructured their supply chains, and shifted billions of dollars of taxable profits into low tax countries.The senate subcommittee inquiry was first reported by Bloomberg News.Caterpillar’s overall tax rate has fallen over the past 14 years, as more of its profits have been taxed outside the US. It paid an overall effective tax rate of 32 per cent in 1999, when its non-US activities accounted for 26 per cent of profits. In 2013, its overall tax rate was 25.7 per cent and its non-US activities accounted for 62 per cent of profits.In its latest annual report, the company said the Internal Revenue Service had proposed an adjustment relating to the US taxation of some non-US operations and foreign tax credits. Caterpillar said it disagreed and would “vigorously contest” the adjustments in appeals.The company’s tax strategies also came under the spotlight in a 2009 federal lawsuit. Caterpillar was accused by an employee of shifting profits overseas to inappropriately avoid billions of dollars in taxes, through complex structures in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Bermuda. The employee, Daniel Schlicksup, also alleged that Caterpillar did not pay taxes on profits it repatriated through shell companies.The company denied the allegations and, in 2012, settled the suit with Mr Schlicksup.In court documents filed in September 2011, Caterpillar said it had reduced the amount of US taxable income from its replacement parts business as a result of structural changes that led it to report more income at its Swiss subsidiary, which was taxed at a rate of about 10 per cent.The documents also showed that, in 2005, the company retained Ernst & Young to advise it on a structure involving subsidiaries in Luxembourg and Bermuda to return cash to the US, using a short-term repatriation incentive. A 2006 internal email said the company repatriated nearly $1.5bn cash to the US without incremental US tax.
79;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2014-01-27T19:01:24Z;Caterpillar: digging deep after poor year;A deep slump in mining hit the group in 2013, but its raised dividend obscured the pain;Caterpillar chief executive Doug Oberhelman kindly recognised the efforts of his employees in Monday’s fourth-quarter earnings release. Never mind that those earnings beat expectations partially because the equipment behemoth has 10,000 fewer employees to pat on the back than a year ago. A deep slump in mining (overall capital expenditures have been slashed by roughly a quarter) has battered Caterpillar shares over the past two years. But fourth-quarter results, on the back of cost cuts and solid cash flow management were good enough to send its shares up 4 per cent. More importantly, it signalled the worst is behind the company, at least for the workers and investors still standing.Fourth-quarter earnings of $1.54 were up a shade from last year. But that obscures a nasty overall 2013 for Caterpillar. Group revenue fell $10bn to $56bn and earnings per share were down a third. In the fourth quarter, revenues in its mining equipment business, Resource Industries, were down a half. That tumble was so dramatic that mining equipment has gone from Caterpillar’s biggest to smallest business. The good news? Helped by $3bn in inventory reductions, 2013 cash flow hit a record $9bn, enough for Caterpillar to raise its dividend 15 per cent and buy back $2bn in stock.The question now is whether Caterpillar is poised to pleasantly surprise in 2014 after repeatedly disappointing in recent quarters. The company says miners remain squeamish about investing and so purchases will remain below replacement levels. However, mining equipment sales are not expected to fall as sharply as in 2013 since dealer inventories have come down. With its other segments, Caterpillar says group revenues and profits will be flattish this year. Investors will look forward, anxiously, to 2015 for a top-line revival. It is a good thing there is a new $10bn buyback plan to ease the tension.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
80;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Caterpillar attacks ECB for being too cautious;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of heavy machinery, has attacked the European Central Bank for cautious policies that could hamper the region’s potential recovery.“Compared with other central banks like the [US Federal Reserve] which has been aggressive in driving liquidity into the market . . . the ECB has not done that to the same degree,” said Brad Halverson, chief financial officer. “We think that’s one of the reasons growth has lagged in Europe relative to the US and we’d like to see them be more aggressive.”ECB policy “risks leaving the economy struggling for years”, the company said.The comments came even as the Illinois-based company forecast stronger growth, with its prediction that the global economy would expand about 3 per cent in 2014, compared with 2 per cent last year.Lawrence De Maria, analyst at William Blair, said Caterpillar had undertaken big cost-cutting initiatives recently, including an extensive restructuring plan for a plant in Belgium.“The message is Europe has been a tough environment and it’s expected to be one going forward, so they’re taking tough actions now as a result of a lack of tangible recovery,” he said. “The [company is saying the] US and emerging markets are a better place to have a big manufacturing footprint.”Caterpillar on Monday announced a new $10bn share repurchase programme that will expire in 2018 as it reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations.It said it expected to buy back some $1.7bn in shares during the first quarter of 2014, completing its $7.5bn repurchase programme.Fourth-quarter earnings rose to $1bn, or $1.54 a share, up from $697m, or $1.04 a share, during the same period last year. Sales fell 10 per cent, from $16.08bn to $14.4bn.Excluding certain items, earnings rose 8 cents, from $1.46 a share to $1.54. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.28 a share on $13.64bn in sales.“Cost flexibility is critical to our strategy and was a significant focus in 2013 as we took substantial actions to help maintain profitability as sales declined,” said Doug Oberhelman, chief executive.He said Caterpillar had consolidated plants and cut about 6,500 jobs but challenges, particularly in the mining sector, remained.Caterpillar expects full-year 2014 sales to be in the range of 5 per cent above or below $56bn, with earnings of $5.30 a share including about 55 cents in restructuring costs.On Friday, the company said retail machinery sales in the three months to December fell 9 per cent compared with the same period last year. That is an improvement on the three months to November, which saw a 12 per cent drop, but it represents the 13th straight month that Caterpillar has logged a drop in retail machinery sales.In the fourth quarter, retail machinery sales fell 19 per cent in Asia Pacific, 13 per cent in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, 3 per cent in Latin America and 1 per cent in North America.Mining remains the main driver of the sales slump as resource companies hold back on capital expenditure. Sales for Caterpillar’s mining equipment segment during the quarter fell 48 per cent to $3.02bn, compared with the same period last year. Construction equipment sales rose 20 per cent, while power systems rose 5 per cent.For the full year, Caterpillar reported earnings of $3.79bn, or $5.75 a share, compared with $5.68bn, or $8.48 a diluted share. Sales fell 16 per cent from $65.88bn to $55.66bn.

In March last year, workers protesting against the planned closure clashed with police outside Goodyear’s headquarters in the suburbs of Paris.Police said that 19 officers were injured in the violence as an angry mob of workers threw missiles and police responded by firing tear gas.The Goodyear plant last year became the centre of a spat between Arnaud Montebourg, France’s fiery industry minister, and Maurice Taylor, the outspoken head of the US-based Titan International tyre company.In response to an invitation by Mr Montebourg to buy the plant, Mr Taylor said that he would “have to be stupid” to consider such an option.The “Grizz”, as Mr Taylor styles himself, further poured petrol on to the flames by saying that instead he would “buy a Chinese tyre company or an Indian one, pay less than €1 per hour wage and ship all the tyres France needs”.In an apparent U-turn, however, Mr Taylor confirmed in October that his company was reconsidering its initial position on the plant as it looked to nearly double the size of its European business as part of a bet on the European economy rebounding.
82;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-12-19T22:47:24Z;US mining equipment makers set for $500m in fresh sales;;Caterpillar said US mining equipment manufacturers are set for more than $500m in fresh sales after the approval of nearly $700m in government-backed financing for an Australian iron ore mine.On Thursday, the Export-Import Bank, whose mission is to create export-related US jobs, approved the loan to the A$10bn Roy Hill mining project in Western Australia.“After a comprehensive review, the bank determined that this transaction represents a significant opportunity for American exporters to create and sustain American jobs,” said Fred Hochberg, chairman of the bank.The bank said the financing would support around 3,400 US jobs and is “contingent upon the purchase of US mining and rail equipment” from Caterpillar, General Electric and Atlas Copco. The bank increased the original $650m loan it had been considering to $694.4m.The decision marks a victory for the struggling mining equipment makers, whose sales have plummeted, forcing thousands of jobs cuts over the past year. But it marks a defeat for US miners, which had argued the loan would hurt their interests.In a statement included in the bank’s announcement, Steve Wunning, head of the resources group at Caterpillar, said the company “applauds” the bank for “bolstering US manufacturing competitiveness”.The Illinois-based company in October slashed its full-year forecasts and enacted “general austerity measures” to cope with the global slowdown in mining activity, including $700m in costs and a $400m reduction in capital expenditure.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said at the time that 75 per cent of the company’s projected $11bn drop in sales this year will come from the division which primarily sells mining equipment.Caterpillar is not alone. Joy Global, another likely supplier to the Roy Hill project, earlier this month cuts its 2014 earnings forecast while reporting an 87 per cent drop in profits during the quarter ended October 25.US mining companies, including Cliffs Natural Resources, had opposed the loan. They have argued that the financing promotes competition against US companies, and that the 55m tonnes of annual production from Roy Hill set to come online in late 2015 would put pressure on iron ore prices.Roy Hill, which is 70 per cent owned by Hancock Prospecting, the company controlled by Australia’s richest person Gina Rinehart, is expected to succeed in its goal of raising around A$7bn in debt.It has held talks with commercial banks and export credit agencies from various countries, including Korea and Japan.
83;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Business salutes trade deal as WTO ‘delivers’;;Business leaders have welcomed the first global trade deal in the WTO’s 18-year history as a boost to the bottom line and the global economy.The “trade facilitation” deal approved by the World Trade Organisation’s 159 member countries at the weekend is meant to streamline customs procedures and ease the flow of goods around the world.To help developing economies in Africa and elsewhere meet requirements of the agreement as early as January, donors including the EU, the World Bank and the OECD have promised to fund aid programs to train customs officials and develop infrastructure.Paperwork and delays at borders have long been nominated as among the “most costly and least predictable non-tariff barriers to trade” by companies, said Roberto Azevêdo, the WTO’s head. “For the first time in its history the WTO has delivered.”Scott Davis, the chairman and chief executive of UPS, the logistics company, hailed a “giant step forward for businesses large and small in expediting the movement of goods globally and reducing unnecessary paperwork”.Walmart, the US retailer, said the agreement would “significantly reduce the costs of customs clearances, logistics, border measures and other inefficiencies [and] enhance our ability to deliver the right product at the right time and price”.It would also, said Doug Oberhelman, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, provide “momentum” to other negotiations, including the EU-US trade negotiations and those now underway to conclude a Pacific Rim pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Christian Verschueren, director-general of Euro-Commerce, which represents European retailers and wholesalers, said: “This is a good day for Europe and the world economy. We will now see quicker and more simplified border procedures, acting as a catalyst for trade, growth and jobs. The Trade Facilitation Agreement is a win-win-win deal.”The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that the deal, which is expected to take two years to enact, would cut the cost of shipping goods by 10-15 per cent worldwide and boost global output by up to $1tn.The agreement requires the removal of obstacles such as the mandatory requirement of customs brokers and sets up an international trade facilitation committee to keep pushing for the streamlining of bureaucracy.Under WTO rules the deal will take effect once it is ratified by two-thirds of the 159 member states. The Obama administration believes the accord does not need Congressional approval but has not yet decided whether to seek a vote on Capitol Hill, according to Michael Punke, the US ambassador to the WTO. The EU’s approval process is expected to culminate in a vote by the European Parliament.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson and Ed Crooks in New York
84;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-10-25T07:16:58Z;Tale of two updates reveals state of mining sector;BHP and Caterpillar show industry is focused on volume and costs;They were two very different updates – one bearish, one bullish. But this week’s trading statements from BHP Billiton and Caterpillar, respectively the world’s largest natural resources company and heavy machinery group, neatly captured the state of play in the mining industry.BHP’s quarterly production report, published on Tuesday, showed how mining in 2013 is all about volume and costs. Miners are trying to produce as much as they can for as little as they can, while at the same time cutting back on spending.BHP reported output gains in thermal and coking coal, copper, nickel, aluminium and iron ore. Here it recorded a 23 per cent increase in output in the three months to September and also increased its full-year production target to 212m tonnes.The company also drew attention to the $2.7bn of costs it had stripped from the business in the past year and its planned 25 per cent reduction in capital and exploration expenditure.“Our rate of expenditure will decline again next year and if our investment criteria cannot be met in any one project, product or geography,” said chief executive Andrew Mackenzie.These themes, writ large across Caterpillar’s announcement, led to a sharp drop in its sales and earnings. Reporting a 44 per cent slide in the third-quarter earnings, the maker of bulldozer, draglines and dumper trucks said it had implemented “general austerity” measures to cope with the slowdown in mining activity.Caterpillar said sales to the resource industry would drop 40 per cent year on year in 2013 (it had previously expected a recovery) and said revenues would remain weak in 2014.Explaining the downgrade, Caterpillar chief executive Doug Oberhelman said he had spoken with several mining executives and while they were pretty “bullish” on existing mine production “any expansion in the near term is dead”.That news will have be welcomed by mining investors pushing for increased dividends and share buybacks. Unfortunately, there are still billions of dollars worth of investments of projects and expansions approved in the boom years about to come on stream. And these have the potential to damage prices.That said, analysts are nowhere near as worried about new supply as they were at the start of the year, presumably because of robust growth in China.In a report published on Thursday, Rob Clifford at Deutsche Bank said the price of the iron ore would remain above $100 even as 375m tonnes of new capacity hit the market over the next three years.That view was echoed by Jefferies. “Our analysis indicates that the much-anticipated iron ore market surplus will take longer than expected to materialise as the demand outlook has improved.”If they are right, shares in BHP and other miners could have a strong run. But for companies servicing the mining industry, the opposite is probably true. If Caterpillar’s results are a guide, the outlook remains grim.The Commodities Note is a regular online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
85;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Caterpillar slashes forecasts on mining slump;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest heavy machinery maker, has slashed full-year forecasts after enacting “general austerity measures” to cope with a global slowdown in mining activity.The US group missed analysts’ estimates and reported a 44 per cent fall in third-quarter earnings as a result of continued weak demand from the mining industry and moves by dealers to cut their inventory. In the past year, mining companies have cut 13,000 jobs, temporarily shut plants and reduced capital spending.Although the world’s largest mining groups – including BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto – have reported robust production numbers in recent days, they are still curbing investment in new projects. BHP, for example, will cut capital and exploration spending 25 per cent this year, its chief executive said this week.Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar chief executive, told analysts that he had spoken with mining executives recently and they are “pretty bullish” on existing mine production but “any expansion in the near term is dead”.He said mining executives remained optimistic about the eventual recovery of China, where the company is gaining market share and achieved a 30 per cent increase in retail sales during the quarter.“They are feeling . . . that even one to three years out, the world will grow, China will not implode – it will continue to attract iron ore and some coal,” Mr Oberhelman said. “At some point, that plays into our hand – just not right now.”The Illinois-based company cut its full-year sales forecast to $55bn, down from a range of $56bn to $58bn given in the previous quarter, and down from $66bn in 2012. It also reduced its earnings forecast to $5.50 a share from about $6.50 projected previously.Caterpillar shares were down 6.3 per cent to $83.55 at lunchtime in New York.Mr Oberhelman said 75 per cent of the company’s $11bn drop in sales this year will come from the resources division, which primarily sells mining equipment. The group is predicting that sales in the division will continue to decline in 2014. To compensate for the loss of revenue, Caterpillar has cut costs by about $700m and capital expenditure by $400m.“We have everybody here on a cost lockdown binge,” Mr Oberhelman said. “[It’s] all hands on deck here on cost structure and more coming.”The company is considering whether to consolidate smaller facilities, and shift production between facilities to maximise productivity.Caterpillar said nearly half of the decline in sales came from dealers reducing inventories. During the third quarter of 2012, dealers had increased inventories by $800m, but they cut them by the same amount in the third quarter of this year. Caterpillar lowered its own inventory by $500m.Mike DeWalt, vice-president, said that while demand from mining customers will probably fall in 2014, the company’s construction and power systems business should achieve flat to modest growth.Caterpillar reported net income of $946m, or $1.45 per diluted share, during the three months to the end of September. That compared with $1.7bn, or $2.54 per share, during the same period last year. Sales fell 18 per cent to $13.4bn from $16.45bn a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.67 a share on $14.32bn in sales.Operating profits for the resources division fell 63 per cent from the same period last year, to $409m. Sales for the division declined 42 per cent to $3bn.Caterpillar’s construction equipment division fared somewhat better, with operating profits down 43 per cent to $262m and a 7 per cent fall in sales to $4.5bn. But Matt Arnold, analyst at Edward Jones, said the results showed “a lot of the upturn in construction, especially non-residential, is still in its infancy”.“Businesses still aren’t confident to put any big ticket spending to work,” he added.Additional reporting by James Wilson
86;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-09-29T12:05:27Z;US mining equipment makers clash with miners over financing plan;;Caterpillar has said the US mining equipment industry faces over $500m in potential lost sales if US miners succeed in opposing $650m in government-backed financing for an Australian iron ore mine.Equipment makers, including Caterpillar, support the loan to the $10bn Roy Hill mining project in Western Australia, because the resulting orders for trucks and bulldozers would help an industry that has seen sales plummet and thousands of jobs cuts over the past year. But miners, led by Cliffs Natural Resources, oppose it on the grounds that the project would hurt US mining interests.The financing is expected to come before the Export-Import Bank, whose mission is to create export-related US jobs, in the coming months. According to the bank, if approved, it would be used to “support the export of approximately $522m worth of mining equipment” to the mine, which will in turn export the ore to Asian steelmakers.Caterpillar, the world’s largest heavy equipment maker, said in a statement that it has been working with members of the US Congress and trade associations to support the financing.“Caterpillar believes this particular transaction will have a positive net impact on jobs, both directly and indirectly throughout the supply chain,” the company said.The Illinois-based company saw a 10 per cent drop in global sales in the three months to the end of August compared with the same period last year. Asia-Pacific sales dropped 30 per cent year on year during the period, which analysts at William Blair attributed to weakness in the mining sector.Rival Joy Global, another likely supplier to the Roy Hill project, saw a 36 per cent drop in third-quarter orders and sharply cut its revenue forecast for the coming year.US miners, led by Ohio-based Cliffs and backed by senators from the iron ore-producing states of Minnesota and Michigan, contend the financing promotes competition against US companies. They argue that the 55m tonnes of annual production from Roy Hill set to come online in late 2015 would contribute to a global oversupply, putting pressure on iron ore prices.“The addition of 55m tonnes would be substantial at any period of time but . . . that impact will be particularly acute now,” said Raga Elim, vice-president of global corporate affairs at Cliffs.Even as the overall mining sector has faced difficulties iron ore prices have defied expectations, averaging $136 per tonne this year, the second-highest level on record, supported by strong Chinese demand. But Citi has estimated that a flood of new supply from China, India and especially Australia, along with falling Chinese demand, may see the price fall to $110 per tonne in the fourth quarter.Cliffs has also expanded its Australian iron ore output by about 40 per cent to about 11m tonnes, most of which is sold to the same Asian market that Roy Hill will be targeting, placing the two in direct competition.Roy Hill, which is 70 per cent owned by Hancock Prospecting, the company controlled by Australia’s richest person Gina Rinehart, is likely to proceed regardless of whether the US loan is approved.The company is expected to succeed in its goal of raising A$7bn in debt following talks with commercial banks and export credit agencies around the world, including the Export-Import Bank of Korea, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance, Korea Trade Insurance Corp and Japan Bank for International Co-operation since December. This puts Asian equipment suppliers in a strong position to win the orders for the project.

Caterpillar, the maker of mining and construction equipment, blamed the worldwide mining downturn when it cut its outlook for the second successive quarter. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, also said on Tuesday that 4 per cent revenue declines outside North America had partially offset 7 per cent increases in the region.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said the 38 per cent increase in second-quarter revenue, to $5.6bn, reflected 40 per cent growth from acquisitions and a 2 per cent decline in “core sales”, reflecting “soft conditions” in several of the company’s end markets.Net income was up 29 per cent compared with last year’s second quarter to $494m, while diluted earnings per share – which were depressed by the shares issued to purchase Cooper – declined 7 per cent to $1.04.Mr Cutler said Eaton had entered 2013 expecting the year to be one of “subpar” global economic growth, leading to approximately 2 to 3 per cent growth in the company’s markets. It now expected global growth of about 1 per cent.Growth in the company’s home US market had also been less focused on the company’s core industrial products than on consumer products, cars and housing, Mr Cutler said. Industrial production in the second quarter had risen only 0.1 per cent, he pointed out.“It wasn’t capital goods; it wasn’t new manufacturing plants,” Mr Cutler said. “We continue to believe that we are going to see a year where industrial production in the US will be less than GDP growth. That’s a difficult environment.”Mr Cutler added that, in the companies two biggest segments – which make electrical control equipment – demand had been strongest in the US, Middle East and Latin America and weakest in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Growth in those segments would now be about 2 percentage points lower than expected, he said.The key emerging market economies – China, India and Brazil – were “struggling to get traction”, Mr Cutler said.“They’re not growing at the rates we saw before the recession,” he said.The company’s hydraulics division fared still worse, experiencing sales growth of just 1 per cent to $772m, as a 9 per cent core sales decline and a further 1 per cent decline from currency effects all but wiped out a 10 per cent increase from acquisitions. The division’s operating profits fell 15 per cent to $104m.The shares closed down 5.5 per cent at $66.06 in New York."
88;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-07-24T18:09:53Z;Industrials upgrades mark strength of US economic recovery;;Some of the US’s biggest industrial companies have provided further evidence of how a domestic economic recovery and continued federal spending are underpinning corporate earnings.On Wednesday, Boeing, Ford and Northrop Grumman all increased their guidance for full-year profits.Ford raised its forecasts, saying that it expected to “equal or exceed” last year’s $8bn net earnings this year, rather than merely matching it, while Boeing increased its earnings guidance by 2 per cent – to a range of $5.10 to $5.30 per share.But it was Northrop Grumman, the US’s second-biggest pure military contractor by sales, that announced the biggest forecast earnings increase, raising its guidance by 10 per cent, to a range of $7.60 to $7.80 per share.The figures suggested a sharp turnround in the relative fortunes of the US economy, and the economies of formerly fast-growing emerging markets.Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving and construction equipment, and one of the US industrial companies most exposed to emerging markets, cut its full-year forecast for the second successive quarter, by 7 per cent, to $6.50 per share. It said it had suffered from a winding down of dealers’ inventories and the continuing mining slump.Bob Shanks, CFO of Ford, the most obvious beneficiary of the US’s economic rebound, said he expected North America to continue to be a “strong performer” for the company.Ford’s North American pre-tax profits – which were boosted by the US’s fast-rising car demand – were 16 per cent up on last year’s second quarter, at $2.3bn.Mr Shanks said: “Our big opportunity is to take the operations outside of North America and get them contributing fairly, if you will, to the overall business.”Boeing benefited from the strength of worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft, including the problematic 787 Dreamliner. The company delivered 13 per cent more aircraft in the second quarter than in the same quarter of 2012 to airlines worldwide.The continuing strength of worldwide aircraft demand also helped General Dynamics – the maker of Gulfstream corporate jets – improve the operating profits in its aerospace division by 51 per cent, to $389m.Boeing also benefited from the continuing strength of demand from the US’s defence department, which helped the group’s operating profit rise 4 per cent to $776m on revenue that was flat at $8.2bn.Northrop Grumman reported still stronger demand from the Pentagon, particularly from the ramp-up in production of Lockheed Martin’s F35 fighter, to which it contributes many components. Demand for many of its unmanned aircraft was also strong.Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chief executive, said the effects of across-the-board sequestration cuts in defence spending had not yet made themselves felt.Caterpillar, meanwhile, continued to suffer from the slump in emerging markets’ once-booming mining industries. Operating profits in its resource industries division fell 61 per cent to $550m.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Not a recovery from where I’m sitting / From Mr William Dunkelberg
89;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-07-24T13:24:42Z;Caterpillar cuts forecast as mining slows;Full-year profit outlook lowered as net income drops 43%;Caterpillar, the earthmoving and mining equipment maker, cut its full-year profit forecast for the second successive quarter as it announced net income for the second quarter down 43 per cent on the same period last year.The company, which in the first quarter suffered from declining demand from the mining industry, cut its forecast for full-year sales 2.6 per cent to a range of $56bn to $58bn. Earnings per share would be $6.50 in the middle of that range, down 7 per cent from the $7 forecast at the previous projected range of $57bn to $61bn.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said the company’s expectations for overall end-user demand remained around the same as in April, when it previously cut its forecasts. However, equipment dealers had cut inventories more than expected during the quarter.The company said it expected inventories to be $3.5bn lower at the end of the year than at the end of 2012.“During the second quarter, dealers increased their utilisation of inventory from our product distribution centres, which allows them to meet customer demand with less inventory,” Mr Oberhelman said. “With the sharp reduction in dealer inventory and the decline in mining, 2013 is turning out to be a tough year and we’ve already taken action to reduce costs.”Caterpillar’s profit for the quarter – its term for net income attributable to shareholders – fell 43 per cent to $960m, on sales and revenues down 16 per cent from last year’s second quarter to $14.6bn. Profit per share also fell 43 per cent, to $1.45.Mr Oberhelman said the company had experienced “headwinds” in the quarter. While it had recorded a $135m gain from the settlement in May of a dispute over accounting for the Siwei group it bought in China, that had been more than offset by currency and hedging losses. Dealers’ inventory cuts had totalled $1bn for the quarter, while Caterpillar had cut its own inventories by $1.2bn.However, the outlook for the second half did not anticipate further currency losses or reductions in Caterpillar’s own inventory for the second half, Mr Oberhelman said.“We expect profit to improve in the second half of the year,” he said.Operating profits in resource industries – which has suffered from the mining slump – were $550m, 61 per cent down on last year’s second quarter, while sales and revenues fell 34 per cent to $3.57bn.The company remained positive about mining in the long term, Mr Oberhelman said. The world needed mined commodities.But he went on: “We don’t expect much change in the environment in the short term and the remainder of 2013 will be tough for our mining business.”In construction industries, operating profits fell 47 per cent to $362m, on turnover down 9 per cent to $4.85bn. Power systems’ operating profit fell 3 per cent to $955m, on sales down 5 per cent to $5.26bn. Operating profits in the financial products segment – which finances purchases of Caterpillar machines – improved 24 per cent to $241m, on turnover up 7 per cent to $735m.The shares fell 2.43 per cent to $83.44.
90;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Dim sum bonds on the ropes;;"China’s credit crunch may be over, for now at least. But it seems nobody told investors in dim sum bonds, who have quit the market at a rapid clip and have yet to come back.Average yields paid on dim sum bonds had been on a steady decline since around this time last year, dipping as low as 3.88 per cent in April – the lowest level since the early days of the market.Issuance was also chugging along nicely, rising to $1.7bn in May. Even the global move out of fixed income sparked by Ben Bernanke’s “tapering” comments only pushed yields up to 4.3 per cent in the last few days of the month.Instead it was China’s onshore credit crunch that really sucked the wind out of the market. Dim sum yields soared as investors sold their bonds, despite continued strength in the Chinese currency – often the main driver behind appetite for the bonds.Issuance has already almost completely dried up. In June, just one corporate bond deal was completed – a $292m issue from US earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar.With appreciation expectations coming down, fears growing over the Chinese economy, a lack of liquidity in the market, and increasing access to onshore fixed income, Standard Chartered’s description of the outlook as “clouded” looks rather understated. That the only silver lining the bank could find in its Renminbi Insider update, released on Thursday, is a lack of correlation to US Treasuries also speaks volumes.Even though China interbank lending rates have come back down from their panicky peaks, this looks like a market that could be on the ropes for a little while yet.Related reading:

Such trains – known as multiple units – have their motors hidden under the floors of passenger carriages.The new trains would compete with the pairing of a heavy diesel locomotive and robust passenger coaches that is currently generally used to run commuter services over US freight lines. The US diesel locomotive market is a duopoly of General Electric’s GE Transportation and Caterpillar’s EMD.Multiple units have rarely been allowed to operate in the US on mixed-traffic routes in case they proved too weak in a collision with the country’s many long, heavy freight trains. However, advocates of a change argue that European trains are also designed to withstand substantial impacts with Europe’s high-speed trains.The FRA’s rules currently demand that commuter trains show no deformation at all in a crash. European trains absorb impacts through crumpling of areas near the front. New rules are expected to move closer to European standards.Commuter services are generally run by either Amtrak, the federal government’s passenger train operator, or local state-owned agencies.The Federal Railroad Adminstration said its safety advisory committee was working “very closely” with train manufacturers “around the world” on designs and there was “broad consensus”.“We are collaborating with Amtrak, railcar manufacturers, and other partners to establish and implement safety standards that will ensure safe operation of these trains for passengers, employees and communities around the United States,” it said.Bombardier, the biggest international passenger trainmaker, said it had participated in development of the new guidelines.“Bombardier is fortunate in that our comprehensive portfolio of technologies and products includes many proven designs from abroad upon which we can draw,” it said.We are collaborating with Amtrak, railcar manufacturers, and other partners to establish and implement safety standards that will ensure safe operation of these trains for passengers, employees and communities around the United StatesHenri Poupart-Lafarge, chief executive of Alstom’s trainmaking division, said a change would open the US market up to more and more of Alstom’s international products. The company already supplies metro cars – which have to meet less stringent crash standards – to New York and Washington.“The US is becoming more and more a complete part of the global network of Alstom,” he said.People familiar with the thinking of Germany’s Siemens, which already supplies electric locomotives to Amtrak, indicated it was interested.Henry Posner, a US-based rail entrepreneur with experience of European passenger services, said it would be easier with cheap multiple units to test the market for new, start-up commuter services.“It’s an important development,” he said.Rail and Metro special report
92;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar and former owners of Chinese group settle dispute;;The former owners of ERA Mining have taken a $135m hit on sale proceeds owed by Caterpillar to settle claims that the US group found “deliberate, multiyear, co-ordinated accounting misconduct” at the Chinese company.The world’s largest maker of diggers and mechanical shovels by sales bought ERA last June for $886m in an effort to crack China’s $64bn machinery market, but in January took a $580m writedown on the value of the business after uncovering the accounting problems.Caterpillar’s investigation into the issues led to the sacking of several senior managers at ERA’s subsidiary Siwei, which sells coal mining machinery. One of the managers was also a director of ERA.However, the US group said it had found no evidence of misconduct by former owners, including ERA chairman Emory Williams, John Lee, James Thompson III and MML, an investment company.Steve Wunning, Caterpillar group president with responsibility for mining equipment, said the group was pleased to resolve these issues with the MML parties.“We purchased [the company] as a strategic fit for our coal mining business in China, a country that produces and consumes more coal than any other country in the world,” Mr Wunning said. “We remain very committed to supporting the large base of customers in the Chinese mining industry.”The settlement news will be a blow to Mr Williams, who was one of the largest shareholders in ERA with about 16 per cent and who in January had declared himself “shocked and dismayed” at Caterpillar’s writedown and claims of accounting misconduct.He was quoted on Thursday in a Caterpillar statement as saying: “We wish Caterpillar continued success in the China mining sector. We are pleased to conclude this matter and to continue our record of building successful businesses in China.”He could not be reached in Hong Kong on Friday for further comment.Caterpillar spent months completing the deal to buy ERA in 2012 and the Chinese company was already seeing problems in its business before final papers were signed.ERA issued the first of two profit warnings in March 2012 after Caterpillar had already agreed its $800m deal but the US group was able to put pressure on ERA’s main shareholders, including Mr Williams, to take more of their payments in loan notes whose value could be reduced if performance of the Chinese business worsened.Those shareholders have now agreed that Caterpillar’s outstanding obligations to them will drop from $164.5m to $29.5m, while Caterpillar will drop all claims against those former shareholders.On top of the settlement, Caterpillar has agreed that a company affiliated with MML can buy from Siwei “certain receivables and other assets”, it said.
93;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;US stocks with firm home ties lead market;;The share prices of US companies with a strong domestic presence are significantly outperforming their multinational rivals in the S&P 500.The trend is being reinforced by the latest round of results from corporate America, which has highlighted the pain of a strong dollar for those companies that rely on overseas revenues. Weaker-than-expected growth in the eurozone and emerging markets also has been a feature of the current first-quarter earnings season.The strong US dollar has already hurt IBM’s first-quarter results. Industrial bellwether Caterpillar lowered its full-year earnings forecast on Monday.“Consumer spending growth is now consistently coming from North America, while it has been shrinking in Europe and has been uneven at best in places like Asia and Latin America,” said Oliver Pursche, a portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of industrial conglomerate General Electric, told investors last week the company had expected a lacklustre performance in Europe similar to 2012, “but it was even weaker than we had expected”.The relationship between share price performance and domestic revenues in the past 12 months is seen across all the 10 major groups in the S&P, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group. Within the S&P, telecoms companies have risen 30 per cent, while technology has dropped more than 3 per cent.This gulf reflects how telecoms generate nearly all of their revenues from within the US while tech companies rely on more than half of revenues from foreign markets.Investors are responding to the shift by aggressively buying stocks in sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples, where revenues are heavily orientated to the domestic economy. The two sectors are the top performing groups in the S&P this year, up 20.1 and 18.3 per cent, respectively.However, Barry Knapp, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, cautions: “We believe investors are overpaying for domestically focused stocks.”Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock said investors should consider a more defensive portfolio in the present environment, but be aware of valuations.“We would be careful about rotating into classic defensive areas of the market such as the utilities and consumer staples sectors, both of which look extremely expensive.”The performance of utilities is an outlier when viewed from the perspective of earnings growth this year. Utilities is the only major sector forecast to see its earnings growth decline, with a drop of 2.7 per cent for 2013 versus 2012 according to FactSet.Telecoms stands apart with forecast growth of 19.8 per cent this year, with the broad S&P 500 forecast to record profit growth of 7.4 per cent.Verizon Communications, the telecoms group that counts the US market for most of its sales, has been among the strongest performers on the S&P 500 for the last year. The company reported first-quarter results last week bolstered by increased subscribers and higher charges for its services.
94;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Caterpillar earnings drop 45%;;Caterpillar reported a 45 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings and lowered its guidance for the full year as weak global mining demand continues to batter the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment.The company lowered its full-year sales forecast to $57bn-$61bn, from the $60bn-$68bn it had forecast earlier. Caterpillar reported a record $65.88bn in 2012. Its mid-range earnings forecast fell to $7 per share, from $7-$9 it had forecast earlier.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said that while expectations for the company’s construction and power systems segments remained constant, “our expectations for mining have decreased significantly”, reflecting a sales decline of about 50 per cent from the previous year for Caterpillar mining machines.Shares in the equipment maker are down more than 23 per cent over the past 12 months. They initially fell on the latest results but were trading up nearly 3 per cent at $82.65 by late afternoon in New York as the company suggested the mining segment would bottom out this year before rebounding in 2014.“Almost the entire decline of $7bn [in sales for the full year] is mining,” said Brad Halverson, chief financial officer. “[But] as we look forward to 2014 . . . our mining inventory decline should be behind us and we see production continuing at a decent pace.”The Illinois-based company reported net income of $880m, or $1.31 per share, in the three months to March 31, down from $1.59bn, or $2.37 per share during the same period last year. Revenues fell 17 per cent to $13.21bn, compared with $15.98bn during the first quarter of 2012.Analysts had expected earnings of $1.40 per share on $13.72bn in sales.It was the second tough quarter in a row for the company, which had a 55 per cent drop in earnings in the three months to December.Revenues were hit by an 11 per cent decrease in global retail machine sales during the quarter, led by an 11 per cent drop in North America and a 24 per cent fall in Asia Pacific.Sales of mining, construction and power systems equipment fell 23 per cent, 17 per cent and 12 per cent year on year, respectively.In recent months, Caterpillar has announced plans to cut about 2,000 jobs in response to weakness in the global mining industry and low commodity prices.The US shale gas boom has driven down natural gas prices, causing many power producers to switch from coal to natural gas, while the industrial slowdown in China has slowed demand for resources in the world’s largest consumer of mined commodities.Caterpillar also said it would restart a share buyback, first approved in 2007, that allows the company to buy as much as $3.7bn of its shares by December 2015.
95;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-04-22T18:59:53Z;Caterpillar: scaredy Cat;Shares to suffer when the rebound doesn’t come;"It says something about Wall Street estimates when a big, important company cuts its sales target to a level well below the analysts’ consensus – and the stock rises. This is what happened at Caterpillar on Monday morning. The maker of life-sized Tonka Trucks and industrial generators cut its 2013 sales estimate by 8 per cent, to $59bn at the midpoint. The Street had wanted $63bn. The stock rose 3 per cent.Caterpillar’s news was no surprise to those who follow the mining industry, which accounts for roughly a third of the company’s sales and where weak demand led to the lower outlook. Mining bosses have been signalling their intention to cut spending. As Glencore/Xstrata chief Ivan Glasenberg bluntly put it: “It’s time to stop building.” The “big four” miners (Xstrata, Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto) spent almost $50bn on capex last year; $35bn is expected for 2014. US power plants shifting from coal to shale gas won’t help sell diggers and dump trucks, either. Investors have heeded the signs, and have sent Caterpillar’s shares down almost a fifth over three months.The question is whether the share price now fits the outlook. There are reasons for hope. The price/earnings multiple, at under 10, is now well below its long-term average. In the past two decades, single-digit ratios have been rare outside of the 2008-09 crisis. Operating margins have come down towards normal levels as well. The company is right to point out that the awful sales result in the first quarter (down 18 per cent year on year) would have been milder (down a mere 9 per cent) were it not for inventory shifts. And finally, Caterpillar’s order backlog, which fell sharply in the third and fourth quarters, seems to have stabilised.The worry is that some investors are still harbouring hope of a near-term rebound in sales or profit; when it doesn’t come, the optimists’ capitulation could hit the shares again. Of course, Wall Street estimates for 2014 and 2015 forecasts call for precisely such a rebound. But who would believe them?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
96;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-04-14T14:20:07Z;US rail operators divided over LNG future;;The US rail industry has reached a crossing point in its debate over making a transition from running diesel fuel to adopting liquefied natural gas.Natural gas power could slash costs for US railroads, which operate the world’s largest and busiest rail freight network, compared with existing diesel fuel. Despite a recent increase in prices, US natural gas prices remain historically low at a time when oil – and diesel fuel – prices are near record highs.Matt Rose, chief executive of BNSF, the US’s second biggest rail network by route miles, is one of the most enthusiastic exponents for a potential switch to LNG. BNSF could convert on its own to using LNG if necessary, Mr Rose said.“We don’t change a lot in our industry,” Mr Rose said. “There was a big change from steam to diesel. This is that kind of change.”However, Jack Koraleski, chief executive of Union Pacific, operator of the biggest network, Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, operator of the fourth-biggest, and Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer for CSX, the number three, have all expressed reservations.Mr Eliasson said it was “pretty clear” the economics of operating on LNG would work. But a switch at one railroad could jeopardise the smooth running of locomotives between different railroads.“It’s much more a question of how much and how quickly will the industry convert small portions, large portions or all of their fleet over to utilise LNG,” Mr Eliasson said.Mr Moorman called LNG conversion “an extraordinarily interesting opportunity”. But he queried whether gas-powered locomotives would generate the power of diesels.Mr Koraleski acknowledged it was undoubtedly possible to run a locomotive on natural gas, but he added: “The question is, can you do it economically, can you do it safely and can you do it on a consistently reliable basis?”The LNG, which is generally regarded as cleaner than diesel, would be carried in supercooled liquefied form either within the locomotive itself or an adapted freight car. Both GE Transportation and Caterpillar are co-operating with railroads in trials of the new technology due to start later this year.Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE Transportation, the General Electric business that is one of the US’s two big locomotive builders, said his company was developing LNG power in response to customers’ demands. He added that the company’s intended LNG locomotives should produce at least the same power as existing ones running on diesel. The locomotives might also be able to run further than existing ones between fuelling stopsGE’s main rival, the EMD unit of Caterpillar, said locomotives were likely to be able to carry substantial quantities of fuel within existing locomotive bodyshells, even without a neighbouring car to carry additional stocks.
97;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar cuts highlight mining woes;;Heavy industry is known for its toughness but one of its biggest players is taking a battering.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment, has announced plans to cut about 2,000 jobs in recent weeks, in a further sign of how weakness in the global mining industry and low commodity prices are hurting heavy industry.The mining industry is being hit on two fronts. The US shale gas boom has driven down natural gas prices, which has caused many power producers to switch from coal to natural gas, while the industrial slowdown in China has also slowed demand for resources in the world’s largest consumer of mined commodities.These twin effects have hit Caterpillar in the US and beyond. The company last week announced 460 job cuts at its plant in Decatur, Illinois, near its headquarters, citing weakness in the mining sector. The company had announced lay-offs and instituted a shortened working week last year.The move comes a week after reports that the company will cut up to 300 jobs at a facility in South Milwaukee, which it acquired when it bought mining equipment manufacturer Bucyrus in 2011. In late February, the company announced it would cut 1,400 jobs in Belgium, citing rising costs and the troubling state of the European economy, which has seen weakness in both its core construction and mining sectors.Caterpillar’s rivals are also feeling the pinch. Joy Global, a Milwaukee-based mining equipment services group, reported a roughly 30 per cent drop in orders in the quarter ended January 25, to $1bn, compared with a year earlier. In the previous two quarters, Joy orders dropped 5 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, year on year.Last October, Joy announced it would cut up to 250 jobs in response to slowing business.Coal producers, and the companies that supply mining equipment, including Caterpillar, have suffered amid a boom in US natural gas. The price of US natural gas reached an 18-month high on Friday, at $4.124 per million British thermal units.But a surge in output in recent years has driven prices as low as $2 per Mbtu last year, causing demand to spike among petrochemical plants and industries configured to take advantage of the boom.The effect on US coal producers has been severe: coal production and coal power generation fell by a tenth in 2012.The economic slowdown in China saw growth fall to 7.8 per cent last year, the lowest in more than a decade, driving down to single-digits demand for commodities such as iron ore, copper and coal.Demand growth remains anaemic, which has kept global prices for commodities below their post-financial crisis peak in 2011, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. China, the world’s largest steel producer, also saw steel inventories reach record levels in February, suggesting buying remains constrained.The effect on US coal producers has been severe: coal production and coal power fell by a tenth in 2012Still, Caterpillar is optimistic about the market, which it has said will see GDP growth near 8.5 per cent this year, driving up commodity prices and demand. Increased Chinese demand would help boost Caterpillar sales in Australia and South America, among other places that supply China with natural resources.But last year’s weakness in commodity prices saw the metals and mining industry suffer, with fundraising dropping 25 per cent to $249bn, compared with $340bn the year prior.“The two major mining equipment manufacturers, Caterpillar and Joy Global, are driven largely by miners’ . . . orders for new equipment,” said Adam Fleck, analyst at Morningstar. Weakness in the mining industry is “leading to pretty large year-on-year reductions in orders”, he said.In each of the past two quarters, Caterpillar reported that new orders had “significantly declined” or were “well below” those during the same periods the year before.In January, when the company reported record full-year earnings, Douglas Oberhelman, chief executive, said he was pleased that the company had reduced its inventory by $2bn in the fourth quarter, while its dealers had also reduced their inventories and order rates.Analysts applaud the reduction in inventories as a cost-saving measure amid lean times, but Caterpillar and its rivals will be hoping for a pick-up in demand so they do not find themselves in a hole too deep to dig themselves out of.
98;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-02-28T19:00:44Z;Caterpillar to cut 1,400 jobs in Belgium;;"Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues, plans to cut 1,400 jobs at its Belgian plant, making it the latest large US company over the past 12 months to shed hundreds of jobs because of the eurozone crisis.The global manufacturer said on Thursday that it was forced to make the job cuts at its Gosselies plant near Charleroi, which employs 3,700 people, because of the troubling state of the European economy and rising costs.“Though they are painful, these measures are indispensable to allow us to be competitive and give a chance of survival to our factory,” said Nicolas Polutnik, chief executive of Caterpillar Belgium.Caterpillar’s move reflects a broader trend in Europe, which has seen high-profile US groups either shed thousands of jobs or shut plants all together as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis has turned the old continent into a less attractive place to invest and do business.Among the most distinguished groups to have announced closure or shed jobs are: Ford, which announced the closure of its Belgium plant leaving 4,300 people unemployed; General Motors, which closed its Opel plant in Germany shedding more than 3,000 jobs; ArcelorMittal, which plans to slash tens of hundreds of jobs at its steel plants in France and Belgium; and Dow Chemical, which announced the closure of operations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and the UK.“Europe is going to be slow-growth for a long time,” Jeff Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, said last year at a conference in New York. “If they allow a bank to bust like what happened here in September 2008, it could be worse. So count on Europe being slow,” he added. GE said last year that most its $2bn planned cuts across all operations would occur in Europe because of the weak economic environment.Several detailed studies examining the impact of the sovereign debt crisis that led Europe into the worst economic crisis since the 1930’s Great Depression indicated that companies have lost trillions of dollars and shed millions of jobs.Though they are painful, these measures are indispensable to allow us to be competitiveGrant Thornton, a US consultancy that interviewed more than 12,000 executives in 41 countries, said that companies have lost about $2tn since 2009 because of the eurozone crisis, while unemployment has reached record levels with nearly 19m unemployed.However, the economic crisis is not the only reason why global companies are quitting Europe. The burden of costly regulation as well as the high cost of labour and taxation is forcing many to look for better opportunities in emerging markets.“It currently costs less to import machines to Europe from some other Caterpillar locations than to produce them in Gosselies,” the company said on Thursday."
99;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-02-12T00:04:19Z;Caterpillar digs into trouble in China;;Two years ago in the US, over a dinner of filet mignon and sweet potato gratin, Caterpillar chief executive Doug Oberhelman looked on as China’s President Hu Jintao praised the “mutually beneficial economic co-operation” between the US and China.With a violin serenade and a hearty welcome from Chicago mayor Richard Daley, the dinner feted Mr Hu and highlighted the industrial ties between the world’s two largest economies. Caterpillar, one of the first US companies to set up shop in China after it reopened to western businesses in the late 1970s, was a co-sponsor.At the time the US machinery company’s prospects in China could not have looked better. Sales of crawler excavators, a key segment, had surged 70 per cent from the previous year as the Chinese machinery market boomed. “We’re going to play offense [in China], and we are going to win,” Mr Oberhelman told investors.More recently, however, Caterpillar has come badly unstuck. It has been bleeding market share as homegrown companies – many deploying suspiciously similar technology – have grabbed sales. Caterpillar’s chief Chinese rival, Sany Heavy, surpassed it in market share for excavators for the first time in 2011. Last year, a drop-off in construction pushed all-important excavator sales down more than 30 per cent from the previous year, according to Barclays data.As if that were not bad enough, Caterpillar has been forced to make a costly and embarrassing goodwill impairment charge of $580m after uncovering alleged accounting misconduct at a Chinese mining equipment company it acquired six months before.It is an abrupt reversal of fortune for a company that once seemed like a textbook case of how to do things right in China. The US machinery company saw the country’s potential so early that, in 1978, it opened its first Beijing office in the same year that Washington and Beijing established diplomatic ties after decades of estrangement.In the 1980s, Caterpillar curried favour by cautiously sharing technology and knowhow with a dozen Chinese state-owned enterprises. As China began to urbanise in the 1990s, it was one of the first to set up a factory through a joint venture with an ambitious local group in Xuzhou. Instead of operating through dealerships, Caterpillar sold its equipment directly to its customers, even sending western executives out to remote mine sites to sign major contracts – a popular approach, according to a former customer.We’re going to play offense [in China], and we are going to winHowever, in spite of decades of careful investment, China still accounts for only 3 per cent of Caterpillar’s worldwide sales. Sales in Asia Pacific even dropped 2 per cent in the final quarter of last year, dragged down by poor sales in China.The US machinery company has misjudged China’s capricious market for heavy machinery time and time again. In 2010, when the Chinese market was booming, Caterpillar was constrained by production capacity. Last year, as unsold machines started filling up Caterpillar’s lots, the company exported more than 2,300 excavators out of China to help draw down stocks.Caterpillar also abandoned the direct sales model several years ago and switched to a dealership model similar to what it uses in the West, which one customer describes as a “major mistake” because it hurt sales.“Caterpillar tried very hard to maintain its traditional virtues of trying to maintain premium products and premium customers,” says David Phillips, head of consultancy Off-Highway Research. “I don’t think that is a mistake, but it has certainly held them back a little bit.” He adds that they have not been “dragged into price wars” as much as other companies.Yet it is the dispute with ERA that has been Caterpillar’s biggest sore point in China. In January the US group ended up taking a $580m writedown on the value of the business, alleging multiyear accounting misconduct and kicking out key executives whose relationships may be central to winning and maintaining this line of business in China.Caterpillar, which has not released details of the misconduct, insists it remains dedicated to building this and other businesses in China. But observers and people familiar with the deal say it may have been too heavy handed in its treatment of the ERA deal and that this could taint its whole approach to China.The trouble with ERA began far before the deal was signed. When ERA Mining issued the first of two profit warnings in March 2012, Caterpillar was already locked into its $800m deal to buy the mining machinery group. The US machinery company flew ERA executives to Peoria to explain the profit warning, but decided to push forward with the deal and negotiated for itself some wriggle room in terms of price.As the slowing growth in China took its toll in early 2012 – particularly on the construction and basic industries sectors at the heart of the investment-led economy – Caterpillar was able to put pressure on the main shareholders of ERA to take more of their payments in loan notes whose value could be reduced if the performance of the Chinese company suffered, according to several people familiar with the deal.Nobody close to the deal doubts that Caterpillar’s due diligence was thorough and lengthy – there were operational people and two sets of accountants going over the business and its books. They had tens of people all over its main site in Zhengzhou for several months while they were awaiting Chinese regulatory approval for the deal, according to one person familiar with the process.The $580m writedown – which was double the asset value of the company at the time it was purchased – caught those involved in the deal by surprise. “When you lay the accounting systems of someone like Caterpillar over a small, growing Chinese company there are always going to be discrepancies – but $580m worth?,” says a person close to the deal.The dispute over account misconduct also risks fraying ties with one of ERA’s key shareholders, Li Rubo (John Lee), who has extensive ties in the mining community.“The naive thing Cat has done is throw the main relationship guy under the bus,” says another person familiar with the deal. “John Lee is the one who knows the industry, knows the people and is effectively the lead salesman. What does that do for their prospects in China?”
100;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Investors face end of big US bond returns;;The first rule of investing is that, if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. The second rule of investing is, the Federal Reserve can suspend the first rule of investing.Savers who put their money into bonds have found that, over the past few years, their super-safe investments enjoyed the sort of returns you can normally only get by buying risky assets such as equities. That is thanks to the unprecedented actions of the US central bank to push down interest rates – a bond-buying spree by the Fed that raised bond prices and gave investors a big capital gain on top of the interest income they receive on their holdings.This seems like the year when reality catches up.While the Fed’s buying spree is continuing at the rate of $85bn per month, at least for now, the likelihood of further declines in interest rates has diminished, meaning capital gains could be a thing of the past. The meagre interest income, called the coupon, might be all you get from a bond portfolio this year – and that is if you are lucky.If rates rise, the value of your holdings would fall, and the fear of such an outcome has already caused a sell-off in bonds since the start of this year.The yield on a 10-year US Treasury bond, a market benchmark against which other investments are typically priced, fell as low as 1.38 per cent last July, leaving bond investors facing a classic asymmetry: the remaining downside potential is as nothing compared to how high interest rates could spike if the world economy revives.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank says: “Corporate bond investors are mathematically challenged by low interest rates.”Capital gains have formed a large part of bond investors’ returns, especially for those investing in long-term bonds and junk bonds, flattering the total return figures for bond funds and luring investors who look at those historic returns in fund prospectuses. Repeated financial scares – of a eurozone collapse, a US debt crisis or a Chinese hard landing – have also sent investors scurrying for the perceived safety of bonds.Take a typical, popular fund, the Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade “Admiral Shares” fund. It returned 11.8 per cent last year, juiced by a 6.6 per cent capital gain. The figures in 2011 were 17.3 per cent with an 11.1 per cent capital gain.Or take a single bond, one issued by the equipment maker Caterpillar. Issued at $100 in 2009, its value has appreciated to $129 now, the equivalent of an annual capital gain of more than 5 per cent, even before factoring in an annual interest payment of 7.25 per cent of face value on top of that.Mr Ablin calculates that for total returns on the Caterpillar bond – capital gains and interest together – to hit 5 per cent in the coming three years, interest rates would need, implausibly, to fall to zero.Corporate bond investors are mathematically challenged by low interest rates“It’s been a one-way street for a long time,” says Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “This time last year it was a lot easier to buy investment grade bonds, but now rates are very low. You don’t need to see rates rise that much in order to erode a small coupon.”Market participants have begun debating whether we are at the start of a “great rotation” out of bonds and back into the equity market. Advocates of such a shift point to the end of outsize returns – and the rising risks – in bond funds. But sceptics argue that central banks will fight any upward moves in market interest rates, for fear that higher rates will undercut the economic recovery.“We still see another 18 to 24 months of the Fed being involved in buying bonds,” says Mark Kiesel, portfolio manager at Pimco. “This year alone they are on course to buy over $1tn of Treasury and mortgage bonds, which leaves investors needing to buy something else. If you need income that leaves corporate bonds. But people are cognisant of interest rate risk and are moving into equities.”Arthur Steinmetz, chief investment officer for the Oppenheimer Funds, wonders how long investors will remain afraid of financial calamity. “People haven’t been flooding into bond funds because they were getting a good interest rate, it’s because they were afraid. Capital preservation loomed much larger than income. But 2013 may be the year that people get tired of waiting for the next event that will drive down the value of equities.”The question is whether the mathematical impossibility of keeping up recent bond returns will be enough to prompt a shift.Mr Steinmetz says that, confronted with coupon-only returns that fail to match inflation, investors may reconsider their addiction to bonds. “Sitting around to lose money slowly is not an attractive situation to be in.”
101;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;New twist in Caterpillar-ERA saga;;Caterpillar still owes the sellers of ERA, the Chinese mining machinery company it acquired last year, at least $150m in loan notes, putting a new twist on the saga that has forced the US machinery group to make a $580m write-off.Caterpillar said last month it had uncovered “accounting misconduct” at the Chinese company’s Zhengzhou Siwei subsidiary and would take a goodwill impairment charge of $580m from the $886m it paid for ERA in June.ERA’s controlling shareholder was a vehicle co-owned by American entrepreneur Emory Williams, who has said he was “shocked and dismayed” at Caterpillar’s writedown, and businessman James Thompson III, who is the son-in-law of Mr Williams’ Chinese business partner, Li Rubo.The two men sold 40 per cent of their shares to Caterpillar in cash, and exchanged the remaining 60 per cent for the loan notes. On April 30 this year, Caterpillar will have to pay the first tranche of loan notes, according to filings that are public but have not been previously reported. That payment will be at least $150m, and could increase with a second tranche to a maximum total of $232m if ERA’s profits meet specified levels, according to the filings.Caterpillar chief executive Doug Oberhelman said on Monday: “We were deliberately misled by the accounting misconduct at Siwei [ERA’s subsidiary], and we are considering all options to recover our losses and hold those responsible accountable for their wrongdoing.” A Caterpillar spokesman declined to comment about the outstanding loan notes.In a statement earlier this week, Mr Williams said that he and his business partner “co-operated very closely with the Caterpillar team during their extensive due diligence prior to the acquisition”.Caterpillar’s public statements to date have not alleged that fraud was perpetrated by ERA’s controlling shareholders. However one Hong Kong lawyer believes that if any fraud were established, it could lead to civil settlement that might be discounted against the value of the loan notes, allowing Caterpillar to claw back part of the cost of the ERA deal.Brett King, a senior finance partner at Paul Hastings in Hong Kong, said Caterpillar’s allegations of accounting misconduct could hypothetically lead to litigation by Caterpillar against the controlling shareholders of ERA.“In a typical M&A transaction, the controlling shareholders would be required to make representations and warrants regarding the company they were selling,” he said. “If these representation and warranties were not truthful, it is likely that Caterpillar could assert claims against ERA and may well collect monetary damages,” he said.He added that he did not work on the Caterpillar-ERA deal or have direct knowledge of how their contract was structured.A spokesperson for Mr Williams declined to comment on the loan notes outstanding and declined to comment on the possibility of any future litigation. Mr Thompson could not be reached.
102;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-01-28T20:39:50Z;Caterpillar sees stronger China growth;;Even as Caterpillar, the US-based machinery maker often seen as a barometer of economic activity, predicted continued global economic weakness in the first half of the year and cut its own revenue forecast, the company said it sees stronger GDP growth in China in 2013.In an outlook that “assumes the Chinese government will maintain pro-growth policies throughout 2013,” Douglas Oberhelman, chief executive, told analysts Caterpillar predicted growth near 8.5 per cent on the mainland. The International Monetary Fund forecasts 8.2 per cent.“It’s not going to be a 2010-2011 boom in China, but [rather] an improvement from this year that should be good for commodity prices and as important it should be better for commodity demand,” said Mike DeWalt, chief comptroller.Increased activity in China, which grew at 7.9 per cent in the quarter ending in December, will help boost Caterpillar sales in Australia and South America, among other places that supply China with natural resources, Mr DeWalt said.Announcing worse than expected fourth-quarter results, the world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues forecast full-year 2013 revenues of $60bn to $68bn, compared with the $62.7bn to $69.3bn range it had earlier forecast.Caterpillar, which generates some two-thirds of its revenue outside of North America, said the lowered revenues range “reflects the level of uncertainty we see in the world today”.Fourth-quarter earnings came in well below analyst expectations, and less than half of those during the same period last year, reflecting the same weakness in the global economy that Caterpillar said was likely to continue into 2013.For the quarter ended in December, the company said net income fell to $697m, or $1.04 per share, from $1.55bn, or $2.32 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.70 per share.Earnings were also hit by a charge of $580m, or $0.87 per share, in the fourth quarter after Caterpillar discovered alleged accounting misconduct at a Chinese company it acquired last year.The $886m purchase of ERA Mining Machinery in June represented Caterpillar’s latest attempt to crack China’s annual $64bn machinery market, which is dominated by local companies.Earlier on Monday, Emory Williams, the former chairman of ERA, said he was surprised by the $580m writedown. Mr Williams said in a statement via email: “We were especially surprised by this situation as we co-operated very closely with the Caterpillar team during their extensive due diligence.”On Friday, Caterpillar reported that the fourth quarter had seen the first decline in retail machine sales in more than two and a half years, on a slowdown in demand from Asia and North America.Global machine sales fell 1 per cent during the fourth quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 7 per cent drop in Asia-Pacific sales and a 6 per cent drop in North America sales drove the fall.The company’s power systems business also saw a 2 per cent decline in global retail sales.For the fourth quarter, total revenues were down 6.8 per cent, to $16.1bn, compared with $17.2bn in the same period a year earlier, and matching expectations of $16.1bn.The drop in revenues was driven by a 13 per cent drop in sales in North America, and a 5 per cent drop in sales from the Europe and Middle East division. Revenues from the construction sector fell 25 per cent.Caterpillar said dealers had reduced new machine inventories by about $600m during the quarter, compared to an $800m increase during the same quarter in 2011.Adam Fleck, analyst at Morningstar, said he was encouraged by the company’s China outlook and its view that over 1m new homes will begin construction in the US this year – the most since 2007.“That’s going to help Caterpillar, especially as the US mining market continues to suffer,” Mr Fleck said. “That’s probably going to help offset some of that [mining weakness] in North America.”Shares were up 1.96 per cent to $97.45 by the close.
103;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-01-28T12:12:28Z;Caterpillar in China;Fight with ERA should not be allowed to sink quietly;The more that is revealed, the less clear things become. So it is for most business fights that descend into he-said-she-said. Add China as the backdrop and utter confusion reigns. ERA Mining Machinery’s former chairman Emory Williams said on Monday he was shocked, dismayed and surprised that Caterpillar found misconduct serious enough for it to write off two-thirds of what it paid just seven months ago.This is a funny one. Somehow Caterpillar’s due diligence team, following a “rigorous and robust” process, did not notice accounting misconduct worth $580m. They had six months between the deal being announced and closing. All the wider world – and Mr Williams, he says – knows is that the multiyear cover-up involved revenue recognition and inventory. Still, diligence does not come much simpler than counting mine shaft supports and checking sales receipts. And these issues are hardly a surprise in China, especially when they eventually come to light through a routine stock check.Caterpillar overpaid for ERA, so a writedown should have appeared at some point. ERA was sold for more than 50 times 2010 profits – the last full year there were any – or 3.5 times 2011 sales. A price like that, when the buyer liked to emphasise its target’s rapid growth, leaves no room for, say, a slowdown in China. Take Sany Heavy, ERA’s bigger rival in mining equipment. Between the ERA deal closing in June and Caterpillar’s December year-end book closing, shares of Sany lost a quarter of their value as the industry slowed.The matter accounts for less than a tenth of Caterpillar’s projected earnings. But it should not be allowed to sink quietly. If Caterpillar is right, how a multinational did not spot a problem that seems likely to grace any list of classic accounting tricks is something investors in Caterpillar, and in China generally, deserve to know.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
104;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-01-28T12:01:37Z;ERA ex-chairman breaks silence on Caterpillar;;The former chairman of ERA Mining Machinery said he was “shocked and dismayed” at the $580m writedown on the value of the Chinese company taken by Caterpillar, which bought the business last year.Caterpillar claimed on January 19 that an internal investigation of ERA, which it bought for $886m last June, had “uncovered deliberate, multi-year, co-ordinated accounting misconduct” at its Zhengzhou Siwei subsidiary.In his first public comments on the scandal, Emory Williams, the former chairman, said he had asked Caterpillar for more details on the allegations but had not heard from the US group’s senior management.Mr Williams, who was one of the largest individual shareholders of ERA, with direct ownership of about 16 per cent at the time it was sold, said he was “taking advice on how best to respond to the situation”.“We were shocked and dismayed to learn, from press reports, about the very significant goodwill impairment that Caterpillar is taking in relation to the acquisition of ERA’s subsidiary Siwei,” Mr Williams said in an email statement.“We were especially surprised by this situation as we co-operated very closely with the Caterpillar team during their extensive due diligence,” Mr Williams said.He added that, along with his partner John Lee, who is also known as Li Rubo, he had continued to work with Caterpillar since the acquisition.“Our surprise is compounded by the fact that, as directors of ERA before the acquisition by Caterpillar, when it was a Hong Kong-listed company, we took the company’s fiduciary and reporting responsibilities very seriously.”Shares in Caterpillar have lost some 2 per cent since the writedown was announced.Shares of rival machinery makers have also suffered, including those of US-based Joy Global, which also bought a company – International Mining Machinery – that had close ties to Mr Williams, Mr Li and ERA. Joy Global’s shares are down almost 8 per cent to $63.26 since Caterpillar’s announcement.Joy Global did not respond to a request for comment on its acquisition. Mr Williams declined to comment on his links with IMM. Mr Li could not be reached.Spending more than $1bn, Joy Global bought IMM over several stages between July 2011 and early 2012. When IMM listed in Hong Kong in 2010, Mr Emory and Mr Li controlled 9 per cent of the company, with the rest held by a private equity firm.There had been talks between Siwei and IMM over a potential merger before the former was reverse listed in Hong Kong through its acquisition of ERA in 2009. IMM also had loans outstanding to a vehicle used by Mr Williams and Mr Rubo to hold their interest in Siwei.Additional reporting by Neil Munshi in Chicago
105;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Machinery sales dented at Caterpillar;;Caterpillar has reported its first decline in retail machinery sales in more than two and a half years on a slowdown in demand from Asia and North America.The world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues reported that global machine sales had fallen 1 per cent in the three months ending in December compared to the same period a year earlier.Analysts said the figures were a reflection of a drop in spending by mining companies due to low commodity prices and the general slowdown of the global construction business.A 7 per cent drop in Asia-Pacific sales and a 6 per cent drop in North America drove the fall, even as Latin America saw a 14 per cent rise.The company’s power systems business also saw a 2 per cent drop in global retail sales.Last year, Caterpillar paused production at some plants amid weak global economic conditions. In October, the company cut its full-year 2012 earnings forecast from $9.60 per share to a range of $9.00 to $9.25, and its revenues forecast to $66bn from an earlier range of $68bn to $70bn.Caterpillar will report fourth-quarter and full-year results on Monday.The news comes a week after Caterpillar announced that it would take a charge of around $580m, or $0.87 per share, after it discovered accounting misconduct at a Chinese company it acquired last year. That charge brings the company’s 2012 earnings range down to $8.13-$8.38 per share.The $886m purchase of ERA Mining Machinery in June last year represented Caterpillar’s latest attempt to crack China’s annual $64bn machinery market, which is dominated by local companies. The deal coincided with an economic downturn that has seen the company having to cope with rising inventory and excess manufacturing capacity on the mainland.But Eric Ause, analyst with Fitch Ratings, said Caterpillar’s problem was bigger than China. “Asia is a big part, but Europe is also slow . . . and the US recovery has been weak,” he said.Its shares were down just over 1 per cent to $95.58 at the close.
106;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-01-25T03:24:54Z;Auditors named in Caterpillar-ERA debacle;;Two of the world’s top accounting firms helped conduct due diligence last year for Caterpillar’s $886m acquisition of ERA, the Chinese mining equipment maker that was later alleged to have accounting irregularities.Deloitte and Ernst & Young conducted due diligence for the transaction, according to two sources close to the deal. Deloitte audited the working capital for ERA, while Ernst & Young conducted overall due diligence, one of these people said.Caterpillar said last week it had discovered accounting irregularities at ERA, prompting it to take a goodwill impairment charge of $580m– more than half the value of the acquisition. The US machinery maker said it had found “deliberate, multiyear co-ordinated accounting misconduct” at ERA that was designed to make the company appear more profitable ahead of the acquisition.The involvement of two of the Big Four accounting firms in Caterpillar’s acquisition of ERA is the latest illustration of the problems they have faced in China, where they are accused by investors and regulators of failing to catch systematic fraud at a series of companies with overseas listings.Oliver Meng Rui, professor of accounting and finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said the allegations made by Caterpillar about ERA highlighted the challenges of the traditional due diligence process, under which accounting firms check the books of a target company but typically do not check its underlying assets or business model.“Sometimes it is difficult for them [accountants] to verify the accuracy of the numbers provided by executives,” said Mr Rui. “In cases of intentional fraud, the traces will be covered.”Over the past two years, as a wave of fraud allegations has swept over dozens of China-based companies that are listed overseas, several of the world’s best-known accounting firms have found themselves embroiled in legal battles relating to the charges. In December, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged the Chinese affiliates of five leading accounting firms with violating securities law after they refused to produce paperwork related to fraud investigations at nine Chinese companies.Caterpillar’s regular auditor is PwC. ERA’s regular auditor was RSM Nelson Wheeler, a Hong Kong accounting firm that is part of RSM International, the world’s sixth-largest network of accounting firms. RSM Nelson Wheeler declined to comment.Deloitte said it “was not involved in any due diligence pertaining to working capital” but declined to comment further. Ernst & Young declined to comment on or confirm its involvement with the Caterpillar-ERA acquisition.ERA is a manufacturer of hydraulic roof supports used in Chinese coal mines, and it listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange through a reverse merger in 2010. In 2010, its most profitable year, ERA reported profit of HK $135m. In 2011, it reported a loss of HK $14m, according to the annual report it filed to the Hong Kong Exchange.Additional reporting by Neil Munshi in Chicago and Ed Crooks in New York
107;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2013-01-19T01:35:41Z;China accounts probe hits Caterpillar;;Caterpillar, the US manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, has uncovered accounting misconduct at a Chinese company it acquired last year, forcing it to take a charge of about $580m, representing almost one-tenth of its 2012 earnings.The Illinois-based company said an internal investigation of ERA Mining Machinery, a Chinese manufacturer of underground coal-mining equipment which it bought for $886m last June, had “uncovered deliberate, multiyear, co-ordinated accounting misconduct” at its Siwei subsidiary, based in Zhengzhou.Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar chief executive, said: “The actions carried out by these individuals are offensive and completely unacceptable. This conduct does not represent, in any way, shape or form, the way Caterpillar does business or how we expect our employees to work”.He added: “Once our investigation confirmed that misconduct had taken place at Siwei, we moved quickly and decisively to hold the responsible leaders directly accountable for the wrongdoing”.The company said it had “removed several senior managers at Siwei who were responsible for the misconduct”, and installed a new leadership team.The ERA deal had been seen as an important move for Caterpillar’s ambition to establish itself in the Chinese mining equipment market, where customers have tended to favour local suppliers.The charge Caterpillar has taken, a goodwill writedown, is equivalent to two-thirds of the price it paid.The charge will cost an estimated $0.87 from earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2012: almost 10 per cent of the $9.10 per share that analysts had expected for the entire year.In a statement, Caterpillar said the discovery of misconduct “does not change our plans to develop, grow and improve the business”.It added that its strategy was “to expand in the rapidly growing Chinese coal mining equipment industry utilising the Siwei roof support products and manufacturing capabilities, combined with Caterpillar’s strong commitment to product innovation and safety”.For the time being, at least, it plans to retain the Siwei brand.Caterpillar said the misconduct had been “purposely designed to overstate the profitability of the company prior to our acquisition”.It added that it first became concerned in November, when, during a check of Siwei’s inventory being conducted as part of the integration process, it identified discrepancies “between the inventory recorded in Siwei’s accounting records and the company’s actual physical inventory”.It launched a review, which is continuing, but has already identified “inappropriate accounting practices involving improper cost allocation that resulted in overstated profit”, as well as “improper revenue recognition practices involving early and, at times unsupported, revenue recognition”.As far as Caterpillar is aware, no one has been arrested or charged in connection with the misconduct.The company also defended the due diligence done for the ERA deal, saying: “We believe our process is rigorous and robust …Siwei was a publicly traded company with audited financial statements.”
108;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar – a bet on global growth;Company’s comments on its results are a classic of corporate equivocality;"That one of the best ways to have played the developing-economy boom has been to buy a hundred-year-old US company is delightfully ironic. Caterpillar shares have returned almost 500 per cent during the past decade, despite having fallen by a fourth from their peak early this year. Revenue tripled over the period; earnings per share sextupled.Still, it makes a certain amount of sense that Caterpillar should outperform the miners, construction companies, and railways that are its core customers. It is diversified, so, as a boom in one geography or commodity turns to bust, the company does not feel the full impact, as long as another area is picking up speed. It is also the biggest player in a scale business.But is building piles of money with large yellow trucks now over for investors? World growth is sluggish and it is anyone’s guess whether (a) emerging-world demand is a long-term trend that rich-world troubles cannot restrain for long or (b) global deleveraging will keep global output low indefinitely. Caterpillar’s comments from its mildly disappointing third-quarter earnings report, released on Monday, were a small classic of corporate equivocality. The company expects world economic growth to improve but not until the second half of next year and then not by much.Bulls on the stock price comfort themselves with its low valuation. It is selling for eight times next years’ expected earnings (below most of its peers and most of its customers), has a dividend yield of more than 2 per cent and an admirably clean balance sheet. But this should not reassure anyone. A quick look back at the company’s performance in 2009 makes clear what a mistake it is looking at one year of earnings; operating leverage works both ways. Caterpillar’s price is 22 times its average earnings per share for the past 10 years – dead even with the S&P 500 when it is measured the same way. Caterpillar remains what it has always been: a way to bet on global growth. If that bet goes wrong, the valuation will not provide much protection.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
109;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-10-22T16:16:35Z;Caterpillar backtracks on year’s forecast;;Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving, construction and mining machines, often seen as a barometer of economic activity, has cut its full-year profits forecast sharply, saying dealers are pulling back on orders in the face of economic uncertainty.As it announced third-quarter financial figures, Caterpillar reduced its forecast for full-year revenues to $66bn from an earlier range of $68bn to $70bn. The earnings-per-share outlook, which had been in a range centred on $9.60, was cut to a range of $9.00 to $9.25.The third-quarter figures were nevertheless the best in its history as it benefited from a 13 per cent year-on-year increase to $5.21bn in sales in its resource industries segment, which supplies miners. It also benefited from a one-off, $273m gain from the sale of a majority stake in its third-party logistics business. Even the reduced forecast would produce record net profits and revenues for the year, the company said.Net profits were 49 per cent higher from last year to $1.7bn, on revenue up 5 per cent to $15.7bn. Earnings per diluted share also rose 49 per cent, to $2.54.The company said it had temporarily shut down some factories and laid off some workers in response to the worse than expected world economic conditions.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said Caterpillar had seen continued economic weakening and uncertainty as it moved through the year.“It’s definitely impacting our business with dealers intending to lower inventories and mining customers delaying some projects and reducing orders,” he said.The company expects revenues in 2013 – which it predicts will see worldwide economic weakness but not a recession – to be between 5 per cent below and 5 per cent above the levels for this year, with dealers continuing to run down their inventories during the first half. It forecast continuing growth in the US, China and most of the developing world but “continuing difficulty” in Europe.Mr Oberhelman said 2012 would be a record year on both the top line and bottom line for the company.“What we’re looking at is going into 2013 with a lot of uncertainties, most of which will be cleared out – good or bad – in the first half.”Shares rose 0.98 per cent to $84.68.
110;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Mining suppliers hit by fall in demand;;The decade-long boom in the mining services industry has come to an abrupt end as a pullback in mining investment reduces demand for equipment such as trucks and shovels, putting pressure on companies such as Caterpillar.For the past 10 years miners have struggled with soaring cost inflation and long waiting periods for equipment and teams of engineers, as companies raced to dig new mines to meet the voracious demand from China and the rest of Asia.But as companies such as BHP Billiton and others now start to cut back spending, executives told the Financial Times that the cost of equipment and services was starting to come down.“We have seen contractor rates in particular starting to go down, rolling back some of the unsustainable cost increases of recent years,” said Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio Tinto.Richard Adkerson, head of US-based copper miner Freeport-McMoRan, added that cost inflation had “come down a little bit”.The largest contractors for the mining industry include Bechtel and Fluor of the US, Leighton of Australia, Weir Minerals of the UK and Hatch of Canada.The pullback in mining investment has been a key topic of discussion at LME Week, the annual gathering of the metals and mining industry, with traders, bankers and investors debating whether the slowdown in projects will be enough to offset the relatively gloomy outlook for demand as China slows.Mining executives reported greater availability of equipment as projects were cancelled or deferred.Thomas Keller, head of Codelco of Chile, the world’s largest copper producer, said waiting times had “improved significantly” and that “we would expect suppliers to start reducing prices”.Mike Henry, group executive at BHP Billiton, added that the waiting period for the delivery of trucks, had fallen from “multiple years to a few months”.The comments bode badly for groups such as Joy Global, one of the biggest manufacturers of shovels, and Caterpillar, which in 2010 bet big on the sector by buying Bucyrus for nearly $9bn.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive of Caterpillar, last month said the business was “soft right now”, calling the recent years a “bubble”. Caterpillar cut its earnings outlook to 2015 to $12-$18 a share, down from $15-$20 a share previously.Joy Global also recently reported that its orders were 25 per cent lower in the three months to the end of July than in the same period of last year.Mining executives said exploration service companies were particularly suffering as junior companies cut back on their spending due to lack of financing. Diego Hernández, chief executive of Antofagasta, said: “In exploration, there was a lack of drilling equipment. Now you can secure long-term contracts at reasonable prices.”Komatsu and Hitachi of Japan, Stockholm-listed Atlas Copco and Sandvik, and Sydney-listed Boart Longyear are also among the top manufacturers in the sector. Others impacted are likely to be groups such as FLSmidth and ABB, which produce specialised mining equipment.
111;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Just three months ago analysts had forecast growth of 1.9 per cent.In the past three months, warnings from large companies about reduced full-year profits due to global economic weakness fuelled this pessimistic view.FedEx and UPS, often seen as barometers for world economic health, cut their full-year guidance during their last earnings releases, citing the slowdown in global trade.In August, talking to the Financial Times, the chief executive of Caterpillar, bellwether of the industrial economy, warned of the greater uncertainty about global growth, predicting it could take another five years before Europe’s economy begins to grow.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said: “We expect corporate profits will be negative and revenues soft, as the global slowdown and below average economic growth in the US has affected companies.”The earnings season starts with Alcoa reporting on Tuesday, followed by JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Friday.However, downbeat earnings expectations are yet to weigh on the broad market with the S&P 500 up more than 16 per cent so far this year. Stock prices are being supported by the Federal Reserve buying large amounts of bonds, which lowers interest rates and boosts the attractiveness of riskier assets such as equities.“If we see that the markets do not correct even after earnings disappoint and guidance gets worse, then it will be clear that fundamentals have given way to the Fed,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.Equity investors are also looking beyond the most recent quarter toward the final quarter of the year given the expectation that profits will rebound. S&P 500 companies are on course for record cash profits for 2012.That outlook may suffer from downward revisions should companies express caution about their future earnings in their results in the coming weeks.“Even with lowered expectations, earnings could disappoint and place stocks under pressure,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “It’s worrying to see the warnings from Fed Ex and other weakness from the transport sector that suggests this will not be a good quarter.”Financials are expected to be one of the few bright spots with analysts expecting earnings growth for the quarter of 10 per cent according to FactSet.Ahead of earnings season, companies tend to downplay expectations and look to surprise the market with better results.“We expect more upside surprises in the third quarter, primarily because consumer health is in a good shape and with 80 per cent of companies tied to consumers their earnings will be better than the consensus estimate,” said Phil Orlando, chief equities strategist at Federated.
113;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-09-25T21:12:45Z;Barnes & Noble falls amid outlook doubts;;Barnes & Noble shares fell sharply on Tuesday despite jumping to strong gains early in the day’s trading session after the bookseller said it would enhance its popular tablet device to compete with those designed by rivals Amazon and Apple.The company’s shares added as much as 6.9 per cent in morning trading after it said it would add video streaming capabilities to its Nook tablets this autumn.The move comes amid stiff competition from other consumer gadget offerings such as Amazon’s Kindle and Apple’s iPad.Barnes & Noble shares have dropped more than 15 per cent since the start of the year as investors weigh whether the company can compete.Last month, the bookseller said it would launch the Nook in the UK, marking the first time it has expanded overseas in its history.Despite the early gains, shares in the company turned negative along with the broader markets throughout the day. Shares in Barnes & Noble fell 3.7 per cent to $12.26.Meanwhile, Amazon shares lost 1 per cent to $252.54, which unveiled the latest iterations of its Kindle a few weeks ago.Earlier in the morning, Amazon made its boldest move into the financial services sector as the ecommerce conglomerate said it was in partnership with Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, to offer Wall Street brokers a chance to store key regulator data on its “cloud computers”.Nasdaq OMX shares fell 2.3 per cent to $23.17.Apple lost 2.5 per cent to $673.54 as reports said a key factory in China where its gadgets, such as the new iPhone 5, are assembled was set to reopen after mass riots took place earlier in the week.Overall, US stocks accelerated losses throughout the afternoon even as fresh housing data showed that home prices grew at their fastest year-on-year rate in more than two years in July.The benchmark S&P 500 dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,441.59 as fears of instability within the eurozone, which faces an ongoing debt crisis, crept back into the market. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.4 per cent to 3,165.71.Homebuilders saw no gains despite the housing data. Lennar fell 1.9 per cent to $36.26 and DR Horton lost 1.4 per cent to $21.74.On Monday, Lennar posted estimate-beating net profits for the third quarter and said Americans were becoming more confident about home purchases.All sectors on the S&P 500 recorded losses, with healthcare stocks seeing the most limited declines.Wall Street investors continued to debate whether a run in US equities – that has put the S&P 500 up more than 14 per cent since the start of the year – would continue.Analysts at Barclays said recent action by the Federal Reserve, which earlier this month said it would extend its monetary operations to stimulate the flagging US economy, has supported equity prices.“But to push equities significantly higher, the economic or public policy outlook needs to improve,” they said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.8 per cent to 13,457.55. Shares in Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, fell 4.3 per cent to $87.01 as it cut its long-term profit forecasts due to reduced capital spending by large commodity producers.But Michael Jaffe, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the company’s business would benefit from a $160m infrastructure stimulus plan announced in China earlier in the month and retained his “buy” rating on its shares.“We think Caterpillar will be a particular beneficiary as the plan to build highways, ports and other transportation structures [in China] should boost demand for its construction and mining equipment,” he said.Caterpillar shares have fallen 4 per cent since the start of the year, underperforming the Dow, which has risen 10.2 per cent.Other cyclical materials and industrials companies also came under pressure as fears of global growth weighed on investors.Joy Global, which also makes mining equipment, lost 5.5 per cent to $56.88 as the warning from its rival reverberated across the sector.Nabors Industries fell 5.4 per cent to $14.26 as the land drilling contractor also saw investors dump its shares.Shares in the New York Times Company, the US publisher, rose 0.1 per cent to $9.76 after it said it would see a gain of $100m in its fourth-quarter results after the sale of Indeed.com, a job search website.The company’s shares touched their best mark for the year on Tuesday and are up 24.2 per cent since the start of the year.
114;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-09-25T10:06:37Z;Japan’s smaller companies outperform;;Gains for stocks in Tokyo helped lift regional indices on Tuesday, with Japan’s broadest indicators boosted by smaller companies.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 0.3 per cent to 9,091.54, but the broader Topix climbed 0.5 per cent, while the Topix Small index advanced 1 per cent.Smaller companies were boosted by a survey showing the Small Business Confidence index improved in September. The measure, compiled by Shoko Chukin Bank, rose to 45.1 from August’s level of 44.8.Small-cap regional banks were among the best performing stocks, with Taiko Bank climbing 9.6 per cent to Y239, while The Miyazaki Bank added 7.4 per cent to Y217.Back among the large caps, Suzuki Motor was up 4.9 per cent to Y1,534 on reports that its Indian joint venture Maruti Suzuki was set to raise prices. Maruti Suzuki produces the biggest selling car on the subcontinent – the Alto 800 – and launches its latest model next month.China stocks were mixed, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index ending flat at 20,698.68, while the mainland Shanghai Composite edged 0.2 per cent lower to 2,029.29.Resource stocks struggled on both indexes as global growth concerns continued to undermine the sector.Zhongjin Gold fell 4.5 per cent to Rmb17.29 as gold prices fell overnight, while rival Chenzhou Mining Group lost 4 per cent to Rmb21. Iron and steel group Citic Pacific was the biggest faller on the Hang Seng, down 4.1 per cent to HK$9.39.Shantui Construction Machinery, the maker of earth-moving equipment, fell 3.6 per cent to Rmb4.59 after US rival Caterpillar cut its 2015 earnings forecast, warning of “anaemic” growth through to this date.Prada, the fashion group, dipped 3.5 per cent to HK$57.85, likely the result of profit-taking after rising nearly 70 per cent so far this year. The luxury goods maker reported a 59 per cent rise in first-half net profit, which was in line with expectations.Its results had a positive effect on rival Esprit Holdings, however, which climbed 4.3 per cent to HK$13.26.Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing fell 2.6 per cent to HK$115.80 on news that it will issue $500m worth of convertible bonds to finance its acquisition of the London Metals Exchange.Commodity-related shares figured at both ends of Sydney’s main index, but the most powerful pull was to the downside, leaving the S&P/ASX 200 down 0.3 per cent at 4,372.86.In Seoul, the Kospi index fell 0.6 per cent to 1,991.41, while the Indian BSE Sensex index edged 0.3 per cent higher to 18,701.56.
115;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;N Ireland seeks decision on rate-setting;;Northern Ireland’s political and business leaders have urged the UK Treasury to stop dithering over devolving corporation tax rate-setting powers after the loss of several hundred jobs at one of the province’s biggest employers.But, after a meeting on Thursday between Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland first minister, and Theresa Villiers, the new secretary of state, Ms Villiers warned it was not possible to know if this could happen.FG Wilson, a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc, a US multinational, said on Thursday it is shedding up to 760 engineering workers as it moves production of one of its generator products to China to cut costs. It made the announcement as the Northern Ireland executive held a jobs summit to try to tackle rising unemployment in the region. Figures out this week show it climbed above the UK average, to 8.2 per cent, for the first time since the recession began.“This is a major blow to the economy and shows the importance of reducing corporation tax to make Northern Ireland more attractive for investment,” Sammy Wilson, minister for finance, told the FT.He said the jobs losses would have gone ahead regardless of a cut in the corporation tax rate, because of a range of factors affecting the company, but that a lower rate would help replace these jobs. He warned of growing frustration at the long delay in agreeing the detail and cost of proposals with the Treasury.“We need a decision now because the delay is causing uncertainty for investors and cynicism. I need to know what the cost of cutting corporation tax is for future budgets and foreign investors need to know what the rate will be for them,” said Mr Wilson.Speaking on UTV, Ms Villiers said, “I can certainly see a case for doing it but the reality is there are some quite significant technical and practical issues and ultimately we will have to see what is possible.”Political and business leaders in the province have run a vocal campaign to be allowed to reduce the rate. They argue it would help them compete with the Republic, which charges 12.5 per cent, compared with 24 per cent in the UK. They also note it would help boost an economy hurt by three decades of conflict and heavy reliance on the public sector, which supports almost a third of jobs, compared with an average of 21 per cent elsewhere in the UK.Talks on rate setting powers between treasury officials, ministers from the Northern Ireland executive and the secretary of state were due to finish in the summer. But this deadline was missed because of disagreements over the estimated cost of a cut. A date has not been set for the next meeting of the tax working group.Under EU rules a cut would have to be accompanied by a reduction in Northern Ireland’s “block grant” from Westminster. The Treasury has predicted the block grant would have to fall by more than £500m. Local ministers dispute the methodology behind the figure and say it should be less than £250m, arguing some of the extra VAT and income taxes generated by increased business activity from the reduced rate should flow to the province.Northern Ireland politicians have become concerned that the appetite to devolve powers to set corporation tax from Westminster has diminished. The promotion of Owen Paterson, the former secretary of state for Northern Ireland to environment secretary, has also removed a strong supporter for the project.However, a UK government source said Ms Villiers had not been sent to the province to kill the plan.
116;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-08-24T15:59:22Z;Uncertainty is the only safe prediction;The financial world is preoccupied by how little it knows;"This is the summer of uncertainty. Chief executives, money managers, analysts and central bankers are preoccupied by how little they know. With more tumult in the eurozone ahead, the US racing towards a “fiscal cliff” and China slowing down, conventional wisdom in the financial world says the future is especially unknowable right now. If you have lousy returns, blame uncertainty.The uncertainty consensus is flattering: it implies our age is uniquely on edge. But it offers no useful insight. Investors who wait for resolution will be the investors who waited too long.Evidence of the financial world’s epistemic turn is not hard to find. Companies as varied as Cargill, the world’s biggest agricultural commodities trader; CBRE Group, the commercial real estate firm; Legg Mason, the fund manager; and Kraft Foods all lament economic uncertainty in their recent reporting. Often they say uncertainty is “heightened” to emphasise the current state of doubt.Some companies have tried to outline the duration or magnitude of uncertainty. Cooper, a tyre company, “expects uncertainty to persist in the global economic environment” through 2012, though it’s not so certain about uncertainty in 2013. The chief executive of earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar this week told the Financial Times: “There’s never been a more unpredictable set of tea leaves than right now.” The meme has even crept into the Federal Reserve. Minutes of its monetary policy meeting released on Wednesday showed its members believed economic uncertainty had given consumers and investors pause. Some acknowledged “an unusually high level of uncertainty” had blurred their own outlooks.Empirical proof of uncertainty is lacking, however. The US consumer sentiment index is sharply higher than a year ago and retail sales have strengthened, hardly signs of Americans paralysed by anxiety.Companies are not hoarding money. Among non-financial companies in the S&P 500 stock index, growth in cash on corporate balance sheets has slowed below 10 per cent a year for the first time since late 2008 as companies boosted dividends or bought back stock, according to S&P Capital IQ.The S&P 500 this week hit the highest level since May 2008. The Vix index, which tracks market expectations of future stock volatility, has declined. Meanwhile, fixed-income investors are vacuuming up higher-risk junk corporate and municipal bonds.Gold jumped above $1,670 a troy ounce but the catalyst was the Fed signalling more stimulus, not uncertainty. And metals boosters are conflicted over the meaning of uncertainty. The World Gold Council industry group attributes a decline in gold demand in the second quarter “to the particularly challenging global economic climate and market uncertainty”. But a report from a leading issuer of gold-backed funds reads: “Precious Metals in Demand as Macro Uncertainty Soars”.There are doubtless plenty of risks to be unsure about. First is the future of the eurozone as wrangling begins anew over aid to Greece. Second is the US. If lawmakers allow tax rises and budget cuts to occur as scheduled on January 1 – the so-called “fiscal cliff” – the US could fall into recession. Third is the gathering slowdown in China.But these are, as former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld liked to say, the “known unknowns”. The risk of bad outcomes is presumably priced into assets.Of greater concern are risks no one has contemplated. But these concerns are true to every age, not just ours. Indeed, investors could have used a little more uncertainty in the past decade as they bought trashy mortgage-backed securities. Interesting fact: FT archives show 2,877 stories with the word “uncertainty” in 2005 before the subprime bubble burst. Less than nine months into 2012, the story count was 3,290. Which year will prove more critical for markets?The question cannot be answered. Uncertainty is the foundation of financial markets, the source of risk and opportunity. It is not an abnormality worth dwelling upon. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote in his book On Certainty: “Doubt gradually loses its sense.”gregory.meyer@ft.com"
117;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US industrial groups partner for training;;Jeff Owens recalls how he used to become frustrated with the mismatch between the entry-level workers he was seeking and the skills of young people leaving high school or college.“People coming out of high school just don’t have the skills necessary to work in this industry,” says the chief executive of Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include Caterpillar and Honeywell.“They have to have skills around hydraulics, electronics, computers, software,” Mr Owens says. “Community colleges were not training to the level we needed for our world – machine maintenance. They were training for welders, for machine operators. Our focus is on the guys who service and repair the machines.”Mr Owens established an in-house apprentice programme, but he says it was expensive to run and young people were put off by the fact that it did not earn them college credits.Then he approached a local state-funded community college, proposing that they jointly develop a curriculum.From an initial 20 graduates five years ago, the two-year programme has grown to 60 people. Some 200 alumni have gone on to work for ATS.Mr Owens’s staff serve as adjunct professors and he gives scholarships to the children and grandchildren of employees and customers, paying their tuition fees and offering work experience.While larger groups can afford in-house training schemes, small and medium-sized US industrial companies facing a lack of qualified young workers are increasingly taking the situation in to their own hands and forming partnerships with educational institutions to train workers with the skills they need.Only one in five employers use training and development programmes to fill the skills gap internally, while only 6 per cent team up with outside educational programmes, a recent survey by Manpower Group has found.“The bottom line for youth employment is that companies’ proactive talent management strategies must include recruiting potentially trainable workers, including young people and investing in training these individuals in the specific skills needed to deliver a business strategy,” the report, Wanted: Energised, career-driven youth, said.Such partnerships are still unusual, however. Although 93 per cent of manufacturers said they faced some kind of skills shortage, in a survey last year by the Manufacturing Institute, an industry body, only 14 per cent are working with technical and community colleges. But the institute’s Jennifer McNelly says the numbers are increasing. “We are seeing it become part of the solution,” she says.While Mr Owens’s company is large enough to support its own programme, smaller manufacturers are clubbing together to attract and train young people in the skills they are looking for.Michael Araten, chief executive of Rodon, a small plastic injection moulding manufacturer near Philadelphia with 100 staff and an annual turnover of more than $20m, formed a consortium of 50 local manufacturers two years ago. It approached local technical schools, described the skills its members needed and pledged to offer jobs to graduates where possible.The programme now trains up to 20 young people a year. Because the manufacturers all have specific needs, Mr Araten says the aim is as much about marketing manufacturing to young people as developing particular skills. “We didn’t change their curriculum,” he says. “It was more to get the message out that there are jobs here in the marketplace.”Some companies have gone even further to show young people the kinds of job manufacturing offers. Tailored Label Products, of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, has turned part of its factory into a classroom for teenagers who are struggling at high school or have dropped out. The company, which has 75 employees, makes labels for customers including Rockwell Automation and Eaton.The students learn in the classroom for two hours a day and spend six hours a day working at businesses in the area. It is a programme that contradicts mainstream thinking that schools should simply prepare people for university, says Tracy Tenpenny, vice-president of Tailored Label Products.The focus on four-year college degrees is a perennial gripe of US industrial companies, many of which argue that technical training would better serve young people when they come to look for employment.According to Ms McNelly, many college courses that offer training for manufacturing jobs are not actually helping, because they are not designed in consultation with industry. “A lot of people go through manufacturing education but are they achieving industry certifications? Not all are right now,” she says.In response, the Manufacturing Institute has developed its own national credential to teach a set of standard competencies for industrial jobs. The US federal government is encouraging companies to train young people, asking them to commit to taking on a certain number. More than 300,000 commitments have been secured this year, says Adriana Kugler, chief economist at the Department of Labor.Many employers balk at the idea of the government setting standards for skills education, saying that should be left to industry. However, many also say the government could do more to push basic science, mathematics and engineering skills.Ultimately, manufacturers hope that by demonstrating to young people the career choices available, they can foster more interest in acquiring the relevant skills. “The education system is measured on how well we can get kids to college,” says Mr Tenpenny. “There’s no room in the system for kids who aren’t going to college. That has to change.”
118;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Policy makers need to reduce uncertainty;Private sector wants assurance that risk of eurozone break-up is low;Following the financial crisis, economic recoveries have been disappointingly slow. We believe that elevated levels of uncertainty are one reason why.Currently, the most obvious driver of higher uncertainty is the euro crisis, as a disorderly break-up of economic and monetary union would “crunch” global output. A second factor is the US’s approaching “fiscal cliff” – a sharp fiscal tightening that will transpire unless policy makers quickly do something.Uncertainty affects activity because, whenever companies consider making investments which entail upfront (“sunk”) costs, they need also to consider the benefit of waiting – and investing instead at some future date. Recently, as policy makers have dithered, companies have decided to postpone making investments. Likewise, consumers have postponed purchasing “big-ticket” durables.Obtaining accurate quantitative measures of uncertainty is not easy. Recent academic research has tried to obtain proxies in a variety of ways.Most such measures suggest that, since the financial crisis, uncertainty has risen markedly with the move in Europe especially significant. This is consistent with the chief executive of Caterpillar telling this newspaper that it was harder to predict what would happen to the global economy than at any time in his 37-year career.The effects of uncertainty are likely large. One study suggests it may have depressed US gross domestic product by more than 3 percentage points between 2006 and 2011.Currently, corporate boards around the world are reluctant to invest because they fear that some eurozone event could trigger a “Lehman moment” and instantly overturn the conclusions of the discounted cash flow analysis of the projects they are reviewing. It would clearly be unrealistic to expect the fiscal and banking union that is needed to make EMU sustainable anytime soon. Therefore, European policy makers need soon to find ways of reassuring private sector decision makers that the risk of a disorderly break-up is low while they work on completing monetary union. Hence, it is not surprising that many were initially cheered by Mario Draghi’s assertion that the European Central Bank would do “whatever it takes” to save the euro.Many have worried that the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism are too small to bail out Spain and Italy. In that regard, the ECB’s promise (albeit a conditional one) to undertake open market operations of a size adequate to achieve its objectives is very important. For under the new framework, both countries can potentially be saved. This should materially reduce the probability of the “disaster” outcome of EMU breaking up with inordinately high costs.Last year, we argued that elevated perceptions of “disaster” risk were an important driver of the extraordinarily high equity risk premium. Last December, we gauged the market-implied probability of a disaster, in which GDP in the US drops as much as 20 per cent, to be as high as 7.5 per cent. Today, we estimate it to be even higher, at about 10 per cent, which some would regard as excessively fearful. Were, however, the ECB to deliver promptly and forcefully, it would surely reduce this probability to below where it was last December. That would have a large impact on the relative performance of bonds versus equities.Equally, the benefits of reduced uncertainty for economic growth should not be underestimated. If the European authorities can convince companies and consumers that the chances of a disorderly break-up have fallen sharply, then the investment projects that were previously postponed are likely to be allowed to go ahead. Likewise, with consumer durable purchases. This “catch up” effect can have a powerful effect on growth.As always with matters involving the eurozone, the devil is in the details. We do not, as yet, know much about the ECB’s proposals, or how it is going to credibly pre-commit regarding seniority. The ECB has said that its intervention will be conditional on governments doing the right thing. But will the Spanish and Italian governments voluntarily do what the ECB desires? Or might further market pressures be needed for them to act? Looking further ahead, what if a country misses its programme targets? Is it credible that the ECB will provoke a financial crisis by pulling the plug? And, if it does not, might this not lead to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations?Even in a good scenario, the ride is likely to be bumpy – especially when the region is already mired in recession and with event risk high. However, those who wish for a sustainable global recovery must hope that the ECB and the eurozone governments are able to conjure up means of rapidly and materially reducing the “tail risk” relating to an EMU break-up.Sushil Wadhwani is a partner at Caxton Associates/Wadhwani Asset Management.

119;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Caterpillar warns on global uncertainty;;The global economic outlook is more uncertain than at the start of the crisis in late 2008, according to Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues and a bellwether of the industrial economy.In an interview with the Financial Times, Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, also predicted that it could take another five years before Europe’s economy begins to grow again in earnest.Mr Oberhelman said it was harder to predict what would happen to the global economy over the coming year than at any time in his 37-year career at Caterpillar.“There’s never been a more unpredictable set of tea leaves than right now,” he said. “Even in 2008 and 2009, US housing was already dying and had been for two years. We saw that.”“I don’t think the situation is as grave as it was in 2008, but the uncertainty, the storm clouds are around things that none of us know about – like what will happen with the political situation in Europe,” Mr Oberhelman saidThe Caterpillar chief said that barring Europe, most big economies looked unlikely to contract, although he said it was not clear whether they would grow significantly.“Virtually no segment today in the US is signalling any recession,” Mr Oberhelman said. “It’s also not signalling a boom. China has bottomed and I think everybody agrees – the question is whether it’ll snap back or be flat, but it won’t disintegrate. Brazil has bottomed.”“As we look at all of the economic stimulus around the world, virtually all the governments were not as aggressive as they should have been and that’s why we’re feeling a soft spot now.”
120;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-08-19T16:13:39Z;Caterpillar ready to dig out of any eventuality;Construction equipment maker hedges its optimism;Doug Oberhelman is generally an optimist, but these days he sounds a lot less confident about his optimism.“I think the glass is half-full, but it could be half-empty,” says Caterpillar’s chief executive. “I think 2013 will be better than 2012, because of all the easing and stimulus we’ve had. But there are political events that none of us can foresee that could derail everything.”Some investors have been left confused by this hedged outlook. In its quarterly earnings call last month, Mr Oberhelman said the global economy would “definitely get better” in 2013 and the company raised its 2012 profit forecast. On the other hand, Caterpillar also lowered its sales guidance for 2012 and emphasised that it could cut jobs quickly if necessary.“I can paint an optimistic picture and I can paint a pessimistic picture,” Mr Oberhelman says. “But what we worry about at Caterpillar is: what’s the base case? What do we think will happen? I think we’ll muddle through, hopefully with no political cataclysms and 2013 should look slightly better than 2012. But it’s not going to be a lot better.”Europe is the region most likely to provide a catastrophic economic or political upset to the global economy, but it is the slowdown in China that has most surprised Caterpillar, a company that has invested heavily in the country and other emerging markets and makes two-thirds of its revenues outside North America.The manufacturer warned in April that it had overestimated Chinese demand for construction equipment, saying its inventories in the country were so high it would export 2,300 excavators from China to other developing countries.Nevertheless, Mr Oberhelman says that while Caterpillar has reduced some capacity in China and slowed its expansion plans, he believes the company’s long-term future depends on sticking to its programme of building new factories to serve the country’s construction market.“We’ve been reluctant to disinvest in China, even through this monumental slowdown,” he says. “I’ve seen China every time for the past 30 years come roaring back. We can’t be caught short on capacity and inventory to sell when that happens.”China, Mr Oberhelman points out, is still massively “under-excavated”, by which he means that per capita excavator usage in the country is much lower than other big economies. “They’re way under-excavated,” he says. “You have to take a long view there. We are staged for a decade down the road and longer.”As far as the US is concerned, he says partisan politics are deterring investment. “Until we see some clarity from Washington, most businesses are going to be fairly conservative with their cash,” he says. “That will hamper growth. The US wants to grow. Housing has bottomed. But right now there’s too much uncertainty.”So will the US general election in November dispel the uncertainty? He is not confident of that, either. “I don’t see a clearing of dysfunction and gridlock with a new term, whoever the president is. That will mean continued uncertainty for business and continued caution for our customers.”Mr Oberhelman notes, however, that there have been less-publicised recent examples of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill on economic issues, such as the passage of the highway bill and trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama.In any case, he says the industries he serves have cut back so much that lower levels of growth will feed through quickly. “Our business, our dealers and our contract base around the country have staged ourselves cost-wise for a very low level of business,” he says. “We’re still less than half of the construction-equipment activity from the peak of 2008.”“In the six, seven years of downturn we’ve seen in the housing market, all of that equipment has aged or left,” he notes. “So as jobs come along, those orders are flowing through either to new inventory or new orders.”Ultimately, Mr Oberhelman says, in this time of great uncertainty, his job is to prepare Caterpillar for the unexpected. “We’re prepared to be nimble,” he says.“We’ve got our hands on all the levers – forward, back and stop. Whatever we need to do, we’ll do.”
121;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Caterpillar warns on industrial slowdown;;Caterpillar sounded a warning on the state of the global industrial economy by lowering its full-year sales outlook, downgrading its growth projections and warning it could rapidly cut large numbers of jobs if the situation worsened.The world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues cut the top end of its sales and revenue outlook for 2012 to $68bn-$70bn from its prior forecast of $68bn-$72bn.Caterpillar, which generates some two-thirds of its revenue outside of North America, said the strengthening of the US dollar would wipe about $1bn off its balance sheet, while weaker economic growth would reduce its earnings by a further $1bn.The manufacturer said it now anticipated that the US economy would expand by 2 per cent this year, down from the 3 per cent it projected in April, while the global economy would grow 2.5 per cent, down from its prior outlook of 3 per cent. Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said he expected “anaemic” global economic growth over the next 12 to 24 months.However, the company stressed it was still on course for a year of record profits and revenues, and raised its full-year profit outlook to $9.60 per share from its prior forecast of $9.50. Caterpillar explained its improved profit forecast and lower revenue outlook by saying it was achieving better underlying operating performance.“Caterpillar’s success in 2012 is occurring despite US construction activity that remains depressed and well below the prior peak, the problems facing eurozone economies and economic concerns in China,” said Mr Oberhelman.Nevertheless, he cautioned that if the global economy deteriorated further, the company could cut jobs aggressively, as it did at the start of the 2008 crisis, when Caterpillar’s global workforce shrank by 35,000 workers – 17 per cent of its staff. He said it could also slash its capital spending plans.“While we’re expecting a record year in 2012, we understand the world is facing economic challenges, and if it becomes necessary, we are prepared to act quickly as we did in late 2008 and 2009,” Mr Oberhelman said.“While we’re prepared, the good news is, this doesn’t feel like 2008,” the Caterpillar chief said. “Interest rates are low, central banks are prepared to inject more liquidity if needed, and housing is coming off lows, not a peak, and seems to be improving.”Caterpillar has been surprised by the pace of the slowdown in the global economy. The manufacturer warned in April that it had overestimated Chinese demand for construction equipment, saying that its inventories in the country were so high that it would export 2,300 excavators from China to other developing countries. It is also reducing production in China.The company said at the time that it expected demand for construction equipment to decline in China this year, down from its prior forecast of growth of 5-10 per cent, a reassessment that underlined the difficulties facing industrial multinationals that have made big bets on the Chinese economy.Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar’s head of investor relations, said: “The [Chinese] construction equipment industry remains very weak and it really hasn’t shown much in the way of signs of improvement yet.”Caterpillar issued its latest outlook as it unveiled record second-quarter results that far exceeded analysts’ expectations.The company made a net profit of $1.7bn, or $2.54 per share, up from $1bn, or $1.52 per share, in the same period last year and above Wall Street consensus forecasts of about $2.28 per share. Revenues were $17.4bn, up from $14.2bn last year and ahead of average expectations of about $17.1bn.Caterpillar shares closed up about 1.4 per cent at $82.60 in New York.

Shares in Facebook finished 2.3 per cent at $28.19.Overall, US equities on the S&P 500 dropped 1.4 per cent to 1,313.32 points as investors across the world fled risky assets on resurgent eurozone worries.The benchmark US index has declined more than 6 per cent in May, making this the worst month for equities since September.All major sectors on the S&P 500 were trading in negative territory with energy stocks the worst off and down 3 per cent.The metallurgical coal supplier Alpha Natural Resources fell 6.5 per cent to $10.79 while the natural gas and oil explorer WPX Energy lost 6.3 per cent to $15.04.The S&P 500 financials index declined 2.2 per cent as big US banks suffered heavy losses.Shares in Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America all fell by more than 3 per cent as investors were firmly in “risk-off” mode.Morgan Stanley dropped 4 per cent to $13.36. Shares in JPMorgan Chase fell 2 per cent to $32.96 as the bank, which suffered an unexpected trading loss of at least $2bn this month, said it has been in discussions with Japanese regulators about possible insider trading at the group.Volatility, as measured by the Vix index, surged by more than 14 per cent to trade above 24 – its biggest jump since early March.Investors hoping for a respite from losses in May are in for further disappointment if stocks follow historical patterns, according to Justin Walters at Bespoke Investment Group.He said that, over the past 20 years, US stocks had moved higher only 35 per cent of the time during the month of June.“May didn’t disappoint this year for those who followed the ‘sell in May, go away’ script. Unfortunately, in recent years, June has been a worse month than May,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3 per cent to 12,419.86 with the equipment maker Caterpillar losing 2.5 per cent to $90.18.Shares in Walt Disney declined 0.6 per cent to $45.20 as a report said the entertainment group would launch an application that would allow Comcast television subscribers to watch its programming on their mobile devices.

123;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US strike action;Management is not prepared to buy off labour;North American industrial workers are revolting – or at least striking. In recent weeks, employees at a Caterpillar plant in Illinois, railway workers with Canadian Pacific and staff at Lockheed Martin’s fighter jet facility in Texas have all taken to picketing over pay and benefits.Should executives be worried? A little. According to the labour department, after declining for decades serious stoppages – involving more than 1,000 workers and lasting at least one shift – jumped from 5 in 2009 to 19 in 2011. Over the same period, annual days idle climbed from 124,000 to more than 1m.The rise is surprising. Classical economic theory would suggest that, with unemployment levels running at about 8 per cent and economic prospects cloudy at best, workers should be quiescent – willing to accept whatever management offers for fear of being replaced.But the situation is more complex. Despite the headline numbers, many industries complain that they cannot find qualified workers for skilled positions. Employees appear to be gambling that in specific circumstances they retain enough leverage to secure improved, or at least stable, terms and conditions.Employees have some cause for complaint. Pay for manufacturing workers has remained broadly flat since 2000, while output per hour has increased by almost half. At the same time, and partly as a result, corporate margins are close to record levels while the share of national income going to workers as wages is near postwar lows.Given those data points, the real question is why management is not prepared to buy off labour to avoid the hassle. One possibility: executives do not yet believe in the modest US recovery. Scepticism is understandable. Europe remains in crisis, Asia is slowing and domestic political uncertainty is high.

124;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-05-30T16:26:03Z;Fiat;Differential voting plans can be a double-edged sword;Two and a half cheers for Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne, whose efforts to bring order to the once-Byzantine Fiat group structure took another step forward on Wednesday. The plan is to merge Italy’s Fiat Industrial and US-traded CNH – in which FI has an 88 per cent interest – into a new holding company with a primary listing in New York.That makes sense and investors should welcome the decision, although more for the longer-term advantages than for short-term gains. CNH was formed in 1999 when New Holland, Fiat’s majority-owned farm and construction equipment business, acquired US rival Case. Fiat Industrial was formed when the Italian group spun off its non-car operations in 2010. Together, FI and CNH comprise the third-largest maker of capital equipment by sales worldwide.But CNH’s separate identity and minority shareholders make intra-group business more complex. Valuations suffer, too: CNH shares trade at an enterprise value to 2012 earnings ratio of slightly more than three times, while FI’s are on 4.3 times. That compares with five to six times for peers such as Volvo and Caterpillar. No instant cost-savings are expected from the full marriage. But there should be cheaper refinancing possibilities longer-term. Greater liquidity of the new entity’s shares could improve market ratings, making the equity more useful, too.The half cheer is reserved because of an accompanying “loyalty” plan. Shareholders can “earn” double votes if they participate in FI or CNH shareholder meetings or remain on the register for three years. Such schemes have strong advocates in continental Europe, where short-termism is much-derided. But differential voting plans can be a dangerous, double-edged tool for countering this. Here, one beneficiary could be the Agnelli family holding company with 27 per cent of FI. Not so progressive.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
125;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-05-20T19:22:20Z;Factories begin to shift back to US;;Two-thirds of big US manufacturers have moved factories in the past two years, with the most popular destination being the US, according to a survey being released on Monday by Accenture, the consultants.The report provides some of the first industry-wide empirical evidence of “reshoring,” the trend of jobs once outsourced to low-cost emerging economies being brought back to the US.Although the subject has received much attention, with General Electric the most high-profile example, most of the evidence so far has been isolated and anecdotal.President Barack Obama has proposed tax incentives for companies that move their overseas operations back to the US and tax penalties for those that do not.“If you’re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn’t get a tax deduction for doing it,” Mr Obama said in this year’s State of the Union address. “No American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas.”Some 65 per cent of the senior executives questioned by Accenture said they had moved their manufacturing operations in the past 24 months, with two-fifths saying the facilities had been relocated to the US. China was the second destination for relocated factories, with 28 per cent, followed by Mexico with 21 per cent.Rich Bergmann, managing director of Accenture’s manufacturing practice, said the respondents cited freight and the speed of fulfilling orders as their main motivators for moving factories. The survey demonstrated that manufacturers are increasingly moving production closer to end-markets, he said.“There is evidence here of reshoring because of transportation costs and lead times,” Mr Bergmann said. “The global supply chain allows you to chase lower cost of labour, but the total costs are reflected in the decision on where you produce for a given geography.”In many cases – such as GE and Caterpillar – the relocation takes the form of expansion at existing US facilities. However, China remains the top destination for new factories among companies that are opening facilities, followed by the US, India, Brazil and Mexico.“Internal domestic demand in China and other markets in south-east Asia is behind the new facilities there – not so much for importing back to the US,” said Mr Bergmann.The survey also reveals that US manufacturers expect China to overtake Europe as their second biggest market within three years.Some 58 per cent of companies anticipate that Chinese demand will be one of their highest revenue generators within three years, up from 38 per cent currently, while 53 per cent predict that western Europe will be a leading source of revenue, down from 63 per cent today.
126;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-04-25T18:02:52Z;China sales fall short of Caterpillar forecasts;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues, said it had overestimated Chinese demand for construction equipment, adding that its inventories in the country were so high that it was now exporting machines to other developing countries where demand was tight.The industrial bellwether said it was now expecting demand for construction equipment to decline in China this year, down from its prior forecast of growth of 5-10 per cent, a reassessment that illustrates the difficulties facing industrial multinationals that have made big bets on the Chinese economy.China makes up 10 per cent of Caterpillar’s business in Asia and 3 per cent of its overall sales. The development is a sharp reversal of fortunes for the company’s China operations, which have fuelled its profits in recent years as demand has been sluggish in developed economies.It also calls into question Caterpillar’s plan to ramp up capacity in China. The company has 16 manufacturing facilities in the country – the most recent of which opened only last month – with nine more under construction, most of them due to open this year. It also plans to double its China workforce from its current level of 11,000.The company on Wednesday reiterated those plans. Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said, “Our mid- to long-term forecast has not changed.”The industrial bellwether said stronger than expected demand in the US though would offset the weakness in China as well as Brazil. It said the US recovery was entrenched and raised its forecast of new home construction as it reported profits for the first quarter that were well ahead of Wall Street expectations. Caterpillar also raised its full-year profits outlook.Caterpillar shares however were trading down 5 per cent at $103 by early afternoon in New York however as investors focused on the China market news.The company earned a record net profit of $1.59bn or $2.37 a share in the quarter, up from $1.23bn or $1.84 a share a year ago and above analysts’ average forecasts of about $2.13 a share, boosted by acquisitions and strong sales of mining equipment.The company raised its profit outlook for 2012 to $9.50 a share at the midpoint of its $68bn-$72bn forecast for sales and revenues. The prior outlook was for about $9.25 a share.Mr Oberhelman said much of the demand in the US was accounted for by resource and construction companies replacing ageing machinery.Ed Rapp, chief financial officer, told the FT Caterpillar plans to export 2,300 excavators from China to other emerging markets, principally the Middle East but also Africa, eastern Europe and Latin America.“The primary focus we’ve had for our manufacturing facilities in China is to build for China,” said Mr Rapp. “However, we are now diverting units out of China.” He said the company last did so at the time of the China’s 2004-05 economic slowdown.“CAT built inventory in China for a sales ramp that did not materialise,” Rob Wertheimer, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a research note.This article is subject to a clarification.
127;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-04-12T09:52:10Z;Tokyo ends seven-session run of losses;;Tokyo stocks broke a seven-session losing streak on Thursday, posting modest gains on hopes for policy easing in China following first-quarter growth to be reported in Beijing on Friday.The FTSE Asia Pacific index was up 0.6 per cent to 239.35 in late Asian trade.Japan’s main stock indicator climbed 0.7 per cent to 9,524.79, its first gain after seven sessions of losses. Traders said that after the Nikkei fell through the technical level of 9,500 buying was triggered to cover short positions.Metals groups climbed ahead of China’s keenly awaited first-quarter growth data. Analysts said that a stronger number than the 8.4 per cent rise in gross domestic product expected would allay fears of a hard landing for the Chinese economy, while a weaker number may foster hopes that monetary easing will be unleashed to ensure growth does not slow too rapidly and fall below the 7.5 per cent annual target.Sumitomo Metal Mining climbed 4.1 per cent to Y152, while Nippon Steel gained 3 per cent to Y207 and Pacific Metals added 2.9 per cent to Y425.In Shanghai, the Composite index jumped 1.8 per cent, its biggest one-day rise in two months, to 2,350.9. This took its gains over the past three sessions to 2.9 per cent.Monetary easing hopes were boosted after local press reports in Shenzhen suggested the city would soon reveal policies aimed at supported economic growth.Mining and financial stocks were among the weightiest contributors to the overall gains. Brokerages climbed after the market regulator approved more overseas buyers of renminbi-denominated securities.Citic Securities, China’s largest listed broker, climbed 4.1 per cent to Rmb12.99, while Haitong Securities added 4.4 per cent to Rmb10.22 and GF Securities rose 3.9 per cent to Rmb30.84.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 0.9 per cent to 20,327.32, led also by its financial sector. Bank of China Hong Kong topped the index, up 3.5 per cent to HK$22.45.In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 index climbed 0.8 per cent to 4,280.64, led by Seven Group Holdings, the conglomerate, which jumped 5.4 per cent to A$10.34 as investors favoured its deal to buy the Bucyrus distribution and support business from Caterpillar of the US.
128;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-04-10T17:30:05Z;Michelin unveils US expansion;;Michelin, the French tyre manufacturer, will invest $750m in South Carolina by building a new factory, expanding another and creating 500 jobs in the latest sign of the revival in industrial activity in the US.The plants will make large tyres for earthmovers, responding to strong demand from the mining and construction industries. The world market increased by 20 per cent between 2009 and 2011.At least 80 per cent of the additional production is expected to be exported to markets including Canada, where the tyres are used in oil sands production, and emerging economies.Pete Selleck, chairman of Michelin North America, said: “We could have made this investment anywhere in the world. The fact that we have chosen to do it in South Carolina shows that in the eight plants we already have here, we have been doing the right things.”Michelin employs 22,300 people in the US, 8,000 of them in South Carolina. Last year it announced a planned $200m investment in the state, creating an estimated 270 jobs making tyres for passenger cars and light trucks. It also operates the world’s largest rubber processing plant there.The latest investment decision followed a global competition, Mr Selleck said, and Michelin could have chosen to increase earthmover tyre capacity at one of its existing plants in France, Spain, Romania, Brazil or Canada, or in a low-wage emerging economy.“We have chosen to come to a high-cost labour country, because the return to the company is the best.”He cited high productivity and the technical capabilities to produce advanced tyres 12.5 feet in diameter as the great strengths of the US plants.Other tyre companies have also been investing in the state. Last September, Bridgestone of Japan announced the largest ever single investment in South Carolina, a $1.2bn commitment that included a new plant to build earthmover tyres in direct competition to Michelin, shifting production out of Japan.Continental of Germany said in October it was investing $500m to make tyres for cars and light trucks.The earthmoving equipment market has shown signs of slowing recently but is still growing strongly, and manufacturers such as Caterpillar have been investing in increased production capacity.Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of earthmovers by revenues, said last month that retail sales by dealers were 21 per cent higher in the three months to the end of February than in the equivalent period a year before, although that represented a slowdown from 30 per cent year-on-year growth in the last quarter of 2011.Michelin’s decision comes amid growing concern in France about its shrinking manufacturing base.However, Mr Selleck said the company’s French facility was also exporting successfully to the world.South Carolina is a “right to work” state, meaning that workers have a right not to be forced to join a trade union.However, Mr Selleck said the legal protection had not particularly been an issue.“There is a work culture here,” he said. “People want to have a very frank and very direct relationship with the management of the company. Unions have not really tried to organise at our plants, and our employees have not really been interested in that.”The port of Charleston is another attraction of South Carolina as a location for export-oriented production.
129;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-04-09T16:14:56Z;AstraZeneca chief in need of a tonic;;When David Brennan won the race to become chief executive of AstraZeneca six years ago, he joked to a colleague who had come to congratulate him: “Great job, shit timing.”Since then, the Anglo-Swedish group has struggled under its American boss to adapt to the malaise affecting much of the sector as pharmaceutical companies face a so-called cliff of expiring patents and an ever thinner pipeline of innovative drugs to replace them.“It seems that something has to give at AstraZeneca, given its troubling future financial outlook,” Bernstein Research wrote in a note, highlighting that the company was trading at just over seven times 2012 consensus earnings, the lowest in a sector with an average multiple of 11. Many investors, it said, had an attitude towards the company of “left for dead”.Mr Brennan’s defenders argue that he was dealt a difficult hand by his predecessor Sir Tom McKillop, and it is not clear that a different manager would have played it better, or could even today.AstraZeneca – formed through the merger of Astra of Sweden with the spinout of the UK chemicals group ICI in 1999 – was slower than many of its peers to embrace the shift towards more profitable, targeted biological therapies. Patent filings suggest it still lags behind, with the majority of its intellectual property still, until recently, chemical-based.Its efforts to accelerate progress through the acquisition of CAT in 2006 and MedImmune in 2007 both backfired, with few of those companies’ planned drugs since making significant advances.AstraZeneca has instead been hit by failures of medicines in late-stage clinical trials, so the returns on its research have proved very disappointing.Since last year, it has written off failed late-stage cancer and anti-depressant projects. This month it signed a deal with Amgen, of the US, for joint development and commercialisation of a series of experimental medicines, providing potential for some additional future revenues but handing the larger share of the upside to the partner that developed them.Similar research and development setbacks have affected AstraZeneca’s peers, too, but Mr Brennan’s critics argue that he has played his hand badly. They suggest he refused to prune research early or deeply enough, or to diversify sufficiently into other cash generating activities such as generics or consumer healthcare deals.“He’s a delegator, not a decision maker,” says one large shareholder.To Mr Brennan’s credit, he championed the company’s expansion into fast-growing emerging markets, notably establishing a place as a market leader in China, which has been envied and since followed by his competitors.He oversaw the emergence of Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, as a blockbuster, although some insiders say he could have done far more to tap the potential of AstraZeneca’s portfolio of so-called mature drugs that have gone off patent, notably in emerging markets.He has championed improved business ethics, last year irritating some rivals by cutting funding for doctors travelling to medical conferences – a custom that has been criticised for possibly influencing prescribing practices. But that followed legal actions against the company for alleged aggressive marketing of drugs including the anti-psychotic medicine Seroquel, which AstraZeneca is fighting.Mr Brennan and his team were quick to embrace calls for higher returns to shareholders, stripping out costs to boost earnings. He has stepped up restructuring with a further 12 per cent reduction in the company’s 60,000 global workforce by 2014. Such moves have allowed Mr Brennan to increase dividends and share buybacks, driving up AstraZeneca’s multiple at a time when investors were seeking defensive stocks during the economic downturn.“Until the past year, AstraZeneca was performing quite well,” says Gbola Amusa, pharmaceuticals analyst with UBS, who remains bullish. He stresses that efficiency gains have helped generate strong total shareholder returns, which take into account the dividend as well as the share price. That triggered Mr Brennan’s jump in total remuneration last year to £9.3m.Even Mr Amusa predicts radical surgery ahead: “If you cut $2bn a year in research for infinity, and used it to finance acquisitions, it would be highly rewarded.”For others, AstraZeneca has lost the first-mover advantage it once had on boosting shareholder returns, and with far less internal fat to cut it is already heading over a steep patent cliff with revenues set to fall. Even a miraculous new drug approval can do little to make an impact.One institutional investor says: “This was predictable for a long time, but it shows how short-term the market is.”
130;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-04-09T16:09:02Z;Sany’s marriage of convenience;;In just over three years Putzmeister’s world, fashioned around the unforgiving business of concrete, came crashing down around it.For nearly half a century the Stuttgart-based company along with Schwing, its German arch-rival, had dominated the niche business of concrete pumps.Until around 2002, each company had been responsible for about 45 per cent of the world market in these machines, a vital tool used on large construction sites.In 2008, Putzmeister announced record sales for the previous year of €1bn, recording profits before interest and tax of €130m.By this time the business, set up in 1959 by its idiosyncratic founder Karl Schlect, remained the world market leader in concrete pumps with a market share in 2007 of about 35 per cent.Mr Schlect, known for handing out to new employees rules based on his version of the Ten Commandments, remained a guiding force in spite of having put Putzmeister under the control of a family foundation.But, after recording in 2009 a €140m loss and losing half its revenues as a result of the financial crisis and recession, the company was forced by the end of last year to put itself up for sale.The biggest headache was bank loans, which at the worst of the crisis were €280m, much of which was owed to Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank.Norbert Scheuch, an industry veteran called in by the banks in 2009 to take over as Putzmeister’s chief executive, toured China for five days just before Christmas to check on putative buyers.The company that emerged as easily the most serious bidder was Sany Group, a fast-growing Chinese construction equipment business started in 1986 by four Chinese engineers.After a series of brief discussions, Sany agreed to acquire Putzmeister for €525m.Speaking at Sany’s headquarters in Changsha, southern China, Sany’s president and co-founder Tang Xiuguo said that he and other top managers agreed the deal without visiting Putzmeister’s main plant and headquarters in Aichtal, south of Stuttgart.“We felt we already knew Putzmeister. They had been our teacher for many years,” he said.Since its foundation as a producer of welding materials, Sany has expanded aggressively. It started building concrete pumps modelled on the versions made by Putzmeister and Schwing in the early 1990s and then moved into other more mainstream areas of construction machines such as excavators and cranes.David Phillips, managing director of Off Highway Research, a London consultancy, said Sany was the Chinese construction equipment company that was “most feared” as a competitor by big global businesses in this field such Caterpillar of the US and Japan’s Komatsu.Behind this, said Mr Phillips, was Sany’s “devotion to quality, its enormous manufacturing capabilities and a sophisticated financing division [in which the company offers credit to customers on relatively easy terms]”.Liang Wengen, one of Sany’s founders and the company’s chairman, is according to Forbes magazine China’s second richest man, with a fortune put at $8.1bn.The company listed its main subsidiary on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2003, though with the founders retaining control of the overall business.Behind Sany’s rapid growth has been the massive expansion in construction activity in China in the past five years that has meant the world centre for building machines has shifted to this country.Putzmeister tried to grab a share of this Chinese business by establishing a factory and sales operation in Shanghai, but failed to make much headway against its China competitors. Last year Putzmeister had a market share in concrete pumps in China of just 2 per cent.Besides Sany, another strong Chinese player in the market is Zoomlion which holds second place in concrete pumps sales worldwide. The rival is another fast growing Chinese construction machine business, which is also based in Changsha.Zoomlion held a world market share in concrete pumps last year of 30 per cent. It made its own move into Europe before Sany through a €500m deal in 2007 to buy CIFA of Italy, a smaller player in concrete pumps which also makes other types of concrete machines.Last year Sany made 90 per cent of its Rmb80bn (about $13bn) sales in its home country. Of its 65,000 employees, all but 3,000 of them in China.To complement its Chinese plants it has set up small factories in the US, Brazil, India and, before the Putzmeister deal, it had a production site near Cologne in Germany. Now Sany wants to use Putzmeister as the main vehicle for expanded sales outside China.Mr Schlect, Putzmeister’s founder who is in his 80s, will no longer have an active role in the business though Mr Scheuch is joining Sany’s main China-based board.Mr Tang is meanwhile targeting global sales for the whole of Sany of Rmb300bn by 2017. “I think it’s realistic to think that [by then] we will have at least 20 per cent of [Sany’s total ] business outside China,” Mr Tang said.
131;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-04-09T15:23:54Z;Sany Group to invest €300m in Putzmeister;;One of China’s fastest-growing manufacturing companies has promised to invest €300m to expand its new German offshoot, in an illustration of the interest by Chinese production businesses in establishing a stronger international presence.Sany Group, a large maker of construction equipment, says its new plan is likely to create 3,000 jobs across Germany, India and Brazil.Tang Xiuguo, Sany’s president, said in an interview with the Financial Times that Sany wanted Stuttgart-based Putzmeister to operate as a largely independent company, responsible for manufacturing and sales of concrete-related equipment around the world.“In future Putzmeister will be a more powerful company, thanks to the introduction of new products that we [Sany] will help it to develop,” said Mr Tang.Sany has increased sales by roughly tenfold in the past five years, so that it is now a big rival to global leaders in the building machine business such as the US’s Caterpillar and Komatsu of Japan.Sany bought Putzmeister in January for €525m including debt, in one of the biggest purchases by a Chinese business of a German Mittelstand “niche” engineering business.Putzmeister was the biggest company in the world by sales in concrete pumps until 2008 when Sany took over as the industry leader. Its machines are mounted on trucks for channelling concrete on building sites.Sany’s plan is to help Putzmeister to invest in the development of new products such as concrete production machinery, mobile cement mixers and building cranes. These products would be aimed largely at customers outside China, leaving the parent group to remain focused on its home country where it has a strong presence in other types of building machines including excavators.Thanks to China’s construction boom, concrete pumps have seen immense growth in the country. This year seven out of every 10 machines of this kind sold anywhere are likely to see service in China.Last year Sany accounted for roughly 40 per cent of global sales of concrete pumps of about $5bn.Putzmeister’s annual sales hit €1bn in 2007 but fell precipitously in the financial crisis, pushing the company into a big financial loss in 2009. Under Mr Tang’s plans, its sales would rise from an expected €621m this year to about €2bn within five years.Putzmeister’s workforce of 2,700, of whom about 40 per cent are in Germany, would rise to almost 6,000 by 2017. Mr Tang said the extra jobs would be split between Germany, where Putzmeister has its main factories, and other countries where the company has a strong presence.He said Sany was looking to increase its annual revenues from an expected Rmb100bn ($16bn) this year, of which roughly a fifth is likely to be from concrete pump sales, to Rmb300bn by 2017.

He oversaw a push into trading related businesses and was in charge of the investment banks when it reported its first ever quarterly loss in 2007 due to writedowns on subprime mortgage-backed securities.He also charted the group’s conversion to a commercial bank in 2008, so that it could borrow emergency funds from the Federal Reserve, and negotiated capital injections from the China Investment Corp and Mitsubishi UFJ, a Japanese bank. He stayed on as chairman until the end of last year.The sixth son of Lebanese immigrants, Mr Mack graduated from Duke University where he attended on a football scholarship and is a member of the board of trustees. His first job in finance was as a clerk at a small brokerage house during his junior year at Duke, after a cracked vertebra ended his ability to continue playing football.He served two stints at Morgan Stanley, first joining as a bond salesman in the 1970s before becoming president in 1993. During that term, he helped put together a deal with Dean Witter, the brokerage firm, but was squeezed out in 2001 after a power struggle with Philip Purcell, the Dean Witter veteran who became chief executive of the combined group.Mr Mack serves on the boards of trustees of New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the University Hospital of both Columbia and Cornell, on the board of the Bloomberg Family Foundation, and on the advisory board for China Investment Corp and the International Business Leaders Advisory Council for the mayor of Beijing.
133;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Aggreko set to acquire Brazilian rival;;Aggreko is set to announce the £140m purchase of a Brazilian rival as the temporary energy supplier buys greater access to one of its fastest growing markets.The deal for São Paulo-based Poit Energia is worth just over nine times the Brazilian group’s operating profits last year. It should raise Aggreko’s sales in South America by almost a third, to £193m, or about 14 per cent of the FTSE 100 company’s global total.It comes amid a strong performance by Aggreko’s operations in the region, where unreliable energy infrastructure has helped drive demand for temporary supplies. Poit will add to the company’s service centres and fleet of generators ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil, both of which should boost trading.Aggreko – the world’s biggest supplier of temporary electricity – holds a £40m contract to provide emergency energy at the London Olympic Games this summer.Poit Energia was founded in 1999 and operates in Brazil, Chile, Argentina and Peru.Aggreko’s existing debt facilities will fund the deal, with the purchase price set to rise by £21m if performance targets for 2012 are met. Poit’s management team will stay on until the end of the year.Aggreko entered South America through its purchase of GE Energy Rentals, a lossmaking division of General Electric, for $212m in 2006, a deal that also bolstered the UK group’s expertise in provision of power to Olympic games.That purchase was valued at 6.5 times the unit’s annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.As well as sporting events, Aggreko’s business benefits from drought and natural disasters. A deal to supply emergency energy in northern Japan last year, following the earthquake, pushed its shares to record highs.The share prices has risen by 25 per cent since, in spite of a dip last summer when investors grew nervous over increasing competition following the purchase of one of Aggreko’s two global rivals, Florida-based APR Energy.Rupert Soames, chief executive, dismissed the market’s fears at the time, saying competition was nothing new: “They have grown their business very rapidly and our performance hasn’t been entirely shabby either,” he told the Financial Times.The company also competes with Caterpillar, the US industrial.

PulteGroup, another homebuilder, dropped 2.6 per cent to $8.88 while rival Lennar fell 1 per cent to $25.86.The S&P 500 homebuilders index, which had risen 80 per cent since last October, has lost more than 3.5 per cent this week.Key housing data released throughout the week showed signs that, while the housing market was stabilising, the pace of recovery was slowing.“After the run-up we have had this year, you want to see the markets take a pause and consolidate,” said Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “They were not any new, fresh drivers to take us higher this week with the data being mixed.”“For the week overall, I’d probably give the US housing data a grade of B- or C+. There are some details to suggest we are bumping along the bottom rather than falling off the wagon. The story for the US is not great but it’s still improving and nothing this week changed our view.”Shares in Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, were halted after they plunged to $542 a share.A single mistaken trade on one of BATS’s exchanges was identified as the cause and corrected, according to a statement by BATS. Trading in Apple shares, which had retreated from highs earlier in the week, resumed soon after and fell 0.6 per cent to $596.05.But the troubles continued for BATS as the exchange was forced to withdraw its initial public offering on Friday, citing “technical issues” that caused its share price to plunge in the first moments of trading on its own exchange.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,397.11 on Friday, edging back towards the 1,400 mark after retreating from it earlier in the week.But the US benchmark has had its worst week since mid-December, falling 0.5 per cent and retreating from the post-financial crisis highs reached on Monday. However, the S&P 500 is still up 11 per cent on the year to date.Nike, the world’s largest sporting goods company, reported that revenues rose 15 per cent like-for-like to $5.8bn, driven by strong demand in North America, but its shares fell 3.2 per cent to $107.42 in trading on Friday as analysts considered the pressure on the company’s forward profit margins and valuation.Camilo Lyon, analyst at Canaccord, said of his “hold” rating: “Taking it altogether …we believe the stock should trade down, especially considering the peak 21 times price to earnings multiple at which it currently trades.“Given the strength in North America futures, we would rather play the strength of the footwear cycle via the retailers, in particular buy-rated Foot Locker and Dick’s Sporting Goods.”Citi analysts removed Nike from their top-picks list but reiterated their buy rating on confidence that sales growth would be driven by momentum in North America and China.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.1 per cent to to 3,067.92. The technology-heavy index fared the best among the three major US indices, up 0.4 per cent for the week.Netflix, the home DVD delivery and internet movie streaming provider, was among the week’s top gainers. Shares in the company rose by more than 9 per cent on the week and were trading at $120.19.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.2 per cent over the five trading days at 13,080.73 as equities on the blue-chip index were rattled by weak manufacturing data out of Europe and China released on Thursday.Earthmoving equipment manufacturer Caterpillar rose 1.3 per cent to $107.83 on Friday but remained one of the weakest stocks among blue-chips for the week.Shares in the company, which have risen by 19 per cent in the year to date, fell by more than 5 per cent this week.Sears Holdings, parent company of the Sears and Kmart department store chains, fell by more than 12 per cent over the five days to make it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500.Last week, the company reported that it would shut down as many as 62 stores in the first half of the year to reduce its expenses but the move was little comfort to investors as the stock fell another 1.8 per cent to $72.36 on Friday.
135;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-03-23T01:12:11Z;Manufacturing data weigh on US stocks;;Energy stocks suffered their steepest decline in more than three months as the S&P 500 retreated from the 1,400 threshold and fell for a third straight day on poor manufacturing data from China and Europe.The main market’s energy index was down 2 per cent, its worst drop since December 14, as oil prices dipped on Thursday.Coalminers were among the day’s worst performers as the industry continues to face pressure from the shale gas boom. A warmer winter also meant natural gas inventories rose above their five-year average.Consol Energy, which produced 62.6m tons of coal from 12 sites in the US last year, was the worst performing stock on the main market, down 4.5 per cent to $32.94. Alpha Natural Resources, another coalminer, fell 4 per cent to $16.03.A speech by US President Barack Obama in which he said the government would expedite construction on the Keystone XL pipeline did little to inspire confidence in the sector.Cabot Oil & Gas was the second worst performing stock on the main market, down 6.1 per cent to $31.52Overall, the benchmark US index sank 0.7 per cent to 1,392.78, its lowest point in more than a week.The S&P 500 materials sector had its worst day in more than two weeks, falling 1.6 per cent as commodity prices slid on concerns over global growth.US Steel, the integrated steel producer, was the worst performer among materials, falling 5.8 per cent to $29.47.Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was the next worst, shedding 3.7 per cent to $38.33. Allegheny Technologies, the speciality metals producer, fell 2.7 per cent to $41.58.“What you had was continued speculation on the depths of the Chinese slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the Chinese data,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Both those factors immediately hit materials.”Creeping fears of a slowdown in the world’s second- largest economy also sent Wall Street’s “fear gauge” up to its highest point since March 9.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, rose by as much as 9.6 per ent before finishing the day up 2.9 per cent to 15.27.Insurance companies and regional banks were the worst performing equities among the S&P 500 financials index, which fell 1.4 per cent, relinquishing its position as the top performing sector for the year so far to information technology.The financials index is now up more than 19.9 per cent since the start of the year while the tech index is slightly ahead, having gained 20 per cent.Hartford Financial Services after pressure from John Paulson, the billionaire investor, caused the insurance company to consider the sale of its life assurance business.Shares in the company, which rose on Wednesday after it revised its forecast earnings above analysts’ expectations, were down 3.3 per cent to $21.30.Overall macro growth fears also caused investors to ignore the latest US economic data that showed the number of first-time unemployment claims falling to its lowest level in four years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6 per cent to 13,046.14.Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, was the third biggest loser on the blue chip-heavy index, falling 2.4 per cent to $106.44. The company’s shares are down more than 6.3 per cent on the week.McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, fell 1 per cent to $95.80 on news that Jim Skinner, chief executive, will retire at the end of June after more than seven years in the top job.The fast-food chain recorded its strongest year-on-year sales last year since 2006 and is looking to expand its worldwide presence by opening another 1,300 stores this year.Federal Express, the package delivery company, was down 3.5 per cent to $92.50 as it reported a lower profit forecast for the current quarter even though revenues surged in the three months to February.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent to 3,063.32.Zynga, the social media game developer, was a rare gainer, rising 0.3 per cent to $13.76. The game developer said on Wednesday that it would acquire New York-based smartphone application developer, OMGPOP, for $200m.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the index, fell by 0.5 per cent to below $600 at $599.34 after hitting yet another cyclical high on Thursday. Shares in the iPad and iPhone maker are up almost 48 per cent in the year to date.
136;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-03-20T22:30:30Z;Caterpillar reports slowing sales growth;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues, said growth in machine sales had slowed down in the past three months in almost every region of the world.The report came amid renewed concerns about China’s economic growth fuelled by BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company by market value, which warned of “flattening” iron ore demand from the Asian country.Caterpillar said retail machine sales by dealers rose 21 per cent in the three months to the end of February compared with the same period last year. However, that was down from a pace of 30 per cent year-on-year growth in the last quarter of 2011.In the Asia-Pacific region Caterpillar’s sales growth slowed to 20 per cent in the three months to the end of February, down from 31 per cent in the fourth quarter. In North America sales were up 39 per cent in the three months to the end of February compared with last year, down from 51 per cent growth in the fourth quarter.Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar chief executive, is visiting China, from where he told CNBC television that he remained confident about the market.“We look at China as a long-term market here,” he said. “It’s the largest construction equipment market in the world today. We want to be here in a bigger way and of course we are investing a lot of time for what would be a 20 or 30-year run.”In January Mr Oberhelman said he expected construction markets in the US and Europe to remain “depressed”, but he added on Tuesday that he was “pretty optimistic” about growth in eastern Europe and the Middle East.Caterpillar shares closed down 2.6 per cent at $110.76 in New York.Earlier, Ian Ashby, president of BHP Billiton’s iron ore unit, told an industry conference in Australia that he was expecting growth in Chinese demand for iron ore to slow down over the next decade, comments that prompted a sell-off in industrial sector shares.Global iron ore consumption rose by 6.1 per cent a year between 2000 and 2010. However, BHP is forecasting demand will grow by an average of 3.5 per cent annually until 2020.

However, the S&P 500 is still up more than 11 per cent from the start of the year.“Overall, the market is up 30 per cent from its lows in the late summer of last year but a little consolidation is expected,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING. “The fact that we are holding 1,400 is a good sign and we’ve bounced off lows. There are still many investors who are underweight and we are not too concerned by a small retrenchment on a given day.”Commodity-related stocks were among the worst performers. Joy Global, the mining equipment maker, was the biggest faller among industrials, dropping 4.3 per cent to $75.92. Cummins, the diesel engine manufacturer, fell 3.6 per cent to $123.42.Peabody Energy, the coalminer, dropped 5.4 per cent to $31.64 and was the worst performer in the energy sector. Alpha Natural Resources, another coal supplier, lost 4.1 per cent to $16.61.Markets also reacted to news that US housing starts slipped by 1.1 per cent to 698,000 last month as analysts continued to express concerns over the prospects of a housing market recovery.“Housing starts are expected to rise 9 per cent this year, with single-family construction rising 8 per cent and multi-family starts rising 12 per cent,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo.“Overall, starts should rise an additional 16 per cent in 2013. Even with these gains, however, homebuilding remains well off its long-run trend.”The S&P 500 financials index bucked the weaker trend in the wider market, rising 0.4 per cent to lead the major sector indices on strength from the country’s largest banks.Bank of America, which dispelled rumours that it was considering a share offering to raise additional capital on Monday, led the way higher. Shares in the bank, which said last week it would not return capital to shareholders after passing the Federal Reserve’s stress tests, rose 2.9 per cent to $9.81.Goldman Sachs rose 1.4 per cent to $126.02, while JPMorgan was up 0.4 per cent to $45.38 on reports that the bank will pay $150m to settle a lawsuit with three pension funds. Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $20.41 and Citigroup rose by 2.5 per cent to $38.08.Tiffany & Co, the luxury jewellery retailer, was the best performing stock in the S&P 500. Tiffany’s rose by 6.7 per cent to $73.27 as the company upped its annual profit forecast to $4.05 a share, driven by surging sales in Asia.Williams Company, the natural gas explorer and producer, was among the day’s biggest risers and gained 2.9 per cent to $31.30. The company’s subsidiary, Williams Partner, said it would acquire a natural-gas pipeline system for $2.5bn from Caiman Energy.The Nasdaq Composite Index recovered some of its losses earlier in the day and finished down just 0.1 per cent to 3,074.15.

The bank said in a statement that it expected earnings for the first quarter of 2012 to beat initial estimates.Zions Bancorporation soared 10.5 per cent to $21.58 as the bank said it planned to issue $600m in senior debt to help repay $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,394.28, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 per cent to 13,194.10, led higher by Bank of America.The bank, which passed the tests but said it would not return money to shareholders at present, climbed 4.1 per cent to $8.84 with its shares now up more than 59 per cent in the year to date.American Express was the second-leading gainer on the index, up 3.5 per cent to $56.15.

David Evanston, analyst at Canaccord, raised the 12-month price target for Apple to $710.“Since we attended the iPad launch last week, our checks have indicated record pre-orders with wait times for shipping iPad models now reaching 2-3 weeks …Apple remains a top pick,” he said.Netflix, the streaming and home DVD delivery provider, fell 2.3 per cent to $103.90. Its shares were hit by news that Walmart would let customers buy online access to movies they have already purchased.

The benchmark US index has now risen 11 per cent in the year to date. The financial sector – led by JPMorgan, which reached its highest mark since May – climbed 3.9 per cent on the day, clearly outpacing other groups, and is up more than 18 per cent for the year.Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs recorded gains of larger than six per cent each on the day. Shares in those major banks also reached multi-month highs, but Citigroup dropped 4 per cent after hours as it was revealed that the bank required more capital following the stress tests.Wells Fargo said it planned to increase its January declared dividend an additional 10 cents to 22 cents. Shares of the bank, which gained 5.7 per cent during the trading day, were up 0.5 per cent after hours.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 per cent to 13,180.40, its highest point since December 2007.The blue-chip heavy index was led by earthmover Caterpillar, which rose 4 per cent at $113.30. The construction equipment provider has climbed more than 25 per cent since the new year. Miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 2.2 per cent to $39.09. Dow Chemical and DuPont each added about 3 per cent to $34.60 and $52.68.The Nasdaq Composite Index also broke into unfamiliar territory and closed above the 3,000 point threshold for the first time since December 2000. The Nasdaq was up 1.9 per cent to 3,039.88.The most heavily weighted stock on the index, Apple, continued to guide the Nasdaq’s rise, once again hitting an all-time high. The maker of the popular iPad and iPhone products added 2.9 per cent to $568.10.The announcement by JPMorgan added to other positive market indicators that came throughout the day on Tuesday. Retail data released in the morning showed sales rose to their highest in five months.Economists, however, sought to temper the significance of the retail report.Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, warned: “After a weak December, retail sales picked up considerably in January and February …However, retail sales data, like many other time series, seem to have received a boost from much better than normal weather in many areas of the country combined with overly generous seasonal adjustment factors, which is a very potent combination.”Later in the day, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would leave interest rates unchanged.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.3 per cent to 428.20. Gains were led by chip makers including Micron Technology, which increased 5.1 per cent to $8.49. Advanced Micro Devices climbed 3.5 per cent to $7.76.CME, the US’s largest futures exchange, edged up 1 per cent to $272.99 after Monday’s news that its chief executive, Craig Donohue, is to step down at the end of the year. The exchange has struggled to restore confidence in its markets since the collapse of MF Global. Despite gains in recent months, shares are still trading down more than 8.5 per cent in the past year.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein, said: “At the current stock price we believe CME shares offer exceptional value for a firm that can generate high single to low-double-digit growth rates long term, has stable pretax margins exceeding 60 per cent, boasts a defensible business model and has a number of real options related to mandated over-the-counter clearing.”Cyclical material stocks, such as US Steel, which was up 7.3 per cent to $28.31, also made strong gains.Retailing group Urban Outfitters was among the day’s worst performers, down 5.3 per cent to $27.95. The company reported a 48 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits after it was forced to offer heavy markdowns to clear year-end inventories.Brian Tunick, retail analyst at JPMorgan, said: “Going forward, we continue to believe that with inventory under control and new management focused on improving product offerings, Urban Outfitters represents an attractive opportunity. We maintain a “buy” rating as we believe that the Street will remain excited over the potential improvements brought about by the “reassembled band”, setting up impressive [2012 fiscal year] opportunities.”Shares in China’s largest online video provider, Youku, fell 1.5 per cent to $31.40 after it climbed over 27 per cent on Monday as announced plans to merge with smaller rival Tudou.

That comes ahead of the official monthly non-farm payroll report on Friday, which will be closely watched by markets.“The fundamentals in the market continue to surprise on the upside and beat expectations. Today’s ADP numbers add to that. There are two drivers in the market, primary are the fundamentals and global risk is a secondary consideration in our forecasts. Clearly, the attention is getting back on the fundamentals where it should be,” said Doug Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management.He added: “We think this market continues to run. Friday’s non-farm payrolls are forecast at 210,000 but are we projecting 280,000.”The S&P 500 index had dropped 1.9 per cent on Monday and Tuesday as global economic growth concerns and Greek debt worries crept back into the markets, taking away investors’ appetite for risk.The US Treasury department late on Wednesday said it would sell $6bn in shares of AIG. Shares of the insurer that was rescued during the financial crisis in 2008 were down 1.2 per cent to $29.45 in after-hours trading.The financial sector led the S&P 500 during the day, closing up 1.3 per cent as Greece inched nearer to a successful debt restructuring agreement with private sector bondholders as a deadline approached. Morgan Stanley, the worst hit among the major banks earlier this week, rose 3.2 per cent to $17.88. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $33.24, Bank of America went up 4 per cent to $8.02 and Goldman Sachs rose 2.4 per cent to $116.40.After having spiked on Tuesday, investor expectations of volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, dropped back below 20. The Vix was down 7.8 per cent to 19.25 points, but still has risen 13 per cent for the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.9 per cent at 2,935.69. Apple – now the most owned stock by US mutual funds according to Citigroup – see-sawed throughout the day as Tim Cook, chief executive, unveiled the latest iterations of its popular products, including the iPad. Apple closed up 0.1 per cent at $530.69.Netflix, the video streaming and DVD delivery service, rose by up to 4 per cent after announcing it would enter into partnerships to stream content for cable companies. But the volatile shares in the company were sent down by as much as 4.3 per cent after Apple debuted the latest version of Apple TV in the afternoon. Netflix shares recovered a bit to close down 1.8 per cent at $105.19, as it assured customers that it services would be available on Apple TV.Pandora, the internet radio company, slumped 23.9 per cent to $10.86, erasing nearly all of its gains for the year. The company reported widening fourth-quarter losses compared to the same period a year ago and lowered future earnings guidance to below analyst consensus. Mark Mahaney, an internet analyst at Citi, downgraded the shares to “neutral”.“We initiated [Pandora] with a ‘buy’ last July with the stock at $18. That call clearly hasn’t worked. As a speculative ‘buy’ – with no profitability track record and no near-term profitable outlook – [Pandora] always carried very little margin for error. And now there’s error,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 12,837.78. The earthmover Caterpillar gained 2.2 per cent to $108.28, the third highest riser on the blue-chip index.The consumer goods maker Kraft was the biggest loser on the Dow, falling 1.2 per cent to $37.83 as the company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by Scott Mushkin, analyst at Jefferies.“2012, however, appears to be a year of investment and we expect limited upside for the next two to three quarters until the focus shifts to the post-separation outlook,” he said, adding that he still believed in the company’s longer-term prospects.Cyclical materials stocks recovered slightly, up 0.4 per cent, but have been the hardest hit sector on the S&P 500 this week, having dropped 3.4 per cent. The fertiliser maker CF Industries was up 4.1 per cent at $175.84. Eastman Chemical and Dow Chemical were up 2.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent to $51.17 and $33.12, respectively.Energy stocks were up 0.6 per cent led by a 7.3 per cent jump in shares of Valero Energy at $27. First Solar continued its losses, falling another 6.6 per cent to $25.80 as a report said the renewable energy company was cutting production at its operations in Germany and Malaysia.The Philadelphia Gold and Silver index was down 0.1 per cent, having fallen 8.3 per cent since Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, last week disappointed markets with a downbeat statement on the likelihood of a third round of quantitative easing.

US Steel Corp shed 4.7 per cent to $26.21.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,363.44 as analysts sought to temper pessimism.“This should not have been a surprise for the markets [and] the full report released last night showed [the Chinese] are offering further measures to stimulate their economy,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.Stocks had fallen during the morning session on tepid US economic data, as a gauge of factory orders fell for the January period, but recovered slightly in afternoon trading.“This is a continuation of the market needing strong data from the US to show the economy is self-sustaining,” Ms Krosby said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,962.81, as blue-chip material stocks were also hit by China’s growth warning. Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, lost 3.6 per cent to $9.87; earthmover Caterpillar shed 2.1 per cent to $110.09; and Dupont fell 1.1 per cent to $50.89.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,950.48, slipping further from the psychologically important 3,000 benchmark, which it breached intraday for the first time in 11 years last week.Apple shares opened higher, to within $2 of its record high of $548.21 set last week. But the iPad-maker declined 2.2 per cent to $533.16.First Solar was the biggest loser on the S&P, dropping 6.5 per cent to $28.08. The world’s largest maker of thin-film solar panels continued to reel from its disappointing fourth-quarter results released last week, while reports suggested natural gas producers are as likely to benefit from clean energy subsidies as renewable energy companies.WPX Energy climbed 2.8 per cent to $18.33, as analysts speculated that the natural gas producer could be subject to a takeover bid, after its shares sold off, as natural gas prices fell last year.Big bank stocks dropped as attempts continued to secure participation in the planned private sector exchange of Greek debtBank of America was down 2 per cent to $7.97, Morgan Stanley was off 3.1 per cent to $18.48, Citigroup fell 1.2 per cent to $33.68 and Goldman Sachs was off 1.1 per cent to $119.95.AIG gained 2 per cent to $30.39 on news that it would sell $6bn worth of shares in AIA Group. The insurer, which was bailed out by the US government during the financial crisis, said it expects to use the funds to pay down debt it owes to the US Treasury.Fertiliser manufacturer CF Industries fell 5.5 per cent to $177.98 as Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that the company’s comprehensive natural gas price hedging strategy, reduces the potential for the company to benefit from low prices for the commodity this year .“While hedging adds visibility to CF’s margins, it may have left some profit potential on the table with [year to date] average [natural gas] prices near $2.60,” PJ Juvekar told Citigroup clients.Advanced Micro Devices lost 5.2 per cent to $7.07 as the semiconductor manufacturer said it would pay at least $150m to break an exclusivity agreement with one of its clients.Micron Technology also fell 5.2 per cent to $8.20 as the Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor stocks fell 2.6 per cent.Micron, which manufactures dynamic random access memory for computers, had rallied strongly last week after a Japanese rival filed for bankruptcy, raising hopes of consolidation in the sector.Zynga shares fell 4.9 per cent to $13.97, after Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan removed his “buy” recommendation on the stock, after it briefly topped his $15 target last week.“We believe Zynga shares are fairly valued and could be range-bound in the near-term until we see greater clarity around the strength of newer games and their ability to increase both users and payers,” said Mr Anmuth.Groupon, the e-coupon company, dropped 5.6 per cent to $18.13.MetroPCS shares slumped 5.7 per cent to $9.96 as Sanford Bernstein analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on shares in the wireless network.“[The company’s] long term prospects are more pedestrian,” Craig Moffett told clients in a note. “Competition is greater in their core markets than it once was – due partially to the shifts down-market from Sprint and T-Mobile.”Polypore International, the plastics manufacturer of a key lithium battery component for the Chevrolet Volt, dropped 9.7 per cent to $35.91 after reports late Friday said Chevrolet would temporarily suspend production of the electric vehicle.Computer Science Corp rose 2 per cent to $31.93, as the company signed a letter of intent with the UK’s National Health Service, as it attempts to rescue a lucrative contract."
143;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Banks institute renminbi safeguards;;The world’s biggest banks have taken steps to protect themselves from the risk of a collapse of the offshore renminbi market in Hong Kong, allowing them to postpone payments and settle their transactions in US dollars in certain circumstances.The moves signal that although bankers view the internationalisation of the Chinese currency as a big opportunity, they see a risk that the small but fast-growing offshore renminbi market could seize up.While market participants say the chance of a collapse is extremely low, bankers say that a mechanism to settle trades in an emergency situation is essential. This is because China retains extensive capital controls that limit the flow of renminbi between the onshore and offshore markets.Under the measures taken, Swift, the global payments system operated by almost 10,000 banks, this week implemented a mechanism that would allow its members to complete trades with each other even if the offshore renminbi market became completely illiquid.“The offshore renminbi market is still quite small and subject to external shocks,” Lisa O’Connor, Swift’s director of renminbi internationalisation, told the Financial Times. “[These measures will] help protect banks and their customers.”Last September, the offshore renminbi market suffered unprecedented volatility when international investors dumped the renminbi for dollars, partly on concerns that the Chinese currency would not appreciate as much as they had previously believed.As a result, the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar in the offshore market diverged by 2 per cent from its onshore rate. About the same time, the pool of renminbi deposits in Hong Kong started to shrink, causing offshore renminbi interest rates to surge.Under the new mechanism, banks using the Swift network to process transactions in foreign exchange markets, money markets, and derivatives can specify that their offshore renminbi trades are subject to a special “disruption event agreement”.Drawn up by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the agreement gives banks the right to postpone payments and settle their transactions in US dollars, rather than the Chinese currency, if the offshore renminbi becomes “illiquid”, “inconvertible” or “non-transferable”.According to the definitions, a bank can trigger the disruption mechanism if it cannot access the Chinese currency in the offshore market or if it is unable to transfer renminbi between bank accounts.Banks are not alone in trying to protect themselves from unexpected shocks. Multinational companies such as Caterpillar and Tesco have also been inserting similar provisions into their bond documents when they tap the offshore renminbi bond market, or dim sum market, for funds.Andrew Malcolm, a partner at Linklaters in Hong Kong, said it has become common practice for big multinationals to include the clauses in their dim sum bond offerings. This means investors in these bonds could be paid in a currency other than renminbi if the market were rocked by extreme volatility.As of the end of last year, the renminbi was the world’s 17th biggest currency by value of payments, according to Swift. While its growth outpaced that of other major currencies, the renminbi’s 0.3 per cent share of global payments remains small compared with 43 per cent for the euro.
144;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-02-10T18:21:59Z;Illinois rebuts Caterpillar over relocation plan;;The state of Illinois has dismissed claims by Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, that the company would have moved jobs from Japan to the Midwest state were it not for a recent increase in the state’s corporate tax rate and its deep financial woes.In an email this week to cities and counties in Illinois that had made a bid for the plant, Caterpillar said its concerns about a 30 per cent increase last year in the state’s corporate income tax rate and the parlous state of its finances trumped other considerations in where to locate the jobs.“Even if your community had the right logistics for this project, Caterpillar’s previously documented concerns about the business climate and overall fiscal health of the state of Illinois still would have made it unpractical for us to select your community for this project,” the email said.However, Pat Quinn, Illinois governor, hit back, saying he had spoken to Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chief executive, who had assured him that the decision was based primarily on logistical concerns. “He told me at the time that logistics would drive that (decision),” Mr Quinn said. ”He also pointed out that they needed a deep-sea port.”Caterpillar – one of Illinois’ biggest employers and exporters, with 23,000 employees in the state out of 125,000 globally – plans to transfer work from its three-decade-old plant in Sagami, Japan, that manufactures small hydraulic excavators, small tractors and bulldozers. It is widely thought to be considering locating the jobs instead at a facility in North Carolina.Caterpillar’s tussle with the state comes as there appears to be greater momentum behind “ reshoring”, the trend for manufacturers to bring to the US jobs from overseas as they seek to simplify supply chains and lower logistics costs.President Barack Obama will present a new budget on Monday that is expected to offer a range of proposals to attract US jobs back. Among the measures are tax incentives for companies that move their overseas operations back to the US and tax penalties for those that do not, as well as more training and additional education.The dispute with Illinois highlights an interesting twist to the reshoring debate: that just as the US is competing with other countries to host manufacturing facilities, US states and regions are in competition with each other to win jobs, using economic incentives as a draw.Jim Dugan, the company’s spokesman, said it was reshoring to reflect a shift in demand for those products from Asia to the US and Europe. However, he stressed that the Sagami plant would not be closed, but retooled to make other components for Caterpillar equipment sold primarily in Asia.
145;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Premier Farnell’s Green wary of recovery talk;;Predictions of a global manufacturing recovery are premature, according to Premier Farnell and Electrocomponents, two British companies seen as bellwethers of economic health.Purchasing managers’ index data from 30 countries last week showed signs of an upturn and helped to lift stock markets around the world.The US manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest rate since June 2011 while Chinese output also grew, defying forecasts of a decline.But from her perch as chief executive of Premier Farnell, the electrical components distributor, Harriet Green warned that the US and Chinese economies are stuck in a “twilight zone”.Premier Farnell is considered an economic barometer because its business, based on 24-hour delivery across the globe, is very sensitive to shifts in short-term demand.In July 2011, the company was one of the first to warn that a global slowdown was imminent.“If you take the aggregate, a sort of patchy North America, a Europe which is definitely a bit battle-weary and Asia which is very constellated around a China that is recalibrating, I think it’s really quite hard to tell what’s going to happen,” said Ms Green.Ian Mason, chief executive of Electrocomponents, another UK-based distributor, said his company had also seen a weakening of growth.Between October and January, the company’s sales grew 4 per cent but, in January, revenues rose by just one per cent.Mr Mason attributed two percentage points of this decline to global economic conditions.“The PMI data look to have bottomed out but is this irrational optimism or a return in confidence – who knows?” he asked.Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered, said signs from around the world were mixed but added: “What people often ignore is that the world economy is continuing to grow. Since the crisis, it has grown 14 per cent in nominal terms. Some of that is inflation. But the bulk is growth, led by emerging economies such as China.”Major North American industrial companies, such as Caterpillar, are forecasting that the US will be among the biggest growth markets this year.The US has added more net manufacturing jobs since the start of 2010 than any other leading economy.However, Ms Green believes that the rhetoric surrounding the US presidential campaign is masking economic fundamentals.“What confuses many of us is how much of the new-found confidence is the entire political system going into overdrive and everyone feeling so much better because that’s what we’re told to think,” she said, comparing the pre-election mood to going to Las Vegas or Disneyland.Ms Green also expressed doubts about the manufacturing data from China.“The Chinese manage their statistics very well. In fact, I think this would be the first time ever that a week after Chinese New Year, PMIs have risen,” she said.Ben Uglow, capital goods analyst at Morgan Stanley, was also sceptical. “The idea that we are back to business as usual is laughable. At the moment, people seem to want to look through the valley rather than focus on the gradient as we go down.”
146;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-02-05T17:05:21Z;North Asia to lead wave of M&A activity;;North Asian companies will lead a wave of acquisition activity out of the region this year as South Korean executives increasingly join those from Japan and China in acting on their overseas ambitions, according to bankers in the region.Deal volumes should remain high in spite of the slowdown at the end of last year, which was less pronounced than other regions, and the slightly slower start to this year than in 2011. In spite of the shadow cast by uncertainty over the fate of Europe’s leading economies and the withdrawal of their banks from the region, north Asian groups remain cash-rich and well supported by domestic lenders, bankers say.Korean and Japanese groups are being driven to look abroad by limited growth opportunities and higher costs at home. This is likely to lead to more deals in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and all kinds of consumer goods.“Going forward, we are likely to see more outbound activity from Korean and, in particular, Japanese companies given the lower growth opportunities in the domestic Japanese market and their relatively higher cost bases,” said Edward King, head of Asia M&A at Barclays Capital, adding that Japanese groups would be encouraged to exploit the strong yen.Japanese companies have already been busy with deals such as Takeda Pharmaceutical’s $13.7bn takeover of Nycomed of Germany, one of the biggest outbound deals ever from Japan, and beer maker Kirin’s deal for Aleadri-Schinni of Brazil.Colin Banfield, the Asia-based co-head of global cross border M&A at Citigroup, who advised Kirin on its deal, said Asian buyers would continue to hunt for assets in Europe and Latin America during 2012.“But for an asset to be attractive to an Asian buyer, there has to be a brand that is already known in Asia or something else that is useful back home,” he said. “It’s not about going abroad for the sake of being abroad.”Chinese companies are expected to be active in similar sectors to their Japanese and Korean peers, but for the most part they will continue to feed the country’s hunger for energy and resources. According to Ernst & Young, upstream energy business, the extraction of resources, accounted for 75 per cent of all Asian deal volumes last year.As the region grows and develops, deal sizes are getting larger too, with 2011 seeing a record 149 deals of $1bn-plus in size, according to Citigroup. The year also saw 16 deals larger than $5bn – a joint record with 2007.“China now has the largest banks and the largest resource companies in the world,” said BarCap’s Mr King.“China is also keen to create global multinationals, the future IBMs and ExxonMobils, which is done more quickly via M&A than through organic growth.”Western industry also remains keen to increase exposure to the growth markets of Asia, but Robert Ashworth, Asia Managing Partner at Freshfields, warned that buyers and sellers could find it harder to come to terms.“On the inbound side, we are seeing the classic mismatch of expectations between the sellers’ view of the fundamentals behind their assets in Asia and buyers wanting some discount for the widespread economic uncertainty,” he said.One way to bridge such gaps is through an earn-out feature for the seller. Caterpillar, which bought Hong Kong-listed Era Mining machinery for almost $900m last year, used a loan note issued to the sellers for this purpose, according tow one person involved.
147;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Look before you leap, Mr Zuckerberg;;Dear Mark Zuckerberg,Congratulations on your IPO filing.We understand that you are faced with a difficult decision soon on where to list your stock.You have probably heard from your bankers that the Nasdaq exchange is for tech savvy companies like Google and Apple and the NYSE is where the blue chip companies like GE and Caterpillar choose to list.You may think that the Nasdaq market is more of an electronic exchange where dealers place competing bids and offers to help facilitate institutional client trades.You may look at financial television and see scenes from the NYSE and think that the NYSE market is more of a floor-based auction model where your stock would trade at a “post” on the exchange.You may be thinking that regardless of which exchange you pick, your stock will help investors create wealth for themselves by investing in your company for the long-term.We hate to break the bad news to you but the fact is, in today’s market, it doesn’t matter where you list. Your stock is about to become one of the biggest casino chips on Wall Street.Ever hear the terms “rebate arbitrage” or “latency arbitrage”? Ever hear of “colocation”? Do you know what “an exchange private data feed” is? How about an “actionable IOI” or a “dark pool”?We bet you have probably never heard of these terms (maybe you have been too busy coding lately).These terms are really what stock trading is all about nowadays. Your stock will now be traded by high frequency traders who have an average holding period of 22 seconds.The majority of them won’t care about your earnings, or your new “likey like” button that you just launched. They won’t care about how many gazillion users you just signed up or how many eyeballs are on your site.They will only care about flipping your stock for a very small profit – millions of times per day. They will only care about getting paid a rebate 1/3 penny per share to “add liquidity” in your stock.They are not looking to invest in Facebook, they are looking at it as a tool to help them make money in their high speed arbitrage world.Before you make your decision on where to list, also keep in mind that one-third of your stock will be traded in dark pools that are off-exchange and away from the public’s eye.Know that even though the spread in your stock will be one penny (most of the time), your stock will not necessarily be liquid. Sure your stock will trade a lot of volume, but this is not the same as liquidity.Know that when your stock starts to move around intraday by 3-5 per cent, there will be no one to call to ask what is going on.You may be thinking now, how did this happen? How did the stock market get so screwed up? What ever happened to the goals of capital raising and investor protection?Well, it’s a long story. One that is much too long for this letter. Maybe if you have some time, give us a call and we’ll explain what happened.Best of luck on the IPO. If you pick the NYSE, know that the podium looks much bigger on television.Joe SaluzziCo-founder and co-head of trading at Themis Trading in New Jersey
148;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-30T17:28:16Z;Sany Heavy: China digs in;The Putzmeister deal is significant because Sany will quadruple foreign sales overnight;China serves up some heebie-jeebies yet again, this time directed towards the global market for construction machinery. Sany Heavy, the country’s biggest maker of cool-sounding machines such as concrete pumps, excavators and cranes, is to buy 90 per cent of German concrete pump-maker Putzmeister for €324m.Sure, Putzmeister is small fry, with only a 10th of the revenues of Sany. But the deal is significant because it is Sany’s first overseas acquisition and will quadruple its foreign sales overnight. Just 4 per cent of Sany’s revenues came from outside China in the first half of last year. By contrast, more than four-fifths of Putzmeister’s sales come from countries outside of China, Morgan Stanley estimates. Sany gets access to Putzmeister’s global distribution and after-sales service channels and there are potential synergies by supplying its parts to Putzmeister’s assembly plants.With a listing in Shanghai and just a third of its shares freely floating, it is tricky for investors to cash in on Sany’s global ambitions yet (it is also mulling a Hong Kong listing). Instead, they should worry more about potential damage to market leaders Caterpillar and Komatsu. A slowdown in construction growth in China has sharpened Sany’s need for overseas growth. It has already built plants in the US, Brazil, India and Germany. And Chinese heavy equipment makers such as Zoomlion, XCMG and LiuGong have been boosting sales in Brazil, in particular.Caterpillar’s revenues may be seven times that of Sany’s at $60bn last year, but three quarters of them come from outside Asia. With cheaper manufacturing costs at home, Sany benefits from operating margins double those of Caterpillar’s. It can therefore afford to be much more aggressive in expanding its share abroad. The construction machinery land-grab is on.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
149;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-30T15:52:47Z;China’s Sany to acquire Putzmeister;;China has laid claim to a pillar of German industry after Sany Heavy Industry, the country’s largest construction equipment group, said it would acquire Putzmeister, a Mittelstand company that makes high-tech concrete pumps.The deal is among the largest in which a Chinese company acquires one of the family-owned, niche-focused, German engineering groups – the backbone of the German economy. The term Mittelstand covers Germany’s legion of small and medium-sized family groups.Sany, whose chairman is China’s richest man, and Citic PE Advisors, a Chinese private equity company, will acquire all of Putzmeister, with Citic retaining a minority shareholding. Sany and Citic will pay €360m for the business, as well as taking on Putzmeister’s debt, giving the company an enterprise value of just over €500m.* Sany will pay 90 per cent and Citic Capital 10 per cent.The Mittelstand’s engineering prowess and strong brands are highly attractive to potential foreign suitors but tight family control has been a barrier to widespread Chinese takeovers in Germany.The deal could herald a new era of Chinese dealmaking in Europe as Chinese companies look to “go global” and reduce their exposure to their domestic economy. Zoomlion, Sany’s Chinese rival, bought Italy’s concrete pumps maker Cifa in 2009.Other German Mittelstand companies now in Chinese hands include Waldrich Coburg, a maker of milling machines, and Dürrkopp Adler, a maker of sewing machines.“There will be surprise that a former star of the German economy and a hidden champion has been taken over by the Chinese. It’s a wake-up call,” said Hermann Simon, chairman of Simon-Kucher & Partners, a German consultancy.“There is still a perception that Chinese companies produce only cheap wares. Sany is different – they are the vanguard of new Chinese competition.”Sany had €800m equivalent cash at hand before the deal and is funding the purchase straight off its balance sheet, according to a person familiar with the company. It is Sany’s first ever deal abroad as it looks towards becoming a global player in this sector and add to the overseas sales it has generated organically. The group has looked at a number of acquisitions in the past couple of years, but not managed to pull one off yet, according to the person.The company, which listed a smaller international arm in Hong Kong last year, is itself listed in Shanghai and has grown extremely rapidly in recent years. It reported revenues of almost Rmb34bn (€4.1bn) in 2010 and net income before taxes of Rmb6.94bn. Sales in 2010 were almost 80 per cent ahead of the Rmb18.98bn reported for 2009 and more than treble Rmb9bn of 2007.In 2009 Sany, which makes a wide range of machinery from excavators to mobile cranes, overtook Putzmeister as the world’s largest concrete pumps manufacturer by sales. The Shanghai-listed company – often referred to as China’s Caterpillar – wants to build a global Chinese construction equipment brand and already has plants in the US, Brazil, India and Germany.But most of its sales are still at home, where government measures have cooled the property market and reduced demand for construction equipment. In Europe, Sany has until now lacked a large sales and service network and established brand name.Last year Sany opened a greenfield €100m research and development plant near Cologne – the biggest Chinese corporate investment in Europe– explaining that if it wanted to become a world-class company it needed to reach the best global manufacturing and engineering talent.Putzmeister, based near Stuttgart, has about 3,000 employees. Revenues reached a record €1bn in 2007 but fell by about half during 2008 and 2009, leading to hundreds of job cuts.Although the company has returned to growth and profitability, revenues last year were about €570m.A person close to the deal said Karl Schlecht, 79, the company’s founder, had trouble finding a successor and therefore sought an investor.Putzmeister’s truck-mounted boom pumps – normally used to pour concrete for new bridges or high-rise buildings – were used to help cool the Fukushima nuclear reactor. Putzmeister pumps were also used in the construction of Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building.Putzmeister’s headquarters is set to become Sany’s global non-Chinese centre for concrete equipment and will have a high degree of autonomy, the parties said. Sany will continue to focus on the Chinese market.Liang Wengen, Sany’s chairman, said: “With this merger, Putzmeister and Sany will create a new and global market leader for concrete pumps.”Mr Schlecht said: “This merger is a global showcase transaction. Sany is one of the few large Chinese conglomerates which is personally operated by the founder, who is also the majority shareholder.“[Liang Wengen] not only shares our entrepreneurial spirit, but also Putzmeister’s vision and corporate values.”The transaction is subject to approval by regulatory authorities. Morgan Stanley advised Putzmeister.Additional reporting by Paul J Davies*updated
150;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-29T16:30:30Z;Chinese shopping spree slows;US and European companies report reduced orders;Buoyant Chinese demand has been a wonderful palliative for western industrial companies in recent years, helping to offset anaemic European and US sales.However, comments from leading industrial companies last week suggest Chinese demand for a host of western-produced capital goods ranging from earthmoving equipment to automation technology is – at least temporarily – starting to slow.China’s efforts to rein in the real estate market and engineer a soft landing come as its manufacturers hold back fixed-asset investments because of tighter credit, overcapacity and slower demand from the debt-encumbered eurozone.Volvo, the commercial vehicles group, warned as early as last summer of an impending slowdown in Chinese demand for construction equipment, which it described as temporary.In October ABB, the Swiss electrical engineering group, also observed weaker demand for its power systems and process automation technology in China, where orders declined by 5 per cent in the third quarter.As European and US industrials have begun reporting their latest quarterly figures, more companies have expressed caution on the short-term outlook in China.Siemens, the German industrial bellwether that makes everything from trains to gas turbines and medical diagnostic equipment, warned last week that Chinese orders had declined by 16 per cent to €1.4bn in its fiscal first quarter, owing primarily to weakness in industrial automation – a technology that is typically one of the first to register a slowdown because of short lead times.Joe Kaeser, chief financial officer, said: “The whole world was worried to death about a hard landing [in China] …We have reason to hope this is a soft landing in progress, and after that there will be a journey to new heights.” The company, he added, expected a return to growth in China in the fourth quarter.Sandvik, the Swedish tool and mining equipment maker that cut 500 jobs this month, said “financing uncertainty” in China had “reduced the willingness of companies and private individuals to invest”.In the US, Caterpillar, the manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, said it had also seen a drop in sales of new machines in China last year, although it had gained market share.Different companies have experienced the slowdown at different points. United Technologies, the manufacturer of Otis elevators, was hit only in the fourth quarter of 2011, when order growth slowed to 7 per cent from a 20 per cent average for the year. Greg Hayes, United Technologies’ chief financial officer, said this was “directly due to the actions of the government to try to slow down housing”.Other western companies have not yet suffered at all. Growth in Chinese car sales slowed last year after the government withdrew tax incentives for small-engine vehicles. But premium carmakers such as BMW and Volkswagen’s Audi were among foreign companies that continued to enjoy record sales, boosting suppliers.Honeywell, the US industrial group, highlighted sales of truck components such as turbochargers as a particular area of strength. Controls for mining and other process industries had also had strong growth in orders, it said.Meanwhile, retail sales have remained robust. Apple said Chinese demand was “staggering” and “off the charts”.The Chinese economy grew at an annual rate of 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, the weakest in 2½ years but still a handsome pace by western standards, and economists still expect gross domestic product to expand by about 8 per cent this year.Analysts believe western industrials should have few troubles withstanding a couple of quarters of slower growth, and with an average of about 10 per cent of Chinese sales exposure remains limited. Investment is likely to pick up this year if China, as expected, eases monetary policy further to support the economy.However, some economists believe the dynamics of the Chinese economy might change, meaning foreign industrials that profit from the country’s growth will have to change, too. China’s property boom, for example, may become a thing of the past.“China has no choice but to switch from an investment-driven to a consumption-driven economy. Infrastructure, construction and mining-related industries should see their growth rates wane accordingly,” analysts at Société Générale told clients.Wage inflation will instead encourage greater industrial automation in China, while China’s growing ranks of elderly will require spending on medical equipment, its report noted.In addition, US and European companies will also face increasing competition on their own turf.Bernd Laux at Cheuvreux said. “The more the Chinese economy slows, the more Chinese vendors will try to sell their wares abroad.”Additional reporting by Simon Rabinovitch in Beijing, Jeremy Lemer in New York and Michael Stothard in Stockholm
151;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-27T21:39:58Z;Wall Street retreats from bull market;;"Fourth-quarter earnings season gathered momentum this week but macroeconomic news moved the market; the S&P 500 closed in bull market territory on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve forecast prolonged low interest rates, but the index retreated on Friday as US growth figures came in beneath expectations.The S&P 500 ended the week up just 0.1 per cent to 1,316.32. It had climbed as high as 1,333.47, a gain of more than 21 per cent from the close on October 3, as equity analysts said the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep interest rates low until the end of 2014 was bullish for equities.“The Fed intervention should turn savers into investors, bringing money back into the market,” said Douglas Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “For the next three years at least, bank deposits will make no money, and even the most conservative savers can’t be happy with zero returns.”Utility and material stocks appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the Fed’s move, with both sectors gaining in a falling market. Analysts said material stocks offer a hedge against the inflationary effect of low interest rates – as commodity prices rise with inflation – while low interest rates would make it easier for utility companies to fund infrastructure investments.Apple, meanwhile, briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as its shares surged 6.4 per cent to $447.28 following blockbuster results on Tuesday. That helped the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index to a handy 1.1 per cent gain over the week, closing at 2,816.55.It also triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.For example, Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $6.82, even though the company cuts its forecast for full-year earnings.But the news was less good for companies supplying other smartphone manufacturers. SanDisk shares tumbled 11 per cent to $46.70 over the week, as the semiconductor manufacturer said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt 2012 revenue, and announced it had put a new production facility on hold.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, fell 0.5 per cent to 12,660.46, lagging other indices, as poor fourth-quarter results weighed on several companies.Mobile phone network Verizon fell 4.5 per cent to $37.21 and rival AT&T was off 4.4 per cent to $29.16, as both reported unexpectedly large payments to their pension funds. Pension contributions also sapped margins at 3M, although shares in the technology supplier still climbed 2.1 per cent to $87.46 on strong earnings.Caterpillar was another bright spot in the Dow, climbing 5.3 per cent to $111.28 as the earth-moving company gave a bullish forecast for spending on construction in the US.But that was not enough to sustain a rally in homebuilders, which sold off on Thursday as December new home sales came in lower than expected. Lennar ended the week up just 1 per cent at $22.28, although the stock remains up 13.4 per cent for the year.With the quarterly earnings of 196 S&P 500 constituents reported, companies have beaten analysts’ forecasts at the lowest rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. Revenue growth is also set to outpace earnings growth, suggesting US corporate margins are being squeezed.The financial sector of the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent over the week, although data from Lipper showed funds investing in US banks had attracted inflows for eight successive weeks, the longest such run since March 2000.Brokers Charles Schwab and E Trade Financial fell 9 per cent to $11.67 and 15.2 per cent to $8.19 respectively, as fourth-quarter earnings were hit by low trading volumes.Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell 10.4 per cent to $16.89, as mark-to-market losses on collateralised debt obligation securities hit earnings by $12.1m, or four cents a share. Brian Zabora at Stifel Nicolaus said Zions was the only regional bank he covers that still had exposure to CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.Netflix jumped 23.5 per cent to $123.79 over the week as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [domestic earnings] and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix is now up almost 80 per cent for the year, although part appears to be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset."
152;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-26T22:10:35Z;Netflix climbs on global prospects;;Netflix surged 22.1 per cent to $115.84 as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [earnings] for its domestic business and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix shares are now up 68 per cent for the year, although part of that may be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset.“This stock has been highly volatile. Our calls have been highly volatile,” conceded Mr Mahaney.The S&P 500 started higher, up 0.6 per cent to 1,333.47, almost 15 points into bull market territory. But data on December new home sales, which came in below the November number and expectations, sparked a reversal. The benchmark index closed at 1,318.145, outside bull territory, with a loss of 0.6 per cent for the day.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 2.4 per cent to $7.80 on the home sales data, with DR Horton off 2.6 per cent to $14.12 and Lennar down 2.9 per cent to $22.13.Caterpillar provided some cheer for the sector, predicting real terms spending on US construction will increase in 2012 for the first time since 2004, but analysts warned against excessive optimism.“Sellers of new single-family homes face a similar challenge as one might have selling ice to Eskimos. The market is awash with plenty of existing homes and the supply is likely to increase as banks proceed with more foreclosures,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not have any homebuilders constituents, dropped just 0.2 per cent to 12,734.63, as Caterpillar shares climbed 2.1 per cent to $111.31 on the earthmover’s strong results.AT&T fell 2.5 per cent to $29.45, as the mobile phone network posted a fourth-quarter loss despite surging smartphone sales, as a hefty charge relating to its failed bid for T-Mobile weighed heavily.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,805.28, as poor results from SanDisk weighed on semiconductor stocks.SanDisk shares closed 11.4 per cent lower at $46.39, as the afterglow from Apple’s blockbuster results earlier in the week faded for smartphone suppliers. SanDisk said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt revenue in the first half of the year, and put a new production facility on hold.Electronic broker E Trade Financial slumped 14.6 per cent to $7.99, as it reported weak fourth-quarter results on low trading volumes.Keith Murray at Nomura retained his buy recommendation, arguing “several noisy items related to credit and expenses” contributed 10 cents a share of the miss.JC Penney shares surged 18.8 per cent to $40.72 as the company forecast strong 2012 earnings, and said it would stop relying on heavy discounting and promotions to attract customers.Time Warner climbed 7.8 per cent to $74.51 after the company used a strong earnings report to announce a $4bn share buy-back scheme and raise its dividend.Investor choices continued to be guided by the Federal Open Market Committee’s forecast of low interest rates until the end of 2014. As was the case on Wednesday, utility and material stocks were among the best performers in the S&P 500.Utilities, which are considered a carry-trade by some investors, because low interest rates reduce the cost of infrastructure investments, were up 0.5 per cent.Materials climbed 0.6 per cent, suggesting some investors are nervous of the inflationary impact of a prolonged low-interest rate environment: commodity prices tend to rise with inflation, offering some protection to materials stocks.Financials sold off led by insurers and regional banks, with lower long-term interest rates expected to put pressure on lending margins, and investment returns.Insurer Lincoln National fell 5.7 per cent to $20.69, while SunTrust Banks was off 5.2 per cent to $20.50.Greenhill & Co bucked the trend as shares surged 12.3 per cent to $49.36. The boutique investment firm posted better than expected revenue. It also followed the lead of large investment banks by cutting compensation – only 50 per cent of revenues were paid out in salaries, down from 73 per cent a year ago.“We are at a juncture where there is opportunity for advisory boutique firms like Greenhill to take away business from big companies,” Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities is reported to have said.
153;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-26T18:48:32Z;Industrial groups see strong US growth;;North American industrial companies are predicting that the US will be one of their big growth markets in 2012 for the first time since the start of the financial crisis, reflecting rising demand for everything from excavators to truck parts.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment, brushed off concerns about a possible slowdown in the global economy and said it expected real US construction spending to increase this year for the first time since 2004.The upturn in demand in the US was helping the manufacturer to experience its “best growth since Harry Truman was president”, said Mike DeWalt, head of investor relations.The International Monetary Fund warned this week that global economic growth was slowing and might slow further if European leaders did not take decisive action to tackle their sovereign debt crisis.While Caterpillar echoed concerns that policymakers could derail the recovery by prematurely tightening economic policies, the company said it expected the US economy to pick up steam this year and added that “the risk of a worldwide recession has diminished significantly”.The vote of confidence in the US was underscored by Eaton, the manufacturer of industrial equipment and components for trucks and aircraft, which said it expected its markets to grow faster in the US than in the rest of the world for the first time since the mid-2000s.Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said he expected economic growth would still be faster in emerging economies such as China and India than in the US. But Eaton’s sales had been hit by the slowdown in Chinese construction, he said, while US markets were picking up.“Most people would say their view of the US economy is a little better than it was three months ago,” he said. “Consumers are spending money, non-residential construction is starting to rise, the car market is picking up and exports and manufacturing capacity utilisation are up, creating demand for trucks and factory automation equipment.”Even the US residential housing market, which had had “its worst year since World War Two” in 2011 was now starting to turn up a little, Mr Cutler said.After trailing for the first ten months of last year, a late surge in housing construction meant that work began on 606,900 houses in the US last year, up from 586,900 in 2010. Caterpillar predicts there will be 700,000 housing starts this year.Official figures also suggested a robust outlook for US capital spending. New orders for durable goods orders rose 3 per cent in December, following an upwardly revised 4.3 per cent increase in November, according to the commerce department, beating analysts’ average forecast of a 2 per cent increase.Caterpillar said it would increase its capital expenditure this year to $4bn from $3bn in 2011 to take advantage of what it believes is a multiyear economic up-cycle.The company said it expects revenues of $68bn-$72bn this year and profits of about $9.25 per share, ahead of the $9.07 analysts expected. It issued its outlook as it reported profits for the fourth quarter of last year that far exceeded Wall Street forecasts. Caterpillar earned $1.5bn in the fourth quarter, up from $968m in the same period a year earlier.Stripping out the impact of its November 2010 acquisition of Bucyrus International, the mining-equipment maker, Caterpillar earned a net profit of $2.25 per share, well ahead of the $1.69 analysts had been expecting on average.The figures completed a year in which Caterpillar notched up record revenues, profits, exports and order backlog.However, industrial companies’ expectations for the US market have not been universally strong. Emerson Electric, the industrial equipment manufacturer, said on Wednesday that in the three months to December, its orders were hit by “delayed infrastructure investment by US telecommunications service providers” and a “challenging” market for air conditioners in North America.Caterpillar shares were trading up 2.5 per cent at $111.17 by early afternoon in New York. Eaton was down 3.2 per cent at $47.98, while Emerson was down 0.3 per cent at $51.93.
154;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Comment: SEC’s audit trail gamble;US regulator has to lay out case for computer project;Just a few weeks after the notorious May 6 2010 “flash crash”, the US Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a multibillion-dollar supercomputer database.The database, called the CAT (consolidated audit trail), is to be a repository of US capital markets order and trade data, and promises a comprehensive view into market activity. A final proposal and mandate for the CAT is expected sometime this year.This project is a huge test of the SEC’s skill, and its fate will reveal whether the regulator can emerge from an existential crisis that began with the 2008 financial collapse and accelerated with the Madoff and Stanford scandals.Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC, told Congress in December 2010: “[The database is] perhaps for me one of the most important things I can try to get accomplished at the SEC.”However, as currently imagined, the CAT might flop, with mortal consequences. A year and a half after announcing the initiative, the SEC has not said how much it will cost, how long it will take to build, or what good it will do – other than to answer “billions”, “years” and “lots”.The SEC’s first forecasts for the project envisaged it taking three or four years and $4bn to build, and $2.1bn a year to operate. Six months later Ms Schapiro appeared before Congress with welcome news: the SEC believed the CAT would cost much less and be implemented considerably sooner.She was pressed for details and was asked if it would cost only half as much as she first thought. “I would hope so. I honestly don’t know,” Ms Schapiro replied. Would it take only half as much time? “Again, I don’t know and I don’t want to be misleading in any way because I truly don’t know, but it would very much be my hope.”As for the good it will do, the SEC has been similarly vague. Markets have changed dramatically in the past decade. There are now dozens of venues for stock and options trading and new participants such as high frequency trading firms dominate. The SEC and exchanges need a window into the modern world to combat “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices in the marketplace”.But little has been said about why efforts so far fall short, or whether there are alternatives to a multibillion-dollar database, or how much more productive regulators can be with the new facility. Market participants are being asked to take it for granted that a gigantic database will make regulators more productive, without knowing what the result will be.This is especially troubling given that one US regulator, Finra, says it now has a view across 80 per cent of US equities trading. Yet so far there has been little or no uptick in actions against fraudulent and manipulative acts committed in exchange-traded securities.Have US regulators ever detected front-running on the exchanges? So far as we can see in the public record, no. Have regulators detected spoofing? Again, the record is discouraging. Front-running and spoofing have been prosecuted in the past, but those schemes were reported by tipsters. This record of spotty detection was true even before markets changed and fogged regulator sightlines.Perhaps markets have changed so much regulators now need a supercomputer database to detect abuses. Or perhaps regulators just do not know how to find fraud and manipulation in exchange-traded stocks and options. Or perhaps fraud just does not happen very often. We do not know, but we should. Rarely have so many laboured so long to do so little.Who pays for all of this? In the equities markets, high frequency firms are estimated to account for between 55 per cent and 75 per cent of trading and to earn total gross revenues of $3bn-$6bn a year, depending on the study.Now the SEC wants to spend as much as $2bn a year just to capture and save order and trade data, most of which these firms create. Others want a transaction tax on high frequency participants to pay for it all. Even critics of these companies think this is overreach.The SEC should start more prudently, taking data from the exchanges alone, on a next-day basis, rather than insisting on real-time data from every firm in the market. Those simple changes could cut the cost to a small fraction and still burn off much of the fog.If the SEC proves the database is a benefit, it can ask for more. If it is of little use, the SEC can change course without risking its reputation. Coming on the heels of repeated failures such as Madoff, Stanford and a botched lease for $550m of Washington office space it could neither afford nor fill, the SEC cannot suffer another expensive failure and survive intact.RT Leuchtkafer is a private investor based in New York
155;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:06:19+0000;Business returns to US as Asia loses edge;;"Bruce Cochrane’s family furniture business illustrates what may be the start of a US industrial renaissance.His story also offers insights into the opportunities and the pitfalls facing manufacturers wanting to build up their US production.The Cochranes were in the furniture business for five generations, employing more than 1,000 people in the early 1980s. But by 1996 the going had become too hard and they decided to sell out. Under the new owners, their factory in Lincolnton, North Carolina, was closed, the equipment was dismantled and production was moved to Asia.Mr Cochrane worked for 12 years as an import consultant, advising companies on how to source furniture from Asia to sell in the US. But by last year, he had come to the view it was viable to make furniture in the US again, even against competition from China.“Back in 2000, the average wage in China was about 50 cents an hour; now it’s $3.50,” he says.Non-wage costs have also risen in China. The Chinese authorities have become “much more aggressive” about environmental regulation, he adds. Taking into account the higher productivity of US workers, and shipping costs, the competitive advantage of Asian manufacturing was disappearing, he said.So last year, he announced that Lincolnton Furniture would open up production of high-quality wooden beds, tables chairs and cabinets in his family business’s old plant. “The ‘Made in the USA’ label is more important now than it’s ever been. People are looking for American-made,” he says.“I’m convinced that our timing is exceptionally good.”He is not alone in that view. Plenty of economists and business leaders believe that US manufacturing is entering an upturn that is not just a bounce-back after the recession, but a sign of a longer-term structural improvement. Manufacturing employment has grown faster in the US since the recession than in any other leading developed economy, according to official figures. Productivity growth, subdued wages, the steady decline in the dollar since 2002 and rapid pay inflation in emerging economies have combined to make the US a more attractive location.“Over the past decade, the US has had some huge gains in productivity, and we have seen unit labour costs actually falling,” says Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. “A lot of our members tell us that it sometimes is cheaper to produce in the US, especially because labour costs are lower.”The increased competitiveness of US production has been reflected in the past couple of years in job creation announcements from Ford, GM, Caterpillar, Sleek Audio, Farouk Systems and many others. President Barack Obama recently called it a “hopeful trend”.However, Mr Cochrane highlights a problem that faces many manufacturers in the US. Although there was a substantial population of unemployed and under-employed former furniture workers in Lincolnton, many did not know how to use the latest equipment.“People have to be retrained for the new machinery,” he says. “Even people with experience of computer-aided woodworking machinery are amazed at the new technology that’s available.”It is a common refrain from US employers; the flipside of the improvement in productivity. Modern factories are now highly sophisticated, using automation and other advanced technology. This enables them to compete against producers in China while still paying much higher wages. The result, however, is that they need fewer people, and they tend to be more highly skilled.Mei Xu is a Chinese-born entrepreneur who has become a standard bearer for “re-shoring” production in the US. Chesapeake Bay Candle, her company, employs about 120 of its 2,000 staff in factories in Maryland and California.At a meeting at the White House last week to discuss what the administration has dubbed “insourcing”, she stressed the need for workers with the right skills and aptitudes.“We really need high school kids to get some vocational training,” she says. “They need the skills to be able to work in a factory that is entirely automated. Workers in their 50s may be willing to work, but may not have the computer skills to use the technology.”James Guyette, the chief executive for North America of Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine company, who was also at the White House meeting, agrees that “the education system must improve”.Rolls-Royce is creating about 600 highly skilled jobs in the US, but has cut some lower-skilled ones, so the net gain in its employment is lower. The company is working with universities, colleges and even schools in an attempt to raise skill levels in the states where it has its plants and research and development facilities.Mr Guyette warns that however strong the recovery, the labour market will never return to what it was.“Many of the jobs that have been lost in this country are never coming back,” he says. “And those are the low-skilled jobs.”"
156;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-17T21:30:54Z;Jobs boost fuels hope for US industry;;Manufacturing employment has grown faster in the US than in any other leading developed economy since the start of the recovery, as productivity gains and subdued pay rises raise hopes for an American industrial renaissance.The US has added more net manufacturing jobs since the start of 2010 than the rest of the Group of 7 developed countries put together, with only two other economies, Germany and Canada, increasing factory employment at all.At 11.79m, employment in US manufacturing is still about 2m below its pre-recession levels. About 2.3m factory jobs were lost in 2007-09, and 328,000 jobs (seasonally adjusted) have been created since then.However, hopes are rising that the US is entering a sustained manufacturing revival.Since the start of 2010, manufacturing employment has risen 2.9 per cent in the US compared with 2.4 per cent in Germany and 1.9 per cent in Canada. In Japan, the UK, Italy and France it has fallen.Bruce Cochrane, chief executive of Lincolnton Furniture, a company that is reopening a plant in North Carolina that was shut down in 2008, said: “We’ll all be faced with different types of problems. But this is going to be the place to be, and America is going to be the manufacturing powerhouse.”A detailed look at the condition of the US economy state-by-stateMark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said: “I think we are at an inflection point for manufacturing in the US. Employment in the industry has been in decline for decades, but it is now at a point where it is going from quite strong to stronger.”Productivity growth over the past decade and slow wage rises, combined with the decline in the dollar, have boosted US competitiveness. In 2002-10, US manufacturing unit labour costs in dollar terms fell 11 per cent, compared with rises of 3 per cent rise in Japan and 41 per cent in Germany.The US has also been improving its relative cost position compared with China, where wages have been rising annually by 15 per cent or more for most of the past eight years.Companies including Ford, Caterpillar, General Electric and Otis Elevator, owned by United Technologies, have announced manufacturing job creation plans in the US in the past couple of years. In some cases, companies say that they plan to bring back to the US production previously done in emerging economies such as China and Mexico.In his video address at the weekend, President Barack Obama hailed “CEOs who take pride in hiring people here in America, not just because it’s increasingly the right thing to do for their bottom line, but also because it’s the right thing to do for their workers and for our communities and our country”.Higher oil prices, which raise transport costs, and the shale gas boom that has cut local energy bills have also made the US a more attractive location.Mark Perry of the University of Michigan-Flint said: “All these factors are coming together: the stars are aligning to favour US manufacturing. The sector has been getting stronger, and I expect that to continue in 2012 and beyond.”However, executives and analysts warned that productivity gains through automation meant that it would be difficult to replace all the jobs that had been lost.Brad Jensen, of the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, said: “To call it a false hope would be too strong but we need to be clear-eyed: manufacturing is not really where the US comparative advantage lies.”He argued that the higher-skilled sectors, where wages were above $45,000 per year or so, would be less affected by import competition. He added that the US should be looking to business services, including finance, the media and professional services, as sources of jobs and export income.
157;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-04T02:38:12Z;Wave energy pioneer courts big engineers;Pelamis received £45m in venture capital funding;Three of Britain’s biggest engineering groups are being sounded out in an effort to find a “UK solution” to the conundrum of how to finance one of the world’s most advanced suppliers in the fledgling wave energy sector.The company up for sale is Pelamis Wave Power of Edinburgh, which hopes to attract interest from BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Weir after receiving £45m in funding from venture capital groups since it was started in 1998.The response to ideas about acquiring Pelamis will be a useful test of corporate interest in wave power machines, which employ a range of mechanisms to extract energy from the oceans and convert it into electricity.While the technology is considered one of the most promising areas of renewable energy, the costs of producing Pelamis’s hardware are 5-10 times higher than they need to be before the machines can rival conventional forms of power, such as gas turbines.Other companies to be canvassed about their potential interest in acquiring Pelamis, which is thought to be worth £30m-£50m, include Siemens of Germany, Caterpillar of the US, ABB of Switzerland and Alstom of France.All are interested in zero-carbon forms of power and could, at least in theory, afford the outlays of perhaps £10m-£20m that might be needed in the next few years to bring Pelamis’s technology to fruition.Per Hornung Pedersen, Pelamis’s chief executive, said: “We have reached the stage where it makes most sense to look for financial support from a large engineering company rather than [to] seek further investment from venture capital groups.”While his main aim was to find the “right company” to buy Pelamis, he “favoured the idea of a British buyer”. Professor Jim McDonald, vice-chancellor of Strathclyde University in Glasgow, a leading academic establishment for engineering, said: “From my perspective, the ideal solution would be to find a UK business to buy Pelamis.”Ernst & Young, the consultancy, has been retained by Pelamis with the aim of finding a buyer during the next six months. Among the names on the list of companies it intends to talk to are the three UK and four non-UK companies. All seven declined to say if they would be interested.Pelamis’s semi-submerged machines, which resemble red and yellow snakes, are 180m long, weigh 1,300 tonnes and cost as much as £7m. Electricity is generated by hydraulic mechanisms and sent to the shore by cable.Mr Pedersen said Pelamis was close to starting up a production line for some machines – a transition that would require a partner with the ability to operate factories turning out complex equipment and to afford substantial outlays in working capital.Since 2005, Pelamis has chalked up cumulative revenues of £19m, including sales of two large wave power machines to Eon of Germany and Scottish Power. By 2020, it hopes to build up to sales of £50m-£100m a year.
158;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2012-01-02T17:04:26Z;Western investors target Burma;;When it opens its doors once a month, the British Club in Rangoon is normally packed with diplomats, NGO workers and English teachers buying drinks on an old-style chit.But since the long-isolated government recently launched political and economic reforms, a new group of people is propping up the bar at the club in Burma’s former capital: western investors.“We’re interested in Burma’s mining potential and we want to have a closer look as we think things might be changing,” says one private equity fund manager.Decades of isolation and tough western sanctions imposed in response to repressive military rule have left Burma as one of Asia’s poorest countries, forced to rely on billions of dollars of Chinese investment in extractive industries to stay afloat.But since the military junta handed power to a nominally-civilian government in March, Thein Sein, the new president, has unveiled a series of tentative reforms that have reignited speculative interest from foreign investors in one of Asia’s last untapped frontier markets.“The business community here think this is the time,” says Wael Elmawie, a Burma resident since 1999 who runs PEB Steel, a Lebanese company that builds pre-engineered steel factories. “If the government goes back on the recent changes, they will lose the trust of the world for good.”Investors hope that Hillary Clinton’s visit to Burma in November– the first by a US secretary of state for 50 years – could help to accelerate reforms, prompting the US and the European Union to consider easing the sanctions that have kept many western companies out of the country.The Financial Times reported last week that George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager who funnels aid to Burma through his Open Society Foundation, had arrived in the country for an eight-day visit.Underscoring the renewed interest in Burma, Rangoon’s top hotels are full of visiting business delegations, and many multinational companies are looking for advice on doing business in Burma, particularly in the oil and gas, telecoms and consumer goods sectors.Vietnam and the Chinese province of Guangdong have both held trade fairs in Rangoon recently, while the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore held a seminar last month on investing in Burma.Even though sanctions prevent new investment by US companies, Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, and others are doing business in the country already through third parties. Caterpillar says this trade is in “full compliance with all applicable laws”.“Almost every major US company is working on a Burma or Myanmar [as the country is officially known] folder right now,” says Ernest Bower, who heads the south-east Asia programme at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.There is no doubting the potential of Burma which, until the military took over, was a major Asian rice exporter and a strategic entrepot located between China, India and the rest of south-east Asia.In addition to an undeveloped domestic market of about 60m people, Burma is endowed with plentiful natural resources such as oil, gas and minerals. Tourism also has good potential, according to Frank Janmaat, the Dutch deputy managing director of a Burmese hotel group. Burma received just 300,000 foreign tourists last year, little more than a 10th of the number who visited its smaller neighbour Laos.But many challenges lie ahead. The country lacks functioning banking and telecoms systems and a legal framework, and the economy remains dominated by a handful of politically-connected cronies. Moreover, the government has a history of dramatic about-turns after periods of reform.Foreign investment has so far been concentrated in the oil and gas, hydropower, mining and other extractive industries with France, South Korea, Thailand and, most notably, China leading the way.Sean Turnell, an expert on the Burmese economy at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, says these industries create relatively few jobs and impose large environmental costs on the local population, so that they are doing little to create “the foundations for future growth”.In recent decades, most Asian nations – from Thailand and Vietnam to Taiwan and Japan – have focused on export-led manufacturing to drive growth and reduce poverty. While Burma’s poor infrastructure limits its manufacturing capacity, a few pioneers have been testing the waters.Taiwan’s Asia Optical, for example, has been making lenses in Burma for the world’s biggest camera brands since 2003. Simon Cheng, a company spokesman, says the company believes that in the “long term Myanmar could be a good base to expand”.Even if the reforms continue, foreign investors will still need to deal with a lack of skilled workers, after the generals closed universities for many years and laid waste to the education system.“The people are keen to see a better future but it will take a long time to train them,” says Mr Elmawie.Additional reporting by Robin Kwong in Taipei
159;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-12-23T20:20:39Z;Capita widens remit with £7.5m purchase of ALS;;Capita, the FTSE 100 outsourcing group, has bolstered its range of services by buying a fast-growing translation business with a series of big government contracts.It is paying at least £7.5m ($12m) in cash for Applied Language Solutions, with a further consideration of up to £60m depending on performance in the next four years.ALS, founded by Gavin Wheeldon in 2003, is a business that had £10.6m in turnover in the year to May 2010 and provides global translation and interpreting services to clients including Google, Sony, Dell and Caterpillar.In August 2011, ALS’s fortunes were transformed by a five-year framework agreement with the Ministry of Justice worth about £42m a year. It should lead to all work for the courts, prisons, the Crown Prosecution Service and police forces being routed through ALS rather than directly to freelancers as at present. The ministry spends £60m annually on language services.Mr Wheeldon, who featured on Channel Four’s Secret Millionaire programme in 2008 when he lived in a poor area of Rhyl, north Wales, will remain chief executive and ALS will remain a standalone business based in the village of Delph, in the Pennines near Manchester.Mr Wheeldon, 35, says its use of machine translation, eliminating the need for people, attracted Capita. He said its size would help ALS cope with the ministry deal.He added: “The potential is huge. Capita’s strength and marketing and operations expertise will help us grow even quicker.”He said the investors on the Dragons’ Den TV programme had “missed a trick” when they failed to invest in ALS in 2007, balking at a £250,000 price tag for a 4 per cent stake. “It was a fair price,” he said.However, Mr Wheeldon has made enemies in his quest to cut the costs of the translation business. When ALS won a contract with Greater Manchester Police this year, his proposal to reduce interpreters’ pay to about £30,000 a year led them to seek a judicial review, which was successful. Nevertheless the company still works with GMP.Unite, the union, is campaigning against the ministry deal. Paul Pindar, chief executive of Capita, said: “By combining the specialist skills, market reach and proprietary technology of ALS with Capita’s operational expertise and balance sheet we believe that this will allow us to become a very strong player in the language services industry with excellent opportunities for organic growth both in the UK and internationally.”In the six months to June 30 Capita saw a 7 per cent fall in organic sales. However, pre-tax profits rose 6.7 per cent to £141.4m as acquisitions helped sales rise from £1.36bn to £1.4bn.This article is subject to a clarification and has been amended.
160;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-12-23T16:14:49Z;Candidates confront a changed Iowa;;Tara Barney smirks as she recalls when Hillary Clinton campaigned in downtown Davenport in the run-up to the 2008 Iowa caucuses.As a backdrop for her speech, Mrs Clinton’s supporters set up cornstalks and hay bales for the benefit of the television cameras – despite the fact that their candidate was speaking in the heart of a highly industrialised urban area that is Iowa’s third-biggest city.Ms Barney, chief executive of the local chamber of commerce, tells the story as an example of the pervasive caricature of Iowa as a land of farms, Evangelical churches and white folks. Consequently, it is often thought of as wholly unrepresentative of the rest of the US, and its first-in-the-nation caucus, which takes place on January 3, a poor guide to who most Americans would want for their presidential candidates.That image, says Ms Barney, is “charming but laughable”. More than 70 per cent of Iowans live in urban areas, according to the most recent census, and farming represents less than 6 per cent of the state’s gross domestic product – small compared to the 17 per cent accounted for by manufacturing or the 14 per cent produced by the financial and insurance sectors.Iowa is still overwhelmingly white, but the proportion of its population that is Latino has quadrupled in the past 20 years. Indeed, most of the growth in population in the past decade has been accounted for by Latin American immigrants, while African-Americans also make up an increasingly large segment of Iowans.Republican contenders are vying for the presidential nomination of the party in an attempt to unseat Barack Obama in 2012Two-thirds of the state’s Republicans are Evangelicals, but only half of those are classifiable as “hardcore Evangelicals” who vote chiefly on social issues rather than economic matters, says Steve Grubbs, chief executive of Victory Enterprises, a Republican political consultancy in Davenport. Moreover, Iowa is the only state beyond the north-eastern seaboard to allow gay marriage.This helps explain why, although conservative, Iowa is a swing state. It voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but supported George W. Bush, the Republican president in 2004, and his Democratic opponent Al Gore in the 2000 contest. In a presidential election that polls suggest could be much closer than the last, Iowa’s six electoral college votes will be much sought-after.As it is for most Americans, the economy is the top issue on Iowans’ minds ahead of the caucus, polls show. However, if Iowa is becoming more like an average US state in demographic terms, its economy is atypical.The economic downturn that has ravaged other parts of the US has taken a relatively light toll on the state. Its unemployment rate is now 5.7 per cent, far below the national average of 8.6 per cent. And while the state’s jobless rate pre-crisis was less than 4 per cent, the damage has been far less than that seen in the early 1980s when a combination of a Midwest farm crisis and a manufacturing recession battered Iowa and sent the rate above 8 per cent.Davenport, the largest of the “Quad Cities” that straddle the Mississippi River marking the Illinois-Iowa border, about 175 miles west of Chicago, is a good vantage point from which to survey the state’s economy. Urban and industrial, it is representative of the reality behind the state’s cornfield image.Once known as the “agricultural implement capital of the world”, the area was devastated in the 1980s, when it lost about 20,000 jobs as manufacturers such as International Harvester and Caterpillar left.As home to John Deere, the world’s biggest tractor-maker, and a large factory owned by Alcoa, the aluminium producer, manufacturing remains important to the city. Yet not necessarily private industry: its biggest local employer is the Rock Island Arsenal, a federal installation that makes weapons for the US military. When Deere and Alcoa shed hundreds of jobs in the downturn, the arsenal hired 3,000 people as it churned out equipment for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.A detailed look at the condition of the US economy state-by-stateBill Gluba, Davenport’s Democratic mayor, says the city also learnt from the 1980s crisis the need to diversify its economy: other big local employers include Genesis, a healthcare provider, and Kraft, which has a meat-processing plant in the city.These factors have helped Davenport escape the brunt of the recession. Its unemployment rate is 6.7 per cent. By contrast, the unemployment rate in nearby Rockford, Illinois – another former manufacturing hub – is 11.9 per cent.Relatively low unemployment means that when Iowans say they are troubled by the economy, they are generally referring less to a lack of jobs than concern over the size of the national debt and, by extension, Washington’s seeming inability to address it.That helps explain the ascent of Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas Congressman whose main campaign platform is a pledge to cut $1,000bn from the federal budget. Mr Paul topped two polls in Iowa this week and came second in another.“People in Iowa just believe that smaller government is necessary,” says Jim Anderson, a registered Republican who runs Schebler, a manufacturer of industrial chimneys.Mr Gluba is not so sure. “The irony is that would mean cutting jobs at the arsenal, which would put unemployment back on the agenda here,” he says. “It’ll never happen, but it’s an election year, so people will say anything they can get away with.”
161;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Skills gap hobbles US employers;;Drew Greenblatt has been looking for more than a year for three sheet-metal set-up operators to work day, night or weekend shifts.The president of Marlin Steel Wire Products, a company in Baltimore with 30 employees, Mr Greenblatt says his inability to find qualified workers is hampering his business’s growth. “If I could fill those positions, I could raise our annual revenues from $5m to $7m,” he says.He is offering a salary of more than $80,000 with overtime, including health and pension benefits. Yet in spite of extensive advertising, he has had no qualified applicants. He is trying to train some of his unskilled staff but says none has the ability or drive to complete the training.Mr Greenblatt’s predicament speaks to one of the biggest economic debates about today’s 8.6 per cent US unemployment rate: is it merely a cyclical problem that will shrink as demand recovers? Or is it something deeper and more structural, a “mismatch” between the skills workers have and those companies need?The idea there is something structurally wrong with the US workforce is controversial among economists but has a certain resonance with the public. Since the emergence of Japan as a technology and manufacturing powerhouse in the 1970s, Americans have been anxiousthat they were losing their competitive edge to better-educated, harder-working rivals.Economists trying to figure out whether unemployment is cyclical or structural have turned to what they call the Beveridge curve: the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate.Vacancies, the number of unfilled positions, have risen by 35 per cent since their trough in June 2009 – but the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. If there are jobs but people are not filling them, it may be because their skills are not up to scratch, say those who fear structural unemployment.But a preponderance of economists argue this is a misreading of the data. A recent San Francisco Fed paper finds that vacancies are high relative to hiring across a broad range of industries, including those such as construction, where recent job cuts mean that there is most unlikely to be a skills shortage.The authors suggest companies may not be trying very hard to fill jobs, while workers in receipt of unemployment insurance may not be trying that hard to find them.Policy moves by the US Federal Reserve reflect a view that most unemployment is not the result of a skills mismatch. But even those who believe that today’s unemployment problem is primarily cyclical say closing the “skills gap” noted by Mr Greenblatt will be essential if Americans are to enjoy stable work and rising wages.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, told an audience in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August that the US had to “foster the development of a skilled workforce” if it was to enjoy good longer-term prospects. The US education system “despite considerable strengths, poorly serves a substantial portion of our population,” he said.US companies that are growing say an unqualified workforce is already a significant barrier to hiring.In a September poll of owners of fast-growing, privately held US companies undertaken by the non-profit Kauffman Foundation, the inability to find qualified workers was cited as the biggest obstacle to growth. Some 40 per cent of respondents said they were being held back by the skills gap, compared with just 13 per cent by lack of demand.Advanced Technology Services (ATS), a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron, is finding it tough to fill the 160 job openings it has available for roles such as maintenance and machine technicians.The company’s revenues grew by 35 per cent last year and are on course for 25 per cent growth this year. But Jeff Owens, chief executive, says it could expand faster if it could find qualified workers more quickly. “In other businesses the capacity constraint is buildings, plant or equipment,” he says. “In our business, a service business, it’s people.”US manufacturers have 600,000 unfilled positions because of a lack of qualified skilled workers, according to a report released in October by Deloitte, the consultants, and the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry body.Jill Bellak, chief operating officer of MBX, a company in suburban Chicago that makes computer hardware, says the fast-growing business is finding it tough to find good software engineers, production workers and salespeople to add to its 78-strong workforce.“You hear how high unemployment is and you think it would be easy to hire, but companies have tended to cut their lower performers and retain their best people,” says Ms Bellak. “Meanwhile, talented people are less inclined to leave their current positions than they would be in good times.”In manufacturing, the skills problem dates at least to the 1970s and 1980s, when companies began automating factories and outsourcing production. As a result, manufacturers found they did not have jobs for the people leaving their in-house training programmes, some of which were then scrapped.Some big manufacturers still train in-house, including Boeing, the aerospace manufacturer, which spends $80m a year on training its existing workforce. But not all do. “Technology moves fast and most companies don’t have the money or resources to pay for extensive retraining,” said Sir James Dyson, the British household appliances engineer.Without in-house training programmes, companies have often been left looking for staff with specific skills. “A generation ago, employers would hire and train employees. Now, they demand trained workers,” says Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school.“The skills gap is largely a figment of companies’ imagination,” says Mr Cappelli. “They cannot find workers to do the very specific tasks they want done. That is different from not being able to find capable workers.”Companies counter that today’s jobs require a broad set of skills, and that the US educational system is not producing workers with the flexibility they need.“We have a training programme, but if someone applies for a job and doesn’t have basic math, I don’t have the wherewithal to teach them basic math,” says Charles Cannon, chief executive of JBT, a maker of food-processing machinery and airport equipment.American 15-year-olds ranked 25th among the 34 developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in maths, 17th in science and 14th in reading ability, according to a 2009 OECD study.Many companies are realising they need to take the initiative in collaborating with educational institutions. Martin Swarbrick, chief executive of Bison Gear & Engineering, a Chicago manufacturer with 250 staff that makes industrial motors, says his company has had such a programme in place for years and it has helped him offset the skills gap.“We’ve done a lot of promoting from within,” he says. “A lot of our people started on the shop floor and now they’re completing their Masters degrees.”
162;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-12-11T22:06:31Z;US groups told to reveal Syria, Iran links;;"At least a dozen US-listed companies have been told by securities regulators to disclose business activity in and with Syria, Iran and others deemed “state sponsors’’ of terror by the state department.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has written to several companies in the past few months asking why they had not disclosed business dealings in Syria, Iran, Sudan and Cuba. The inquiries are part of SEC reviews of companies’ investment risks to security holders.Sony, Caterpillar, American Express, Aecom Technology, Iridex, and Veolia Environnement are among the companies that received letters from the SEC’s corporate finance division. Their responses show how sales have shrivelled with tighter international sanctions and how some companies, such as Sony, have found middle-men in Dubai and other countries to keep limited supply lines open.Details of the business dealings emerged as China’s Huawei Technologies telecoms equipment maker said it would scale back its business in Iran, where the company provides services to government-controlled telecoms operators. The announcement came on Friday amid reports that Iranian police were using mobile network technology to trace and arrest dissidents.Huawei would “voluntarily restrict its business development there by no longer seeking new customers and limiting its business activities with existing customers”, according to a statement on the company’s website. It said the company was making the move because of the “increasingly complex situation in Iran”, but did not elaborate.The US Congress is focusing on a loophole that allows some US subsidiaries to operate in countries where sanctions are in place; lawmakers’ interest has heightened with continued unrest in Syria and attacks against the British embassy in Iran two weeks ago. The UN has accused the Syrian regime of killing 4,000 civilians since March during protests against Bashar Al-Assad, the president.Howard Berman, ranking Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said in November that he had repeatedly heard foreigners cite the activities of US subsidiaries as a basis for claiming that the US was not serious about sanctions.He said: “The notion that a foreign subsidiary of a US company can conduct business that would be sanctionable in the US …undermines our efforts to prevent Iran from achieving a nuclear-weapons capability”.US law enforcement has become more aggressive in enforcing sanctions violation in Iran.US law prevents US companies from operating in those countries, but foreign subsidiaries can operate as long as they are run separately from their parent and do not employ US citizens."
163;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
164;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-12-11T21:30:56Z;SEC offers Middle East trading insight;;Ongoing inquiries by the US Security and Exchange Commission offer some insight to how companies can engage in trade that serves Syria and Iran, or benefit consumers inside the regimes, even as international sanctions remain in place.In a letter dated June 3 2011, Sony told the SEC that it distributes professional-use audio-visual products to state-backed Syria TV. It sells TV, video equipment and other consumer-use goods through a Syria-based distributor. For the year ended March 2011, Sony made sales of almost $80m. That represented 0.09 per cent of total group revenues.Sony said it has no subsidiaries or affiliates in Syria but its website refers to sales offices in Damascus. That “represents information about showrooms and after-sales service centres of designated third parties’’ and the company has no direct or indirect financial association with those, according to its letter.With Iran, Sony said it has no dealings with the government but distributed professional-use audio-visual products sold through a single dealer based in Dubai. That dealer is a subsidiary of the broadcast station owned by the Islamic Republic. Consumer-use products were distributed in part through Iran-based distributors and in part through traders based in Dubai, the letter said. Sony has a representative office in Tehran that “primarily conducts market research and support of sales promotion”, the letter said.The letter adds: “Sony understands that certain non-state-owned Dubai-based dealers with whom it does business sell to state-owned entities inside Iran, including the ministries of education and health and a bank.’’Caterpillar responded to the SEC on May 10 2011, disclosing that non-US subsidiaries “have sold and continue to sell” products, including engines and generator sets to Syria, through its foreign subsidiaries, including two British companies, Perkins Engines and FG Wilson Engineering.The construction and mining equipment giant, based in Illinois, said sales by non-US subsidiaries to Syria were estimated at about $600,000 the first quarter of 2011.As for Iran, Caterpillar said that all its non-US subsidiaries had terminated all dealers and distributors since April 2010.American Express told the SEC in a letter dated July 5 2011 that its business in Syria was negligible and through a Bahrain-based joint venture with the Mawarid Group, a private investment company.The business, which services existing card holders and merchants, resulted in $19,200 in net income, a fraction of the company’s consolidated net income of $4.1bn.Aecom Technology, the engineering and design group, said in an April 2011 letter that it had contracts through Davis Langdon, a British company it acquired in 2010, and EDAW Middle East, another subsidiary, to develop a mixed-use community and a private hospital in Syria.Aecom estimated that its total revenue from projects in Syria is about $1.27m for the past three fiscal years. Aecom said it did not anticipate future business in Syria – or Iran, which has faced sanctions for years. “Due to the comprehensive embargo on deals with Iran’’, the company has no contacts there and “does not anticipate future contacts unless and until the US embargo is lifted’’, the company said.All of the companies said in their filings that they did not think a reasonable investor would deem the amounts sold to these countries a material risk.SEC staff are considering requiring companies to disclose any dealings with Syria, Iran and Sudan, not just those that are material to their business. It is not clear when they might act on the issue.

166;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;CME to allow renminbi as collateral;;CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will allow international investors to use the Chinese currency as collateral for trading in all its futures products from January 2012.The move, announced on Monday, means investors holding renminbi deposits in Hong Kong or other financial centres outside mainland China can use the cash to bet on markets including metals, grains and energy.“It has symbolic significance that the best-known futures exchange in the west has put a stamp of legitimacy on the Chinese currency by accepting it as collateral,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, Hong Kong-based strategist at Crédit Agricole.However he added that CME’s move was unlikely to have any immediate market impact.The exchange said it would cap the amount of renminbi it accepts at $100m, a relatively small figure that reflects the fact that the offshore renminbi is only a few years old and is less liquid than most major currencies.While the renminbi can be used for financial transactions outside the Chinese mainland with few restrictions, Beijing retains substantial controls that prevent the currency from crossing China’s borders. However, Beijing has been slowly relaxing some of those controls as it promotes the renminbi as a global alternative to the US dollar.US-based CME already accepts a wide range of collateral for deposit into trading accounts, including cash from most of the world’s developed markets, as well as gold, asset-backed securities and agency bonds.The renminbi is not the first emerging market currency to be accepted as collateral: traders can also use the Mexican peso and the Turkish lira.Like other exchanges, CME said it was planning to expand further the range of currencies and assets it accepts as collateral.HSBC will serve as CME’s sole clearing custodian in Asia, the exchange said. Under the arrangement, HSBC Hong Kong will hold renminbi deposits from CME clients and allow the use of those deposits as collateral.According to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, renminbi deposits in Hong Kong totalled Rmb618.5bn ($97bn) at the end of October, down 0.6 per cent from September but still triple the amount a year ago.CME, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange, is one of hundreds of global companies seeking to take advantage of greater use of the renminbi outside China’s borders.So far this year, companies including Unilever and Caterpillar have issued the equivalent of $13.4bn in renminbi-denominated debt, known as “dim sum” bonds, though issuance has declined in recent months as investor appetite has cooled.“We’re very seriously growing our presence in Asia and one of the things we want to do is ensure that the products and services that we’re offering here have more of a local applicability,” said Jeremy Hughes, a CME spokesman. “We’re very aware that the vast majority of our products are still US dollar products.”CME already offers futures that track the value of the renminbi against the US dollar, however these are settled in dollars rather than the Chinese currency and have seen low trading volumes since their launch in 2006.

That deal transformed the company into the world’s biggest supplier of large mining equipment.Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar chief executive, has identified the mining industry as a key area of expansion.Buying ERA would enable Caterpillar to make further inroads into China where coal mine operators tend to prefer local brands over US equipment.Caterpillar is in a race with rival Joy Global, a US mining-equipment maker, to take market share in China’s mining industry. Joy Global announced plans in July to buy a 41 per cent stake in China’s International Mining Machinery for $585m.Steve Wunning, Caterpillar group president with responsibility for resource industries, said the ERA deal “underscores Caterpillar’s long-term commitment to continue to invest in China in order to support our growing base of Chinese customers”.Mr Wunning said Caterpillar hoped both to expand in China through ERA and to use Caterpillar’s global presence to sell the company’s products internationally.The deal values ERA at up to HK$6.9bn ($886m), a one-third premium on the company’s stock price before trading was halted in Hong Kong on Monday on expectations of the acquisition being announced. The deal is subject to approval by ERA’s shareholders and Chinese regulators.“This is another indication that CAT is leveraging itself to what we think is a relatively long-dated international mining up-cycle, driven by relatively strong emerging market commodity demand,” wrote analysts at Barclays Capital in a research note. “While we would not be surprised if this announcement generates some investor concern given potential sentiment that mining may be somewhat late in its cycle, we believe that the mining end market is still in the middle innings of growth.”Citigroup Global Markets Asia advised Caterpillar on the deal, while Blackstone advised ERA.

The New York-based investment bank, which is a market-maker in Italian government bonds, spent last week battling to reassure investors about its exposure to eurozone debt.Morgan Stanley fell 9 per cent to $15.76, once again suffering more than other big US banks, as filings showed it had recently carried $1.79bn in net exposure to Italy, after hedges.Goldman Sachs was off 8.2 per cent to $99.67 after the bank said it had $2.3bn of exposure to the Italian government, of which all but $700m is hedged, generally with investment-grade counterparties.Among the commercial banks, Citigroup fell 8.2 per cent to $28.85 and Bank of America was off 5.7 per cent to $6.16.Credit default swaps on US banks also moved upwards on Wednesday. The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose 50 basis points to 445bp, according to data from Markit. That equates to $445,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years, but is still well off the 584bp seen at the start of October.The S&P 500 closed at 1,229.1, down 3.7 per cent for its worst daily performance in three months, and decisively back into negative territory for the year.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.9 per cent to 2,621.65, in negative territory for the year for the first time in more than a week.General Motors, plunged 10.9 per cent to $22.31 after the Detroit carmaker posted a quarterly net profit of $1.7bn, 15 per cent lower than the same period last year, and said it would not break even in Europe this year.Software maker Adobe Systems was down 7.7 per cent to $28.08 after the company cut its 2012 revenue forecast and said it would axe 750 jobs at a cost of up to $78m in the fiscal fourth quarter.The company is to reduce its focus on enterprise software for governments and businesses, and stop adapting its Flash Player software for mobile devices and tablets, calling time on a long battle to persuade the likes of Apple to adopt Flash.“A year ago Adobe would have said Flash was critical to the company’s future,” said Chris Hickey, software analyst at Atlantic Equities, from Adobe’s analyst day in New York. “But Flash-specific products only make up a small percentage of revenues, and I think the sell-off in the stock is overdone.”All 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down – an alarming sign of stocks moving in lockstep in response to macro news from Europe.The blue chip-heavy index fell 3.2 per cent to 11,780.87, with China-exposed stocks among the biggest fallers.

CME chief executive Craig Donohue admitted MF Global, one of the biggest players in CME’s derivatives markets, had failed to segregate customer money from its own trading account, as required by CME rules.The regulatory lapse overshadowed better than expected third quarter results. Reveues of $874m were almost 20 per cent higher than the same quarter in 2010, while analysts welcomed the company’s commitment to keep a tight rein on costs.“Futures exchanges have been the poster child for the industry because they of their stability after Lehman Brothers and at other times of stress, so when investors hear about funds being misplaced, that leaves a big question mark,” said Alex Kramm, US exchanges analyst at UBS.The S&P 500 fell 2.8 per cent to 1,218.28, its worst day in a month, with heavy selling leading to sharp downward moves in the first and last fifteen minutes of trading.US investors reacted with dismay to the Greek prime minister’s call for a referendum on his country’s bail-out package. “There is a sense we’re being held hostage by the Greek government,” Phil Orlando, chief investment strategist at Federated Investors complained.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 4.7 per cent as yields on Italian bonds soared to euro-era highs.

Tenet shares rose 0.9 per cent to $4.77.The Vix index of expected 30 day volatility in the S&P 500 rose 18.6 per cent to close above 35. That followed two weeks of sustained falls up to the end of last week, which had seen the Vix drop beneath 25 for the first time since early August.“Its a little crazy out there this morning,” said Randy Warren, portfolio manager at Warren Financial Service. “We kept our Vix options as insurance against a downside, which I’m very happy about right now because they’re going to be popping.

170;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Investors ask if bounce in stocks will last;;Gravity finally caught up with the October rally in equity markets on Monday.But the statistics from some markets still make for impressive reading, all the more so in the middle of the ongoing eurozone debt crisis. In late afternoon trading in London, the S&P 500 was set for its best month since December 1991 while the FTSE All World was enjoying its second-best month since its creation in 1993 with only April 2009 topping it.Other markets have risen less strongly – October lies just outside the top ten in recent decades for both Germany’s Dax-30 and the French CAC-40.As investors catch their breath at the end of the month, the big question is: can the rally go further? That in turn depends on what has underpinned the surge this month and there investors and analysts are conflicted. Some point to technical factors, typically more transitory, while others believe fundamentals are at work.“On the one hand sentiment and positioning had become very bearish,” says Ronan Carr, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. “On the other, there has been some improvement in the data, especially in US growth.”But his overall view is clear: “We think the rebound has gone a long way already.”In many ways, markets are only correcting some of their falls from earlier this summer when gloom about the eurozone was at its highest. Following its 12 per cent gain this month to 1,267, the S&P 500 is now back at its level from early August. But it is still a distance off its May high of 1,370.The fundamentals theory goes that October has seen good news on the “troika of worries” the market has, in strategist Ed Yardeni’s words. They are the eurozone, US growth and China. The catalyst in early October for the rally seemed to be that European policymakers were finally getting a grip on the debt crisis ravaging the continent. Further support was given later in the month by better-than-expected US gross domestic product numbers.“It doesn’t take much good news that contradicts the bearish scenarios to turn things around. What changed in October is that we might be able to muddle along with all these three issues,” says Mr Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research.Belief in the fundamentals argument might suggest the rally has further to go, particularly as companies such as Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment, continue to surprise so positively on US corporate earnings.But as Monday’s tumble shows – even before MF Global’s bankruptcy exacerbated matters – markets remain twitchy about how the eurozone crisis plays out. And one thing that makes many in equity markets particularly nervous is that bond markets have been far less triumphant in October than equities, particularly in the eurozone periphery.“You have not seen the same enthusiastic response in the fixed income markets. That is quite a worrying indication. In recent years when bond markets and equity markets differed, it tended to be the bond markets that were proved right in the end,” says Mr Carr.Richard Batty, strategist at Standard Life Investments, also notes the bond markets’ reaction, particularly to last week’s eurozone deal with Italian yields rising. He is staying neutral on equities as he sees better ways of exploiting the solidity of corporate balance sheets.“We would prefer to play that strength through high-yield corporate bonds and commercial property. We prefer those high-yielding assets rather than taking on the volatility of owning lower-yielding equities,” he says.One big technical factor stands out as a reason for the rally: the fact that many investors are behind their benchmarks and so need to play catch-up. “The rally has been on relatively weak volumes. A lot of people are having a tough year. Given it is the fourth quarter there is maybe an attempt to chase things higher,” says Mr Carr.Another technical support for the rally is pointed out by Cullen Roche of Pragmatic Capitalism, who notes that 94 per cent of the S&P 500’s stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average. That has only been topped once in the past decade. Every single financial stock is trading above its 50-day average.The battle between technical and fundamental reasons for the rally will persist. But for Andreas Utermann, chief investment officer of RCM, an equity fund manager owned by Allianz, only one thing can make any rally truly durable: good GDP numbers. “Ultimately the real rally will only come through growth. Any sign of growth will spark significant rallies and every sign of falling back into recession will spell doom and gloom.”Mr Yardeni sums up the shattered state of investors: “European leaders have done a good job in making everyone totally confused. Anyone who was completely bearish got beaten up but now after this rally it is hard to jump up and down. Everyone I know is just exhausted.”

Both sectors were helped by a better than expected “flash” purchasing managers’ index survey in China.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for use in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.5 per cent to $23.79. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan was 8 per cent higher at $23.79.The defensive utility, telecom and consumer staples sectors were the only S&P 500 components to fall.Caterpillar surged 5 per cent to $91.77, after the company reported record revenues and delivered earnings per share of $1.71, a full 15 cents higher than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.The company raised its 2012 earnings outlook by a fifth, and said global economic uncertainty had not fed through to demand for its earthmoving equipment.Shares in health insurer HealthSpring surged 33.7 per cent to $53.71, after rival insurer Cigna announced it would purchase the company for $3.8bn.The deal values HealthSpring at $55 a share, and would give Cigna access to HealthSpring’s customer base. HealthSpring sells premium insurance to customers eligible for Medicaid, the federal health insurance programme for retirees. Cigna shares were down 0.6 per cent to $45.34.The deal helped Humana, another health insurer focused on Medicare-eligible clients, gain 4.8 per cent to $79.93.In the property sector, Citigroup analyst Josh Levin released a note arguing that “the structural excess supply of homes is exhausting itself.“The inventory of existing homes for sale [3.48m in September] has been declining on a year on year basis for the past eight months and now stands at a multiyear low,” Mr Levin told clients.Although he warned the “shadow inventory” of homes in foreclosure could yet add to the housing stock, homebuilder shares continued their strong October rally.The SPDR Homebuilders exchange traded fund, which tracks the return on homebuilders listed in the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent to $16.49. The ETF has risen 30 per cent in three weeks, after hitting a low of $12.30 at the start of October.Lennar Corp, considered one of the healthiest of US homebuilders because of its low debt levels, was up 1.7 per cent to $17.02, a gain of 33.6 per cent since October 4.

172;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-10-24T19:56:28Z;Caterpillar: earth-moving results;"It is prepared for the worst; but even shovel makers suffer when boom turns to bust";"In mining booms you don’t want to be digging around in the dirt – you want to be selling the shovels. Even better, then, to be hawking ultra high demolition excavators. On Monday, US construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar released another set of earth moving quarterly results, sending its shares up 5 per cent. Over a decade – about the length of the current resources and emerging markets booms – Caterpillar has produced total returns (370 per cent) 10 times that of the S&P 500.Nor is the company taking a breather. Volumes are up across Caterpillar’s three main businesses – selling big yellow toys to the construction and mining industries, and power systems – as well as across geographies. Even boring old North America saw revenues up by a third versus 2010. Order backlogs are at record levels and management has revised up sales and profits for this year and next.Can it last? Bulls may argue that Caterpillar’s shares are a long way off recent highs and barely a 10th above where they were in 2007 when profits from continuing operations were a fifth lower than today. Earnings-based valuations are hardly a stretch either. What is more, sales of new machines in developed markets remain also well short of historic peaks; growth in countries such as the US was mostly due to upgrades or replacements.Wannabe profit takers, however, worry about two things. The first, which may be temporary, is that the only emerging market to witness falling construction industry sales last quarter was . . . China. The bigger concern, however, is a repeat of the last downturn. In 2009, revenues plummeted 40 per cent in spite of the mining and emerging market fundamentals remaining in tact. Caterpillar says it is prepared for the worst; but even shovel makers suffer when booms turn to busts.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
173;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Caterpillar bullish on 2012 outlook;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenues, brushed off doubts about the global economy, saying it expected its sales to increase by up to one-fifth next year as the US and Japan bounce back.The Dow component and industrial bellwether made the prediction on Monday as it reported record quarterly earnings and profit in the three months to the end of September and said its full-year results would be at the top of its prior guidance range.“We get questions almost daily from our own employees and outsiders saying: ‘the situation seems like 2008 all over again’,” said Doug Oberhelman, chief executive. “While it does in some cases – on a macro level specific to the European banking situation – it bares little resemblance internally this time to mid-2008.”“We believe continued economic recovery, albeit a slow recovery, is the most likely scenario as we move forward.”That view was echoed by Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton, the manufacturer of industrial equipment and components that also reported record quarterly profits on Monday. “We haven’t witnessed a material change in our demand levels at this point,” he said, saying he expected “still growth, but slower growth”.Caterpillar said the recovery in the US and Japanese economies would gain pace in 2012, with the US growing at 2.5 per cent and Japan at 4 per cent. It said it was expecting the economies of the Asia/Pacific region to grow by 7 per cent, Africa, the Middle East and eastern Europe by 5.5 per cent and Latin America by 4 per cent.In spite of its bullishness, however, the company said it was concerned by political risk in the developed world. “Economic policies of developed countries have not been up to the task of securing sustained, stronger economic growth,” it noted. “Governments have too often engaged in confidence-destroying battles over budgets, and central banks have too often overestimated the stimulus provided by their policies.”Caterpillar said net income in the third quarter was $1.14bn or $1.71 per share, up from $792m or $1.22 per share in the same period a year earlier and ahead of analysts’ consensus forecasts of about $1.55 per share. Revenues were $15.7bn, up from $11.1bn in the same period last year.Revenues were boosted by the company’s $7.6bn acquisition of Bucyrus International, the maker of mining machinery, without which sales would have been $14.6bn in the quarter – a figure that would still be a record for the quarter. Takeover costs also depressed profits, which would have been $1.93 per share for the quarter, excluding the impact of Bucyrus.The company said it expects 2011 revenue of $58bn, at the top of its previous forecast of between $56bn and $58bn. Annual profits will be about $6.75 per share, compared to a prior forecast of $6.25-$6.75. Caterpillar said sales would be between 10 per cent and 20 per cent higher next year.The company said it had “received significant interest from around the world” for a planned sale of its external logistics business and would make a decision on a transaction by the end of the year.Caterpillar shares were up 6 per cent at $92.64 by midday in New York, while Eaton rose 4.2 per cent to $40.01.
174;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-10-17T14:02:14Z;Dim-sum ETFs raise liquidity concern;;Three exchange traded funds launched in the US to track the return on renminbi-denominated bonds may have trouble trading the debt securities they are meant to track because of limited liquidity in the market for so-called “dim-sum” bonds.The renminbi bond market has grown rapidly. Some Rmb72bn ($11.3bn) of debt has been issued this year according to Dealogic, twice the total for 2010, by the Chinese government and companies and international corporations such as Caterpillar and Volkswagen.Demand has been strong from investors seeking exposure to the Chinese currency, which is widely expected to appreciate against the dollar. That has led to the creation of ETFs aimed at US retail investors. But it means the bonds are hard to come by.“Liquidity is certainly an issue,” said William Belden, head of product development at Guggenheim, which launched the first fund, the Guggenheim Yuan Bond ETF, in September. “But the index our fund tracks uses a carefully chosen universe of issuers to maximise liquidity.”The Guggenheim fund only tracks investment grade issuers, with more than Rmb1bn of bonds outstanding. Some 45 per cent of the fund, the maximum permitted, tracks bonds issued by the Chinese government or state-backed groups such as the China Development Bank.The trouble, analysts say, is that there is little trading in the nascent renminbi bond market because demand has tended to exceed supply by a wide margin. Many renminbi bonds are so small that they do not trade at all in the secondary market.A liquid market is important for ETFs, because the fund issuer or market makers need to buy and sell the securities a fund is tracking, in order to create or redeem shares. Barclays Capital estimates that the average daily turnover in renminbi bonds on the secondary market is just Rmb300m ($47m).So far the US-based ETFs are small. The Guggenheim fund has just under $5m in assets under management, while the PowerShares fund just under $3.5m.If the funds attract large inflows from US investors, analysts say they could have a substantial impact on the market.“ETFs could distort renminbi bond pricing by pushing yields too low,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, Hong Kong-based strategist at Crédit Agricole.So far, however, the funds have performed badly as they were launched just before a sharp sell-off in the previously unshakeable market.The Guggenheim fund has fallen 2 per cent in value since its launch three weeks ago, while a fund offered by Invesco PowerShares that invests in high-yield bonds, is down 6 per cent since it launched on September 23.Additional reporting by Robert Cookson in Hong Kong

Chinese regulators closely guard the country’s capital account to prevent hot money from entering the economy.With rules published on Friday by the Chinese central bank and commerce ministry, foreign companies will have long-sought clarity about the approval process and the offshore renminbi market will have a more solid foundation for expansion.“Previously, the key thing was how do you generate more usages for this money sitting offshore,” said Kelvin Lau, an economist with Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. “One of the key functions that Hong Kong will increasingly serve is to become a capital-raising hub for offshore renminbi.”Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong have reached Rmb609bn, more than six times the level at the start of 2010, but the growth of assets, including dim sum bonds, has been much slower, making it hard for banks to manage their burgeoning liabilities in the Chinese currency.Slower renminbi deposit growth in Hong Kong in recent months has also fanned questions about whether Beijing was tapping the brakes on the offshore renminbi market, wary of ceding control over its currency.However, the clarification of investment rules implied that Beijing was comfortable with the pace of change and was committed to its stated objective of internationalising the renminbi, Daniel Hui, an HSBC strategist, said in a note.“China is slowly but surely closing the circle for the global circulation of the renminbi,” he wrote.A firm grip on the capital account has been one of China’s main ways of insulating its economy from the volatility of international markets, a policy that has served it well since the outbreak of the global financial crisis.But Beijing is slowly relaxing its controls in order to promote its currency as an alternative to the dollar. A more international renminbi would make global trade and financing cheaper for Chinese companies and potentially be a source of diplomatic strength for the Chinese government.
176;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-09-19T21:02:23Z;SEC seeks offshore cash disclosure;;The US securities regulator is pushing more companies to disclose how much cash they hold offshore, as attention focuses on the impact of tax rules that encourage US companies to keep earnings overseas.The Securities and Exchanges Commission has asked companies, including Dow Chemical, Fortune Brands, Caterpillar and CIT to increase the information they provide to investors about overseas earnings and cash.Currently there is no firm rule about whether companies must disclose details of how much they hold overseas. However, the SEC typically raises questions through its public comment letters when it believes further information may be relevant and material to understanding a company’s liquidity. The letters are part of routine disclosure reviews of companies’ filings and are separate from the regulator’s enforcement activities.People familiar with the matter said the SEC had decided to focus on the issue of overseas cash more broadly after new disclosures at Microsoft and Google earlier this year prompted interest in the issue.The regulator’s move comes amid concerns that tax issues may be distorting business decisions, potentially leading companies to favour overseas investment over opportunities at home. President Barack Obama on Monday outlined a series of tax reforms as part of the US deficit reduction programme.US rules require companies to pay tax of up to 35 per cent on income generated overseas and brought home. The current administration has so far resisted lobbying by businesses for a repatriation tax break, similar to the tax holiday granted in 2004, saying it would only consider the idea in the context of broader tax reform.The increased disclosure highlights how companies across a wide range of sectors are sitting on large piles of so-called “trapped cash”.Attention has previously focused on technology and healthcare companies, which house intellectual property in low-tax jurisdictions and often have 80 per cent or more of their cash overseas.Analysts at JPMorgan noted that companies such as Avon Products, the maker of beauty products, and Dover, the manufacturing and engineering company, hold “substantially all” of their cash outside of the US.In a sample of 258 companies, the bank estimated that more than 50 per cent of cash balances were held abroad. JPMorgan said the industrials, materials, consumer and energy sectors all exhibited above-average levels of overseas cash. As recently as a year ago, barely a couple of dozen companies provided disclosure on this issue.Bankers say that US companies are also increasingly seeking ways to put overseas cash to work in a tax-efficient manner, including through mergers and acquisitions.Hewlett-Packard, which says “substantially all” of its cash is overseas, plans to use offshore funds in its $11bn purchase of Autonomy, the UK software company. Microsoft earlier this year said it would use offshore cash to buy Skype for $8.5bn.
177;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-09-12T13:58:29Z;Currencies: Renminbi has yet to find great favour in loan market;;Anyone walking past HSBC’s Norman Foster-designed skyscraper in Hong Kong this year could not escape the billboards advertising the fast-growing suite of services the bank now offers in the Chinese currency.With an image of an aircraft soaring into the sky, the billboards captured the optimism among Hong Kong bankers about the potentially vast opportunities presented by Beijing’s push to “internationalise” the renminbi.As a result of these marketing campaigns, HSBC and its rivals have, over the past year, accumulated a large pool of renminbi deposits which flowed out of the Chinese mainland through controlled channels such as cross-border trade.So far, however, the business has not been very profitable because there is almost no international demand for renminbi-denominated loans and Beijing strictly limits flows of the currency back to the mainland.Mark McCombe, chief executive of HSBC’s Hong Kong operations until last week when he quit to lead Black Rock, the asset management company, in Asia, says the freedom to do business in renminbi is “probably one of the single greatest opportunities presented to the Hong Kong financial centre for a generation.” However, the renminbi’s path to full internationalisation and convertibility is unlikely to be entirely straightforward.Almost 150 years after it was established in Hong Kong and Shanghai to finance the growing trade between China and Europe, the territory’s biggest bank is moving aggressively to gain a dominant position in the renminbi market.In July 2009, HSBC was the first foreign bank to settle cross-border trade in renminbi following landmark reforms by Beijing. Since then, the amount of trade settled in the Chinese currency has surged, with more than Rmb800bn ($125bn) of such transactions passing though Hong Kong in the first half of this year.As a result, the renminbi has accumulated rapidly in the banking system, crowding out Hong Kong dollars and US dollars, the traditional source of bank funding. As of July, renminbi deposits made up 9.5 per cent of the total $947bn of deposits in Hong Kong – up from less than 2 per cent just a year ago. “If the renminbi develops the way we expect it to, in a few years it will be a key source of our funding,” says Thomas Poon, HSBC’s head of business planning and strategy for the territory.HSBC has overhauled its Hong Kong operations to ensure that everything the bank can do in Hong Kong or US dollars is also enabled for payments in renminbi, from trade finance to dealing bonds and equities.Yet, while the growth of renminbi deposits in the territory has been rapid, the development of renminbi-denominated assets in which to place those deposits has been more modest. In April, HSBC helped arrange the first, and so far only, initial public offering outside mainland China to be denominated in renminbi.The offshore market for renminbi-denominated bonds has proved much more lucrative. A procession of companies, from Tesco, the UK supermarket group, to Caterpillar, the US engineering group, have raised more than Rmb54bn selling renminbi bonds in the year to date, up from Rmb34bn for the whole of 2010.Competition is fierce. Global banks, including Standard Chartered, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, are all fighting to gain a bigger share of the market, while the state-owned Chinese banks are also making their presence felt.Last month, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China flew a helicopter over Hong Kong trailing a red banner that advertised a Rmb20bn sale of Chinese government bonds, the biggest ever issue of offshore renminbi debt.Mike Werner, Hong Kong-based banks analyst at Sanford Bernstein, says the territory’s banks will find it difficult to generate profits from the offshore renminbi business for at least the next three or four years. “While the offshore renminbi business has got off to a fast start, it is still a very imbalanced market,” he saysThe biggest concern for Hong Kong banks is that there is almost no demand from customers to take out renminbi loans. There were just Rmb11bn of these loans at the end of June, compared with Rmb550bn of renminbi deposits.“As long as the market expects the renminbi to appreciate against the US dollar, companies will be unwilling to borrow in renminbi,” says Mr Werner.Mainland Chinese companies would love to borrow in renminbi from Hong Kong banks, since offshore interest rates are lower than those onshore. However, Beijing places strict limits on cross-border lending and investment.Until Hong Kong banks find a way to expand the asset side of their balance sheets using renminbi, their overall profit margins will be under pressure.Mr Poon of HSBC is optimistic. He reckons companies will become more willing to borrow in renminbi in future, especially if dollar borrowing rates continue to rise.“One way or another, the market will find its equilibrium,” he says. But first the bank’s customers may take some persuading. Time to bring out a fresh set of billboards.
178;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-09-08T15:42:22Z;US manufacturers feel weight of baby boomers;;The US’s biggest industrial companies face an average bill of at least $100m each over the next five years as they struggle to fill the skills gaps left by the looming retirement of “baby boomer” factory workers, according to a survey of manufacturers to be released today.The survey by The Nielsen Company of 100 top executives at US manufacturing companies underlines the scale of the demographic problem facing the US economy. In recent decades, apprenticeships and workplace training have been gradually downgraded, to the extent that many manufacturers now complain they cannot find the skilled workers they need in spite of stubbornly high unemployment.Mechanics and engineers from the baby-boom generation – born in the two decades following the second world war – formed the backbone of the US’s industrial workforce from the 1960s onwards. However, the first baby boomers become eligible for retirement this year, raising the spectre that the skills gap could worsen sharply in the next few years.Some 55 per cent of industrial companies with annual revenues of at least $1bn expect skills shortages prompted by retirements to cost them at least $100m in the next five years, they said in a survey conducted for Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include companies such as Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron.Most of the costs will be accounted for by recruiting, training and overtime costs, said Jeff Owens, ATS chief executive. He said the costs also take into account the likelihood that equipment would not be operated for part of the time because of a lack of qualified maintenance staff. “You’re talking about falling productivity and a shorter life for fixed assets in factories,” Mr Owens said.Rick Stephens, senior vice-president of human resources at Boeing, the aircraft maker, said his company is well aware of the problem. “Like most aerospace companies, we have a workforce that is more on the mature side,” he said.Mr Stephens said Boeing spends about $80m annually in workforce training. “We’ve also significantly increased spending in the past year to train up new employees to ensure they’re qualified to go into the production environment,” he said.The problem of the looming retirement of highly experienced workers, Mr Stephens said, has been aggravated by the fact that new recruits tend to be far less technically skilled than entry-level workers were decades ago. In response, Boeing recently doubled its introductory training course from 6-7 weeks to 13 weeks.Mr Owens said the recession had enabled manufacturers to avoid facing the retirement issue. “Companies have put this problem off for a long time because it’s not been pressing,” he said. “But many companies are starting to discover how urgent it is when they look at the average age of their workforce.”The survey also found that 45 per cent of companies are encouraging older workers to delay their retirements as they face the prospect of losing skilled staff, while employees are keen to rebuild their recession-hit pension funds.“The folks that we expected to retire, the age has been extended a bit because of the economy’s effects on peoples’ savings and retirement plans,” said Mr Stephens.Mr Owens said that could help postpone the problem, but could not overcome it. He also noted that older skilled workers tend to be less productive.“Manufacturers have assumed they can simply hire people when they need them, but when they start to look, they realise how difficult it is to hire.” Half of the survey respondents said they had 11 or more open positions for skilled workers, with one-third having more than 20 unfilled vacancies.
179;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Obama calls for new infrastructure funding;;Barack Obama, US president, called for new infrastructure investments in the US to revitalise the stagnant economy and boost the beleaguered labour market.Speaking after new data showed US private sector jobs growth slowed in August, the president urged Congress to pass an extension of a federal transportation spending bill that expires at the end of September.Mr Obama said that failure to do so would put thousands of jobs at risk and delay vital infrastructure projects and funding for the nation’s highways and airports.“It’s inexcusable to put more jobs at risk in an industry that’s already been one of the hardest hit in the last decade,” the president said on Wednesday in comments at the White House.“We shouldn’t just be playing patch-up or catch-up, we should be leading the world,” he said.A report from ADP, the payroll processor, said US companies added 91,000 jobs in August, missing expectations of 100,000 new jobs and coming in below the downwardly revised 109,000 positions created in July.The data “suggests that the trend in employment moderated somewhat in August at a pace below what would be consistent with a stable unemployment rate,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which produces the ADP report.Jobs growth was concentrated at small and medium-sized businesses, which added 58,000 and 30,000 positions respectively, while businesses employing more than 500 workers hired just 3,000 new employees. Expansion was once again stronger in the service industry than the goods-producing sector, while manufacturers cut 4,000 jobs. Construction hiring picked up for the first time in four months, rising by 7,000.Wednesday’s figures come ahead of the government’s closely watched employment report, due on Friday, which is expected to show the economy added 75,000 jobs in August, with 103,000 new private sector positions offsetting an expected decline in government payrolls. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain at an elevated 9.1 per cent.The official tally of private sector jobs is expected to come in below July’s 154,000 rate in part because of a strike at Verizon Communications, the telecoms group, noted John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics, an independent research group.But Mr Prakken said ADP’s data did not reflect the impact of the strike. “It seems to me Friday’s number [from the bureau of labour statistics] could be a good deal weaker than the number we’re reporting today,” he said.As US economic growth has stalled to a lacklustre annualised rate of 1 per cent in the second quarter, following an even more meagre 0.4 per cent in the first three months of 2011, the Obama administration has come under increased pressure to take steps to jump-start growth and reduce unemployment.Mr Obama is due to give a broader economic policy speech before a joint session of Congress on September 7 in which he is being urged to set out proposals including extending a payroll tax cut for middle- and low-income workers, boosting infrastructure and green energy spending and tackling the persistent foreclosures crisis.Amid the widening gap between Republicans and Democrats, business leaders have expressed frustration with the gridlock in Washington. In an interview with the Financial Times, Doug Oberhelman, chief executive of Caterpillar said he feared that pending bills including the transportation funding legislation and bilateral trade agreements could be derailed by partisan bickering.On Monday the president appointed Alan Kreuger, a leading labour market economist, as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, signalling the White House’s intent to raise its game in the battle for jobs.In a speech last week, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke expressed alarm about the high rate of long-term unemployment, which he said could leave a “major scar” on the US economy. But he cautioned that most measures to spur growth and job creation are “outside the province of the central bank”.Minutes of the Fed’s latest policy meeting showed division among members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee over further action to stimulate the economy through another round of quantitative easing, known in the markets as “QE3”.A separate report on Wednesday showed that planned lay-offs by US employers fell back after three months of increases, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement company.Companies announced 51,114 job cuts in August, a 23 per cent drop from July’s 16-month high, which was driven by large-scale redundancies at a handful of large companies. It was the first time in four months that the pace of lay-offs had eased, but the report noted that August’s figure was 47 per cent higher than a year ago – an indication of the protracted slowdown in the US economy this year.August’s lay-offs were driven by the public sector, with government cuts nearly doubling to 18,426, concentrated in federal payrolls including the military.“More workforce reductions at the federal level are undoubtedly coming down the road. Congress and the White House are under immense pressure to cut federal budgets and while the heaviest cuts are due in 2014, we will probably begin seeing some fallout starting this year and into 2012,” said John Challenger, chief executive.“Meanwhile, the private sector is still being hampered by low consumer and business spending. While we do not see any indication of a sudden resurgence in private sector job cuts, conditions definitely are not ideal for hiring,” he added.
180;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-08-28T16:17:10Z;Caterpillar chief attacks Washington;;The head of one of the US’s biggest manufacturers has launched a scathing attack on Washington, saying the country’s economy could be dragged into another recession because of political brinkmanship on Capitol Hill.In an interview with the Financial Times, Doug Oberhelman, chief executive of Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, said he feared that pending bilateral trade agreements and road-building legislation could fall victim to political bickering.Mr Oberhelman joins a growing chorus of US business leaders who say they are fed up with the widening gap between Democrats and Republicans, displayed most recently in the gridlock over the debate to raise the country’s debt ceiling.Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, has called on his peers to stop donating to politicians until Congress reaches a bipartisan agreement on debt reduction. More than 100 business leaders have backed the campaign, including Duncan Niederauer of NYSE Euronext, Walter Robb of Whole Foods and Myron Ullman of JC Penney.Mr Oberhelman’s remarks – which are notable for a company that in spite of being a strong industrial force, rarely speaks out on political issues – indicate a deeper concern that the lack of political consensus could continue to paralyse US government and derail the US’s fragile economic recovery.The Caterpillar chief blamed political leaders in Washington for their inability to find agreement over the debt ceiling, an issue that contributed to Standard & Poor’s downgrading of the US’s credit worthiness.“The process was ugly and it was a red herring of a problem,” Mr Oberhelman said. “The politicians turned [it] into this big giant thing that scares people. I’m equally critical of both sides.”He said the debate had also poisoned the US’s political atmosphere, saying it diminished the chances of securing Congressional approval for outstanding trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, which he said were critical to keeping US companies internationally competitive.“This deficit debate sucked all the air out of Washington,” Mr Oberhelman said. “Here we are with no free trade agreements, not anywhere in sight. Meanwhile, our competitors, led primarily by China, are signing up countries to free trade agreements.”He said he was also concerned that road-building legislation could fall victim to partisan squabbling.“Spending on infrastructure made us one of the most competitive economies on the planet. But now our infrastructure is deteriorating badly. We have decided as a country not to invest in infrastructure any more. It’s short-sighted and it’s dangerous for the future of our country. We cannot give up our international competitiveness. That’s what’s at stake.”
181;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Caterpillar chief confident on recovery;;The tide of opinion may be turning increasingly towards the idea that the US economy is heading for a double-dip but Doug Oberhelman is unconvinced.If anything, the chief executive of Caterpillar, the maker of construction and mining equipment viewed widely as an industrial bellwether, says he is more upbeat now than he was at the start of the year.“There won’t be a double-dip,” he tells the FT in an interview at the company’s headquarters in Peoria, Illinois. “I don’t see a return to high growth, but I think we’re going to bump along.”Caterpillar’s relative bullishness – it is forecasting that the US economy will grow by 2.5 per cent this year – is important, not only because of the size of the company but also because it has a good record of economic forecasting.The manufacturer was one of the first big US companies to warn in 2007 that the US was entering a serious economic downturn.Mr Oberhelman’s view comes primarily from conversations with the companies that buy Caterpillar equipment.“I’ve been meeting a customer a day for months,” he says. “I haven’t found one this year that hasn’t said business is getting better, even if it’s a long way from what it was.”In addition, he says many of the problems that faced the US at the start of the recession no longer look as threatening.“The US economy is performing at such a low rate and so many of the excesses have wrung out,” he says.“The banks have mostly been recapitalised. Housing is close to, if not at, the bottom. It’s hard for me to see how we could go over a cliff like in 2007-08 when this was all beginning.”Caterpillar has backed up its optimistic outlook with a range of capacity expansions.It closed last month on its $7.6bn acquisition of Bucyrus International, the maker of mining machinery, which transformed the company into by far the world’s biggest supplier of large mining equipment.It plans to spend a total of $3bn this year in capital expenditure.In recent months, the manufacturer has announced plans for new factories in Singapore, Thailand, China and Brazil.In the US, it is building a new distribution centre in Washington state while expanding its factories in North Dakota and Kansas.Caterpillar has hired about 29,000 people worldwide in the past 20 months, some 13,000 of them in the US, with most of the rest in China, Brazil, Mexico and the UK.The manufacturer’s revenues hit a record $14.2bn in the second quarter, adding to the picture of a company accelerating at full throttle.Investors are not so convinced – Caterpillar’s shares have underperformed the wider market this year.In part this is because, in spite of strong sales, the company’s second-quarter profit fell short of analysts’ estimates as it felt the effect of the Japanese earthquake, weaker Chinese demand and took on $4.5bn in new debt to finance the Bucyrus acquisition.Mr Oberhelman says the company may have also suffered from its bellwether status, which makes it something of a proxy for investor bearishness on the industrial economy.“Traditionally, we’ve been perceived as an indicator of the global economy,” he says. “Investors are just nervous about the uncertainty of global economic growth.”He thinks that nervousness is largely unfounded. The danger, he says, is that the jitters themselves hamper the recovery.“We could all pull in our collective dollars because we’re all afraid of not what’s happening but what might be happening down the road,” he says. “It could be a self-fulfilling prophecy.”Two-thirds of Caterpillar’s revenues come from outside the US with China its most important market. There, Mr Oberhelman thinks concerns about slowing growth are overblown.“There has been a slowdown in China, which is healthy,” he says. “Thank God it happened, because we were all rushing in there, committing resources, growing at rates that couldn’t be sustained over time. So now we’ll see a lower growth rate but one that’s still pretty high by world standards.”“We’ll see China reflate in the next few months, going into the Chinese New Year [in January],” he says. “That will remove a very large question mark in the world economy about what China’s going to do, which has been a big damper on sentiment.”Elsewhere, he again sees little evidence of another downturn.“Brazil is red-hot. We’ve not seen any breather down there,” he says. “The Middle East is still doing well, the mining business is still strong. So far, it’s hard to paint a picture of a massive slowdown again. But we’re watching.”
182;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-08-25T16:01:10Z;China steps up march of currency reforms;;Only a couple of months ago, Hong Kong bankers were worrying that the Chinese government may have developed second thoughts about its plan to transform the renminbi into an international currency.The pace of reform had slowed, renminbi deposits were no longer accumulating rapidly in Hong Kong banks and there was growing evidence that cross-border trade in the renminbi was being hijacked by financial opportunists.However, those concerns faded away over the past week. Speaking in Hong Kong last Wednesday, Li Keqiang, Chinese vice-premier, signalled that Beijing remained as determined to press ahead with the internationalisation of the renminbi.Mr Li, who is expected to become China’s premier in 2012, announced almost half a dozen reforms to increase the flow of renminbi in and out of the mainland and to enhance Hong Kong’s role as the offshore trading hub for the currency.While Mr Li was speaking, a helicopter buzzed over the city trailing a red banner advertising a Rmb20bn ($3.1bn) sale of Chinese government bonds, the biggest ever issue of offshore renminbi debt.“Confidence in the renminbi market received a very significant boost from the vice-premier’s speech,” says Kelvin Lau, an economist with Standard Chartered. “Since that speech, we’ve seen very responsive actions by the Chinese authorities.”Indeed, China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday issued draft guidelines for a programme under which companies can make foreign direct investments into China using the renminbi.The scheme could be launched as soon as September, the ministry said.Allowing the renminbi to be used for foreign direct investment should make it easier for companies that sell renminbi bonds – as McDonald’s and Caterpillar have done – to move the money to the mainland where it can be put to good use.Financiers have high hopes for the offshore renminbi bond market, where companies have raised Rmb54bn in the year to date, according to Dealogic, up from Rmb34bn for the whole of 2010.Yet, for all the optimism among Hong Kong bankers, the latest batch of reforms is a reminder of the extent to which the development of the offshore renminbi market depends on policy decisions made in Beijing.China has many reasons to reduce its reliance on the dollar, which is used for almost all its cross-border trade and finance. The trouble is, liberalising the renminbi carries risks.Doing so would allow money to pour into, or out of, its domestic financial system, undermining government control of financial stability, interest rates and the allocation of capital.As some sceptics ask, why would the Communist Party dismantle China’s capital controls and allow the renminbi to become a truly global currency when doing so would destroy their ultimate source of power: the control of the banking system.Given such considerations, Beijing is taking a gradual step-by-step approach to the liberalisation of its capital account.For example, a scheme announced by the vice-premier last week to allow Hong Kong financial companies to invest in mainland securities markets using renminbi is capped with an initial quota of just Rmb20bn.Beijing’s caution appears warranted. Take something as seemingly innocuous as the use of renminbi in cross-border trade of goods and services, which only became possible in mid-2009. On the face of things, the scheme has been a great success.In December 2009, only 0.2 per cent of China’s trade transactions were settled in renminbi, according to Crédit Agricole. This jumped to 8.3 per cent in June this year.Meanwhile, international companies still prefer to settle trade deals using the dollar.According to bankers, a large proportion of renminbi trade involves Chinese companies dealing with their own offshore subsidiaries, arbitraging the price differentials between exchange rates and interest rates on either side of the mainland’s capital controls.“This is in essence an arbitrage of the rate disparity between a restricted China and the free market,” said one Hong Kong-based trade finance banker. He added that regulators were growing increasingly worried about outright fraudulent cross-border money flows disguised as trade.Whatever the nature of the trade flows, they have resulted in an accumulation of renminbi deposits at banks in Hong Kong.Renminbi deposits in the Hong Kong system reached Rmb554bn in June.Given the dearth of renminbi-denominated financial assets available offshore, most investors have few options besides low-yielding deposits.They are willing to hold renminbi because the currency is widely expected to strengthen against the dollar at an annual rate of about 5 per cent over the coming years.A reversal in expectations of the renminbi’s rising value against the dollar would have potentially seismic implications for the offshore market.But for the time being, there is no sign that the renminbi’s ascent is slowing. This means that more and more renminbi is likely to accumulate in Hong Kong.When Mr Li next visits Hong Kong, he is likely to have been crowned China’s premier. By then, the offshore renminbi market will have gained greater power too, and will be testing the mainland’s capital controls ever more forcefully.
183;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-08-21T15:55:59Z;Tsunami impact on profits less severe than feared;;Japan’s devastating tsunami and earthquake hit profits at a slew of companies both within and outside the country but also created opportunities for many others, the latest corporate earnings show.Asian results for the quarter to the end of June, compared with the same period a year earlier, paint the most complete picture so far of how companies were affected by the disaster, underlining the sharp difference between Japan, where the impact on final production and the supply chain was severe, and other Asian countries, where it was much less marked.In particular, the results suggest that the supply chain impact outside Japan was much less dramatic than was feared in the days after the March 11 tragedy, which happened only three weeks before the end of the first quarter for most companies. Initially, there were suggestions that manufacturers globally might face production stoppages because of their dependence on Japanese components.Worst hit were Japanese manufacturers such as the carmakers Honda Motor, Toyota and Nissan, and electronics and communications technology groups such as Sony, Nintendo, Panasonic, Toshiba, Sharp and Fujitsu. Japan Air Lines, which is going through a restructuring, also said it was affected, as did Sony-Ericsson, the Japanese-Swedish mobile phones group.Some foreign companies with significant operations in Japan reported an impact on profits, including Caterpillar, the US heavy equipment maker, Coca-Cola, the US drinks producer, and Global Logistics Properties, the Singapore-based logistics group. GLP said net profit for its first quarter to the end of June rose 2.3 per cent, but would have been 10 per cent higher if not for one-off factors including the earthquake.However, most companies said they expected the financial impact to disappear or ease significantly in the current quarter to September. The effect of the earthquake “on the procurement of raw materials and components has for the most part abated”, said Masami Yamamoto, president of Fujitsu.Other companies produced unexpectedly good results, which in some cases reflected market opportunities created by the dislocation following the tragedy.Hyundai Motor, the South Korean group that is the world’s fifth-largest carmaker when sales at its affiliate Kia are included, was the biggest beneficiary, posting a 37 per cent increase in net earnings as it took advantage of disrupted production at its Japanese rivals.Komatsu and Hitachi Construction Machinery, the Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, both report big increases in net profits.Thai Union Frozen Products, Thailand’s dominant seafood exporter, said net profit rose by 42 per cent, in part because of a shortage of shrimp and other seafood in Japan following the disaster.Taiwan’s technology companies were severely affected, but not because of supply chain disruption. As the supply chain largely held up after the disaster, companies that ramped up their stocks of parts found they were stuck with unsaleable inventory as economies in the US and Europe slowed.Companies that suffered a significant setback included the chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Nanya Technology and Inotera Memories in Taiwan, and Hynix Semiconductor in South Korea.Oversupply also contributed to a net loss for the second quarter at AU Optronics, the flat panel maker, compared with a net profit a year earlier. LG Electronics, the diversified Korean electronics group, reported a fall of 87 per cent in second quarter net profit, blaming problems in its flat panel unit.South Korea’s Samsung Electronics said that although its mobile phone business performed strongly, net profit slid 18 per cent as weakness in semiconductors and liquid crystal displays countered its growing strength in smartphones. Taiwan-based HTC, Asia’s second-largest maker of smartphones by sales, said second quarter net income more than doubled to a record.Some airlines were affected by the Japanese disaster, including Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines, the biggest carriers in South Korea, which both suffered operating losses. But the biggest negative impact in the quarter came from higher fuel prices, which were largely to blame for falls in net profit of 59 per cent at Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways and 82 per cent at Singapore International Airlines.Additional reporting by Robin Kwong in Taipei
184;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-08-14T15:15:42Z;Caterpillar builds on solid China foundation;;"When Caterpillar, the world’s largest producer of earth-moving equipment, opened its first joint venture in China in 1994, the country was still among the poorest in the world in terms of gross domestic product per capita, and bicycles, not cars, dominated the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. Fast forward to today, when China is the world’s biggest market for machinery, accounting for about 9 per cent of Caterpillar’s annual revenues.While many global brands have struggled in China’s consumer sector, Caterpillar has been relatively successful so far in maintaining its grip on China’s premium machinery market. A string of recent high-profile pullbacks by multinationals include Mattel’s closure of its flagship Barbie store in Shanghai, along with store closures by Best Buy and Home Depot.Unlike the consumer sector, the heavy machinery sector has largely rewarded foreign companies – like Caterpillar and Japanese rival Komatsu – that offer better quality at higher prices than their domestic peers.Today Caterpillar has about a 7 per cent market share in China, and in recent years the company has become more focused on China, relocating group president Richard Lavin to Hong Kong last winter. Caterpillar even took the unusual step of issuing renminbi-denominated bonds in Hong Kong last year, to raise funds for its leasing business in China.“Our strategy is very straightforward, in support of the corporate strategy. We have got to win in China,” Mr Lavin told an industry conference in March.There is tough competition, however, from Chinese rivals, who have gained market share in recent years from their foreign peers through aggressive marketing, attractive financing and improving technology. In the highly-prized excavator market, one of the fastest growing, Caterpillar’s market share has fallen to 7 per cent from 10 per cent five years ago, according to figures from consultancy Off-Highway Research.Chinese heavy machinery makers – a group that includes groups such as Sany Heavy, Zoomlion, Xugong and Shantui – have excelled at wooing new customers through aggressive promotion by dealerships, says Shi Yang at Off-Highway Research. Some dealerships give buyers raffle tickets to win a Mercedes or a BMW car; others offer financing incentives like zero down payment. The technology gap between Chinese companies and their foreign peers is also diminishing.Coming months are set to put some Chinese machinery makers to the test though, as demand for construction equipment in China falls on the back of a weakening real estate sector. Analysts and industry executives expect a period of consolidation for Chinese equipment makers that will eventually produce a handful of clear leaders.Meanwhile, a handful of larger Chinese groups are already vying for global dominance with ambitious expansion plans overseas. Shantui, one of the world’s biggest makers of bulldozers, last week launched a new subsidiary in Dubai as a gateway to the Middle East and north Africa. Sany Heavy, which makes a range of equipment including excavators and concrete pumps, is set to complete its US headquarters and a manufacturing site in Peachtree, Georgia, later this year.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see Chinese companies acquire overseas companies and build up manufacturing overseas,” said Edmond Huang, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “They are already doing things in Brazil, America and Germany that have made them closer to the market.”Caterpillar says one of its greatest challenges is building up its supply chain in China; the company’s production capacity has recently lagged behind the growing demand. Finding managerial talent is also a key challenge in China, Mr Lavin told the Financial Times last year.Despite these headwinds, Caterpillar’s story in China has been much happier than that of many foreign multinationals. In the area of high speed rail for example, Germany’s Siemens and Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy Industries have seen their technology “digested” by Chinese train companies. In the technology sector, many foreign firms have been hamstrung by regulatory barriers.Caterpillar believes part of its success is that customers are willing to pay more for products that are more reliable. “In our industry, thankfully, the most important thing to customers when they buy a product is what that product earns them over its lifetime,” said Mike DeWalt, director of investor relations, in June, citing Caterpillar’s support for its equipment as a big advantage. “There were probably some product categories where the Chinese and the Koreans today can be more successful. And that’s probably in areas of the market that don’t require as much service support.”"
185;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-08-07T18:29:28Z;Tribunal rules BT can raise mobile rates;;BT is set to receive a multimillion pound windfall after a tribunal ruled that it could charge higher rates to mobile network operators for connecting 0845, 0870 and 0800 calls.The Competition Appeal Tribunal upheld BT’s challenge to a decision by Ofcom, the media regulator, that it could not increase its call termination charges to mobile operators for so-called “non geographic” numbers.The ruling is likely to mean higher payments to BT and other wholesale landline network operators from mobile providers, unless they lower their charges to consumers.The dispute began in 2009 when T-Mobile – now part of the Everything Everywhere joint venture with Orange UK – appealed to Ofcom to prevent BT from charging mobile operators for free calls. O2 and Vodafone, the mobile operators, then joined the dispute.BT provides non-geographic numbers to companies for a fee, and at one stage had passed on a share of those fees to mobile operators for carrying calls.However, towards the end of the last decade, BT began charging mobile networks for terminating calls to such numbers. Last year, Ofcom ruled that these charges were not fair and reasonable. In the latest CAT hearing, BT successfully challenged that decision by the regulator.After a dense and highly technical 200-page judgment, all parties are still considering the likely impact of the decision. Ofcom is yet to determine how far payments should be backdated but BT believes that the ruling should enable it to recoup up to £19m in revenues lost as a result of the dispute from the second quarter of last year.“It is appropriate that the CAT has ruled that BT’s wholesale termination rates for 0800, 0845 and 0870 numbers are fair and reasonable,” BT said. “We are currently examining the details of the judgment to understand the impact.”BT Wholesale could also generate greater revenues from future calls, depending on mobile operators’ pricing decisions. The ruling allows for BT to levy termination fees for 0800 numbers if mobile operators charge more 8.5p per minute, but not if they price below that level. So-called “ladder charging” also applies to calls to 0870 and 0845 numbers, meaning that the more mobile operators charge their customers, the more they must pay to BT.The details of this ladder system are yet to be finalised by Ofcom.Mobile operators have a month to determine if they will appeal the judgment.“Everything Everywhere is disappointed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal’s judgment,” the company said. “We are considering the lengthy judgment further and assessing next steps.”
186;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-08-04T20:58:57Z;Wall Street tumbles on economic concerns;;US stocks tumbled to their worst one-day losses for more than two years with industrial and energy stocks leading the declines as a surge in the dollar raised fears that exporters would be hit by higher costs.All three major US indices entered correction territory, meaning they were more than 10 per cent lower that their 2011 highs. The benchmark S&P 500 retreated 4.7 per cent on Thursday to 1,200.24 at the closing bell. It was the worst session since February 2009.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in more than two years, falling more than 500 points or 4.3 per cent to 11,383.83, while the Nasdaq Composite was off 5.1 per cent to 2,556.39, its worst session since January 2009.The CBOE Volatility index or Vix, popularly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge“, jumped to its highest level since March, up 29.64 per cent on the session to more than 30.The S&P energy sector fell 6.8 per cent, materials lost 6.7 per cent and industrials were down 5.4 per cent, all hit by the rising dollar and weakening market sentiment.Alcoa was the Dow’s biggest faller at the close, retreating 9.2 per cent to $12.94, while Caterpillar was 7 per cent lower at $89.55.In the energy sector, which reached its lowest level since March, the US oil majors were hit hard.ExxonMobil fell 5 per cent to $73.84, ConocoPhillips was down 5.2 per cent to $66.92 and Chevron lost 5.8 per cent to $96.84.Alpha Natural Resources reported a $56.4m second-quarter loss, much of which was due to takeover-related costs after acquiring Massey Energy for $7.1bn in June. Its shares dropped 17 per cent to $33.24.In addition to concerns about global economic growth and currency stability, weekly US initial jobless claims weighed on sentiment, with the 400,000 figure less than the 405,000 that was forecast.Wall Street was also anticipating Friday’s nonfarm payroll report for July, one of the most important economic indicators, which has disappointed in the last two months“Having been burned badly the last two months, it appears that this time a lot of traders have been exiting positions and going to the sidelines ahead of the US non-farm payrolls report,” analysts at CMC Markets said. “This suggests that unlike the last two months where pre-announcement euphoria ended up being crushed, the resignation and despondency seen today could set the table for a positive surprise.”Kraft was one of the few bright spots, leading the Dow after news that the US food company would split into two divisions.As well as reporting forecast-beating results, the maker of macaroni and cheese, Oreos and Kool Aid said it would spin-off its grocery business from the faster-growing snack business. Its shares were 1.5 per cent lower at $33.78.Among retailers, individual July same-store sales figures were mixed but sent the S&P retail sector 4.9 per cent lower.As a whole, the Retail Metrics July same-store sales index rose 5 per cent, with 58 per cent of retailers beating forecasts. “Retailers catering to higher-end consumers outperformed once again in July,” the report said.But mid-level department store group Kohl’s, which was expected to miss sales expectations, fell 7.9 per cent to $47.67.Shares in Gap, the clothing store, fell 11.6 per cent to $16.98, one of the worst-hit retailers of the session. Shares in the troubled retailer have fallen nearly 30 per cent from its 2011 high.Costco, the discount retailer, reported a 15 per cent bump in sales against a similar period last year, registering net sales of $6.4bn. Gasoline inflation and foreign exchange rates both worked in the chain’s favour, Citigroup analysts noted. Its shares were off just 0.7 per cent to $76.51.Limited Brands also reported strong sales and boosted its outlook for the second quarter, which left its stock 1.27 per cent lower at $35.84. The company, whose brands include Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said same-store sales rose 6 per cent over 2010, beating analysts’ expectations.Elsewhere among the earnings reports, General Motors said its quarterly profit nearly doubled to $2.5bn on strong North American and Asian sales. Earnings per share in the carmaker were $1.54, beating analysts’ expectations.“We believe this quarter should begin to revive momentum around the GM story,” Citigroup analysts said. “Recent market share gains, resilient pricing and now a high-quality quarter are all occurring ahead of GM’s major North America product cycle.”But the strong earnings did little to boost GM shares, which fell 4.3 per cent to $25.99. Its domestic competitor, Ford, was down 6.8 per cent to $10.86.DirecTV, the US satellite broadcaster, reported that net income rose to $701m, or 91 cents a share, but its market share shrunk, adding just 26,000 US subscribers. Its shares dropped 5.7 per cent to $46.63.A key concern is that DirecTV’s model is “structurally flawed vs the cable operators”, analysts at Collins Stewart noted. They were optimistic about the outlook because “DirecTV has been able to withstand the crippling US recession and housing crises because of its premium brand and superior service.”
187;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
188;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;America’s turbulent jobs flight;US manufacturing has a good story to tell but it is about technology and productivity rather than jobs for the millions of unemployed;The ill-tempered struggle in Washington over raising the federal debt limit is enough to make anyone gloomy about the future of the US. Clive Crook, my FT colleague, rightly contrasts the stasis among politicians with the “unrivalled energy and ambition” of US workers.Unfortunately, while the former still have full-time jobs many of the latter do not. One reason for the nasty mood on Capitol Hill is the voters’ angst amid a slow recovery that has failed to dent the unemployment rate. It rose in June to 9.2 per cent, leaving 14.6m stranded by the “jobless recovery”.I had the chance earlier this month to go and see the American worker in action at two plants in North and South Carolina owned by General Electric, the country’s second-biggest exporter. There was much to admire on the trip – more than in Washington – but little cause for optimism about job creation.GE organised the tour for some journalists to show off its high-tech “advanced manufacturing” plants in which it makes jet engines and gas turbines, mainly for export. Jeff Immelt, its chairman and chief executive, now chairs Barack Obama’s council on jobs and competitiveness – an effort to address the jobs deficit.The two plants were examples of why the US, despite the rise of China, is still a manufacturing power. China’s manufacturing output has just overtaken that of the US (depending on how the figures are counted) but the output of each is still double that of Japan and three times that of Germany, according to IHS Global Insight.China has achieved that through low-wage manufacturing on a mass scale while the US has driven up productivity – China’s labour productivity is about 12 per cent of the US’s. The American worker is hugely productive, especially in the southern states where plants are mostly non-unionised.That was on display in Durham, North Carolina where the GE Aviation plant will make 377 jet engines this year, 80 per cent for export. They are assembled by teams of technicians, all of whom study for two years for technical qualifications, and who take charge of designing the assembly line.Those are attractive jobs – many of the technicians are military veterans – but there are not many of them. The plant is hiring but it currently employs only 330 technicians and 20 supervisors.Mr Immelt says that each job in GE’s plant in Greenville, South Carolina, where 3,300 workers make turbines worth $25m each, is matched by eight in the supply chain. Even so, these factories are cathedrals of capital intensity and labour productivity, not employment.“It’s not as if we can say: ‘Let’s have low productivity’,” remarked Mr Immelt as we walked around the Greenville plant. “Let us do this as inexpensively as possible and then I will bust my butt to sell the product in every corner of the world.”He is right that GE and other companies have no choice if they are to retain US manufacturing plants. But it illustrates why manufacturing employment has fallen by 5.7m in the past decade and why the McKinsey Global Institute’s most optimistic projection is for zero growth in US manufacturing jobs by 2020.The problem with US manufacturing is not that it has been shrinking – despite the “offshoring” of textile and electronics manufacturing to China, US manufacturing output rose by 3.9 per cent a year between 1997 and 2007. However productivity grew 6.8 per cent annually in the same period, so millions of jobs were lost.If manufacturing carries along the same path, McKinsey estimates that it could shed another 2.3m jobs by 2020, while the economy needs to create 21m more jobs to return to full employment. The mini-recovery in manufacturing jobs – 164,000 were added in the six months to April – recently stalled.The best hope is that productivity rises so high that offshoring is no longer worth the effort. As wages in China’s coastal cities have risen, there have been signs of an “onshoring” trend – Caterpillar and NCR are among companies that have expanded manufacturing facilities in the US, and GE has just announced plans for an aircraft engine plant employing 250 people in Mississippi.Hal Sirkin, a partner of the Boston Consulting Group, argues that the narrowing wage gap between China and the US, combined with higher productivity in the US, will come close to eliminating the cost advantage of China’s coastal cities over US southern states such as North and South Carolina by 2015.“When Chinese workers were paid 25 cents an hour there was not much to think about, but that equation is adjusting. We have begun to see manufacturing job increases and that is the start of a wave,” he says.It would be nice to believe Mr Sirkin but I have trouble doing so – manufacturing productivity rose by another 4.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year and the US must add capacity simply to stand still in employment terms. It is especially difficult for the less educated – even many assembly jobs now require two-year degrees.China is not giving up the jobs fight – although wages in the Pearl River delta have risen, it has pushed production inland. Countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia are also taking up the slack.US manufacturing has a good story to tell but that story is about technology and productivity rather than jobs for the millions of people out of work and facing a jobless recovery. While the US worker is laid off, productivity in Washington is likely to stay appallingly low.john.gapper@ft.com
189;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
190;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Industrial groups lift forecasts for the year;;Leading US industrial companies reported robust earnings and raised their forecasts for the year, though some struck a cautionary note, flagging up uncertainty created by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and lagging business confidence in the US.Honeywell, whose products range from aircraft engines to air conditioning units, reported a 14 per cent rise in sales to $9.3bn and a 40 per cent increase in net income to $810m, or $1.02 per share. The company lifted its 2011 outlook but offered a wider than normal estimate range because of the high levels of macroeconomic “uncertainty”.“The $64,000 question is how long the industrial economy can keep outperforming the broader economy,” said David Anderson, chief financial officer. “We’ve seen lots of poor headlines in recent weeks and those weigh on the industrial economy …and corporate confidence.”Mr Anderson said the industrial cycle “still has strength” particularly in emerging markets where Honeywell sales grew 20 per cent organically, excluding currency effects, but he added that “the structural macro forces [are] somewhat negative. That is what we are managing through.”General Electric, the industrial conglomerate, said second-quarter net income climbed 22 per cent to $3.7bn, while earnings per share increased 25 per cent to $0.35 year on year, driven by a recovery at its financial unit and solid industrial sales.Revenues slipped 4 per cent to $35.6bn, but excluding the impact of the spin-off of GE’s entertainment unit, revenues climbed about 7 per cent, driven by strong demand for aircraft engines and locomotives in particular. Infrastructure orders rose 24 per cent.“We are not getting those order rates from western Europe or the US,” said Keith Sherin, chief financial officer. “The orders are coming from resource-rich regions and rising Asia, China and India – places where they are investing a lot in infrastructure.”“Right now they are in a very strong cycle but there probably will be disruptions some place or maybe in many places in the next three or four years. We don’t anticipate that it continues forever at these rates.”At Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving equipment, net income jumped 44 per cent to about $1bn, while earnings per share climbed about 39 per cent to $1.52 in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, profits were $1.72 a share.Sales rose 37 per cent to a record $14.2bn, despite a $200m hit as a result of the earthquake in Japan. Analysts had been expecting earnings of about $1.75 a share on sales of about $13.2bn. Caterpillar also raised its 2011 full year outlook.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said: “While the economic recovery in the US continues to be weaker than many expected, we’re forecasting continued moderate economic expansion.”Mr Oberhelman added that China was doing “a good job of balancing growth and inflation, and our expectations for China remain positive”, although with a softening of growth during the quarter.In the US, Mr Oberhelman warned that “a lack of confidence in the business climate is the major impediment to a stronger recovery and job creation”, adding that the absence of clear deficit reduction or infrastructure plans was holding back corporate investment.Caterpillar shares slid by almost 6 per cent to close at $105.15, Honeywell shares fell about 3 per cent to $56.40, while GE shares held broadly steady at $19.04.
191;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-07-22T20:53:29Z;US equities struggle but end up on week;;US equities posted solid gains this week as the second-quarter earnings season heated up, led by stellar results from Apple whose stock hit a record.On Friday, better earnings from McDonald’s were offset by investors selling fellow blue-chips General Electric, Caterpillar and Verizon.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,345.01 on Friday for a weekly rise of 2.2 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 2,858.83, a weekly gain of 2.5 per cent.Overall, S&P 500 earnings growth in the second quarter is set to rise 9.2 per cent year-on-year, up from a forecast of 7.1 per cent at the start of this week, according to FactSet. That sets the S&P up for its first single-digit earnings gain after six quarters of double-digit results.So far this earnings season, 127 companies have reported their results with 84 beating estimates, a little higher than the run rate in prior quarters, and with 16 missing estimates, said John Butters, a senior analyst at FactSet.The big change this week has been in technology, with the S&P sector up 3.7 per cent in the wake of stunning results from Apple. The blended earnings for technology are now seen rising 17.5 per cent for the second quarter, up from 11.9 per cent on Monday, said FactSet.Apple recorded earnings of $7.79 a share versus forecasts of $5.87 a share and the stock touched an all-time high of $396.27 on Wednesday and rose 7.8 per cent to $393.30 on the week.Shares in News Corp dropped at the start of the week, but the stock rebounded and rose 5 per cent to $16.42 from Monday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent on Friday to close at 12,681.16 with a number of blue-chips reporting their latest results.Leading the Dow’s best performers on Friday was McDonald’s, whose second-quarter profits rose 19 per cent to $1.41bn, or $1.35 per share, and beat estimates. Its shares gained 2.3 per cent to $88.56.Fellow Dow member General Electric saw its shares drop 0.6 per cent to $19.04 after the conglomerate reported a 21.6 per cent jump in earnings, boosted by demand for oil and natural gas production equipment and jet engines.Verizon Communications, the telecoms group, swung to a second-quarter profit of $1.61bn that exceeded estimates and also named Lowell McAdam as the new chief executive officer.But shares in Verizon fell 2.2 per cent to $36.74, even as 2.3m sales of the iPhone helped produce earnings of 57 cents per share, ahead of analysts’ expectations of 55 cents per share.After the closing bell on Thursday, Microsoft reported a larger-than-expected jump in its fourth-quarter profit, but sales for its Windows product declined. The Dow constituent rallied 1.6 per cent on Friday, up 2.8 per cent on the week at $27.52.Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, said its net earnings in the second quarter rose 44 per cent to $1.02bn, or $1.52 per share. Excluding costs, the company earned $1.72 per share, below the $1.75-per-share forecasts.Caterpillar also signalled an uncertain business environment and the stock dropped 5.8 per cent at $105.15, and as the third-highest priced member of the price-weighted DJIA after IBM and Chevron, Caterpillar dragged heavily on the blue-chip benchmark.Of the major S&P sectors, financials was one of the standouts this week with a gain of 3.3 per cent as 26 banks reported earnings. Morgan Stanley reported a smaller-than-expected loss and, for the week, its stock rose 13.3 per cent to $23.90.Bank of America, the US’s largest bank, reported a net loss of $8.8bn for the second quarter and its shares rose 1.3 per cent to $10.13. Wells Fargo rose 7.2 per cent to $29.14 this week after its 29 per cent rise in earnings to $3.9bn. Goldman Sachs rose 4.1 per cent to $135.49, after overall earnings of $1.1bn, or $1.85 a share, and announced 1,000 job cuts. Analysts had expected profit of $2.27 a share with results hit by a 53 per cent year-on-year plunge in fixed income, currency and commodities revenues to $1.6bn.Zillow, the real estate website, debuted on the Nasdaq and tripled in value in its first day of trading on Wednesday. Shares opened at $60 and closed at $34.27 on Friday.In deals, Express Scripts agreed to a $71.36-a-share offer in cash and stock worth $29bn to buy Medco Health Solutions. Medco shares soared 22.1 per cent to $65.96. Express Scripts rose 10.3 per cent to $57.3
192;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Caterpillar disappoints as Japan quake weighs;;Shares in Caterpillar dropped sharply after the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue reported lower than expected second-quarter profits due to the effect of the Japanese earthquake and softer Chinese demand.In the three months to the end of June, net income jumped 44 per cent to about $1bn, while earnings per share climbed 39 per cent to $1.52 from the same period in 2010. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, profits were $1.72 a share.Sales rose 37 per cent to a record $14.2bn as the global economic recovery drove demand for commodities and the machinery that Caterpillar makes to extract them. But advances were helped by currency effects and hurt by a $200m sales hit from Japan.Caterpillar shares dropped 5.8 per cent on Friday to $105.15.Analysts had been expecting earnings of about $1.75 a share on sales of about $13.2bn. Still, Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, painted a relatively bullish picture of the global economy and raised the company’s earnings forecast.“While the economic recovery in the United States continues to be weaker than many expected, we’re forecasting continued moderate economic expansion. That, coupled with stronger growth in the developing world, is driving higher sales for Caterpillar,” he said.Mr Oberhelman added that China, a significant end market for the company, was doing “a good job of balancing growth and inflation, and our expectations for China remain positive,” despite a softening of growth during the quarter.In the US, Mr Oberhelman warned that “a lack of confidence in the business climate is the major impediment to a stronger recovery and job creation,” adding that the absence of a deficit reduction or infrastructure plans were holding back corporate investment.Over the last few years Caterpillar has grown dramatically, particularly in emerging markets. More than two-thirds of Caterpillar’s sales come from outside the US and the company has stepped up its expansion plans in countries such as China.In 2011 the company plans to make investments of about $3bn in 2011 and through the end of June, acquisitions of companies such as EMD and Bucyrus coupled with organic growth had boosted the company’s headcount by 27,000 since the start of 2010.Excluding the effect of the Bucyrus deal, which the company estimates will add $2bn of revenues in 2011 but trim earnings by $0.50, the company raised its full-year earnings estimate to between $6.75 and $7.25 a share from between $6.25 and $6.75 a share.The company also increased its sales estimate to between $54bn and $56bn from its previous outlook of between $52bn and $54bn.

Yet they came off their session highs after a top Fed official opposed Mr Bernanke’s comments saying he was against providing a stimulus even if the economy worsens.Stocks lost further ground after John Boehner, house speaker, said there would be no guarantee that the debt limit would be raised if an agreement was not inked by early August.The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.31 per cent at 1,317.6 and the Nasdaq Composite was also in positive territory, up 0.54 per cent at 2,796.92.Most of the S&P sectors were up, with the materials sector 0.8 per cent higher with Titanium Metals at the helm, up 7 per cent at $18.9. The energy sector was up 0.7 per cent – spurred on in part by a decline in oil inventories, led by Alpha Natural, the coal producer, up 3.7 per cent at $45.The Dow Jones Industrial average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,491.61, led by Caterpillar, which was up 1.6 per cent at $108.60.Financials weakened, but JPMorgan Chaseclosed 0.6 per cent up at $39.62, ending a three-session losing streak. However, poised for a lacklustre report of earnings before the bell on Thursday, it may say second-quarter revenue declined 0.8 per cent to $24.9bn according to average estimates by analysts.“The next big thing coming is JPMorgan releasing results, and that will fuel the fire,” said Sam Ginzburg, head of capital markets at First New York Securities.Investment Technology Group, an agency brokerage that serves large institutions, was down 13.73 per cent to $11.80, after the announcement of a large write-off for the second quarter alongside layoffs. As one of the lowest performing sectors, financials are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue within the sluggish US economy.Capital One slid 2.6 per cent to $50.87 despite reporting better than expected quarterly profits. It also said it would raise $2bn through a stock offering to finance the acquisition of ING’s US online bank.“Credit cards seem set for another quarter of beat and raise. Estimates are likely to move higher for Capital One. We continue to recommend Capital One and would note over the past year or so the card improvement cycle has survived several rounds of macro issues including the first round of Europe, the first GDP slowdown, and an oil price shock,” said Brian Foran, an analyst with Nomura.Other financial companies on the S&P 500 will announce earnings this week, including Citigroup on Friday.Marriott, the hotel chain, saw gains of 0.9 per cent at $37.10 while Yum! Brands, the US fast food restaurant group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, closed up 1.09 per cent at $55.60. Yum reported a 10 per cent gain in profits or $0.65 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations. Marriott’s diluted earnings per share totalled $0.37, a 19 per cent increase over the same period last year. Both companies announced results after the closing bell on Wednesday.“Yum! Brands has cash flow, strong, predictable and sustainable earnings. It has global reach with 40 per cent of its profits coming from China, which contributed to great earnings over time,” said Tucker Brown, research principal with SGA.On the media front, Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, hit an all-time high of $304.80 in early trading, though it pared its gains to $298.70, up 2.6 per cent. The company signed a multi-year deal renewing and broadening its rights to films and television shows from NBC Universal. This Tuesday’s move to overhaul its pricing policy to reflect the relative costs of distributing movies via the net and the post, was imed at pushing users toward its growing streaming service.News Corp was still in focus after dropping its $12.5bn bid to take full control of BSkyB, though it said it would remain as a long-term shareholder. Also on Wednesday, Senator Jay Rockefeller called for an inquiry into the media group , the first indication that the phone-hacking scandal that sparked outrage in the UK could spill over to the US. Its shares closed up 3.8 per cent to $15.93 in New York, paring back some losses after experiencing a 12.1 per cent drop since last week.
194;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-07-08T21:16:38Z;Wall St tumbles on disappointing jobs data;;Financial stocks led the way down in the final session of a choppy week on Wall Street as weaker-than-expected employment numbers dashed hopes that the “soft patch” in the US economy was coming to an end.The S&P financial index was down 1.3 per cent at the close, but the energy, industrial and technology sectors were not far behind as investors dumped riskier assets after the disappointing employment data.BB&T suffered the most in the financial sector, losing 3.3 per cent to $26.09. Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent to $10.71, despite news that it had reached a deal to sell its Balboa Life Insurance unit to Securian Financial, a US provider of insurance and retirement plans.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index was down 0.7 per cent at 1,343.81, although the measure was still up 0.3 per cent over the week.The losses were prompted by news that the US economy had added only 18,000 jobs in June, which was well below the 105,000 expected by economists.“This is terribly disappointing news,” said Brett Hammond, senior economist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management. “It is easy for the markets to shrug off one month of bad data, but this is two months in a row now,” he said.The negative reaction to the data were particularly acute due to strong ADP employment numbers in the previous session, which had raised hopes that Friday’s data would be strong.The ADP report showed that 157,000 private jobs had been created in June, ahead of the 95,000 expected, causing many analysts to revise upwards their expectations for the official number.This raising and then dashing of hopes left cyclical stocks sharply lower in the session after gaining on Thursday.In the industrial space, Caterpillar was down 1.1 per cent to $110.41 despite news that China’s regulator had approved its acquisition of mining equipment firm, Bucyrus International.Elsewhere, Cummins was down 1.9 per cent at $106.77 while the S&P industrial index was 1.2 per cent lower.The worst performing stock on the S&P 500 index was JDS Uniphase, which fell 4.6 per cent to $15.94. The S&P technology index was down 0.5 per cent, paring some of its 9 per cent gain over the past two weeks.The best performing sectors were defensives. The S&P utilities index was down 0.3 per cent while the telecommunications sector fell 0.3 per cent.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was up 1.6 per cent at 16.21.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent at 12,657.05, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,859.81. But in spite of these losses, the indices were up 0.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, over the week.Before the losses on Friday, the Dow was just 0.7 per cent short of a three-year high and Nasdaq was less than 0.1 cent away from a ten-year peak. These near-records came after two weeks of gains on Wall Street as investors began thinking the recent soft patch in the US – which pushed stocks down more than 7 per cent from the start of May to the middle of June – was finally coming to an end.The ADP employment data on Thursday appeared to strengthen the bullish case, causing a “risk on” trade. Investors were also looking to position themselves for a healthy earnings season, which begins on Monday when Alcoa reports.But the data on Friday left investors wondering if the strong 5.9 per cent rebound in the last two weeks may have been premature.“Hopefully, with supply disruptions related to the Japan earthquake and tsunami fading, and oil prices off their peaks, the labour market will perk up again,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.“If not, it is going to be an uglier second half than most anticipate,” he added.In corporate news this week, News Corp was in focus as the furore over allegations of phone hacking at one of its British newspapers escalated. The stock was down 7.3 per cent at $16.75 over the week, as the paper in question was closed down and some speculated that News Corp’s proposed takeover of BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, could be in jeopardy.Target, the discount retailer, was one of the best performers this week, adding 6.7 per cent to $51.14 after reporting strong retail sales numbers.
195;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-07-06T21:01:20Z;Media stocks drag Wall Street lower;;News Corp lost ground as the furore over alleged phone hacking at one of its British newspapers deepened while US stocks were largely flat as investors paused for breath following the strongest rally for two years last week.The media group was down 3.6 per cent to $17.47, one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P 500 index, as David Cameron, British prime minister, said he was backing a public inquiry into allegations of phone hacking at the News of the World.This was the first big share price move since the latest set of allegations surfaced and comes as News Corp is attempting a full takeover of BSkyB, the UK satellite broadcaster. The stock is still up 20 per cent over the year, however.The fall weighed on the S&P media index, which was down 0.9 per cent.In other news from the sector, there were reports that the owners of Hulu – which includes Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast’s NBC Universal – were committed to selling the video streaming service. Shares in Disney were down 1 per cent to $39.57 while Comcast fell 1.9 per cent to $25.49.But despite these losses, the benchmark S&P 500 index was flat at 1,339.22 overall as traders were reluctant to place large trades ahead of crucial employment data on Thursday and Friday.“The markets are probably just going to bounce around a bit until the employment report later this week,” said Yu-Dee Chang, chief trader at Ace Investment Strategists. “But the report is likely to surprise to the upside and I think the markets will continue up from there.”Sentiment on Wall Street was not helped by the largely disappointing economic news in the session.Data from the Institute for Supply Management indicated that US non-manufacturing business had expanded less than expected last month.The ISM index showed a reading of 53.3 in June, which was below the 54 expected by economists and down from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion.Separate figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consulting firm, showed an 11.6 per cent rise in planned job cuts in June to 41,432 from May’s 37,135. This was a potential worry given the non-farm payrolls report coming out on Friday.Financial stocks were the worst performing as the sector continued to suffer from news in the previous session that Moody’s had downgraded Portugal’s debt to “junk” status.Bank of Americawas down 2.5 per cent to $10.73 while Morgan Stanleylost 1.9 per cent to $22.72.The S&P financial index was down 0.6 per cent but is still up 4.4 per cent from the lows of last week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,626.10, helped by slight gains in the industrial, material and retail sectors. Urban Outfitters was up 5.6 per cent to $30.75 while Caterpillaradded 1.5 per cent to $110.08.The Nasdaq Composite crept up 0.3 per cent to 2,834.02.Many analysts were still confident that the markets would march higher in the second half of this year – even despite the 5.6 per cent gains last week – as they believe that the US economy will start to pick up in the next few months from the “soft patch” of the last few months.We “expect a second half recovery for the equity market,” said analysts at Citigroup. “Strength from corporate America and some resolution on southern European and US debt concerns should lead to equity market gains.”In other news, General Motors was up 1.1 per cent to $31.19 after Morgan Stanley added the carmaker to its “best idea” list, saying share-price declines have made US carmakers more attractive.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain store, was up 1.5 per cent to $43.38 after reporting that same-store sales had risen by 4.8 per cent in June, which was well above analysts’ estimates of 2.2 per cent growth.Shares in Tesorowere up 4.1 per cent to $24.10 after Barclays Capital upgraded its rating on the oil refiner, saying its restructuring will help it outperform peers over the next few years.It has now been just more than two years since the start of the US economic recovery. Of the stocks to gain ground since the end of June 2009, Netflix, the DVD subscription and online video streaming service, is up 603 per cent and Wynn Resorts, the US casino operator, has risen 397.7 per cent.

International Paper was up 4.9 per cent, to $28.78. Alcoa, the aluminium producer, added 4 per cent to $15.37, finding support after closing below its 200-day average on Monday.Caterpillar, the equipment manufacturer, saw some of the strongest gains on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, adding 3.3 per cent to $101.39. It is the sharpest two-day rally for Caterpillar since April.Technology shares also broke recent decline trends. Apple and Cisco both saw the biggest gains in three weeks. Apple added 3.2 per cent to $325.30 and crossed back into positive territory for the year.Cisco jumped 2.4 per cent to $15.51, though it is still down more than 20 per cent so far in 2011, leading a broad turn away fromtech groups that are tied to consumers and businesses spending more.“It’s a relief rally for those shares, with trend reversals for Cisco and Apple, which takes up the Nasdaq on its own,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Genuity.The indices were enjoying a reversal of recent trends, in which smaller growth companies that comprise the Nasdaq were down the most and large, defensive companies in the Dow were showing the biggest gains.But on Tuesday, the Dow was up 0.9 per cent to 12,190.01 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.2 per cent to 2,687.26.However, the internals of the rally were mixed. Volumes were trailing those on the heavy selling days of the past two weeks but the ratio of volumes for advancing shares versus declining shares was among the strongest of recent sessions.The S&P 500 index rallied throughout the morning until it hit 1,295, a key support level, then began paring gains. But the index then closed up 1.2 per cent to 1,295.52. “This is not a barnburner rally by any stretch,” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap. “Real money investors are still cutting back exposure and raising cash on the uptrends.”The early focus was on May existing home sales, which exceeded expectations. Mr Polcari said that with Wednesday’s rate decision from the Federal Reserve and Friday’s US gross domestic product figures still to come, traders were unwilling to make a strong move on the data.CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, was up 5.9 per cent to $146.78. Fertiliser groups have been in favour with analysts after Agrium, a Canadian group, on Monday raised its projections for the second quarter, citing strong retail demand.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, added 2.7 per cent to $32.38 after it announced a $5bn share buy-back programme, among the largest so far in 2011.Whole Foods saw some of the strongest gains on the S&P 500 index, adding6.2 per cent to $60.41. On Monday, BMO Capital Markets had upgraded the shares to “outperform”, sending the shares on a two-day gain of nearly 10 per cent. On Tuesday, the chain said it would expand to as many as 1,000 stores.Shares in Walgreen, the pharmacy chain store, dropped 4.2 per cent to $43.28 after it said it was ending a $5.3bn contract with Express Scripts, the prescription drug benefit services provider. Jefferies, the investment bank, was up 0.4 per cent to $21.34 after it reported earnings of 39 cents per share in the quarter, matching expectations. Investment banking revenues were a bit stronger than expected, as capital markets rebounded, but fixed income trading was slower than had been hoped.“We are confident that in a better environment Jefferies has solid earnings power,” wrote analysts at Ticonderoga Securities.Tower Bancorp was up 31.6 per cent to $26.80 after Susquehanna Bank said it would buy its fellow regional bank for $343m. Susquehanna shares were down 7.6 per cent to $7.70.American depository receipts of Sino-Forest, the Canada-based Chinese timber group, fell another 28.9 per cent to $1.97 after Paulson & Co, the hedge fund, said it had sold its position in the company. The company has been plagued by accusations from short-sellers that it does not reliably audit its Chinese assets, though it has vigorously denied the charges.X-REF BUYBACKS STORY ON MARKETS
197;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Industrial groups raided in EU probe;;Several big industrial manufacturing groups confirmed on Friday that they had been raided by European competition regulators because of suspected anti-competitive practices in the piston engine market.Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment by revenue, said that its Perkins subsidiary in the UK had been visited by officials, as did Germany’s MAN. Both companies said that they were cooperating fully with the authorities.Competition officials at the European Commission announced on Friday that they had carried out the raids on the premises of a number of companies involved in the engines business two days earlier because of suspicions that the firms might be involved in anti-competitive practices.Competition officials at the European Commission did not specify the names of the companies visited, but said that they were involved in the manufacturing, supply and distribution of piston engines, mainly used for industrial applications – such as generator sets, or for industrial transportation.Cummins, another big player in this sector, said it was not amongst the companies targeted by officials.Officials in Brussels stressed, as is normal, that the fact of the raids did not mean that the companies were guilty of EU competition law violations or prejudge the outcome of its investigation. There is no set time limit for such probes.

In the previous quarter, US soup sales had fallen by 4 per cent.The S&P 500 was down 1.2 per cent to 1,317.37, led lower by those sectors most exposed to the global economy as weak economic data out of China and Europe prompted fears of a slowdown.“The economic data from China and Europe are causing people to question their earnings estimates for the next two quarters,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global. Although losses on Wall Street were broad-based, the industrial, energy and technology sectors were the worst-performing.Around 30 per cent of all sales in S&P 500 companies come from overseas but the technology, material and energy sectors have the greatest exposure to activity outside the US.In the industrial space, Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, fell 2.3 per cent to $101.89 while Cummins, the designer and manufacturer of power generation equipment, fell 2.1 per cent to $104.16.The S&P industrial index lost 1.4 per cent.The S&P energy index fell 1.5 per cent as oil prices slumped. Schlumberger, the oil services group, lost 1.7 per cent to $82.09.Losses in the technology sector were led by Red Hat, the software company, which slid 3.7 per cent to $44.03 while JDS Uniphase fell 3.6 per cent to $19.59.The technology sector garners 53 per cent of its sales from overseas, according to figures compiled by Citigroup.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 2 per cent to $47.42, leading the S&P materials index lower by 1 per cent.Telecommunications and utility stocks have the least international exposure and so suffered the slimmest losses in the session.The S&P telecoms sector was down only 0.7 per cent while the S&P utilities sector lost 1.2 per cent.Financial stocks saw losses, in spite of also having relatively low international exposure as worries over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe continued to mount.Citigroup was down 2.1 per cent to $40.16 while Suntrust Bankfell 2.5 per cent to $27.20.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.1 per cent lower at 12,380.88 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,758.90.The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices all fell below their 50-day moving averages in the session, a signal of further selling to come.The benchmark S&P index has been hit by weekly falls for the last three weeks as some traders have worried that interest rate rises in emerging markets are finally starting to slow global growth, while others look nervously towards the imminent end of quantitative easing.Krispy Kreme was up 25.8 per cent to $8.05 after the doughnut chain reported that its net profit in the first quarter had more than doubled – it was the highest quarterly profit in more than seven years for the group.LinkedIn, the business- focused social networking site, failed to maintain the lofty price that it achieved on its first day of trading last week and fell 5.2 per cent to $88.30.The company priced on Wednesday night at $45 a share, already above the projected range, but the stock soared 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on Thursday.The stock is now down 6.3 per cent since then. On Tuesday, restrictions on short selling the stock will be lifted, which could precipitate a further drop.Shares in Apple were down 0.2 per cent to $334.40 following 1.6 per cent losses in the previous session as traders continued to watch the impact of an explosion at one of its main supplier’s factories late on Friday.Foxconn, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision, operated a plant that was set to produce most of Apple’s iPad 2, its second-generation tablet computer.The Vix volatility index was up 2.6 per cent to 17.88.

HP reported a day earlier than planned after a leaked memo from Léo Apotheker, its new chief executive, in which he warned that the company was facing “another tough quarter”.The disappointing results affected related technology stocks. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was down 1.5 per cent to $52.28 while SanDisk lost 3.4 per cent to $46.34.The S&P technology index was down 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down fractionally lower to 1,328.98 as sentiment was weighed down by data showing a sharp drop in US house construction.The number of houses built in April fell 10.6 per cent from the previous month, according to the US Department of Commerce, as oversupply sapped demand for new buildings.New building permits, a gauge of future construction, dropped 4 per cent in an indication that the sector will remain a drag on the economic recovery.This news weighed on homebuilding stocks. DR Horton, one of the largest US housebuilders, was down 1.7 per cent to $11.47 while Lennar lost 0.5 per cent to $17.50. The S&P homebuilding index declined 0.8 per cent.Data from the Federal Reserve showed an unexpected drop in manufacturing output last month. The 0.4 per cent fall was the first in 10 months and was led by an 8.9 per cent drop in autos.Industrial output remained static in the month, which was worse than the slight increase economists had been expecting. The news weakened stocks across the industrial sector. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, was down 3.1 per cent to $102.81 while Joy Global fell 2.5 per cent to $86.19. The S&P industrial index was down 1.3 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6 per cent to 12,479.58 and the Nasdaq Composite flat at 2,783.21.The broader markets have been in decline since the start of May as sentiment has been weighed down by sharp commodity price swings, European sovereign debt woes and worries about the end of quantitative easing.“The path of least resistance may be to the downside near term,” said analysts at Citigroup. “With traditional summer seasonality and some significant uncertainties … it does not appear likely that equity markets can bounce higher this summer.”The retail sector was in focus after mixed results from Walmart and Home Depot.Walmart was down 0.9 per cent to $55.54 after the world’s biggest retailer reported that sales in US stores that had been open more than a year had dropped for the eighth consecutive quarter. Net income rose 3.1 per cent to $3.6bn in the quarter, which served to limit the losses on the stock.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, was up 1.1 per cent to $37.40 after it raised its earnings outlook for the year and reported a strong gain in first-quarter income.Energy and material stocks lost ground as commodity prices softened.Materials was one of the worst performing sectors.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, fell 2.8 per cent to $16.45 and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 1.1 per cent to $46.83. The S&P materials index was 1.1 per cent lower.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, declined 0.2 per cent to $82.06. Cameron lost 2.3 per cent to $47.77. The S&P energy index was down 0.2 per cent.The financial sector was one of the few to gain in the session, led by Wells Fargo, which put on 3.2 per cent to $28.75.The S&P financial index added 0.7 per cent.
200;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Joy Global in $1.1bn deal for LeTourneau;;Joy Global, one of the biggest makers of mining equipment, has struck a $1.1bn deal to buy LeTourneau Technologies from Rowan Companies in a further sign of consolidation in the sector.The acquisition comes six months after Caterpillar, the biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, paid $7.6bn for Bucyrus International, a US maker of mining machinery which is Wisconsin-based Joy Global’s main rival.By strengthening Caterpillar’s position as the top mining equipment maker, that deal put pressure on Joy Global to do a merger or acquisition in order to become a bigger player in a fast-growing global market that is estimated to be worth some $40bn annually.The two acquisitions demonstrate bullishness among heavy equipment makers about the long-term strength of commodities and extractive industries, particularly in emerging markets.Capital spending is forecast to increase by at least 15 per cent this year from 2010, according to Jefferies & Company, the US investment bank, in response to demand from China and other emerging countries.Like the Caterpillar deal, Joy Global’s acquisition creates another powerful North American player in a global sector seeing increasingly fierce competition from emerging market rivals.The purchase of Texas-based LeTourneau would enable Michael Sutherlin, Joy Global president and chief executive, to diversify his customer base by expanding the company’s presence in the mining-equipment sector and entering the oil and gas drilling market.“The drilling products business moves us into another area of resource extraction that has similar fundamentals and value drivers as surface and underground mining,” Mr Sutherlin said on Monday.Entering the drill-making business is something of a homecoming for Mr Sutherlin, who ran the drilling equipment unit of Varco International in the 1990s.Joy Global expects the deal to generate some $40m in cost savings, but Mr Sutherlin said the deal was primarily aimed at opening up new opportunities, such as tapping LeTourneau’s presence in emerging economies and growing demand for large equipment such as wheel loaders.“We’re looking at markets that we don’t currently serve very well,” the Joy Global chief said, citing examples such as the iron-ore sector in Western Australia, coal mining in Indonesia and emerging mining countries such as Mongolia and MozambiqueLeTourneau had revenues of $815m last year, with $556m from its drilling products business and $259m in mining revenue.Mr Sutherlin said he did not expect any other company to try to break up the agreed takeover. “It’s locked and loaded,” he said.The company said it would fund the acquisition with cash and borrowing, most likely via a bank loan but also possibly through a public offering.Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Joy Global, while Barclays Capital was Rowan’s adviser.Joy Global shares rose 1 per cent to $88.36 in New York. Rowan shares slipped 0.2 per cent to $37.96.
201;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Levin minimises gains from US-China talks;;The US made only “minimal” progress in economic talks with China this week, a senior Democratic congressman said, as he warned that Beijing’s currency and industrial policies put America at a disadvantage.“There are two philosophies on trade: one is, let it all happen – it will work out in the wash. And there are those of us who believe in expanded trade, who know globalisation is here to stay but who feel that you have to shape its course,” said Sandy Levin, the veteran Michigan congressman and senior Democrat on the House of Representatives ways and means committee.“The meeting this week: did it do an adequate job in shaping the course? Not enough,” Mr Levin said in a video interview with the Financial Times.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, and Wang Qishan, the Chinese vice-premier, agreed a framework deal on Tuesday on economic co-operation, at the latest round of strategic and economic dialogue talks in Washington.Mr Geithner said there had been a “promising shift” in China’s economic policy, as Beijing made commitments not to discriminate against foreign companies on government procurement and to open up more of the financial sector to international investors. Mr Geithner also said China had made an “unambiguous” decision to let the renminbi appreciate.But Mr Levin, who spearheaded legislation to force China to allow its currency to rise which passed the House last year but has stalled in the Senate, said: “There’s been some improvement but how do you compete when you start with a 15-20 per cent disadvantage?”Mr Levin spoke of the decade-old round of Doha global trade talks, saying many of the big issues remained “unresolved”.The question, Mr Levin said, was “whether there’s any opening for a major agreement or there should be acceptance of action on a smaller one.“My only thing is this: let’s make a decision.”Following a hearing on Thursday morning on tax reform featuring the appearance of chief financial officers from four large US companies, including Caterpillar and United Technologies, Mr Levin said any structural overhaul should to be undertaken with great caution.“It has to be done in a way that keeps in mind the need for job creation in the US,” Mr Levin said, arguing that certain formulas for lowering rates while getting rid of selected tax breaks, like those for manufacturing and mortgage interest, could undermine the economy and middle-class Americans.However, Mr Levin has expressed support for curbing tax breaks for oil and gas companies, also the subject of a congressional hearing this week, noting the sector’s huge profits while consumers are suffering from high petrol prices.The congressman said that negotiations to lift the US debt ceiling were advancing only “slowly”, though “at some point there will have to be an agreement”.The US will hit the current $14,300bn limit on Monday and the Treasury department has warned that if no agreement is reached by early August, the US would be in danger of default.Still, Republicans are holding back, wanting to extract deep spending cuts in exchange for lifting the debt limit. Mr Levin referred back to the tax reform hearing to show corporate America was not happy with the Republican position.“All four [CFOs] said what a disaster it would be to let inaction occur, and I don’t know that Republicans like to hear that,” he said. “Deficit reduction and the debt ceiling need to be looked at, but on two tracks, and if you recklessly put these two tracks together you get a collision.”
202;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-05-09T17:17:27Z;Reaching out to new markets;;"International expansion has played a vital role in the success of three very different UK companiesJCBThe bright yellow livery of JCB is emblematic of one of the UK’s most successful manufacturing exporters. And while the colour remains the same, the mechanical specifications of its earth-moving excavators are changing as the Staffordshire-based company battles to maintain its market-leading position in Europe and compete against rivals in increasingly lucrative emerging markets.The company recently launched a range of so-called “skid steer” vehicles aimed specifically at the US market to compete against South Korea’s Bobcat, which manufactures a loader vehicle with an extremely tight turning circle that is popular in North America.Last month, a design that reduces fuel usage and allows operators to drive faster and get diggers to sites quicker won JCB a Queen’s Award for Innovation – the 26th such award since the company first took the prize in 1969.Modern JCBs can even offer the operator the option of coffee-making facilities in the cab – another ergonomic feature to help it compete with the global market leaders in excavators, Caterpillar of the US and Komatsu of Japan.Accepting the Queen’s Award, Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB and the son of its founder, said the company’s success depended on it continuing to develop machines that enabled customers to “do their job more productively and at less cost”.A determination to maintain its own market-leading position and enter new segments led to a strong rebound in JCB’s revenues last year as a recovery in world demand overcame anaemic growth in the UK economy.Much of the rebound has been down to a surge in demand in export markets. While figures from the Office of National Statistics show rising exports and continued growth in UK manufacturing, the company also says it is shrugging off continued weakness in the construction industry.Booming demand for earthmovers and excavators – particularly in emerging markets – helped the company raise revenues by nearly 50 per cent to £2bn in the year to December 2010, while unit production, which dropped to 36,000 in 2009, recovered to 51,600 by the end of last year. That has prompted plans for an expansion of manufacturing capacity in Brazil and India.JCB last month confirmed it had enjoyed the best first-quarter sales figures in its history, and while it was forced to lay off 1,800 people during the downturn, a rise in productivity has allowed it to rehire more than 1,000 staff.Sir Anthony insists that JCB, which exports more than 80 per cent of its UK production, will maintain Britain as its main centre of production and its engineering hub. However, new investments could see the proportion of its production in the UK shift from about 60 per cent to half as the company chases business in emerging markets.The company’s commitment to manufacturing is also reflected in its sponsorship of the JCB Academy, a school aimed at developing the skills needed for manufacturing employers in the UK.Though a prominent Conservative supporter, Sir Anthony has proved a persistent critic of both Conservative and Labour governments over their lack of a coherent industrial strategy, which, he says, has led to the long-term decline of manufacturing relative to the rest of the economy.Most recently, he called for the government to consider a system of wage subsidies during recessions, similar to the German Kurzarbeit, to help protect the country’s skills base. – Michael KavanaghIQEDrew Nelson has spent more than 20 years building up IQE, a business that has shifted from manufacturing fibre-optic devices for the communications industry to becoming a leading supplier of wafers used in a range of products, including smartphones and tablets.Yet having successfully ridden out the latest downturn, the founder and chief executive of the Cardiff-based group remains frustrated by what he sees as the failure of the government to do more to encourage UK businesses, particularly concerning the issue of red tape.“If, for example, you want to sell to any one of 20 countries, you have to apply for an export licence. It might take two months. Our customers want wafers in two weeks, and when you repeat the order, the same thing happens all over again. You could be talking to five different departments – it’s unbelievably bureaucratic,” Mr Nelson says.Excessive bureaucracy becomes even more of a problem for small and medium-sized businesses, he notes, which often have less of a cushion to protect them during the down cycles.Having floated in 1999 after a period of rapid growth that saw it expand into North America, IQE came unstuck when the bottom fell out of the dotcom market. Its headcount shrank from 450 at the height of the 1990s dotcom boom to just 70.During the most recent financial crisis, IQE “hunkered down”. As customers reduced inventory, its staff took a 20 per cent pay cut, and it introduced short-term working as part of efforts to drive down costs. Sales fell but earnings remained steady. “Everyone’s back on full-time pay,” Mr Nelson says. “We are back to about 400 people but with much higher volumes than before.”IQE has sought to tap into the UK’s high level of technology expertise, buying NanoGaN, a Bath University spin-out, in 2009. Yet Mr Nelson remains frustrated at how many of the UK’s best technology experts head for Silicon Valley.For the year to the end of December 2010, IQE reported a trebling of pre-tax profits to £6.3m on sales up 38 per cent at £72.7m. But while the wireless market still accounts for three-quarters of sales, Mr Nelson says he sees scope for growth in other areas, such as satellite technology, laser printers, barcode scanners and solar cells.He adds that as manufacturers look to gain additional efficiency and performance from their chips, IQE’s semiconductor wafers will be increasingly favoured over more traditional silicon types.With 99 per cent of its products going to customers outside the UK, IQE is also increasingly making use of plants gained via acquisitions in the US and Singapore. About half its production is based over three sites in the US, with plants in Singapore and the UK accounting for 25 per cent each.The next round of expansion is likely to take place in the US and Singapore. While Mr Nelson says that a move overseas is not on the cards, he admits the idea does exercise the board’s minds “from time to time”. – Mary WatkinsWeir GroupThis year marks the 140th anniversary of the Weir Group, which provided pumps that were crucial to the development of steam ships in the UK.The Scottish engineering group, which employs more than 11,000 people and operates in more than 70 countries, is now focused on the mining, oil, gas and power markets. It is still based in Glasgow, but last year only 10 per cent of its sales and workforce were in the UK, with 39 per cent of sales coming from emerging markets.“Although most of the group’s profit is now generated from outside Scotland, we are proud to recognise and celebrate our engineering heritage,” says Lord Smith of Kelvin (below left), chairman. “Weir is almost the last of a long list of notable companies established in the 19th century to retain its independence.”The group, which entered the FTSE 100 last year, reported a 58 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 2010 and a 39 per cent increase in orders.Weir has built its business through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Last year, it bought five businesses: Petroleum Certification Services, in Adelaide, expanding its presence in the oil- and gas-producing areas of Australia and south-east Asia; Linatex, a Malaysian producer of rubber products; BDK, an Indian valve manufacturer; American Hydro, in Pennsylvania, which makes turbine components; and Ynfiniti Engineering Services, operating principally in Spain and Portugal, which Weir said would strengthen its position in the fast-growing wind and solar energy markets.It also established joint ventures and alliances with partners in Germany, Japan and China.Keith Cochrane, chief executive, says demand for minerals, energy and power is being driven by population growth and the industrialisation of economies such as India, China and Brazil.“In North America, as conventional resources are exhausted, the proportion of oil and gas sourced from unconventional sources continues to grow, with other international markets also emerging,” he says. “Ageing power plants and environmental concerns will accelerate demand for new plants or alternative forms of energy.”Working overseas is not without its risks. In December, Weir was fined £3m after pleading guilty to breaching UN sanctions on oil-for-food contracts in Iraq that it was awarded by Saddam Hussein’s government. The fine was imposed in addition to a confiscation order for £14m.Following the fine, Lord Smith said: “What happened back in 2001 was wrong and we accept full responsibility.” Weir launched its own investigation in 2004 and all staff involved in the illegal payments have left the company, he says.“Since 2001, Weir has been transformed. We have a different board and a different management team, all of whom are committed to doing business at all times in an ethical manner,” he says.One reason Weir’s shares have risen sufficiently for it to enter the FTSE 100 is because it supplies equipment for the extraction of shale gas, which has surged in North America. The US Energy Information Administration estimates that technically recoverable shale-gas reserves outside the US are eight times the reserves within the country.Vidya Adala, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says: “While the timing and the cost of tapping these reserves remain uncertain, initial estimates highlight the potential growth opportunity for equipment manufacturers such as Weir Group.” – Andrew Bolger"
203;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-05-05T17:29:57Z;Business lobby toils to win infrastructure debate;;Businesses ranging from Caterpillar to BASF, the chemicals group, are pressing Republicans in the House of Representatives to increase spending to address the US’s growing infrastructure crisis or risk stifling America’s economy.For the US Chamber of Commerce and other business lobby groups, a campaign to convince lawmakers – who were elected on a pledge to cut the size of government and the deficit – not only to maintain spending on transport and other infrastructure but increase investment, has been an uphill struggle. “It’s all rooted in the challenge of explaining that there are certain roles that the government does indeed have,” says Janet Kavinoky, the executive director of the chamber’s transportation and infrastructure group.“We have to take the time to help them understand that with reform and additional funding you can really add to the economy. And you have to make that fit with the bigger message of smaller government and debt reduction and that is a hard message to craft.”Corporate America has largely been aligned with efforts by conservative and Tea Party Republicans on issues ranging from taxation to deficit reduction. But business lobbyists say there is a disconnect when it comes to the need for more spending on infrastructure, with many Republicans suggesting that the private sector, not the federal government, ought to pick up the bill to improve roads, bridges, ports and aviation infrastructure. A letter to freshmen lawmakers from Organization for International Investment, a group that lobbies on behalf of US subsidiaries of multinationals, says the US cannot “defer” addressing infrastructure if it is to remain the world’s most powerful economy and most attractive place to do business.The issue has been complicated by a ban on so-called earmarks, funds, allocated by the federal government in spending bills for what was often seen as lawmakers’ own pet projects. While earmarks have become an object of scorn among freshmen Republicans because they have funded allegedly wasteful projects such as Alaska’s $398m “bridge to nowhere”, they were often used for infrastructure. The issue has rankled some Republicans, such as Lindsey Graham, South Carolina senator.His efforts to get the federal government to fund a study by the Army Corp on the expansion of the port of Charleston, which the lawmaker’s office says directly and indirectly accounts for one in five jobs in the state, has been blocked, partly by fellow Republicans who felt the proposal sounded “earmarky”.The port must be expanded to accommodate the far bigger container ships that will reach the east coast from Asia after the expanded Panama Canal opens in 2014.The competition to decide which east coast ports will be expanded will be fierce. The study will cost several million to complete, but Mr Graham was seeking only $40,000 in this year’s budget.Senator Jim DeMint, of South Carolina, a leader in the Tea Party movement, is one of two lawmakers from the state who did not sign off on the request by the congressional delegation last year.“It’s an ideological issue for them. What we keep talking about is that ideology cannot get in the way of practical results that is in the best interest of the country,” says Otis Rawl, president of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.Boeing, BMW – whose US plant is based in South Carolina – and Michelin are three companies pushing for the study.In nearby Tennessee, Tate & Lyle, the UK food ingredients company, is grappling with severely reduced capabilities of the lock and dam system on the Tennessee River. The traffic from its Tennessee plant has fallen from about 300 barges a year to near zero because the Chickamauga Lock is unreliable, the company says, forcing it to rely on truck and rail transport that is more expensive and less environmentally sound. “If we are looking at achieving goals and improving the economy and being environmentally friendly and reducing our dependence on oil, it seems that support for the lock and dam should have a higher priority,” says Chris Olsen of Tate & Lyle.
204;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-05-05T00:00:51Z;US set to regain industrial crown;;The era of widespread offshoring of manufacturing from the US to China is coming to an end, according to a study that forecasts a renaissance for American production industries over the next five years.The report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) forecasts that, by 2015 – on the back of good productivity growth and relatively low wages – the US is likely to be slightly ahead of China as a base for making many of the goods destined for sale in North America.Another important factor is rapidly rising wage growth in many parts of China, which is reducing the incentive to base production in that country for anything other than selling to the large domestic market.The study will be welcomed in the White House, where President Barack Obama has made the revival of US manufacturing an important feature of plans for a sustained upturn.In recent months, large companies such as Caterpillar, General Electric and Ford have announced plans for new investments in US manufacturing, while the production sector increased at an estimated annual rate of 9.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, making it the fastest-growing part of the US economy.However, the projected rise in US industry’s fortunes is unlikely to be enough to enable the nation to regain its title as the world’s biggest manufacturer, which it held for more than a century until China overtook it last year.Hal Sirkin, senior partner at BCG, said the expected “immense demand” for goods by Chinese industry and consumers in the next few decades would be sufficient to keep China in the number one slot for some time, with supply of most of these products coming from locally based factories.“All the indications are that the US will remain a strong number two [in manufacturing] and well ahead of other countries such as in western Europe, where the economic trends are less favourable,” said Mr Sirkin.John Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think-tank, said the projected rise in US industry fitted into trends in which more US companies were re-orienting production to “more sophisticated goods that can be made with novel labour-saving technology”.Dan DiMicco, chief executive of Nucor, the second-biggest US steel producer, said many American companies had a “great opportunity” in the next decade to increase manufacturing in the country, helped by the weaker dollar.Last year, China accounted for 19.8 per cent of world manufacturing output, fractionally in advance of the US, with 19.4 per cent, according to data by IHS Global Insight, a consultancy. In 1990, China accounted for only 3 per cent of the total.The BCG study says that Chinese manufacturing wage costs seem likely to rise 17 per cent a year in the next five years, compared with only 3 per cent a year in the US.While the productivity of the average Chinese factory worker has increased tenfold in the past 20 years, it is still less than a third of the comparable figure in the US – offsetting the fact that Chinese wage costs are typically a tenth of those in America.Since employee costs typically account for 20 to 30 per cent of overall manufacturing expenses, with other costs such as covering equipment often no lower than elsewhere, by 2015 China is unlikely to have a cost advantage over US factories in making many products for the US market.The goods that look like being more attractive to produce in the US include those made in small volumes and involving many design changes – such as construction machines and furniture.Items made in long runs and with little variation – such as mobile phones and televisions – will continue to be made in China, even for sale in the US, the study says.
205;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-05-03T10:45:35Z;China-Russia relations: Siberia waits for a thaw in border policies;;Across the Amur river that divides Russia from China, dark streaks of water run in patterns across the ice as spring comes to the Siberian city of Khabarovsk.The thaw is bad news for Russia’s economy but good news for Vova Losev, who works for a trading company that shuts down during the spring and autumn when the ice is too unstable to bear the weight of trucks but still thick enough to obstruct the passage of boats.“We have two months a year where we can’t get much done, but it’s nice to have a break from the phone ringing day and night,” says Mr Losev, a young Russian who works in neighbouring China.Along a 3,279km stretch of border from Grodekovo near Vladivostok to Zabaikalsk near Lake Baikal, there is not a single crossing that is passable all year, hampering the growth of trade between resource-rich Russia and the booming Chinese economy.That should change this year, with construction of a railway bridge across the Amur river to connect the steel mills of Heilongjiang in north-eastern China with the iron ore deposits in Russia that they need to run.The bridge will be paid for by both the Chinese and Russian governments and by IRC, a Hong Kong-listed mining company that operates the Kimkanskoye and Sutarskoye (K&S) iron ore field at the Russian end of the railway line.“We know that Russia needs to co-operate with another country to open up its far east. The natural partner is China, which has far more financial resources than either Japan or South Korea,” said Boris Krasnojenov, metals and mining analyst at Renaissance Capital.The region’s key challenge – and one it shares with developing countries with natural resources from Africa to Mongolia – is infrastructure, says Mr Krasnojenov. And China has the funds to solve the problem.China is keen to solve that problem to ensure it gets vital resources to power its economy. The project financing for IRC’s K&S project was arranged by China’s ICBC bank and the China National Electrical Engineering Company (CNEEC), which will build the iron ore processing plant.At the K&S field, a drill is boring holes to fill with dynamite, and the white powdery explosive dusts the ground around the machine ready to blow a hole in the earth that will expose the iron ore beneath.“We use Chinese workers to develop the mine. It’s a win-win for everybody,” says Svetlana Kostromitinova, a mining analyst with Petropavlovsk, which owns a controlling stake in IRC.Ms Kostromitinova has identified the other key challenge confronting officials trying to develop the remote but resource-rich Siberian forest which borders China – a lack of people.With thousands of miles of unexplored forest and snowy tundra, Russia’s far east is sparsely populated. It has only 6.7m people spread across its vast area, or roughly one person a square kilometre, compared with 84 per sq km in the Chinese province of Heilongjiang across the Amur river.“There is enormous potential here, but the key challenge is to find the personnel you need to open up the region,” says Ken Tocker, product support manager at Amur Machinery and Services, a subsidiary of Caterpillar of the US, which supplies the trucks, drills and diggers that power the mining, timber and construction industry in Russia’s far east.In two decades of working for Caterpillar in 20 countries, Mr Tocker says this is the toughest posting he has had. He has tried to recruit people from central and western Russia to work there and failed. “It’s practically impossible,” he says.Despite the lack of manpower in eastern Siberia, however, Russia has not made it easy for Chinese citizens to emigrate and work in the region.Russians can cross the Amur river from the border city of Blagovechensk to the Heihe free-trade zone, on the opposite side, without a visa. But Chinese are not able to make the same journey travelling in the opposite direction.Meanwhile, in the Russian city of Khabarovsk, a 18-hour train ride away through the dense birch and cedar forest known as the taiga, the authorities reduce the populations of Chinese migrant workers by carrying out spot checks and deporting those caught without papers.But without Chinese labour the region will languish.Dr Pavel A Minarkir, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences Far East branch, says that the region’s best hope is to align more closely with its Asian neighbour.“We are not Europe and we are not Asia, but the political obstacles to a closer economic relationship with north-east Asia are far lower than those standing in the way of integration with the European Union,” Dr Minarkir says.China’s projected growth of 7 to 9 per cent a year is correlated with steel demand, so iron ore is a vital element supporting the Chinese economy.The countries remain locked in a tight but uneasy embrace. But for Siberia, Chinese money and workers will be vital to push the economy forward.
206;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;It’s too late to buy into booming manufacturers;The valuation of the two stocks is at historic highs;On both sides of the Atlantic, stocks have been buoyed lately by strong results from old-line manufacturers. A good thing too, some will say. Time to wean the economy off banks and suchlike flim-flam enterprises.How far that notion makes sense is for another day. Certainly, there is an irrational instinct in many people’s minds that says everything depends on making things you can stub your toe on.But is that sentiment affecting investors? After a decade of disappointments – first technology stocks, then banks – it would be natural if they turned for reassurance to old-style makers of big solid objects.To test the thesis, let us take a couple of examples: Caterpillar – which produced strong first-quarter figures last Friday – and Cummins.Those two venerable US corporations have much in common, not least in terms of the remarkable performance of their stock in recent years.Both are about a century old, and both have largely stuck to their original business – earthmoving equipment and truck engines respectively. Relative to the S&P 500, neither stock has been this high in the 38 years I have data for.It is worth comparing a more new-fangled manufacturer, the IT hardware producer Cisco Systems. In mid 2000 – the all-time peak of overvaluation in US stocks – Cisco’s stock was at $75, Caterpillar’s at $18 and Cummins’ at $7.Cisco is now at $17, Caterpillar at $115 and Cummins at $119. Yet Cisco has beaten the other two in sales growth over the period, and Caterpillar in earnings (though not Cummins, which was only breaking even back in 2000).Of course, Cisco was grossly overvalued in the dotcom boom, and traditional companies were despised accordingly. But there is more to it than that. Cummins, for instance, has outperformed the market by a factor of four in the past five years alone.As in the dotcom episode, there seems to be a broader story at work. This time it is about growth is developing nations, which have a monstrous appetite for primary goods and equipment. As with copper and steel, so with trucks and bulldozers.That should, of course, show up in the figures. But the snag is that both companies – Caterpillar especially – are highly cyclical.In 2009 Caterpillar’s worldwide sales of machinery – the bulk of its business – tumbled 43 per cent, then recovered 88 per cent last year. As a result, operating profit for the division went from $1.8bn to a loss of $1bn, then back to a profit of $2bn.Peering through the mayhem, it seems clear that the story has something in it. Caterpillar’s sales growth over the past decade has averaged 3 per cent within the US and 11 per cent in the rest of the world. For Cummins the figures are 2 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.As a result, the proportion of Caterpillar’s sales outside the US has risen over the period from 50 per cent to 68 per cent, and Cummins’ from 43 per cent to 64 per cent.If the story is about the old world giving way to the new, both companies are making the most of it.But caution is called for. Both companies are developing-world veterans. Caterpillar has been in Brazil since 1960, and Cummins in India since 1962. They have been exposed to global growth from various sources all along. And global growth, remember, has been trending sideways for decades, the recent big dip excepted.And whereas the valuation of the two stocks is nowhere near dotcom excesses, it is still at historic highs.Over long periods the price/earnings ratio tends to be slippery, if only because of accounting differences. But I calculate that the last time the price of the two stocks was anything like this high relative to the market – in the late 1970s – Cummins was at a P/E discount of some 40 per cent, and Caterpillar at a 10 per cent premium. Today Cummins is on a near-30 per cent premium and Caterpillar double that.This is scarcely bubble territory – unlike, perhaps, mining and commodities. But it depends on the same narrative – one which, in relation to China especially, is scarcely novel.And here is the slight concern. Those who recall the dotcom boom will know it was not based on a false premise, exactly. IT was indeed the wave of the future.Rather, the reaction to that premise was grossly overdone – the more so with the passage of time.In other words, any story gets overbought eventually.It is good to see Caterpillar and Cummins in the ranks of old-established US corporations that just keep on flourishing.

207;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Growth in jobs belies rust belt’s reputation;;"A123 Systems is a company that could represent the future of US industry.A manufacturer of batteries for the new generation of electric and hybrid cars, it opened a new factory in Livonia, Michigan, about 20 miles west of the centre of Detroit, last year. It is recruiting fast, with 500 employees already and 1,000 expected by the year-end.Attracting the investment was not easy for Michigan; A123 had factories in China and South Korea, where costs are significantly lower, and looked at other US states, including Massachusetts, Virginia and New Mexico. In the end, it took $125m of incentives from the state to seal the deal, but with that additional help A123 decided the Michigan plant could be viable.“Our customers do care about US manufacturing but they have to source their components at the lowest cost,” says Dave Vieau, A123 chief executive.“We could see that if we could get that support from the state, then we could get very close to the cost levels of production in Asia.”The story shows many of the factors that are driving the modest but noticeable recovery in manufacturing in the rust-belt states. One is the influence of the automotive industry, which is vital to many companies in the region and has been powering back after the recession. Seasonally adjusted car and light truck sales ran at an annualised rate of more than 13m units in February and March: the first two consecutive months to reach that level since the summer of 2008.The rebound in heavy-duty trucks is even stronger: from 142,000 vehicles last year, sales are on course for 265,000 this year, and perhaps 300,000 next year, according to Eaton, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components.Another industry strong in the northern states is mining equipment, which has benefited from the commodities boom.The northern states have a base of installed industrial capacity, which remains strong even after the losses the region has suffered. Caterpillar, the earth-moving equipment company, has been expanding its plants in southern states including Texas and Arkansas but still retains Illinois as its principal centre in the US.Timken, a successful manufacturer of bearings and specialised steel based in Canton, Ohio, has production all over the world but still exports its steel from the US to China.“We have a steel mill in Ohio, and the question is whether we can make it profitable,” says Jim Griffith, chief executive. “But a steel mill would be more expensive in China.”That legacy also includes a skilled workforce. Tom Waltermire of Team NEO, which attracts investment into the Cleveland area in Ohio, says: “The tremendous wealth generated during the 100-year heyday of manufacturing in this area – roughly from the 1870s to the 1970s – has created an infrastructure, including universities, that gives us the capability to conduct business and train people.”For modern manufacturing companies which often require a smaller but highly skilled workforce, that can be particularly important.Educational attainment, in terms of rates of graduation from high school and college, are generally higher in the northern states that have been adding industrial jobs than in the southern states that have been losing them.In 22 states, mostly in the south and west, “right to work” laws ban the “closed shop” that requires employees to join a union. Some of those states, including Texas, Georgia and Oklahoma, have added significant numbers of manufacturing jobs in the past year. However, that factor is not always decisive.Lincoln Electric, another Ohio-based company, which makes welding equipment used, among other places, in the oil and gas industry, has hired another 150 people in the past three months. John Stropki, chief executive, says: “When people started to move into those areas that had right to work laws and lower costs, what they didn’t always have was a quality workforce. And we have been able to find that.”Michigan has an employment rate that has been falling faster than any other state but is still above the national average. Mr Vieau of A123 says “access to an experienced workforce” has been very important, and about half the people the company has hired were previously unemployed.While costs are often still higher in the north than in the south, the differences are not enormous. An average general-purpose production worker, or “helper”, on the US government’s definition, is paid $25,240 per year in Michigan and $23,090 in Mississippi, according to official figures: a difference of about 9 per cent.Above all, perhaps, the revival is due to companies battling to innovate and become more productive. “There is a new manufacturing sector emerging in place of the old,” says Mr Griffith. “Companies are finding different ways to compete, and different markets, and they are winning in that competition.”Mr Waltermire, reflecting on the decline of the great US industrial giants of the 20th century, puts it another way: “When the dinosaurs are dead, all the little mammals take over. And we’ve been doing that.”"
208;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-04-29T20:51:57Z;Wall St ends week of bumper earnings;;Large US indices hit multiyear highs this week after a number of bumper quarterly earnings reports and a well-received statement on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.But the final session saw little action as investors paused for breath and attempted to make sense of these technical highs.Still, the markets ground a little higher on Friday as strong results from Caterpillaroutweighed more mixed results elsewhere. The world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues stormed past expectations, reporting a near 60 per cent jump in revenues and a fivefold increase in profit, sending the stock up 2.5 per cent to $115.41.But shares in Research in Motion plunged 14 per cent to $48.65 after the maker of the BlackBerry issued a surprise profit warning, due to increasing competition from Apple and Google and delays to the launch of its next generation of smartphones.Among other technology sector stocks, Microsoft lost 3 per cent to $25.92 after reporting that revenues from its Windows operating system had suffered a rare slip. It was the first quarter in more than two decades in which its profits had fallen below those of Apple.In other earnings news, Merck, the US pharmaceutical company, was up 0.5 per cent to $35.94 after reporting a tripling in its first-quarter net income, while Chevron added 0.6 per cent to $109.44 after announcing that its earnings were up 36 per cent, thanks to higher oil prices.Mixed economic data helped to foster a cautious session. Figures showed that US incomes had risen 0.5 per cent in March, ahead of expectations, but that spending rose by a worse than expected 0.2 per cent on an inflation-adjusted basis.All this left the benchmark S&P 500 up by a slender 0.2 per cent to 1,363.61 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.4 per cent at 12,810.24, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,873.54.The S&P 500 was up 2 per cent for the week overall while the Dow added 2.4 per cent and the Nasdaq rose 1.9 per cent. Over the month, the S&P was up 2.8 per cent.“People were taking a breather on Friday following the onslaught of strong earnings and the positive news from the Fed earlier in the week,” said Paul Brigandi, senior portfolio manager at Direxion Funds.The big market-moving event of the past five days was on Wednesday with the latest statement on monetary policy from the Fed and a subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, chairman.The central bank struck a generally dovish tone, suggesting that it was still a long way from raising interest rates. The event was well received by the markets, lifting a host of big indices to multiyear highs. The Nasdaq Composite reached a decade-long high on Wednesday after the Fed statement.Other highs reached during the week included a 34-month peak on the S&P 500 and all-time highs on the Russell 2000 small-cap index and the Dow Jones Transportation Average.The Russell was up 2.3 per cent to 865.29 over the week and the Dow Transport added 4.2 per cent to 5,514.87. Strong earnings results added to relief over the Fed. So far, out of the 298 S&P 500 companies that have reported, 77 per cent have beaten analysts’ expectations.Of the companies to report and beat expectations, the largest was ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation. It reported a 69 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to $10.7bn, largely on the back of high oil prices, and the stock was up 1.9 per cent to $87.98 over the week.The Nasdaq was helped to its 10-year high by Amazon, the largest online retailer, which rose 5.4 per cent to $195.81 over the week to a high after it reported a 38 per cent jump in sales. This rise in revenues was accompanied by a 33 per cent fall in net income, however, but investors had already braced themselves for this.SunPowerwas up 36.4 per cent to $21.69 over the week after announcing on Friday that Total, the French energy group, planed to acquire a 60 per cent stake in the US solar-panel maker.United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, was up 2.5 per cent over the week to $74.97 after it managed to shrug off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter.Procter & Gamble and Boeing also reported healthy earnings and their stocks were up 2.6 per cent and 5.7 per cent to $64.91 and $79.75 per cent respectively over the five days.
209;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar bullish on global economy;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, struck a bullish note on the global economy, raising its outlook for the year and reporting first-quarter profits far above Wall Street’s expectations, as demand for construction machinery surges around the world.The Dow component and industrial bellwether said on Friday that it had seen “record machine sales in many developing countries” during the quarter, with equipment sales rising by 90 per cent in Latin America from last year.More than two-thirds of Caterpillar’s sales come from outside the US. That has accelerated since the start of the recession, as the company has stepped up its expansion plans in emerging markets, especially China.Caterpillar said US construction companies and dealers that hire out equipment were also starting to replace ageing models, although sales of new machines were still far below peaks.“In the US, it’s a very slow recovery from very low numbers,” said Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, stressing that the company would be well placed when the pace of growth accelerated.Caterpillar made a net profit of $1.23bn, or $1.84 per share, up from $233m, or 36 cents per share, in the same period last year, and well above analysts’ consensus forecasts of about $1.31 per share. Revenues rose to $13bn from $8.2bn a year earlier.Equipment sales were up 63 per cent from the first quarter of 2010, which Caterpillar said was explained by booming demand. At the same time, manufacturing costs increased just 3 per cent, underlining how the company shed jobs and boosted productivity in the downturn.The results prompted Caterpillar to raise its full-year profit outlook to $6.25-$6.75 a share, up from its previous forecast of about $6 a share. The manufacturer said it was on course for a record year, beating 2008, when it made a profit per share of $5.66.The company, which has a large presence in Japan, said the natural disasters there would wipe $300m from its sales this year and reduce operating profits by $100m. Caterpillar said it was suffering from “sporadic production disruptions” due to lack of parts.The company also warned that central banks in the US and Europe could harm the global recovery by raising interest rates prematurely, and warned that rising oil prices had the potential to derail global growth.Mr Oberhelman urged US politicians to address the country’s fiscal situation. “Instead of pointing fingers at each other, the administration and members of Congress need to work hand in hand to find solutions,” he said.Caterpillar shares were up 2.4 per cent at $115.29 by early afternoon in New York.
210;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-04-26T20:43:28Z;Industrials lift Wall Street;;The S&P 500 index jumped to a multi-year high after promising consumer confidence data and a range of strong earnings reports from leading industry names, such as Ford Motor, 3M and UPS.Shares in Ford rose 0.8 per cent to $15.66 after the carmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $2.55bn, its highest profit for the period in 13 years and a 22 per cent advance on a year earlier. Its 61 cents of earnings per share in the quarter, up from 50 cents a year earlier, was also well above the 46 cents estimated by analysts.3M gained after the industrial group reported a 16 per cent jump in first-quarter profit.The stock was up1.9 per cent to $95.94. George Buckley, 3M’s chief executive, said that demand for materials used in the screens for tablet computers was “going up like a rocket ship. And we are the supplier to those folks”. But he added that disruptions from the Japanese earthquake would hit earnings by 10-13 cents per share this year.United Parcel Service also recorded gains after one of the world’s largest package delivery companies managed to shrug off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter. UPS reported net income of $885m, or 88 cents in diluted earnings per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents a share and sending shares in the company up 0.9 per cent to $74.30. The logistics group, which is often regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, also reported higher margins and raised its full-year earnings forecast.Cummins jumped 7.6 per cent to $116.39 after the maker of truck engines reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled. The well-received results left the S&P industrial sector up 1.8 per cent, the best performing sector on the S&P.Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.8 per cent to $111.94 while General Electric gained 1.1 per cent to $20.10, as both stocks benefited from the generally higher sentiment in the industrial space.These gains helped the benchmark S&P 500 index close 0.9 per cent higher at 1,347.24, its highest level since June 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.9 per cent to 12,595.45 while the Nasdaq gained 0.8 per cent to 2,847.54, a 3½-year high.Also lifting sentiment in the wider markets was news that the US consumer had become slightly more optimistic in April, according to data from the Conference Board.The research group said that its index of consumer confidence increased to 65.4 in April, up from a revised 63.8 in March as more Americans said they expected their incomes to rise in the near future.On the negative side, the Richmond Federal Reserve reported weaker manufacturing activity and US home prices fell by 3.3 per cent in February from a year earlier, according to the S&P Case-Shiller home price indices. The fall in house prices was not unexpected.Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, said that now “rest period” in the markets was likely over the coming months, with the S&P ending the quarter only very slightly higher from here.Results from Coca-Cola were the only big disappointment of the session, as the company’s first-quarter earnings per share came in a penny short of Wall Street estimates. In spite of this, net income at the world’s largest soft drinks company by revenues rose 18 per cent from the same period last year to $1.9bn, or 82 cents a share.It also reported a rise in sales around the world in spite of rising commodity prices and political turmoil. Still, the earnings miss left the stock down 1.2 per cent at $66.93.Shares in Netflix fell 9 per cent to $228.91 after a disappointing earnings outlook. Investors focused on this, in spite of the company reporting net income at the top end of expectations. The DVD subscription and film streaming service said it added more than 3m subscribers in the quarter.Delta Air Lines jumped 11 per cent to $9.99 after the airline’s first-quarter earnings and revenue beat expectation. The world’s largest airline by market value still reported a loss, however, due to higher fuel costs.Emulex, the chipmaker, fell 6.2 per cent to $9.71 after forecasting disappointing fourth-quarter adjusted earnings.
211;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-04-25T20:11:41Z;In the post-crisis world, risk must be sensibly priced;Proposed derivatives market rules criticised;“Let’s trade!”Jeffrey Skilling’s primordial cry in Enron The Musical, about the rise and fall of the Texas energy group, sets off a cacophony as each actor sings to a different tune.The noise, according to the stage directions, should build to “an atonal bubble of commodity prices and bids”, a metaphor for the chaos of derivatives trading and the reckless greed that sank the company.The curtain has long fallen on Enron but its themes are very much alive.This month the US authorities, which had a silent part in Enron’s drama, got in on the act with proposed rules for the large and lightly regulated derivatives market.No sooner had the plans been unveiled than an atonal chorus of banks, companies and lobbyists arose to attack them.At the centre of the dispute is a requirement for “non-financial end users” – airlines, oil groups, manufacturers and other companies that hedge their risks with derivatives – to post margin, or collateral, to the banks they deal with.Blue chips such as Caterpillar, Ford and Boeing do not put up margin on many over-the-counter derivatives.The idea is that forcing banks to collect cash and liquid securities from corporate counterparties in the $583,000bn derivatives market will boost their defences in case of a crisis.As AIG and Lehman Brothers showed in 2008, a severe dislocation in such a diffused and opaque area can have ruinous ripple effects on the rest of the system.The proposed rules do not impose automatic margin requirements but simply demand that, for each trade, banks set a “risk threshold” above which collateral would be required.This seemingly logical approach – if a trade gets too risky, pay up – did not go down well with end users.The Washington corporate crowd thundered that the rules would divert billions of dollars from investments to idle margins, impairing economic growth and endangering 100,000 jobs.The big groups say the plans are unpatriotic (leading to overseas migration of the derivatives market), misguided (none of the companies would destroy the system if they failed) and unnecessary (derivatives were not a significant cause of the crisis).The last argument is the only indisputable one. It is also beside the point.Policy actions should guard against the next crisis, not the one just gone.The proposals remind me of what a golfer friend said when I asked him whether being dull was a requirement in his sport (full disclosure: I hate golf).“It’s not indispensable but it helps,” he replied.Maybe derivatives are not the “financial weapons of mass destruction” Warren Buffett warned against (a big derivative user like him should know, though). But in the post-crisis world, ensuring that risk is appropriately priced is a sensible approach.The most puzzling aspect of the companies’ furious reaction – and inevitable lobbying onslaught before the June 24 deadline for comments – is that the proposals would not change the status quo much.Some OTC derivatives already require collateral. But even for those that do not, banks adjust the cost based on the credit profile of the buyer. The riskier the company, the higher the derivative’s price.As finance professors John Parsons and Antonio Mello have argued in their blog Betting the Business, the rules would make transparent a cost that is baked into the securities’ price.A glance at the big profits earned by banks such as JPMorgan Chase on derivatives proves that they do not dole out risk-free lunches to companies.Corporate treasurers may prefer the certainty of regular payments to the vagaries of margin requirements, but that hardly justifies predictions of Armageddon.The claims that corporate end users are “non-systemic” are also suspect. It is true that most of the 30,000-plus companies that trade derivatives are too small to threaten the global financial system, but economic contagion works in mysterious ways.When the Baltimore utility Constellation Energy was teetering on the brink after the Lehman collapse, local electricity supply was in jeopardy. Oil markets shuddered in 1994 when Germany’s Metallgesellschaft lost $1.6bn on “hedges”.Those last quotation marks are the crux. The bespoke nature of most derivatives, coupled with regulators’ chronic failure to oversee the market, makes it almost impossible to distinguish between genuine hedging and Enron-style speculation.In such a secretive environment, collateral seems like a small price to pay to ensure that banks have enough funds to survive wildly turbulent times.“Let’s trade!” But sensibly.Francesco Guerrera is the FT’s Finance Editorfrancesco.guerrera@ft.com

related charges. J&J was hit by $271m of charges related to its DePuy ASR, a hip replacement which had to be recalled. The stock had been losing ground since the start of the year, but after Tuesday’s gains is up 1.4 per cent year to date.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 2.4 per cent to $34.10, helped by the strong results, while the wider S&P healthcare index was up 0.9 per cent.This helped the wider markets bounce higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 index closing 0.6 per cent higher at 1,312.62. This followed a 1.1 per cent loss in the previous session after S&P, the rating agency, surprised traders by lowering its outlook on US debt from “stable” to “negative”.Sentiment on Wall Street was helped by news that housing starts and permits for future home construction had risen by more than expected in March, rising 7.2 per cent from the previous month to 549,000.But the improvement was largely a bounce back from the sharply lower levels in February when the figure was depressed by the winter weather, and so did not have a profound impact in the session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent to 12,266.75 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 per cent to 2,744.97. “The market did react positively to some good earnings, but the gains were not dramatic as traders are in a cautious mood at the moment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “The markets will likely stay in a tight 3-4 per cent trading range for the time being,” he added.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs reported profits down 72 per cent in the first quarter as the bank’s trading revenue declined and earnings were hit by a $1.64bn dividend payment to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.These results were better than analysts’ had expected, but shares in the investment bank still lost 1.3 per cent to $151.86.This weighed many financial stocks, but failed to drag down the overall sector. Bank of America lost 0.6 per cent to $12.34 while US Bancorp fell 1.2 per cent to $25.25, but the KBW banking index was flat.Losses on the broader financial indices were pared thanks to Zions Bancorporation, which added 3.9 per cent to $23.85 after the bank reported its first quarterly profit in 2½ years, surprising investors who were expecting a loss.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Texas Instrumentslost ground after reporting lower-than-expected profits and revenues, becoming the first large chipmaker to report on the effect of the Japan earthquake on earnings. Texas Instruments said after the closing bell on Monday that two of its three Japanese factories were damaged in the disaster and warned that the biggest impact on revenues would take place in the second quarter. The stock fell 0.7 per cent to $34.54.After the closing bell Intel reported earnings of 59 cents a share, ahead of the 46 cents expected. IBM also reported earnings above expectations, with earnings of $2.41 a share, ahead of the $2.30 expected. Both stocks were up in after-hours trading.NYSE Euronext rose 1 per cent to $38.70 after Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange made a fresh offer for the exchange. Nasdaq and ICE fell 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent to $27.40 and $119.33, respectively.The materials sector saw some of the strongest gains on Wall Street led by steel stocks after Steel Dynamics reported strong first-quarter earnings and said that the current quarter looked “solid”. Shares in the steel producer were up 5.7 per cent to $18.46, while US Steel added 4.5 per cent to $52.74. The S&P materials sector added 1.8 per cent.Industrial stocks were also higherCaterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.1 per cent to $106.10.The energy sector was also higher. Halliburton, the oilfield services company, was up 4 per cent to $49.01. The S&P energy index climbed 1.1 per cent."

The rumours last week were that the deal could be worth up to $20bn.But the gains did not last, and as the session continued, Johnson & Johnson was ticked lower with the rest of Wall Street, closing down 0.2 per cent $60.46.The wider markets fell sharply after S&P surprised traders by lowering its outlook on US debt from “stable” to “negative”.The rating agency reaffirmed its current triple A rating but said: “Because the US has, relative to its ‘AAA’ peers, what we consider to be very large budget deficits and rising government indebtedness and the path to addressing these is not clear to us, we have revised our outlook on the long-term rating to negative from stable.”That left the S&P 500 index down 1.1 per cent to 1,305.14 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.1 per cent lower at 12,201.59. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,735.38.Wall Street was already slightly lower before the announcement, not helped by rumours – denied by Athens – that Greece had asked for a debt restructuring and news over the weekend that China had raised the reserve requirements for its banks again.But it was the ratings news that really weighed on sentiment. Some argued that this was surprising, given that investors should already have been aware of the problems with the US deficit.“Most people should already know that the fiscal system in the US has been deteriorating,” said Channing Smith, managing director at Capital Advisors, adding that the downgrade was more of a “reality check” than providing any new information.Despite that, the losses in the US markets were broad based, with most of the major S&P sectors losing more than 1 per cent.The S&P energy index was the worst hit, falling 1.5 per cent. But financial stocks were down 1.4 per cent, industrial stocks lost 1.3 per cent and the S&P material index fell 1.3 per cent.Among the worst performing stocks were Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, which lost 3.1 per cent to $103.90, and Bank of America, which fell 3.1 per cent to $12.42.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, jumped 12.4 per cent to 17.2. On Friday, after a relatively quite few weeks, the index had fallen to 15.3, its lowest level since 2007.The ratings news also sent the S&P 500 index below the psychologically significant 1,300 mark, although this was reclaimed relatively quickly.Halliburton managed to buck the downward trend, adding 0.7 per cent to $47.14 after the oilfield services company reported earnings had more than doubled in the first quarter.The company said that rising oil prices had led to increased efforts to find oil and natural gas in North America.Shares in Citigroup were higher for most of the session after reporting better than expected quarterly earnings. The bank reported first-quarter earnings of $3bn, or 10 cents a share, down from 15 cents a year earlier but ahead of the 9 cents expected.The stock was up around 1 per cent for most of the day, but lost ground in late trading to close flat at $4.42.Eli Lilly reported earnings down 15 per cent amid higher operating expenses and restructuring costs, sending the shares down 1.1 per cent to $35.62. Lilly reported a profit of $1.06bn, or 95 cents a share, down from $1.25bn, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier and short of the $1.17 a share expected by analysts.A123 Systems jumped 11.3 per cent to $6.13 after the lithium-ion battery maker was raised from “neutral” to “buy” by Goldman Sachs.BMC Software, the business software maker, fell 3.2 per cent to $49.21 after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “hold”.Community Health Systems escalated its effort to acquire Tenet Healthcare, converting its $3.3bn bid to an all-cash offer a week after being sued by the hospital operator for wrongfully billing insurers for unnecessary patient stays. CHS’s stock was down 4.4 per cent to $30.50.
214;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-04-12T18:24:30Z;US groups win partial victory on derivatives;;Large US companies fighting to escape expensive rules on derivatives trading have won a partial victory, after regulators put forward plans to hit hedge funds and to spare non-financial companies.The requirement to post margin, or collateral in the form of cash or government securities, against derivatives transactions has been the most hard-fought area of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms for large US companies. The likes of IBM and Boeing have argued it would tie up billions of dollars in collateral, hurting their businesses and the wider job market.US regulators on Tuesday published proposals which they said made the impact “minimal” for these so-called commercial end users. Banks trading with a company would be required to assess its credit risk and demand margin requirements for transactions that exceed a certain threshold and do not pass through a clearing house.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said last month that US companies would simply take their business overseas to avoid draconian rules. Using the example of Caterpillar, Mr Dimon said the US group would take its custom to Singapore.However, Scott O’Malia, a Republican commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said the proposals left the door open to margin requirements for non-financial groups and were therefore unacceptable. He was particularly upset because the instructions from members of Congress were to leave non-financial users out of the new regime.“We are imposing increased costs on non-systemically relevant commercial firms, who will now be faced with the decision of hedging risk or investing in their business,” he said. He added that the banking regulators’ proposals would “require that end users pay …margin to banks”.But an official at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, one of the regulators involved in the rule-making, denied that would be the effect of the rule. “End users would not be required to post margin …below a credit exposure limit that the bank has established,” the official said.Sam Peterson, an analyst at Chatham Financial, said regulators were going against the intent of Congress by stating that they could impose margin requirements on non-financial companies. “We disagree with that,” he said. “The ideal would be that we have a clear iron-clad exemption.”Regulators are now braced for a flood of comments on their proposals.Hedge funds and other “high-risk” financial companies would be required to post margin under the rules set out on Tuesday – many of them are already required to do so by banks managing their credit risk.

Such types of steel are used in components such as crane parts or the shovels and buckets of earthmoving equipment.The initiative to increase revenues in Asia, particularly China and other fast-growing countries, fits into a plan by the company to push up the proportion of its total revenues that are derived from niche grades of steel to about 60 per cent by 2015, up from about 40 per cent last year.In an interview with the Financial Times, Martin Lindqvist, SSAB’s chief executive, said: “We are aiming for a bigger footprint in Asia and to do this we have to find ways of getting closer to customers so that we can discuss with them their needs and find ways to provide them with the type of steel that meets their requirements.”The company is exploring the idea of setting up service centres in a range of countries including China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia that would be modelled on an existing centre in Shanghai.It could also form regional partnerships with independent steel distributors that would do a similar job of acting as a bridge between the company and steel customers in these countries, such as makers of construction machines.Mr Lindqvist said the company particularly wanted to expand in China and form closer links with construction machinery makers such as Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, Zoomlion and Sany to complement its good ties with big makers of earthmoving machines based in other countries, such as Caterpillar of the US and Japan’s Komatsu.As well as making products judged to be speciality in grade since they have unusual properties and are hard to manufacture, SSAB also makes materials that are more towards the commodity end of the steel spectrum, such as hot-rolled materials used in general engineering or white goods.Last year SSAB gained only 6 per cent of its total sales of SKr39.9bn ($6.4bn) from Asia, with about half coming from Europe and the rest mainly from North and South America.However the share of the company’s total niche sales coming from Asia is twice as high as for revenues overall, coming in at roughly SKr2bn out of SKr16bn, or about 13 per cent.While the company is looking to make sales of its niche steel account for as much as 60 per cent of total revenues by 2015, it wants the proportion of this coming from Asia to climb to about a fifth, implying an increase in its total niche sales in Asia of at least 100 per cent.It is stepping up production of a special type of steel – called “quench and tempered” material, which is particularly strong and hard – from one of its plants in Mobile in the US with much of the extra output destined for China.Global sales of speciality and high-strength steels are expected to be about 20m tonnes this year, worth about $30bn. Other big players in this industry include JFE and Nippon Steel of Japan, Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal and Dillinger Hütte of Germany.
216;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-04-04T18:00:48Z;Caution holds back US hiring spree;;"Bob Trojan is in two minds. When asked about Rockford Linear Actuation, the Illinois-based manufacturer of hydraulic components of which he is president and chief executive, Mr Trojan is bullish. Orders from customers such as Ingersoll Cutting Tools and ThyssenKrupp are up 25 per cent on last year, he says.When it comes to the wider manufacturing sector, he is more anxious. “Everybody seems to be waiting for the bottom to fall out again,” he says. “We all got burned three years ago and we’re being cautious.”Businesses such as Mr Trojan’s are critical to the US’s efforts to bring unemployment rates low enough to raise confidence and to encourage growth. Hiring sprees by very large industrial companies such as Caterpillar, manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, and John Deere, tractor-maker, have grabbed headlines, but small companies such as Rockford Linear Actuation employ the vast bulk of US workers.US manufacturing was severely affected by the recession, with more than 2m jobs lost. The sector’s growth has spearheaded the economic recovery. However, many smaller and medium-sized manufacturers are still holding back on creating jobs.Official data on Friday showed the US generated a stronger than expected 216,000 jobs in March, further evidence that a robust recovery in the labour market is under way. Manufacturing added 17,000 jobs.With his order book growing fast, Mr Trojan would normally look to boost his 20-strong workforce. But he is loath to add to his fixed-cost base by hiring. Instead, he is giving his workers more overtime and has reworked existing equipment to make it more efficient.“It’s not clear the present manufacturing uptick will continue for more than a couple of weeks or months,” he says. “And it’s expensive to find people and add them to payroll.”Charles Cannon, chief executive of JBT, a maker of food-processing machinery and airport equipment, tells a similar story. JBT, a company based in Chicago with a market capitalisation of about $540m, cut 200 jobs from its ground support equipment business.JBT is hiring again – but has only taken back about 50. It has a “soft hiring freeze”; new employees must be approved by a group vice-president. “We’re trying to be sticky on the way back with our cost structure because we took all the costs on the way down,” Mr Cannon said.Manufacturers have found they are able to increase productivity by getting their employees to work harder or more efficiently. Navistar, the truckmaker, has adopted “flexible manufacturing” to enable plants to produce different vehicle types rather than the single models produced before the recession.Companies have made increasing use of temporary labour and overtime. These can be more expensive than to pay a salary – but they reflect a focus on staying nimble. “People value the flexibility more than the cost at the moment,” says Jeff Owens, chief executive of Advanced Technology Services (ATS), a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria in Illinois.US manufacturers have also taken the opportunity to rebalance workforces worldwide, hiring faster in emerging economies, to reflect the shifting geographical nature of demand.Another problem is a lack of technical skills in the US workforce, a longstanding complaint by executives of industrial companies. Companies may be holding off hiring as they seek skilled workers. A fifth of US manufacturers have more than 15 job openings on their factory floors, suggests a recent survey by ATS and The Nielsen Company.Martin Swarbrick, president and chief executive of Bison Gear & Engineering, which makes industrial motors for fast-food equipment, train turnstiles and ice-makers, says it took him more than 18 months to find a qualified electrical engineer to join his 250-strong staff.In a sense, the jobs outlook is a Catch-22-style conundrum. Companies say they would feel more confident – and start to hire in earnest – if unemployment were to fall below 8 per cent, yet unless they generate jobs, unemployment will not reach those levels.“Everybody laments the unemployment rate – but they look at their own workforce and say: ‘I’m not going to take on additional expense, I’m doing things differently now, more efficiently’,” says Jeff Joerres, chief executive of ManpowerGroup, a Milwaukee-based global recruiting company.Back at Rockford Linear Actuation, Bob Trojan is “cautiously confident” – but will not hire unless he sees another year of 25 per cent growth: “The recovery’s not certain yet. We’re still kind of choppy here.”"
217;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-31T21:02:33Z;Wall Street down after jobless data revision;;Berkshire Hathaway shares slid after the unexpected resignation of one of its key figures while the wider markets closed out the best first quarter in over a decade, despite edging slightly lower in the session on weak economic data.Berkshire Hathaway lost ground after David Sokol, one of the leading contenders to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, resigned just weeks after the investment company agreed to purchase Lubrizol for $9bn – a business in which he held stock.Class B shares in Berkshire Hathaway were down 2.1 per cent to $83.68, one of the worst performing in the financial sector. Elsewhere, Bank of America was down 0.9 per cent to $13.33 while SunTrust Banks fell 1.2 per cent to $28.86.The S&P financial index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing of all the S&P sub-indices.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 1,325.83, following a string of lacklustre economic numbers.Figures from the Labor Department announced that 12,000 more people had claimed benefits than had initially been reported last week, weighing on sentiment. The four-week moving average of claims went up 3,000 to 394,000.However, the news was not all bad as it also reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 6,000 last week. This helped to limit losses in the session ahead of the all important official non-farm payroll number due to be released today.“The revised data show a slightly less steep drop in claims over the past few months, but the key point here is that the trend is still clearly downwards,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Other figures showed that US factory orders had fallen 0.1 per cent in February, which was more than expected, and that business activity had expanded at a slower rate in March than in the previous month.Overall, that disappointing data left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2 per cent at 12,320.79 while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,781.07.The Dow was up 6.7 per cent in the quarter, which was the best first quarter for the index since 1998.The retail sector lost ground in the session led by CarMax, which fell 7.2 per cent to $32.10 after the biggest US used-car dealer reported lower gross margins for the fourth quarter. However, the group also reported earnings up 19 per cent and double-digit gains in sales of vehicles.Elsewhere in the sector home improvement retailers lost ground, with Home Depot falling 1.4 per cent to $37.06 while Lowe’s lost 2 per cent to $26.43. Earlier in the week, Home Depot had seen gains after announcing plans to issue $2bn of debt and buy back $1bn of stock.The S&P retail sector was down 0.7 per cent, one of the worst performing in the session along with financials. Looking at the first quarter on Wall Street, equities have seen strong 5.6 per cent gains. It was the best first quarter for the S&P 500 since 1998. On average since 1998, the S&P 500 index has lost 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year, with the index losing ground in six out of the previous 13 first quarters.The markets began the year in a euphoric state, continuing the rally from early September 2010 when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The S&P 500 saw a sharp 6.8 per cent rise throughout January and the first half of February, reaching the point where many commentators started to argue equities were overbought and due a correction.Then in the middle of February, the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East and the subsequent spike in oil prices provided a catalyst for a sell off.That was compounded in March by a further retreat following the natural disaster in Japan. These worries saw markets marked down 6.4 per cent in four weeks. Since the middle of March, the index has rallied back 5.6 per cent as traders have turned their attentions towards the domestic economic recovery.“Ultimately, the markets have been predisposed to positive news and have had a tendency to shrug off negative news,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.Energy stocks dominated the quarter, with the S&P energy index up 16.8 per cent as oil prices soared. Chevron rose 17.8 per cent in the quarter to $107.49.Industrial stocks have been the next biggest winner rising 8.1 per cent. Caterpillar has put on 18.9 per cent to $111.40 over the quarter.
218;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-31T00:10:03Z;Dimon warns of bank ‘nail in coffin’;;Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, launched a broadside against financial regulation on Wednesday, warning that new capital rules could be “the nail in our coffin for big American banks”.Regulators are negotiating international capital standards for the biggest banks but Mr Dimon said setting the new requirements too high, or allowing overseas banks to calculate their asset base differently, could disadvantage US banks and was already stifling economic growth.“If you want to set it so high that no big bank ever goes bankrupt … I think that would greatly diminish growth,” he told a US Chamber of Commerce conference. Too large a disparity in capital requirements between Europe and the US would mean “you’re pretty much putting the nail in our coffin for big American banks,” he said.Urging regulators to make a quick decision, he said the uncertainty meant banks were already restricting their lending, nervous of the “anger and the shrillness – and Switzerland says it’s got to be 19 per cent and people in the UK say it’s got to be 15 per cent.”“If you think that’s helping growth, it’s not,” Mr Dimon said, adding that a 7 per cent capital ratio would be adequate.Mr Dimon’s comments come as Wall Street executives and Republican members of Congress are starting to attack regulation as anger at the financial industry subsides. On Tuesday, Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, wrote in the Financial Times that the Dodd-Frank financial reforms risked creating “the largest regulatory-induced market distortion since America’s ill-fated imposition of wage and price controls in 1971”.Spencer Bachus, the Republican chairman of the House financial services committee, has said that regulators are there to “serve” the banks and warned the Treasury not to hurt Goldman Sachs’ shareholders when it writes new rules implementing Dodd-Frank.Restrictions on debit card fees charged to retailers are also coming under attack in Congress. John Tester, Democratic senator from Montana, has closed in on the 60 votes he needs to overturn the rule. He was supported on Wednesday by Mr Dimon who called it “basic price fixing at its worst”.“It basically penalises us for having debit cards,” he said. “I think it was very unfairly done in the middle of the night with no facts and analysis whatsoever. This is not the way legislation should be done.”Attacking another aspect of Dodd-Frank, Mr Dimon said rules requiring companies to put up collateral as they trade derivatives would “damage America”. Gesturing at the chief executive of Caterpillar, Mr Dimon predicted the industrial company would take its derivatives business to Singapore.He said the new law had failed to improve the regulatory architecture. “We had a system of too many regulators, too much overlap and too many gaps. Instead of simplifying and strengthening, we added more. It’s even more complicated now.”Separately, Mr Dimon said that he did not expect a rash of defaults of municipality debt but did say that “maybe 100” could default. “It’s not going to shatter America,” he said.
219;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:27+0000;Unilever in ‘dim sum’ bond move;;"Unilever is set to become the first European multinational to launch an offshore renminbi-denominated “dim sum” bond when it raises Rmb300m ($46m) from institutional investors in Hong Kong on Monday, bankers say.Dim sum bonds are slowly gaining traction with multinationals, virtually all of which have growing Chinese operations. McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, became the first US issuer last August when it raised Rmb200m. Caterpillar, the US-based manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, followed with a Rmb1bn bond in November.Unilever, which is also expected to be among the first clutch of foreigners to list renminbi-denominated A shares in Shanghai once the regulatory framework is in place, will hope the move demonstrates its commitment to China. In addition to backing the nascent dim sum bond market, issuers are supporting Beijing’s ultimate aim of internationalising the so-called red-back. The more foreign private sector issuers, as opposed to bodies like the Asian Development Bank, issue the bonds, the greater the credibility in the offshore market, bankers say.The move comes as Unilever plays catch-up to US-based rival Procter & Gamble, which has stolen a march on it in China. Consultants in China attribute Procter & Gamble’s stronger positioning to its early start and hefty investment in everything from advertising to distribution.But Unilever, which has revenues in excess of €1bn ($1.4bn) in China, is fighting back with beefed-up spending on research and development as well as consumer insights.Dim sum bonds have raised $1.3bn so far this year, according to Dealogic, more than $1bn of which was tapped by Chinese issuers. But issuers from other countries are starting to dip in; Orix, the financial services company, became Japan’s first issuer earlier this month.Bankers say the coupon on Unilever’s bond, which will be finalised on Monday, will be “very competitive”. Caterpillar paid 2 per cent for its bond and McDonald’s 3 per cent. Unilever, like fellow issuers, has sizeable renminbi outgoings, but these are more than covered by income. However, bankers say, the deal is seen as being less about securing reasonably priced funds than winning stripes in Beijing for good corporate citizenship. Backing by a multinational should help stimulate further interest in the dim sum bond market, one of the core components in Beijing’s ambitious plan to internationalise the Chinese currency.Foreign issuers have not been rushing to tap the market largely because the renminbi cannot be freely converted.Strict regulations control the flow of the currency between mainland China and Hong Kong, making transfers for investment cumbersome. Most foreign issuance in the market since its creation in 2007 has come from banks and their Chinese subsidiaries."
220;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:07:36+0000;JCB recovering from ‘one hell of a recession’;;At the entrance to JCB’s global headquarters in Staffordshire, green shoots are finally emerging across the beds of “Mr JCB” roses. They’re named after the company’s founder, Joseph Cyril Bamford.But as workers await the eruption of bright yellow flowers, a strong rebound in demand at JCB has seen sales of its earthmovers and other vehicles recover after two years of recession.The acrid fragrance of steel welding is a welcome sign of the upturn in output, which last year rose from 36,000 to 51,600 units worldwide.That still leaves production less than the 72,000 at the high of the boom in 2007. But Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of the family-owned company, is delighted by a recovery that has allowed him to take on 1,000 workers after having to lay off 1,800 during the recession.Production of its mid-sized machines is running at about 60 a day at the Rocester plant, compared with the 20 or so at the worst point of recession. Meanwhile, JCB is also cranking up production at its heavier equipment plant close to Uttoxeter.Production of large excavators at the plant, which cost £40m ($64m) and opened in early 2009, fell to just half a dozen a week but is now three times or more that figure as demand recovered.“We have been though one hell of a recession,” says Sir Anthony. The recovery in JCB’s fortunes reflects that of Caterpillar of the US, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues. It said in January that it expected to make record profits this year as mining booms and construction users in developed economies replace ageing equipment.The improvement in trading at JCB, which is the third ranked supplier of earthmoving equipment behind Caterpillar and Komatsu of Japan, has been achieved without the benefit of exposure to mining enjoyed by its bigger rivals. JCB’s vehicles are mainly used in smaller-scale construction and civil engineering projects.Though JCB is expanding its portfolio of bigger machines, it does not manufacture the largest vehicles used in mining. The largest Caterpillars can sell for several millions of pounds, while JCBs range between £50,000 and £200,000.“Caterpillar and Komatsu have both done very well out of mining,” says Sir Anthony. “We have struck to what we are good at – high volume machines at a certain price that can sell readily through dealers.”Further investments in plants in Brazil and India announced this week are likely to shift JCB’s balance of manufacturing towards a 50-50 split between the UK and overseas. About 60 per cent of production is in the UK, with India the next biggest location.The investments reflect the pattern of JCB’s sales growth, which has remained strong in the Bric economies and related “outlying countries” such as Indonesia and Chile.But Sir Anthony argues that JCB’s manufacturing future lies firmly in the UK – in spite of the higher labour costs compared with emerging economies.The prominent Conservative party supporter has attacked both major political parties for lacking any coherent UK industrial strategy to encourage export-led manufacturers over recent decades.A proponent of low taxation, on Friday Sir Anthony welcomed the chancellor’s move to reduce corporation tax and other measures to support enterprise.“His next step must be towards a long-term strategy to support our manufacturing companies, whose exports will ultimately drive our return to economic growth,” he says.“You can manufacture in the UK and be successful, but they [politicians] have to look at added value [industries] where the labour content is low.”He also called on the political parties to back a system similar to the German Kurzarbeit. Rather than facing redundancy during a recession, employees would be moved on to part-time working with the government topping up their salaries. This, he argues, would prevent the unnecessary destruction of the UK’s manufacturing skill base. “We are too abrupt in the way we treat labour,” he concedes.This article has been amended since original publication to reflect that production of JCBs mid-sized machines is running at about 60 a day, not the 60 a week originally stated
221;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Slideshow: JCB;;JCB, the supplier of earthmoving machinery, is benefiting from a revival in demand following a painful drop in orders during the recession.The company, the third largest in its sector behind Caterpillar of the US and Komatsu of Japan, announced this week it was expanding production in Brazil and India.But the UK remains its manufacturing and engineering hub, accounting for about 60 per cent of production – of which more than four-fifths is exported from the UK.
222;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-23T17:24:46Z;JCB to expand capacity in Brazil and India;;"Booming demand for earthmovers and excavators in emerging markets helped JCB raise revenues by nearly 50 per cent last year and has prompted plans for an expansion of manufacturing capacity in Brazil and India.Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of the UK-based family-owned company that exports more than 80 per cent of its UK production, insisted Britain would remain the centre of production centre of its engineering “hub” as he announced a $100m investment in expanding production in Brazil, in addition to a $30m investment in a new engine plant in India.Revenues at the group rose from £1.35bn ($2.2bn) to £2bn in the full year to December 2010, while unit production, which fell from 57,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2009, recovered to stand at 51,600 by the end of last year, ahead of forecasts last July.“With markets growing so rapidly, the time is now right for us to enhance our already strong presence in Brazil,” said Sir Anthony.The expansion of overseas production is expected to reduce the UK’s share of JCB’s manufacturing from 60 per cent to about half.But JCB, which enjoyed a record year in India, selling more than 21,000 units, had also experienced improved trading conditions in Europe and North America.The turnround has helped it to raise productivity rates at UK plants, which has allowed JCB to rehire more than 1,000 staff after it was forced to cut 1,800 workers during the recession.JCB is expected to report a strong recovery in profits when it reports full-
year figures later this year. Restructuring costs weighed on JCB, traditionally a bellwether for UK manufacturing industries, with profits falling from £187m in 2007 to £28m in 2008, and remaining stuck at £29m the following year.The company is the third ranked global supplier by volume in the segment of earthmoving machinery, behind Caterpillar of the US and Komatsu of Japan. JCB’s strong market position in smaller and medium-sized machines has helped improve fortunes, despite the company’s lack of exposure to the booming mining sector.Sir Anthony also warned that the sector faced supply chain risks following this month’s Japanese earthquake and tsunami.“The Japanese situation is serious for the whole industry,” he said. “A lot of key hydraulic products are made in Japan and there is still no certainty about how it’s unwinding.”“I can’t speak for competitors, but a lot of core components are sourced in Japan and there are first, second, third-tier suppliers in those areas affected.”"
223;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-20T22:45:07Z;US groups weigh Asia exit as costs rise;;Most big US manufacturing companies are considering relocating factories from low-cost Asian countries to the US or Latin America as they face rising logistics and transport costs, according to a report being released today by Accenture, the consultants.The earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which have wreaked havoc on global supply chains, have underlined how multinational manufacturers can find themselves stranded without critical components.For example, General Motors, the US carmaker, plans to stop production today at a factory in Louisiana that makes pick-up trucks, due to lack of parts normally supplied from Japan.Boeing, the aircraft-maker whose 787 Dreamliner relies on Japanese manufacturers for more than a third of its parts, said it had enough inventory of components for the next few weeks, but was unsure of supplies beyond that. Jamco, the Japanese company that makes the 787’s galleys, warned that deliveries could be affected by fuel shortages.Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment by revenues, said its factories around the world could be “sporadically impacted” by the disruption to its Japanese supply chain. The company has already located alternative sources for components produced by its Japanese suppliers.The problems in Japan could prompt big manufacturers to reassess the risks in their global supply chains. The Accenture report suggests that, long before the earthquake, such companies were already looking at simplifying supply chains by bringing them closer to end-markets.Some 61 per cent of manufacturing executives surveyed by the consultancy said they were considering more closely matching supply location with demand location by onshoring or “nearshoring” manufacturing and supply.Matt Reilly, Accenture’s managing director of process and innovation performance, said that this could lead to a wave of factory relocations in the next three years as big US manufacturers move production from Asia to the US and Latin America. “In the past five years, companies were driving at labour cost arbitrage and lower material costs,” Mr Reilly said.“But now that oil and transportation prices have gone up, productivity gains are not as big as they were, and there are issues around risk in supply chains, companies are starting to go where the customers are, instead of where the raw materials are.” He said the shift was also being driven by customer demands for quicker supply times and greater customisation.“A lot of what’s going on in manufacturing innovation is about trying to get customer feedback quickly and injecting that back into the supply chain, so that features and functions can be changed quickly,” he said. “It’s tough to do that when you’ve got stuff going on in Thailand or Japan.”A string of other international companies have also cautioned that their supply chains could be disrupted by the Japan quake, including Sony Ericsson, Volkswagen, Volvo and GKN, the UK car and aerospace components manufacturer.Japanese companies are racing to reopen their plants at home, but they need all of their suppliers to reopen too. Nissan said it would restart five plants today, but only to make parts rather than assemble cars. Its output will depend on the supply of components and a sixth plant in Fukushima prefecture, near the stricken Daiichi nuclear plant.For its study, Accenture surveyed executives at 287 manufacturing companies, most with headquarters in the US.Additional reporting by Robin Harding in Tokyo
224;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-18T20:51:04Z;Financials lead Wall Street rally;;Financial stocks climbed after the Federal Reserve cleared the way for banks to raise their dividends, while in the wider markets a turbulent week on Wall Street ended on a high note due to easing geopolitical tensions.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were among those to raise their dividend following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders.JPMorgan climbed 2.7 per cent to $45.74 while Wells Fargo added 1.5 per cent to $31.83. The S&P financial index rose 1.1 per cent.In the wider markets, US equities continued to rebound from the heavy losses seen earlier in the week lifted by news that Libya had announced an “immediate ceasefire” in its offensive against rebels.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,279.20, adding to the 1.3 per cent gains from the previous session.News that the G7 had reached an agreement to intervene in the markets to curb the rise of the yen also served to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 is still down 1.9 per cent over the week, however, and 4.8 per cent lower since the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East in mid-February.Industrial stocks saw the strongest gains after financials, helped by the easing geo-political tensions. In the industrial sector Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 1.9 per cent to $105.06, while Rockwell Automation advanced 1.2 per cent to $88. The S&P industrial index was up 0.7 per cent.Energy stocks lost some ground in the session following these developments in Libya. Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, was down 1.3 per cent to $85.93 while Rowan Companies fell 2.6 per cent to $40.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 11,858.52, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,643.67. The indices were down 1.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the week.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 6.5 per cent, but is still up 22 per cent over the week.In corporate news, General Mills announced that it was in negotiations to buy half of Yoplait, the yoghurt brand, sending shares in the food group up 1.4 per cent to $36.65.Elsewhere, Celera was up 34 per cent to $8.40 after Quest Diagnostics, a laboratory-testing group said it was buying the genetics group. Quest Diagnostics fell 0.8 per cent to $53.74.Nike lost ground after the company reported disappointing profits and slimmer margins due to higher commodity costs. Its shares tumbled 9.2 per cent to $77.59, a six-month low.The week on Wall Street was split into two halves. The first three days saw heavy selling as traders worried about the impact of the earthquake and resulting tsunami and potential nuclear disaster on Japan, the third-largest economy in the world.Negative news flow left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in three days and caused the Vix volatility index to spike up 46.4 per cent. Thursday and Friday saw a recovery as traders decided that the sell-off had been overdone and analysts calculated that the impact on the Japanese and the world economy would not be significant.Research from RBC Capital Markets found that technical indicators such as the number of US stocks trading below their 50 day moving average and the put-to-call ratio showed that the markets were at “deep ‘oversold’ levels often associated with market rebounds”.The markets were also lifted by bumper manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday, the best monthly reading since 1984, and news of a ceasefire in Libya on Friday. The sectors that suffered worst in the week were those directly affected by the Japanese disaster. Nuclear stocks plunged, with Uranium Energy falling 10.5 per cent and Uranium Resources declining 6.7 per cent.Insurance companies also lost ground on worries over how much they will be forced to pay out. Aflac was 8.8 per cent lower while Platinum Underwriters lost 4.1 per cent. The KBW property casualty index slid 2 per cent over the week.Technology stocks fell on worries over component shortages as Japan is one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors. Qualcomm fell 3.5 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2 per cent over the week.Material and industrial stocks had a mixed week, pulled sharply lower early in the week but rebounding strongly as sentiment improved. The S&P materials index ended up flat and the industrial index fell 1.7 per cent overall.

GE, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant, was one of the worst-performing stocks on the S&P, fell 1.6 per cent to $19.61.Related stocks also lost ground. 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $89.50 while Caterpillar was 1.3 per cent lower to $100.75. The S&P industrial index dropped 1.1 per cent.Some strategists argued that the industrial sell-off was surprising given that the sector might eventually benefit from the disaster. “In the medium term, some of these suppliers are going to be turned to the rebuilding effort,” said Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management.Elsewhere on Wall Street, insurers faced heavy selling on fears over the mounting costs of the natural disaster in Japan. Aflac was down 5.6 per cent to $50.89, making it the worst-performing stock on the S&P index, while Platinum Underwriters lost 1.2 per cent to $36.26. The KBW property casualty index was 1.3 per cent lower.Energy stocks fell away as oil prices softened on fears that a nuclear crisis would hamper global economic growth. Halliburton an oilfield services company, was down 2.3 per cent to $44.01 while ConocoPhillips was 1.1 per cent lower to $74.98. This left the S&P energy index 0.8 per cent softer, while the S&P 500 fell 1.1 per cent to 1,281.87 at the close, a six-week low.But the losses had been far more severe earlier in the session. The S&P tanked 2.1 per cent in the minutes after opening, but then edged higher through the rest of the session.The markets were given a boost following a statement by the Federal Reserve on monetary policy. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates steady, complete the current round of quantitative easing and said that the economy was on a “firmer footing”.“They came to the conclusion that there was no justification to rocking the
boat in the wake of ongoing development,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.The S&P 500 index has fallen 4.6 per cent in the past three weeks, with the feared effects of the disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. It is still up 1.9 per cent this year.Commentators trying to weigh up the impact of the disaster generally struck a more pessimistic tone than on Monday. Analysts at Citigroup estimated that the total damage to infrastructure could be as high as Y5,000bn-Y10,000bn.However, most added that the long-term prospects for US equities were positive. The “long-term real returns from stocks remain attractive, in our opinion, when compared with other assets, such as cash or Treasury bonds,” said strategists at PNC in a note.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.2 per cent to 11,855.42, a six-week low, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.3 per cent to 2,667.33.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, rose 13 per cent to a six-month high in a sign that traders foresee more turbulence in the pipelines.In the technology sector Apple was down 2.3 per cent to $345.43 while Yahoo fell 5.7 per cent to $16.33.Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker after Intel, tumbled 1.9 per cent to $33.90 after saying that the “substantial” damage to one of its plants in Japan from the earthquake will hurt sales in the first and second quarters.The S&P technology sector was 1.8 per cent lower with traders retreating from a sector that has climbed 35 per cent in the six months from early September.All those companies with exposure to nuclear energy were badly hit for the second consecutive session. Uranium Resources lost 9.7 per cent to $1.58, adding to the 24.7 per cent fall in the previous session.Renewable energy stocks added to gains in the previous session as traders sought to capitalise on any backlash against nuclear power. First Solar was up 8.2 per cent to $158.91 while Suntech Power was up 9.9 per cent to $9.10.MEMC Electronic Materials was down 3.1 per cent to $12.95 in the session, but the silicon maker is still up 8.1 per cent over the last two days."
226;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-10T21:43:33Z;Tech stocks drag down Wall St;;A pull-back in technology shares matched a broad decline in US stocks as confidence in the economy was hit by troubling data.The Nasdaq Composite index, weighted towards tech groups, dropped 1.8 per cent to 2,701.02, below its 50-day moving average, a key technical marker.Especially troubling was a report from China that Hewlett-Packard, the personal computer maker, was considering spinning off its PC business.HP said the unit was not for sale, and many analysts discounted the likelihood of such a move.But HP shares were off 1.4 per cent to $41.48, their lowest level of the year. Rival Dell was off 1.2 per cent to $15.24.The moves followed a report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday that supply of “tablet” PCs, like Apple’s iPad and Motorola’s Xoom, could outstrip demand by 36 per cent. Shares in Apple were off 1.7 per cent to $346.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2.5 per cent, adding to its 3 per cent drop on Wednesday, to below its own 50-day moving average.“Semiconductors are the best indicator, because they go into everything, from toasters to aeroplanes,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. “The shares always top out first and bottom out first.”Micron Technologies fell 3.8 per cent to $9.93 a share and NXP Semiconductor was down 4.6 per cent to $26.51 a share.NetApp, a provider of data storage, fell 6.1 per cent to $48.41 after it sold its external data storage unit to LSI, a rival. LSI rose 3.1 per cent to $6.32.The broader S&P 500 index was 1.9 per cent lower at the close, at 1,295.11. The Dow Jones Industrial average was also off 1.9 per cent to 11,984.61. Both were, like the Nasdaq index, below their 50-day moving averages.A negative jobless claims report was received as evidence emerged that rising oil prices were a threat to the economic recovery. The US labour department reported that 397,000 people filed unemployment claims last week, against a consensus forecast of 378,000.Trade data were also troubling. China reported a $7.3bn deficit as its exports, a key measure of global economic activity, declined. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit, widened to its highest level in five months in January. “To the extent that this surge reflects the strength of domestic demand . . . it isn’t necessarily a disaster,” said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics.“Nevertheless, it is a concern, particularly when we know that the latest surge in the cost of imported oil will drive the deficit above $50bn over the next few months.”Energy shares pulled back as US oil prices fell, though they remained above $100 a barrel.The S&P 500 sector fell 3.6 per cent, its worst one-day decline since last June. Chevron, the oil group, fell 3 per cent to $99.08, and rival ExxonMobil fell 3.6 per cent to $81.38.Materials and industrials groups were also hit hard. Caterpillar, the producer of industrial equipment, fell 3.9 per cent to $98.39 a share. Alcoa, the aluminium group, lost 3.1 per cent to $15.80.Shares in General Motors, the US carmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $31.42 after it said that Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, was leaving the company.“Now [GM has] talented people in all the right spots but they don’t seem to want to hang around,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. He said it was reassuring when Dan Ammann, the incoming CFO, said he planned to stay indefinitely.HCA, the hospital group that went public in a $3.8bn deal on Wednesday night, opened at $31.02, a 3.4 per cent rise from its issuing price of $30 a share.Starbucks, the coffee and beverage retailer, was the top gainer in the S&P 500, hitting an all-time high.Shares were up 9.9 per cent to $37.97 after it made a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, makers of the Keurig single-cup serving system, to allow it to use Starbucks brands. Shares in Green Mountain soared 41 per cent to $61.71 a share following the deal, a record high.Iron Mountain, which handles data storage for companies, saw its shares jump 5.2 per cent to $27.66 after Elliott Management, a hedge fund, nominated four members to the board.Elliott has argued that Iron Mountain could unlock value if it spun off its warehouses used for storing documents into a separate property company.
227;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-09T23:28:43Z;Wall Street falls amid turmoil in Libya;;Wall Street marked the two-year anniversary of the bull market with a whimper, edging lower on continuing concern over the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East and some disappointing earnings forecasts in the technology sector.Technology stocks were shaken after Finisar gave a worse than expected earnings forecast.The maker of fibre-optic cables fell 38.5 per cent to $24.61 after announcing that demand for its product in China was slowing and forecasting a quarterly profit of 31-35 cents a share, short of the expected 48 cents a share.The weak estimate prompted sharp losses in related stocks. JDS Uniphase, another maker of optical communications, was down 16.7 per cent to $21.14, while Oclaro declined 18.6 per cent to $13.53. The technology sector was down 1.4 per cent, one of the worst performing S&P subindexes.The optical communications sector has been volatile in the past few years. JDS Uniphase is up 827 per cent since March 2009. It has put on 46 per cent this year and is one of the biggest gainers on the S&P in the last six months.Finisar is up 999 per cent in two years, and was up 35 per cent this year before Wednesday’s losses.Also weighing on the wider technology sector was Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales, which issued a current-quarter earnings target slightly below estimates, citing slower-than-expected demand for chips used in personal computers. Shares were down 3.1 per cent to $34.74.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 1,320.02 as reports that an oil storage facility had been damaged in Libya led energy prices higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,208.55 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,750.03.Many strategists were asking whether the 1.8 per cent losses on the S&P since mid-February due to the elevated oil price was the start of the long-awaited correction in the US markets.“There will be a correction at some point, and this could be it if oil prices continue to march higher,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.Sharper losses on the S&P earlier in the day were pared, however, after economic data showing that US wholesale inventories had risen higher than expected in January.Inventories were up 1.1 per cent to a seasonally-adjusted $436.88bn, its highest since November 2008, which was ahead of the 0.9 per cent increase predicted by economists.Still, the higher oil price dampened risk appetite and weighed on material and industrial stocks on Wall Street.In the materials sector, Cliff Natural Resources was down 5.3 per cent to $91.56 while US Steel declined 3.4 per cent to $53.85.The S&P materials index was down 1.5 per cent.Industrial stocks fell 0.4 per cent with Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, falling 1.7 per cent to $102.36 and Deere, the tractor maker, down 1.9 per cent to $89.82.Elsewhere on Wall Street, fertiliser companies lost ground after Citigroup cut its investment ratings on PotashCorp and Mosaic to “hold” from “buy”. Citigroup’s note said it was “time to harvest profits” from the North American fertiliser companies.Shares in Potash were down 4.2 per cent at $55.82 while Mosaic was 3.3 per cent lower at $78.84.Also in the sector, CF Industries was 1.9 per cent softer at $126.52 while Monsanto declined 3.3 per cent to $69.39.Elsewhere Walgreen, the drugstore chain, agreed to sell its pharmacy benefit management unit to Catalyst Health Solutions for $525m. Shares in Walgreen were up 0.5 per cent to $42.61, while Catalyst Health Solutions added 18.6 per cent $52.80.Suntech Power Holdings, one of the world’s largest solar groups, was up 2.8 per cent to $9.25 after reporting strong fourth-quarter profits. The company earned $383.4m, or $2.02 per American depositary share, in the quarter, up from $44m, or 24 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, was up 1.8 per cent to $41.88 after Barclays raised its investment rating on the stock to “overweight” from “equal weight”.It is now exactly two years since the post-crisis nadir for the S&P 500 when it closed at 676.53. Since then the index is up 95 per cent, led by the autos and components sub-index, which is up 360 per cent from the bottom.S&P 500 stocks have been outperformed, however, by their smaller rivals in the past two years. Both the S&P 400 mid-cap index and the Russell 2000 small-cap index are up about 140 per cent.In the same time period, the FTSE-All World index has more than doubled, while emerging markets have gained some 145 per cent.
228;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-03-09T11:54:21Z;Orix to be Japan’s first renminbi bond issuer;;Orix, a financial services company, is poised to become the first Japanese company to issue so-called “dim sum” bonds in Hong Kong, adding to the smattering of foreign banks and companies tapping the nascent renminbi market.The company is expected to raise about Rmb400m ($61m) and is eyeing a maturity of two or three years, similar to other foreign issuers such as Caterpillar’s Rmb1bn bond issued in November. Marketing started on Wednesday.Although the amount is relatively small, the move is a first step for Orix, which wants to access a broader range of investors.It also wants to build a natural currency hedge for its renminbi exposure from its burgeoning mainland Chinese operations, which are based in Dalian.Issuing the bond should help raise its profile in the Chinese market.Offshore investors may be keen to gain access to renminbi-denominated bonds issued in Hong Kong in anticipation of a rise in the currency in the short to medium-term.However, foreign issuance in Hong Kong has been limited. This is because the currency cannot be freely converted and strict regulations control the flow of renminbi between mainland China and Hong Kong, making transfers for investment cumbersome at best. Moreover, most foreign issuance in the market since its creation in 2007 has come from banks and their Chinese subsidiaries.There has been only a handful of non-financial foreign issuances, including McDonald’s and Caterpillar.The amounts raised so far by each issuer have also been relatively small.HSBC China’s $293m bond issued in September 2009 was one of the biggest. Fumihito Gotoh, credit strategist at UBS in Tokyo, said that other Japanese companies were likely to be keen to follow Orix’s lead as they expanded in the country.“The size of Orix’s Hong Kong renminbi bonds is small, but with the expansion of Japanese companies’ operations in China, in my view, other Japanese are likely to follow Orix,” Mr Gotoh said.Japan’s largest banking group, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, issued Rmb1bn of bonds last year, but these were issued on the mainland by its China unit.Unlike many Japanese companies, which have traditionally relied on bank loans, Orix is a regular user of the debt markets to raise funds and has tapped the markets at least six times in the past six months, according to its website.Standard Chartered Bank is the co-ordinating bookrunner and joint lead manager with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Mizuho Securities Asia and Boom Securities.
229;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-02-19T00:54:10Z;McKessy to run SEC whistleblower office;;The Securities and Exchange Commission has named Sean McKessy to lead its new whistleblower office.Mr McKessy is a former SEC enforcement attorney who since 2000 has worked at Altria Group, AOL and Caterpillar in compliance-related positions. He is the first person to run the whistleblower office, which was created by the Dodd-Frank law in response to the agency’s failure to follow up on several tips that Bernard Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme.The SEC still needs to fill several other positions created by the financial regulation law, including heads for a credit rating agency unit, an office of an investor advocate and an office of women and minority inclusion.The whistleblower office is a high-profile slot within the agency. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said the agency receives over 1m tips a year.The SEC faces an April deadline to approve rules governing its handling of whistleblower complaints and craft procedures for granting rewards for tips that lead to successful enforcement actions. Several companies have said they are concerned the rule will undermine corporate compliance programs.Separately, Diego Ruiz resigned as executive director, where he oversaw the SEC’s finances, human resources and leasing. The SEC said he is returning to the private sector.
230;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-02-06T20:56:13Z;US recovery gets push in right direction;;"Demand for capital equipment in the US is starting to pick up strongly, manufacturers say, boosting confidence in the health of the economic recovery and raising hopes of a revival in American industry.Comments in recent days from many of the leading manufacturers of capital goods – including factory equipment, earthmovers and truck components – have suggested that while the fastest growth is still likely to be in emerging economies, they also expect significant growth in US sales.Emerson, the Missouri-based manufacturer of industrial equipment, told investors at the end of last week that it expected non-residential investment in the US to grow by 8-9 per cent this year; as much as the average for emerging markets.The company said it expected that the pressure to cut costs and expand capacity would encourage many industries to raise their capital spending this year – and companies that cut investment sharply during the downturn would be forced to catch up, replacing worn-out and obsolete equipment.David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, which makes aircraft and vehicle components and industrial equipment, told the Financial Times: “I do believe the US economy is more resilient now. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we’re on the comeback trail.”Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, is raising its capital spending budget from $1.7bn in 2010 to $3bn this year. More than half of the budget will be spent in the US to build capacity, going towards projects such as an excavator factory in Texas and a motor-grader facility in Arkansas.“If you look at our 2011 outlook, it’s still with the US, Europe and Japan well off historical peaks,” Ed Rapp, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, told the FT. “So, in this cycle, we have tried to get ahead of some of that, to put the investment in place now. That way when we get a more robust recovery in the developed world, we’ll be ready.”Eaton, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components, has said it expected its US sales to grow faster than its international sales this year. Sandy Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, told the FT that demand was “far stronger than people had thought it would be”.The Institute of Supply Management survey released last week pointed to the fastest rate of growth for manufacturing industry since 2004.Barry Knapp, strategist at Barclays Capital, said two factors contributed to the upturn in confidence since last summer: the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying programme and signs of a more business-friendly approach from Congress."
231;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-02-01T15:52:59Z;US manufacturing activity surges;;US manufacturing activity expanded last month at the fastest rate since 2004 on the strength of robust new orders and production, offering hope that the sector will add momentum to the economic recovery.Separately, weakness in the US real estate market continued to plague builders as construction spending plunged to its lowest level in 10 years in December.The Institute of Supply Management said on Tuesday its manufacturing index increased from a revised 58.5 per cent in December to 60.8 per cent in January. That was a sharper rise than Wall Street analysts expected and was the best reading since May 2004. Readings greater than 50 per cent signal expansion.“New orders and production continue to be strong,” said Norbert Ore, ISM chairman. “Global demand is driving commodity prices higher, particularly for energy, metals and chemicals.”Employment in the manufacturing sector also grew at the fastest rate since 2004.The US manufacturing sector has shown growth for the last year and a half, with activity accelerating steadily during the last six months. Fourteen of the 18 industries that ISM tracks grew in January.“This only confirms that the US is at the leading edge of the global pick-up in manufacturing,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank.Last week, US industrial groups 3M and DuPont raised their 2011 profit outlooks, reflecting growing confidence in the sector’s ability help the economy rebound. Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker, projected record profits in 2011 thanks to a surge in demand for mining equipment.However, rising commodity prices could be a drag on some manufacturers, as 64 per cent said they paid higher prices last month for items such as plastics, metals, rubber and food.Manufacturing executives said that the weak US dollar was driving up materials costs and having a negative effect on the purchase of components from overseas. Although they said they were becoming optimistic about the US economy and saw “unexpected strength” in foreign markets, a reluctance to hire is lingering.Meanwhile, the commerce department said that US construction spending fell 2.5 per cent from November to December to an adjusted annual rate of $787.9bn. That surprised economists who had projected an uptick and left spending off by 6.4 per cent from the same month a year ago.During 2010, total construction spending fell by 10.3 per cent from 2009 to $814.2bn.In December, private residential construction actually picked up but spending was held back by weak spending on commercial projects and a decline in public construction investment.
232;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-29T00:54:50Z;Weak earnings spark sell-off on Wall Street;;Wall Street saw its sharpest one-day fall since August as heavyweight companies such as Ford, Microsoft, Chevron and Amazon reported disappointing earnings results and investors digested news that the US economy had grown less than expected in the fourth quarter.The Dow Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rose to the technically significant numbers of 12,000 and 1,300 respectively in early trading, but these proved to be resistance levels for the markets as a sell-off soon followed.The S&P closed down 1.8 per cent to 1,276.35 as investors were given a good excuse to sell the 1,300 mark by the turmoil in Egypt, weak earnings reports and the worse-than-expected GDP numbers. The fall left the S&P down 0.6 per cent over the week.The Dow was down 1.4 per cent to 11,823.70, a 0.4 per cent loss over the week. This brought to an end an eight-week winning streak on the index. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.5 per cent to 2,687.03, losing 0.1 per cent over the past five days.Weak earnings news was one of the most significant factors weighing on the markets. Ford Motor posted fourth-quarter profits down 79 per cent due to a charge for debt payments, sending its shares down 13.4 per cent to $16.27.Operating profit for the carmaker came in at $1.3bn, or 30 cents a share, compared to analysts’ estimates of 48 cents a share.Despite the slow fourth-quarter, the company’s full-year results were the strongest the company had seen in more than a decade.The S&P auto index was down 10 per cent to 116.69 on the news, along with all the S&P sub-indexes. Rival carmaker General Motors lost 5.4 per cent to $36.60.Investors were particularly disappointed by Amazon after the world’s largest online retailer raised the possibility that operating margins could fall in the next quarter as the business expands. The stock was down 7.2 per cent to $171.14.The fourth-quarter results themselves were strong, however, showing an 8 per cent rise in profits and a 36 per cent jump in sales from last year, outperforming most conventional retailers.Microsoft lost ground as profits fell slightly and sales of the Windows and Windows Live division fell short of Wall Street estimates, raising concerns over the impact the iPad was having on its core operating system business.But strong sales in its Kinect motion-sensing game controller and Office software led revenue and sales in the technology company to beat expectations. The stock was down 3.9 per cent to $27.75.Chevron fell 1.5 per cent to $93.37 as its revenue fell short of analyst expectations.Turmoil in Egypt helped push the Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, up 23.7 per cent to 19.98. But not all shares lost ground due to the strife in North Africa. Fears that the Suez canal might be closed prompted shares in shipping companies to jump. Frontline, the world’s biggest oil tanker operator, was up 8.1 per cent to $27.21 on hopes that the extra 6,000 miles that oil would have to be transported to get from the Gulf to Europe or the US could prove lucrative for tanker companies.On top of the leading companies posting disappointing earnings figures, Wall Street was also weighed down by news that US gross domestic product had risen by slightly less than expected. Fourth-quarter GDP was up a respectable 3.2 per cent at an annualised rate but short of the 3.5 per cent expected by economists.But within the report there were promising numbers which helped limit the negative impact of the news. The final sales number, a useful measure of demand as it records GDP excluding the change in business inventories, was up by 7.1 per cent on an annualised basis. Consumer spending, which makes up most of US demand, was also up 4.1 per cent.The week on Wall Street saw mixed earnings results from major industry players which failed to give the markets enough momentum to break through the key resistance levels. Each time the S&P hit 1,300 or the Dow reached 12,000 stocks fell back almost immediately. Halliburton saw one of the stronger results, announcing that its fourth-quarter earnings had more than doubled. Its shares were up 11 per cent to $43.88 over the week.Caterpillar the world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment also posted strong results sending the stock up 3.2 per cent to $95.68 per cent on the week.Boeing and Procter & Gamble, on the other hand posted weak results that sent shares down 3.4 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively over the week.
233;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:32:33+0000;Wall Street weighed down by jobless data;;Soaring profit for Caterpillar lifted industrials but sentiment for US stocks was tempered as other US bellwethers posted weaker results and there was a surprise jump in unemployment claims.The world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment reported strong fourth-quarter profit as high metal prices sparked greater demand for digging equipment.The heavy machinery manufacturer also forecast that 2011 would be its most profitable year on record.Caterpillar had profit of $968m or $1.47 a share, up from $232m or 36 cents a share from the period a year earlier and ahead of the $1.27 estimated by analysts.Its stock climbed 0.9 per cent to $96.63 while the S&P industrials index added 0.2 per cent to 315.69.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index reached the landmark 1,300-point level three times over the session, a peak last reached in August 2008 before the financial crisis.But the US benchmark failed to maintain the momentum throughout the day, closing just short at 1299.54, a gain of 0.2 per cent on the session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to tip over the 12,000 mark for the second day in a row but again failed to maintain progress, rising less than 0.1 per cent to 11,989.90. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent to 2,755.28.The indices were weighed on by news that the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims in the US had increased by 51,000 to 454,000 last week.This jump was unexpected with economists forecasting 405,000 claims. The number of continuing claims was also up, rising by 94,000 in the week to 3.99m.Also disappointing the markets were figures showing that durable goods orders had fallen by 2.5 per cent in December, well short of the 1.5 per cent rise in orders forecast by economists.“This is a surprise. We expected a rebound in aircraft orders to lead the way but they dropped by $5bn,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.But some commentators argued that the figures were not as bad as they looked. The jobless claims data were skewed by snow in some southern states last week which prevented people from filing claims and created a backlog.But researchers at Goldman Sachs said: “The durable goods report looked awful at first glance but improves considerably on inspection,” noting that, with transportation figures removed from the durable good orders, the index actually went up by 0.5 per cent.Separate economic data showed that pending home sales was up 2 per cent for December, a positive signal indicating recovery in the US housing market.Sentiment was also supported by confirmation from the US Federal Reserve in the previous session that it would continue with its $600bn bond purchase programme to aid the economy.The consumer goods sector saw some of the strongest losses of the session after two industry bellwethers, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, reported disappointing earnings figures.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods maker, reported that second-quarter profit had fallen by 28 per cent and its margins had declined due to higher commodity costs.Sales, however, were up slightly in the quarter and the fall in profit was exaggerated due to one-off gains last year in discontinued operations. But investors took the news negatively with its shares falling 2.9 per cent to $64.18.Colgate-Palmolive, which competes with P&G in toothpaste and other products, was down 3.3 per cent to $77.39 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings down 1.1 per cent due to higher materials costs and lower-than-expected revenue.The S&P consumer staples index was down 0.9 per cent to 302.67.AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, was down 2.1 per cent to $28.13 in spite of posting earnings in line with expectations.

234;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-27T22:52:13Z;Caterpillar forecasts record profits in 2011;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, expects to make record profits this year as rising commodity prices fuel a surge in demand for mining equipment in emerging markets and the construction industry in developed economies replaces ageing equipment.The industrial bellwether and Dow component said on Thursday it anticipated revenues in 2011 would exceed $50bn, compared to $42.6bn last year, while net profits would hit a record of “near $6 per share”, up from $4.15 per share in 2010.The company said it would allot $3bn to capital spending this year – almost twice last year’s capex budget of $1.7bn – with more than half of the spending in the US, as Caterpillar builds capacity.In China, where the company is also ramping up capacity, Caterpillar said it would produce 60 per cent more excavators in the country this year than in 2010 and would raise excavator production to 24,000 units by 2013, a fourfold increase from last year.“These investments in our future will add cost in the short term but are essential to be prepared for continued growth as the economic environment improves,” said Doug Oberhelman, chief executive.Mike DeWalt, head of investor relations, said Caterpillar had become “somewhat more positive” in recent months about sales in developed economies and predicted that as the economy recovered, customers would start to replace older machines.“Customer fleets have deteriorated over the past few years,” he said. “End-users in the US, Europe and Japan cut their machine purchases more than construction activity declined, particularly in 2008 and 2009.”Caterpillar made the projections as it unveiled quarterly earnings that easily beat Wall Street’s expectations. The company made a net profit of $968m or $1.47 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $232m or 36 cents per share in the same period a year earlier and above analysts’ average forecasts of $1.27 per share.Sales and revenues were $12.8bn, up from $7.9bn a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street expectations of $11.6bn.The results demonstrate how the boom in commodity prices is feeding into equipment-makers’ performance. Caterpillar’s earnings came after Komatsu, the Japanese heavy-equipment maker that is its main global rival, raised its profits outlook on Thursday and reported that earnings in the three months to December more than tripled from the prior year, on strong demand for construction and mining equipment in China and Indonesia.Caterpillar said that excluding acquisitions, it had hired back 19,000 workers of the roughly 37,000 positions it cut during the economic downturn. It said 7,500 of the new workers were hired in the US, representing a 15 per cent increase in its US workforce. Caterpillar shares were up 0.8 per cent at $96.51 in afternoon trade.Separately, Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton Corp, the Ohio-based manufacturer of industrial equipment and components, said he thought the danger of a “double-dip” downturn in the US economy was “very distant”, as his company reported strong results for last year and said earnings could grow by up to 38 per cent this year. Eaton’s pre-tax profits of $1.04bn for 2010 were more than triple their 2009 level, on revenues up 19 per cent at $13.7bn. Earnings per share more than doubled, to $5.46 in 2010 from $2.27 the previous year.The company raised its quarterly dividend by 17 per cent to 68 cents for the first quarter of 2011, which Mr Cutler said was “an indicator of our fundamental confidence and the visibility in our markets, and a sign that Eaton’s strategy is really working”.

DuPont, 3M and General Electric, along with aluminium maker Alcoa and US Steel, all saw growth in both revenues and earnings during 2010. Dow Chemical is expected to follow suit when it reports next week, and even bulldozer maker Caterpillar, which jettisoned more than 20,000 workers two years ago, has admitted haste and taken some back as orders improve.Economic pundits will be pleased. Growth in companies that make stuff – unlike financial institutions which mainly operate on the secondary market – is a sign the real economy is on track. Some have even begun to think beyond the survival mode of the last two years. DuPont’s $5.8bn purchase of Danisco, the Danish food ingredients group, even though it could cut next year’s earnings by one-tenth, is a welcome return to long-term planning.Still, investors smitten with the latest financial results should temper their exuberance. The sector’s continued growth could be thwarted by rising input and particularly energy expenses, a significant component of industrials’ cost base. About one-third of the cost of making aluminium and one-fifth the cost of making steel is directly linked to energy. Already, the cost of most metals as well as oil, electricity, and polypropylene – the key ingredient in many plastics – has risen in the last 12 months while the price of natural gas is creeping back from its 2009 nadir.If the accelerating economy pushes up energy and input prices further, the ability of industrial companies to pass on the higher cost to customers will be tested. These customers proved more than willing to pull back during the global downturn. Chief executives will be reluctant to test them again so soon.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
236;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-26T09:06:38Z;Commodities daily: Digging into miners’ results;Investors seek signs of rising costs eating into profits;"The world’s diversified miners are about to start their results reporting season: they will announce billions of dollars in profits and dividends as the price of key commodities, particularly iron ore, coal and copper, soar.But savvy investors will look beyond the windfall for signs of a corrosive increase in costs inflation, similar to that seen in 2007-08, which could dent profitability in the future.The industry experienced the last bout of cost inflation about three years ago. As such, late 2007 and 2008 was a bittersweet time for the world’s largest miners. On the one hand, they were enjoying, as nowadays, the benefit of booming prices for metals and minerals; on the other, rising investment to boost supply led to escalating input costs for explosives, drills and other equipment, which cut into their profits.The situation of 2007-08 appears to reflect the outlook for the industry today.BHP Billiton, the world’s largest diversified miner by market capitalisation, offered a warning to investors when last week it said: “Industry-wide cost pressure is being experienced across a broad range of projects and reflects stronger producer currencies, particularly in Australia, and underlying inflation on raw material and labour costs.”The world’s largest miner was updating on its production results for the second half of the year, so the reference to cost inflation was made only in passing. Investors should expect more of the same from the big miners when they report results in February.The season starts on February 8 with Swiss-based Xstrata, followed by Anglo-Australian and Rio Tinto on February 10; BHP Billiton on February 16; Anglo American on February 18 and finally Vale of Brazil on February 24.The surge in cost comes as the world’s five largest diversified miners by market capitalisation – BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Anglo American – plan to boost their investment significantly.The mining sector is likely to boost its investment to about $115bn- $120bn in 2011, above the previous record of $110bn. In the 15 years before the start of the commodities “super-cycle” in 2003, miners spent on average less than $40bn a year.For the past six months, senior mining executives have downplayed the risk of a new bout of cost inflation similar to 2007-08. But some privately now concede that costs are rising faster than expected and capital expenditures will need to follow. Two areas are of particular concern to executives: rising costs for iron ore projects in Australia and an overheated mining industry in Latin America, particularly for copper projects.Of course, while rising costs and the need for deeper investment is a problem for the miners, it is also a windfall for the mining services companies. Large companies in the sector include Caterpillar, which recently bought rival Bucyrus for nearly $9bn, and Joy Global, both listed in New York. Besides, explosive companies such as Orica are also likely to benefit. Contractors such as Betchel and Fluor of the US, Leighton of Australia, Weir Minerals, part of London-listed Weir Group, and Hatch of Canada, among others, will also gain"

Mr Obama stressed that China offered enormous opportunities for the US, saying: “We want to sell you planes, we want to sell you cars, we want to sell you software.”Mr Obama said China’s success was “a tribute to the Chinese people” but also thanks “to decades of stability in Asia made possible by America’s forward presence in the region” and a global trading system championed by the US.Mr Hu’s arrival in Washington coincides with a low in bilateral relations, with the two sides squaring off over diplomatic, economic and business issues.Appearing at his first extended press conference in the west, Mr Hu insisted Beijing wanted to work closely with the US on global issues but said that ties should be based on “mutual respect”.“China is always committed to the promotion and protection of human rights,” he said.The pair, along with cabinet-level officials, held three hours of face-to-face talks following a welcoming ceremony. They interrupted their talks to sit together with business leaders from both countries to discuss commercial ties.Jeff Immelt, chief executive of GE, the largest US industrial group, said Mr Hu had promised that US companies that were “considered to be part of the fabric” in China would be able to bid for government contracts.He added: “We’re not looking for a handout; we just want to be able to compete toe-to-toe with everybody else.”Mr Obama said he wanted to move past the relationship’s “old stereotypes” according to which China only exported cheap goods to the US, stealing jobs along the way by keeping wages low. “The relationship is much more complex than that,” Mr Obama said.Tensions were evident elsewhere, with three congressional leaders declining to attend the state dinner at the White House on Wednesday evening. In a television interview, Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, called Mr Hu a “dictator”.China also said it would include provincial and local administrations along with the central government in a revised offer it will make this year to join the global regime for government procurement. Central government procurement alone is worth $88bn, Beijing says.The White House said that China had agreed to allocate government funding to buy legal software and strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property rights on the internet and in libraries.Additional reporting by Daniel Dombey"
238;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-19T18:16:16Z;Export orders worth $45bn signed;;"US and Chinese officials touted a $45bn package of export deals on Wednesday to coincide with the state visit of Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, but the largest contract was in fact a reiteration of a previously announced order.US companies have been critical of China in the past 12 months, pressing the administration of Barack Obama to toughen defence of their intellectual property rights and their ability to access lucrative Chinese government procurement contracts.To smooth the waters, the Chinese president met the chief executives of high-
profile US companies on Wednesday such as Jeff Immelt of General Electric, Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs.The export package includes a $19bn order for Boeing aircraft, 70 extra contracts involving 12 US states worth $25bn and a series of investment deals. Combined, the deals will support about 235,000 US jobs, the White House said.Still, in spite of the large headline numbers many of the deals represent already announced contracts or memorandums of understanding that forecast, rather than guarantee, potential revenues and jobs.The eye-catching Boeing deal ratifies aircraft sales agreed between 2007 and 2010 to several of the country’s largest airlines, including Air China, China Southern and Xiamen Airlines.But the deals do have some significance as a political gesture. The aircraft deal, for example, underlines the importance of China to US manufacturers such as Boeing, which estimates the Chinese market will require 4,330 new aircraft worth more than $480bn over 20 years.●A Chinese trade delegation will sign a deal on Thursday in Chicago to buy an unspecified amount of US soyabeans, according to the US Soybean Export Council.The companies participating in the signing are China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp, Sinograin Oils, Jilin Grain Group, Bunge Ltd, Chinatex Grains and Oils and the Yihai Kerry Group, the council, a producer-funded marketing group, said."
239;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-18T21:33:30Z;Gains in materials and industrials lift Wall St;;Shares in Apple lost ground after Steve Jobs, chief executive officer, announced that he would be taking a medical leave of absence.The world’s second most valuable company fell 2.3 per cent to $340.65, helping to lead the S&P technology index down 0.5 per cent to 461.47.Mr Jobs said in an e-mail to employees on Monday, when the markets were closed for Martin Luther King Day, that the Apple board had granted him medical leave so he could focus on his health.He did not specify what medical issue has prompted his departure, but it has raised fears that his pancreatic cancer has returned.The last time Mr Jobs said he was going on a leave of absence due to health concerns back in early 2009, shares in Apple fell 2.7 per cent over the day, recovering from much sharper losses in early trading. Shares in Apple were down by as much a 6.5 per cent in early trading, but towards the end of the session losses were pared as investors turned their focus towards first quarter earnings figures. Apple was expected to report earnings of $5.39 a share, well ahead of the $4.80 per share predicted by Apple’s own guidance issued in October.IBM closed up 0.4 per cent to $150.65 on expectations that it would also post strong results after the market close. IBM was expected to post a 14 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to $4.08.Financial stocks slid after Citigroup posted below-forecast quarterly earnings on Tuesday morning.The third-largest US bank reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.31bn, or 4 cents a share, which was lower than many analysts had forecast due to $1.1bn in charges related to tightening of the bank’s credit spreads.The earnings were a dramatic improvement from the same period a year ago when the bank lost $7.6bn, or 33 cents a share, but analysts polled by FactSet Research had forecast earnings of 8 cents a share.Shares in Citigroup fell 6.4 per cent to $4.80, dragging on the wider financial sector. The S&P financials index was down 0.8 per cent to 223.68 with Bank of America also losing ground, falling 1.6 per cent to $15.Citigroup’s disappointing numbers follow strong results from JPMorgan Chase on Friday, which raised hopes that all the major US banks would see blockbuster fourth-quarter results. JPMorgan reported net income of $1.12 a share, a 48 per cent increase on the same quarter last year and in excess of analysts’ forecasts of $1 a share. JPMorgan was down 0.4 per cent to $44.75.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Goldman Sachs fell 0.2 per cent to $174.68, recovering from sharper losses earlier in the session following news over the weekend that the bank had scrapped an offer to its wealthy clients in the US to participate in a $1.5bn investment in Facebook.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent at 1,295.02, as losses from financial and technology stocks were pared by gains in the materials and industrial sectors after positive manufacturing data from the New York region. The Empire State index, which measures the pace of manufacturing activity in the New York-area, increased to 11.92 in January, beating December’s 9.89 and close to the median forecast of 12.50.The index is watched by investors for providing some indication of moves in the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index, to be released later this week, and the ISM manufacturing index. “While not one of the most reliable indicators on a month-by-month basis, today’s report is nonetheless another positive signal regarding manufacturing activity,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,837.93. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.4 per cent to 2,765.85.In other economic data, the National Association of Home Builders said its housing market index remained flat, which was broadly in line with economists’ expectations.In the materials sector, Allegheny Technologies, the speciality metal manufacturer, rose 5.4 per cent to $60.97 while AK Steel Holding was up 0.5 to $14.93. The S&P materials index was up 0.6 per cent to 242.87.In the industrial sector, Caterpillar, the manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 2.8 per cent to $96.23 while the S&P industrials index was up 0.6 per cent to 311.88.Boeing helped to lead the industrial index higher, rising 3.4 per cent to $72.47.
240;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-14T05:02:49Z;Geithner starts talks on tax overhaul;;The Obama administration will take its first step on Friday towards a possible overhaul of the US corporate tax system, as senior Treasury officials meet top business executives to discuss lowering rates and removing tax breaks.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, will lead talks with a group of 18 chief financial officers – from ExxonMobil and Microsoft to Coca-Cola and Walt Disney – in the latest sign of gathering momentum behind corporate tax reform.If it advances, a transformation of the way the US taxes business could emerge as one area in which the White House and the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives may reach agreement before the 2012 presidential election.But the prospects for corporate tax reform are by no means certain, and one Obama administration official cautioned that the meeting was only exploratory, to gather ideas. It will be followed by further encounters with academics, labour leaders and other stakeholders, and for now, the administration is not presenting or drafting its own proposal for corporate tax reform.Still, the Treasury gathering comes as congressional leaders are also examining the issue for possible legislative action.Dave Camp, the new Republican chairman of the House ways and means committee, on Thursday scheduled for January 20 what he described as the first in a series of tax reform hearings, including a focus on “the cost of a corporate tax system that is increasingly out of step with the world”. A Democratic aide on the Senate finance committee, chaired by Max Baucus, this week said to expect a “robust” set of hearings on tax reform in the upper chamber as well.“I cannot convey to you how much things have changed in the last few months,” said Dean Zerbe, former Republican staffer on the Senate finance committee and managing director of Alliantgroup. He said corporate tax reform was only recently seen as a “fool’s errand” but now appeared to be “real and viable”.The US has a corporate tax rate of 35 per cent, although many companies – particularly large multinationals – pay less tax because they benefit from a myriad of special deductions and exemptions in the code.Policymakers and business leaders believe the high headline tax rate deters investment in the US, making America less competitive, while the complexity of the tax system leads to inefficient business decisions.A plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 28 per cent, while eliminating many loopholes, and moving the US to a territorial system that would no longer tax profits generated overseas, was proposed last month by the national commission on fiscal responsibility, an 18-member panel charged with recommending ways to cut the deficit.That was never put to a vote in Congress, but the administration could work from that basic template.Significant obstacles to corporate tax reform still exist, and the path to any deal is expected to be lengthy and fraught.The administration has said it would only like to see reform if it is “revenue neutral”, or doesn’t add to deficits. This could mean curtailing many tax deductions that businesses consider to be extremely precious, and may not be willing to give up even in exchange for lower rates.Furthermore, business is likely to be wary of any attempts to consider corporate tax reform at the same time as individual tax reform, for fear that they could end up paying for the preservation of certain popular individual tax breaks, such as the mortgage interest deduction.Other companies that will be represented at Friday’s meeting include Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, Caterpillar, United Technologies, Wal-Mart, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Cisco and Eli Lilly. On the Treasury side, Neal Wolin, deputy treasury secretary, and Michael Mundaca, assistant secretary for tax policy, will attend along with Mr Geithner, who is not expected to stay for the duration of the talks.
241;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-13T00:33:53Z;Illinois business angered by tax increase;;"Some of the world’s biggest businesses reacted angrily after the Illinois legislature approved tax increases of up to 67 per cent, warning that the measure would harm investment and job-creation in the recession-hit state.Proponents of Wednesday’s increases – a jump in the personal income tax rate from 3 per cent to 5 per cent and a rise in business income taxes from 7.3 per cent to 9.5 per cent– say they will help the state tackle a $15bn budget deficit, unfunded pension liabilities of at least $80bn, and more than $8bn of unpaid bills to educational institutions and social welfare providers.However, Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, said the legislation was “a step in the wrong direction” and said it “would make it more
difficult for Caterpillar to compete in today’s global economy”. The company, which has its headquarters in Peoria in downstate Illinois, employs 23,000 people in the state.CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, said the new tax rates “will negatively impact jobs and business opportunities for Illinois residents and stifle economic growth in our state”. The Chicago-based group noted that the legislation “will give Illinois one of the highest corporate tax rates in the US”.“The only businesses that will benefit are the moving companies that will be helping many of my members move out of this state,” said Gregory Baise, head of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association.As well as the tax increases, business is also upset over a clause in the legislation to eliminate companies’ ability to carry net losses over from one financial year to the next. “That means that even companies that have been running at a loss could be paying tax if they have income in the current year – that’s something they weren’t planning on,” said Jim Kane, managing director at True Partners Consulting, the tax consultancy.Neighbouring Wisconsin signalled it wanted to take advantage of business animosity to the taxes. “Years ago, Wisconsin had a tourism campaign targeted to Illinois with the motto, ‘Escape to Wisconsin’,” said Scott Walker, the governor. “Today we renew that call to Illinois businesses, ‘Escape to Wisconsin’. You are welcome here.”The tax increase received a muted welcome in the bond markets. In the derivatives market, the cost of default protection on Illinois bonds fell, market sources said, an indication that the perceived risk of lending to Illinois is less.“By no means is Illinois ‘fixed’,” said Matt Fabian, managing director at Municipal Market Advisors. “But they have taken a positive step for a state that has taken no positive steps for the last two years.”State and local governments in the US are in the spotlight amid concerns that years of fiscal mismanagement laid bare by the recession could lead to a spike in defaults.The tax proposal initially called for combined business taxes to rise to 10.9 per cent, the highest of any state, a 75 per cent increase in the personal income tax rate to 5.25 per cent and a $1-per-packet rise in cigarette taxes.It passed only after the increases were moderated, the new cigarette tax was scrapped and spending limits were added. The proposal passed the Illinois House by 60 votes to 57 and the Senate by 30 votes to 29. No Republicans voted for the measure, arguing that the state needed to do more to cut its spending.Democrats countered that lower spending would not be enough to solve the state’s financial woes. “Illinois is in crisis, absolute financial crisis, and there is no way we can dig ourselves out of the crisis without increased revenues,” said Barbara Flynn Currie, House majority leader. “There is no way we can cut our way out of the deficit we face.”Republicans were unmoved. “You may think you’re stabilising the budget, but you’re not,” said Matt Murphy, a senator from Palatine, in the Chicago suburbs. “You’re bankrupting our state.”During the debate, House Democrats twice failed to win support for a measure to borrow an additional $8.75bn to help pay overdue bills."
242;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-12T02:10:04Z;US to match Chinese terms for train order;;The US is going to match Chinese terms with cut-price export financing for the first time to help General Electric win an order for 150 diesel-electric locomotives from Pakistan.With Hu Jintao, China’s president, due in Washington next week, the move suggests Barack Obama, US president, will continue to push China to follow global standards on trade.“We’d rather that you play by the rules, but if you’re not going to play by the rules, then we’ll meet you,” Fred Hochberg, chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, told the Financial Times.Ex-Im Bank hopes its willingness to match China Eximbank will encourage US exporters to fight for contracts even when China’s financing terms seem unbeatable. It will finance $437m of the $477m deal, which is awaiting approval by a Pakistani court, but it will have to go against international rules to match the Chinese offer.The rules, managed by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, limit the term of export credits to 10 years.China, which is not a signatory to the OECD agreement, offered to finance locomotives for Pakistan over 12 years.A formula set by the OECD would require a minimum fee of about 21 per cent for a 12-year export credit to Pakistan. The fee, which reflects credit risk, can be paid up front or over the life of the loan. It comes on top of interest, set as the medium-term Treasury yield plus 100 basis points.China Eximbank proposed a fee of about 8 per cent and the US Ex-Im Bank agreed to match it. Mr Hochberg said he could act in this case because unusually, there was evidence of the Chinese offer.Pakistan’s dollar bonds maturing in 2017 were yielding 10 per cent on Tuesday, suggesting Ex-Im’s terms are aggressive, but Mr Hochberg said he was confident that the deal would have no cost to the US taxpayer.The US has two big high-technology makers of diesel electric locomotives in GE and Electro-Motive Diesel, a subsidiary of Caterpillar, but Chinese companies are competing aggressively in international markets.The GE locomotives would be built in Erie, Pennsylvania, making them an example of how Mr Obama would like to use exports to help the US recovery.“Ex-Im Bank’s financing creates a level playing field for US companies to compete and, ultimately, lays the foundation to sustain existing and create new US high-tech manufacturing jobs,” GE said.
243;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2011-01-06T20:33:08Z;America: Riveting prospects;US industry is retraining its sights on manufacturing and exports;"At the Middle River Aircraft Systems plant on the unglamorous outskirts of Baltimore, the past, present and future of American industry are on display.In the second world war, the factory was a powerhouse of the industrial strength that brought victory to the Allies, producing thousands of B-26 Marauder bombers for the US Air Force. It claims to have inspired the legend of Rosie the Riveter, the emblematic figure representing millions of women drawn into the manufacturing workforce during the war.Now owned by General Electric, the plant is also celebrating more recent success, hiring 200 workers to make thrust reversers – aircraft brakes – for Boeing’s latest version of the jumbo jet, the 747-8. It has also won a contract to supply components for the Comac C919, the new Chinese airliner intended to take on Airbus and Boeing.Sagar Patel, the president of GE’s aircraft parts business, says the plant has faced tough conditions but “we have to have the vision to weather those economic challenges”.In a tentative US recovery, the Middle River plant is a small portent of a possible brighter future, with firmer foundations than the mortgage-fuelled consumer spree of the 2000s.Battered by the economic collapse triggered by the financial and property sectors, American business and political leaders are hoping to rebuild growth and employment based less on consumption, construction, debt and imports, and more on production, manufacturing, earnings and exports. An industrial revival in the US could also help correct the international imbalances that underlie global economic instability.However, the views of the heads of some of America’s largest manufacturers suggest there are deep structural reasons why rebuilding US production will be long and difficult.With unemployment at 9.8 per cent and rising, the dream of restoring US industrial greatness – what Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, has called “American renewal”– has widespread appeal. In a speech last year, Mr Immelt criticised the assumption that “America could go from a technology-based, export-oriented powerhouse to a services-led, consumption-based economy, and somehow still expect to prosper.” He added: “We need to make products here, and have the self-confidence to sell them around the world.”Other chief executives share that dream. Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, the largest US chemicals group, tells the Financial Times: “What this government, or any government in the United States, needs to do is work on an advanced manufacturing sector …What you have to do is create competitiveness on a global basis for your US-based companies.” He has even written a book on the subject, Make it in America: the Case for Re-Inventing the Economy, published next week.President Barack Obama has bought into the idea, setting a target of doubling US exports in the next five years that will require a vigorous revival in manufacturing. He also appointed an advisory export council well-stocked with manufacturers and chaired by Jim McNerny, the chief executive of Boeing.The world certainly offers opportunities, with rapid growth in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil creating increased demand for everything from drinks cans to airliners.As Mr Liveris puts it, the world is entering a “golden age” for manufacturing, and American companies are seeing some of the benefit. Eaton, which makes industrial equipment and parts for vehicles and aircraft, and Caterpillar, which makes earthmovers, are just two examples of groups that have been reporting strong growth in emerging market demand. The latest trade figures show US exports for 2010 to October were 15 per cent higher in real terms than in the equivalent period of 2009; for the first time, emerging economies will last year have taken more than half of US exports.However, other countries’ shipments to the US have been rising equally fast. The International Monetary Fund believes that the US current account deficit widened last year, while Japan and Germany, which are both running surpluses, moved deeper into the black. Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, says that while the US is similar to other developed economies in its propensity to import, it has been uniquely poor at exporting manufactured goods.The traditional culprit in any story about US export failure is the overvalued dollar, which has been an international hot topic again recently as tensions flared over China’s intervention to hold down the renminbi.It is true that the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency of choice has tended to support its value, hurting US exporters. But the National Association of Manufacturers, a business group, argues that the dollar is now about 10 per cent below its trade-weighted average in real terms over the past four decades, suggesting that the exchange rate is not now the most pressing issue. The problems for US manufacturing, industry executives argue, have very deep roots.The first is that with the world’s largest national market as their home base, American businesses are simply unused to selling internationally. Only about 1 per cent of US companies export, according to the commerce department, fewer than in any other developed economy. Of those, 58 per cent sell to only one other country. Frank Vargo of the NAM says: “We are not a robust exporter and we never have been.”Second, the US has been less active than other countries in signing agreements to facilitate international trade. There are 262 trade agreements around the world and a further 100 under negotiation, according to the US Chamber of Commerce, but the US has signed only 17 and is involved in just one current set of talks. US businesses have welcomed the latest trade deal, with South Korea, but argued that successive administrations should have moved much faster to sign such pacts.American exports are particularly severely affected by tariff barriers; in the World Economic Forum’s ranking of exporting countries by “tariffs faced”, the US ranks eighth highest out of 121.A third problem for US manufacturers is an insufficiently skilled and educated workforce. Mr McNerny of Boeing warns that in spite of high unemployment, his company and others are starting to run up against skills shortages that “threaten to spiral us into a vicious circle” of shrinking capacity. “If we allow our industrial base to fall into disrepair, opportunities for good jobs will dwindle …we will have to close production lines,” he said last month. “At the same time, without a strong pipeline of future talent, companies won’t have the capacity to pursue new opportunities, create the next innovation in aerospace or develop new market segments, which will cause the US industrial base to deteriorate further.”Fourth, as emerging economies acquire modern facilities and skills, they are increasingly capable of replacing production in US and other developed countries. Louis Chênevert, the chief executive of United Technologies, manufacturer of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis lifts, says that by 2013 he plans to source 40 per cent of the company’s components from low-cost economies such as Poland, Mexico and China, up from 15 per cent in 2001.The most fundamental issue, however, is that large US companies generally want to manufacture in the markets where they sell. The US is the world’s largest outward investor and American companies earn much more from their foreign operations than from exports. The revenues of US-owned foreign affiliates were about $5,000bn in 2008, according to the Chamber of Commerce – almost three times the value of US exports of goods and services.When American manufacturers look at emerging economies, they often decide it would be better to build plants close to the market. That is not solely, or even primarily, for reasons of cost but also to help them understand local needs, improve logistics, protect against currency volatility, meet local regulations and improve relations with governments that are often their largest customers.Sandy Cutler, the chief executive of Eaton, suggests the “model has changed” for US manufacturers. “That was a 1950s view of the world: that you could do all the manufacture in one area, and the rest of the world wouldn’t be competitive, so you’d ship your products there,” he says. “[Now] the world has developed. Both emerging and other developed nations are quite sophisticated today, so we need to be there competing.”For Martin Richenhagen, chief executive of Agco, the Georgia-based manufacturer of Massey Ferguson and other agricultural equipment, Mr Obama’s plan to double exports is “another proof that the American government doesn’t understand business”. He explains: “Most of the big US companies don’t export: they produce outside the US …We export some. But most of the product we sell in Brazil is built in Brazil. Most of the product we sell in Europe is built in Europe.”Even Mr Immelt says: “There is no better marketing than a factory with jobs,” adding that eventually he expects GE’s sales in China to be “completely localised”. Clean energy technology, for example, is one of GE’s great hopes for future growth. Last September it announced a plan for its Chinese wind turbine joint venture to build a factory in Jiangsu province to produce offshore turbines, the most technically challenging part of the wind market.In order to offset all those inhibiting factors, the scale of currency adjustment needed would probably be prohibitively damaging to the rest of the economy. Mr Cutler of Eaton argues that sales in world markets will create good jobs in the US, even if production is overseas.“Having our headquarters in the US means that many of the supervisory jobs for global co-ordination, global R&D investment, the management of the company, are here,” he says. “And that means that we’re not only hiring people in our own company, but we have a multiplier effect on the economy in terms of the consultants we hire, our outside accountants [and] outside attorneys.”Mary Andringa, another member of the president’s export council, makes the case that international operations help companies export from their US plants. She heads Vermeer, an Iowa-based manufacturer of agricultural and earthmoving equipment, which assembles products in its international markets but ships 25-50 per cent of the components from its factories in the US. “It doesn’t have to be either/or; it can be both,” she says.Nevertheless, even recovering the 2m manufacturing jobs lost during the recession looks like a tall order. GE’s Middle River aircraft parts plant employs just 1,000 even after the latest hirings, compared with a peak of 53,000 in the days of Rosie the Riveter. Mr Immelt and Mr Liveris advocate government support for a few “strategic” industries, such as clean energy, to stimulate innovation and help develop skills. But with the Republicans now in control of the House of Representatives, such initiatives can be expected to drop off the agenda.Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University predicts that US manufacturing will be boosted, and global imbalances will shrink, as China and India invest in the infrastructure they need. Rising costs in China and other emerging economies will also help the competitive position of US industry.But those forces could take a long time to work through. As Mr Vargo at the NAM puts it: “The future is not yet written; it is not black. But it could be disappointing.”Additional reporting by Jeremy LemerEconomists vs industrialists: the backlash against the factory ‘fetish’American factory output is higher than it has ever been, and the country is still the world’s largest manufacturer, but the sector’s share of gross domestic product has been steadily shrinking.In the early 1950s it was almost 30 per cent, roughly the same as that of China today. It is now about 11 per cent, down from 15 per cent in 1998.Opinions about that decline typically set economists against industrialists. For industry leaders, manufacturing matters more than other sectors because of its dominance of international trade, and because it offers higher wages than many service sectors such as retail and catering.“No country as economically mature, large and diverse as America can prosper with only 8 per cent of workers in the manufacturing sector, which is what our number is today,” says Leo Hindery, the former chief executive of AT&T Broadband, now at the New America Foundation, a centrist think-tank.“It needs to be at least 20 per cent and more like 25 per cent. Otherwise only repeated consumer-credit driven bubbles can – temporarily – sustain the economy, until of course they burst.”Economists, on the other hand, often reject the idea that any sector deserves special treatment. Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University argues that the focus on manufacturing is a “fetish” that can lead to damaging policies such as protectionism or wasteful subsidies. He points out that many service industries offer higher wages than manufacturing, and that services are increasingly tradeable internationally.Lawrence Summers, former head of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, was the most prominent advocate of that view in the administration, arguing that the US was making a natural progression to a “knowledge and service economy”.It is true that average wages in manufacturing, at about $33,300 per year, are well below the American average of about $43,500. However, they are significantly higher than those in some industries, such as food preparation ($22,100 per year) or building maintenance ($25,000).The issue is the quality of the jobs created to replace those lost from manufacturing – and the record is mixed. One of the largest growth sectors has been health and education, with employment up 3.7m in the past decade to 16.5m. This includes a wide range of occupations, from skilled practitioners (average pay $69,700) to support staff ($26,700)."

This is the fastest organic growth pace since at least 2006.”He said that last year’s GDP growth was due to transitory factors but the main reason for the improvement in 2011 was slower private sector deleveraging.A report from the Institute of Supply Management showed US manufacturing grew in line with expectations in December, reaching a seven-month high.But Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics said: “Remember that the ISM has overstated growth over the past year as it has nothing to say about the struggling small business sector.”US markets will also be affected by growth in emerging markets, and so the Chinese purchasing managers’ index was closely watched by traders.The Chinese PMI edged lower in December from November. But even though the measure fell short of forecasts, investors welcomed the news as a sign that China was less likely to take measures to try to control growth.The S&P 500 industrials index gained 0.7 per cent. with Boeing adding 1.8 per cent to $66.40 and Textron rose 1.6 per cent to $24.01.Elsewhere, Expedia lost 1.2 per cent to $24.79 after the travel website stopped sales of tickets for American Airlines flights. Expedia is the second large online travel agency to fall out with American Airlines, after Orbitz Worldwide stopped selling the carrier’s seats in December.Expedia’s rival Priceline.com increased 4.1 per cent to $415.99 but Orbitz Worldwide sank 3.4 per cent to $5.40. AMR Corp, which owns American, was up 1.7 per cent at $7.92.Meanwhile, Alcoa added 2.7 per cent to $15.80 after analysts at Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy”, saying aluminium prices could rise and the metal producer was showing signs of operational stability.
245;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-27T21:56:14Z;Snow weighs down Wall Street;;US stocks staged a recovery late in the day, shrugging off earlier worries about China’s interest rate rise, while a blizzard in the eastern US pushed the retail sector off a three-year high.Industrial and materials spent the morning in the red, but finished the first trading day after China raised interest rates higher.The materials sector closed flat, with Cliffs Natural Resources higher by 0.2 per cent at $78.15 but aluminium producer Alcoa lost 0.7 per cent at $15.23.The S&P 500 industrials index rose 0.2 per cent, but Caterpillar was down 0.4 per cent at $94.07 and Cummins dropping 1 per cent to $109.82.The industrials and materials sectors have outperformed this year as growth in China and other emerging markets buoy profits.The broader indices were mixed in very light trading volumes.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,257.56 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to close at 11,555.03 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,667.27.Collin Monsarrat, Birinyi Associates strategist, said a “Santa Claus” rally – where stocks climb between Christmas and New Year’s day – was likely.“Reviewing the data for the past 60 years suggests they do exist and are fairly likely to occur,” he said.“The market rallies 73 per cent of the time from the close preceding Christmas day to the last close of the year for an average return of 1.34 per cent.”But “whether or not a Santa Claus rally occurs does not give us any significant insight into the subsequent performance of the market”.Retail stocks, which have rallied over the past couple of months in anticipation of a bumper holiday shopping season, suffered after a blizzard in the eastern US.Traders feared that consumers would not venture out to post-Christmas sales, pushing the retail sector down from its three-year high.The S&P 500 retailers index was down 0.3 per cent, with department store Nordstrom losing 1.6 per cent to $42.09, Saks down 0.8 per cent to $10.92 and discount retailer Target nudging down 0.4 per cent to $60.05.But not everyone thought it was the snow that was weighing down retailers.“I think it’s a bit of profit-taking,” Jason Waxler, partner at Fogle Neale Partners, said.“It’s the beginning of transition to new [sector] leadership. We might see technology pick up, as there are elements of a real cyclical recovery here.”But airline stocks were largely unaffected after the snow kept many aircraft grounded, with the S&P 500 airlines index rising 0.4 per cent.AMR Corp, parent of American Airlines, added 1.4 per cent to $7.89, Delta Air Linesgained 1.8 per cent to $12.45 but US Airways nudged down 0.4 per cent to $9.87.Financials, which have risen 10.8 per cent since the start of December on the back of hopes for an improved economy in 2011 and a steepening of the US Treasuries yield curve, edged up further.The S&P 500 financials sector added 1 per cent on Monday with AIG soaring 9.3 per cent to $59.39, the most in the S&P 500.The bailed-out insurer signed $4.3bn worth of credit agreements, seeking to replace government finance with private funds.The shares have gained 42.7 per cent in the past month as the group put together plans for paying back the US government.Goldman Sachs rose 1.3 per cent to $169.83 after the bank adopted a provision in its executive pay scheme that will reward senior staff on their ability to meet long-term performance goals without encouraging “imprudent risk-taking”.Electric carmaker Tesla Motors fell 15.1 per cent to $25.55 after the expiration of a 180-day lock-up period following its initial public offering, but it remained higher than the IPO price of $17 per share.Shares in casual dining chains slipped after a newspaper story suggested that they could fall 20 per cent or more if the expectations for 2011 earnings are not met.Chipotle Mexican Grilllost 2.5 per cent to $222.56 and Panera Bread, a bakery chain, was down 1.2 per cent at $102.86.
246;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-27T19:06:14Z;Drive for efficiencies leaves jobs unreplaced;;"When Jim McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, emerged from a meeting between Barack Obama, US president, and 20 of the nation’s top business leaders this month, he struck a bullish note.Mr Obama had asked the executives to step up their investment in the US to aid job creation, and Mr McNerney duly obliged.The aircraft maker plans to create 4,000-5,000 jobs next year, he said – up to half the number of positions the company cut during the downturn.While the Boeing chief’s optimism is sure to be welcomed in the White House and in Seattle and South Carolina, where the jobs will be added, few expect his plans to be repeated across the US manufacturing sector.In a number of recent outlooks for 2011, US industrial companies have taken a cautious approach, emphasising both a steady rebound in revenues even as they pursue rigorous measures to cut costs and improve margins.3M, the diversified manufacturer, forecast organic sales growth of 5.5-7.5 per cent in 2011, undershooting Wall Street expectations, while United Technologies, another industrial conglomerate, forecast 3-5 per cent organic growth, even though both companies expect their earnings to grow by up to 14 per cent.Behind the disparity between sales growth and earnings lies one reason industrial companies are still not hiring: the downturn forced them to cut jobs and implement more efficient production systems, in the process removing excess capacity and increasing productivity.Louis Chênevert, chief executive of United Technologies, noted at a recent investor conference that
the company had become “pretty good at doing more with less” in terms of
capital equipment and labour.Mr Chênevert said: “There is no doubt that as we see economic growth resume we are going to adjust the workforce but there is still a lot of opportunity to drive productivity internally without adding too much workforce”.Navistar International, the US’s biggest manufacturer by sales of medium-sized trucks, expects sales to grow 25 per cent next year but plans to increase its workforce by only 5 per cent.Dan Ustian, chief executive, says that dynamic has wider implications: many of the more than 2m US manufacturing jobs lost during the recession are gone for good.Mr Ustian says: “We were forced into efficiencies.“Even if we were to get back to the position of two or three years ago, we wouldn’t hire as many people back.”In part Boeing’s upbeat approach to hiring in the US is a function of its unique status as the US’s biggest exporter. It can build in the US because its products are high-value, extremely mobile and dollar-denominated, and so it benefits from the fall in the US currency.By contrast, faced with rapid growth in emerging markets, big industrial multinationals have established operations globally to reduce the risk posed by foreign exchange fluctuations and win local political and consumer support for their products.Companies such as Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving equipment, will focus much of their investment next year in emerging markets, principally China and India.The company is building a new hydraulic excavator facility in Wujiang that aims to start production in 2012, and has plans for
a new large engine factory opening in Tianjin in
2013 and an expansion of
its Xuzhou excavator plant to be completed by 2014.Cost pressures also play a role in decisions to invest in and procure from developing markets.United Technologies, for example, plans to shift more work outside the US, to low-cost countries such as Poland and Mexico, because it typically pays 25 to 30 per cent less for parts built there.One big trend for 2011 could well be for cash to be spent on mergers and acquisitions instead.For companies such as General Electric, a year of solid cash flows, cautious capital expenditures and cheap debt has produced a pile of cash to invest in acquisitions that could supplement organic growth.The conglomerate expects to generate as much as $30bn by 2013 that could be used for dividends, stock buy-backs and deals. This year it has agreed acquisitions worth about $4bn, mainly in the energy sector.Acquisitive companies such as Danaher – which owns a stable of brands including manufacturers of dental and test-and-measurement products – are also on the lookout for deals. The group expects to spend $4bn in the next 18 months.Analysts at Nomura estimated in a recent research report that the global non-financial sector was generating about $1,400bn of free cash flow each year, drawing “considerable attention” to capital allocation decisions.Nomura said that while investors tended to reward companies that increased dividends and buy-backs at the bottom of the cycle, historical analysis showed that as the economy recovered they bid up the shares of companies that did deals and made capital expenditures.Nomura wrote: “If stock markets continue to recover, and multiples rise, we think investors will look more favourably upon companies that are willing and able to reinvest in their businesses”."
247;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Economic data fail to move US markets;;A slew of economic data and positive news from the retail sector failed to lift markets as traders stuck to positions ahead of the Christmas holiday.Among the positive data, the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week fell slightly to 420,000 and continuing claims were also lower.Orders for durable goods excluding the volatile transportation sector rose by more than expected in November and recorded a gain of 2.8 per cent – the largest in eight months.But total orders disappointed, dragged down by fewer requests for civilian aircraft and motor vehicles.The S&P 500 industrials index edged lower by 0.2 per cent with earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar losing 0.1 per cent to $94.45 and Deere & Company, which manufactures farm tools, down 0.4 per cent to $83.58.But Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, nudged 0.7 per cent higher to $65.06.“The biggest ‘takeaway’ from today’s report comes from the core capital goods category, which was quite healthy,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.“Along with an upward revision to the prior month, this suggests a stronger pace of business spending in the fourth-quarter GDP report. This, in turn, bolsters the case for fourth-quarter GDP to break 3 per cent with a possibility of approaching 3.5 per cent.”The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was down 0.4 per cent, even though another report showed that the US consumer spent more in November as their income rose by slightly more than expected. “The biggest surprise was the upward revision to October consumer spending,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. “That’s the opposite of what we saw [on Wednesday] with the third-quarter GDP report and means it looks like consumer spending this quarter could rise by more than 4 per cent.”A separate report on consumer sentiment showed that shoppers were at their most positive since June.Clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch added 0.7 per cent to $57.34 while Big Lots climbed 1.2 per cent to $30.27 and GameStop gained 2.4 per cent to $22.22.Elsewhere in retail, Jo-Ann Stores soared 31.9 per cent to $60.19 after the fabric store operator agreed to be acquired by an affiliate of Leonard Green & Partners. The deal, worth $1.6bn, or $61 a share, is at a 34 per cent premium to its closing price on Wednesday.Leonard Green, a private equity firm, bought the J Crew clothing chain with TPG Capital for about $3bn just last month.Also in the sector, home furnishings retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond gained 5.1 per cent to $50.10 after it forecast full-year earnings above average analyst estimates and beat expectations in its third quarter. The chain also announced a $2bn share buy-back plan.The company said many US consumers unable to move because of problems in the housing and credit markets were happy to spend on renovations. Last week, rival Pier 1 also reported strong earnings. The wider indices were mixed in low volumes.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,256.77, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,573.49 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,665.60.Thomas Lee, equity strategist at JPMorgan, said the market could hit 1,300 by the end of 2010. “Into year-end . . . the dominant driver, in our view, will be the window dressing effect, the tendency of markets to drift higher in the final two weeks of the year [and there’s an] even greater effect when quarter-to-date performance was positive,” he said.Other economic data included new home sales and prices, which edged up in November, but the S&P 500 homebuilders index lost 3.5 per cent with Lennar down by 4.2 per cent to $18.17.In other deal news, Sonic Solutions shot up 28.7 per cent to $14.42 after the operator of an online video service agreed to be bought by Rovi Corp. The deal, worth $720m, or $14.17 a share, is at a premium of 26 per cent to the last closing price. Shares in Rovi lost 1.9 per cent to $57.26, even though it said the deal would add 5 to earnings in 2011.
248;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Groups seize opportunity in emissions rules;;The world’s biggest manufacturers of construction and agricultural machines aim to profit from much stricter emissions standards being introduced in the US and European equipment markets from January.Groups such as Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment, and John Deere, the world’s biggest tractor-maker, hope to do this by expanding their after-sales servicing businesses, taking advantage of the complexity of the engines needed to meet the new emissions requirements.The moves show manufacturers’ attempts to generate new revenue streams in developed markets, where growth in demand for heavy-duty equipment is expected to lag behind that of emerging economies in the next few years.New large off-road diesel vehicles sold in the US and Europe in 2011 will have to emit 90 per cent less particulate matter than current machines and 50 per cent less nitrogen oxides. The regulations – known as “Tier 4” in the US and “Stage IIIB” in Europe – will be extended over the next five years to include all off-road diesel vehicles.The emissions rules have become a particularly heavy financial burden for manufacturing groups that make engines for their equipment.Most of the $735m capital spending this year by John Deere, for example, was accounted for by development costs to comply with the Tier 4 rules. The company has also warned that Tier 4 spending will dent its profitability in 2011.While companies plan to pass their costs on to consumers, they have also looked to profit from the new rules by expanding their share of the after-sales servicing market – which analysts estimate is worth at least $10bn annually in the US and Europe – by taking business from independent equipment providers.“These new [technology standards] will make it more difficult for end-market users to sway away from the original equipment manufacturers,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar.“There is a big opportunity to capture a larger percentage of that aftermarket business,” he added.Mr Fleck estimates that, at least initially, customers will return to the original manufacturers for any repairs and servicing, rather than getting work done at smaller repair outfits.“As we took a look at all of our equipment in the field …it really gave us a renewed sense of opportunity,” said Tana Utley, chief technology officer at Caterpillar.At any one time, more than half the machines being used on construction sites globally are from Caterpillar, she added.The new requirements are the latest to make large diesel engines more complex, says John Piasecki, director of marketing at John Deere Power Systems, the tractor maker’s engine division.“That has a tendency to bring customers back to the original manufacturer network,” he says.Martin Richenhagen, chief executive of Agco, another big global maker of agricultural equipment, agreed: “Certainly, farmers won’t be able to do their own servicing.”The expanded revenue from servicing is important because equipment manufacturers are anticipating that growth will only recover gradually in mature markets, where sales of large machines typically earn a bigger profit margin than those sold in emerging economies.
249;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-15T21:50:40Z;Honeywell slides after forecasts fail to impress;;Industrial stocks edged lower after strong data on manufacturing activity was overshadowed by a forecast from Honeywell that missed some analyst expectations and the rising dollar.The S&P 500 industrials index was down 0.5 per cent despite a report showing industrial production in the US increased more than expected in November.Factories made more computers, home electronics goods and appliances, helping output rise 0.4 per cent after a revised 0.2 per cent fall the previous month.The Empire State index, which measures the pace of manufacturing activity in the New York-area, beat expectations in December.The index, which shook investors last month when it fell to minus 11.1, shot back up to a positive 10.6.But Honeywell International fell 1.9 per cent to $51.54 even though the conglomerate said its full-year profit for 2011 would rise 17-24 per cent. The middle of the range that the company forecast, between $3.50 to $3.70 per share, is below the average analyst estimate. It also forecast that sales would rise 6-9 per cent in 2011, which was at the lower end of analyst projections.General Electric also fell, even though it said it would finish the year with $20bn in cash on hand, and in the next few years could have $30bn to spend on take-overs, share buy-backs and dividend rises. The shares lost 1.1 per cent to $17.49.But elsewhere in industrials, Joy Global jumped 6.9 per cent to $85.78 after the maker of mining equipment forecast earnings in 2011 of between $5 and $5.30 per share, above the consensus estimate of $4.86.Caterpillar rose 1.1 per cent to $93.12 after analysts at RBC Capital Markets raised their price target for the stock from $98 to $108, saying it was poised to benefit from a rebound in spending and that its focus on mining machines would help marginsThe wider indices dipped late in the day to close lower after the dollar strengthened on the back of the positive economic data and the resurfacing of fears about eurozone debt. Stocks and the dollar have recently been moving in opposite directions.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,235.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.2 per cent to close at 11,457.47 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4 per cent lower at 2,617.22.US-listed shares in BP dropped 1.3 per cent to $43.86 after the White House sued units of the company as well as four other companies, alleging they violated environmental laws in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Boston Beer jumped 12.1 per cent to $94.97 after the brewer forecast earnings for 2010 of at least $3.30 a share, above the average analyst estimate. It also forecast strong earnings for its fiscal year 2011.

He made his fortune selling shovels and picks to the gold-seekers.Fast forward 150 years and the modern version of Mr Brannan – the mining services companies – are ready to profit as miners boost their investment above the record set in 2008 at the peak of the commodities boom.“We are entering the earlier stages of another multiyear expansion of the industry,” says Mike Sutherlin, chief executive of Joy Global, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of mining equipment, such as huge excavators.John Beevers, chief executive of Orica Mining Services, a Melbourne-based company that is one of the largest suppliers of explosives to the mining sector, adds: “A lot of fresh money is going to exploration and mining expansions.”The climate of optimism is in complete contrast to the past two years, when miners slashed capital expenditure to preserve cash amid the global economic crisis, hurting the services companies that depend on their contracts.Industry executives estimate the world’s miners, including companies such as BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Anglo American, will boost their investment to about $115bn- $120bn in 2011, above the previous record of $110bn. In the 15 years before the start of the commodities “super-cycle” in 2003, miners spent on average less than $40bn a year.“Capital costs are now exploding,” says Julien Garran, commodities analyst at UBS, adding that “in an eerie reminder of the 2007-08 period” of cost inflation, he was hearing executives talk about 20-30 per cent annual increases for certain projects.For the world’s biggest mining companies, late 2007 and 2008 was a bittersweet time. On one hand, they were enjoying the benefit
of record prices for metals and minerals; on the other, booming investment led to escalating input costs for explosives, drills and other equipment, which cut into their profits.As a result, mining groups are taking measures to prevent a repeat of such imbalances as the bull market ramps up again.Kazakhmys, the London-listed miner, recently said it had already ordered large-scale, precision-engineered equipment that it would not need until 2015 at the earliest. Over the next year, the sort of big-ticket equipment it ordered might face longer delays than more standard pieces of kit, such as trucks. Only a handful of companies – including FLSmidth and ABB – produce such large mining equipment, which can often lead to supply bottlenecks.For the past two years big miners like Anglo American and Rio Tinto have been working to streamline their equipment procurement buying from fewer companies but with longer-term guarantees. Anglo has such a deal with Komatsu for trucks and other kit.“The strength of your relationships with your suppliers is absolutely key to ensuring on-time delivery of major projects,” says Andrew Hinkly, Anglo’s head of supply chains.“Global framework agreements with our major suppliers . . . provide enhanced security of supply and improved commercial terms, both of which are critical in a high demand market.”Among those suppliers, the manufacturers of earthmoving equipment such as excavators and trucks, underground equipment such as drillers, and other heavy equipment, will be the main beneficiaries of the spending spree.Large companies in the sector include Caterpillar, which recently bought rival Bucyrus for nearly $9bn, and Joy Global, both listed in New York. Besides, Komatsu of Japan, Stockholm-listed Atlas Copco and Sandvik, and Sydney-listed Boart Longyear, are also among the top in the sector.Besides, explosive companies such as Orica and Bulk Mining Explosives, part of Johannesburg-listed Omnia, are also likely to benefit. Contractors such as Betchel and Fluor of the US, Leighton of Australia, Weir Minerals, part of London-listed Weir Group, and Hatch of Canada, among others, will also gain.The sector is attracting large amounts of money as investors bet on increasing profits and a round of mergers and acquisitions among publicly listed and privately held companies.Among those listed, share prices have surged between 20 and 150 per cent. Alex Krueger, managing director at First Reserve, the $20bn natural resources private equity investor, says that the mining services sector has seen a “re-rating” as investors “price in the upside associated with the increase in activity”.Private equity investors are also building exposure. Earlier this year, First Reserve took a majority stake in Calibre Global, a Perth-based engineering group involved in iron ore projects and railways links between mines and ports in Western Australia."
251;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-13T22:30:03Z;Currencies: Yuan direction;China is internationalising its renminbi – in a process that could have a global impact;So new is the trade in offshore Chinese currency bonds that it has yet to gain a proper name. For want of anything else, it is often dubbed the “dim sum” market, in culinary recognition of its Hong Kong home base.In spite of its infancy, interest in the market is growing quickly. Caterpillar, the US-based maker of earthmoving equipment, launched a Rmb1bn ($150m) bond issue last month, making it the second multinational to tap the market, following an August issue by McDonald’s, the fast-food chain.What makes these bond issues important is that the offshore renminbi market is much more than just a new avenue for debt financing – it is one of the core components in a plan to internationalise the Chinese currency. The process will be a slow one, with more baby steps than giant leaps, and it is by no means assured that the renminbi – also known as the yuan – will forge a decisive international role. But it is one that could have a huge long-term impact on trade, the global financial system and even international politics.If the plan works, the renminbi could become the main currency for doing business in Asia, the world’s most economically dynamic region, and in the long run it could become a significant part of the reserves of the world’s central banks. Indeed, some Chinese officials have already called for the renminbi to be included in the International Monetary Fund’s basket of main currencies.The timing is also full of portents. The renminbi is starting to go global just as the future of the euro is looking increasingly uncertain. Eventually the shift could have an impact on the ability of the US to borrow overseas in its own currency. In China, some have taken to calling their currency the hongbi, or “redback”, to rival America’s greenback – a moniker that gives a flavour of the geopolitical undercurrents.“We may be on the verge of a financial revolution of truly epic proportions,” says Qu Hongbin, China economist at HSBC, one of the banks pushing the renminbi to its corporate clients. “The world economy is, slowly but surely, moving from greenbacks to redbacks.”In many ways, the surprise is how little the renminbi is currently used outside China’s borders. China is now the second-largest economy in the world, the largest exporter of manufactured goods and holder of the largest volume of foreign exchange reserves. Yet the amount of the currency held overseas is negligible – the result of China’s strict capital controls and restrictions on currency trade.“If aliens landed on earth today, they would look at the current global monetary system and think it is very weird and unreasonable,” Li Daokui, who sits on the monetary policy committee of the People’s Bank of China, told a forum in Beijing last month.Yet the financial crisis has changed attitudes in Beijing and bolstered support for China to seek a greater international role for its currency. Officials argue that the crisis came about because the international monetary system allows the US to run unsustainable current account deficits. As a result, over the past year Beijing has put in place some of the conditions for the renminbi to go global.The first step has been to encourage international trade to be conducted in renminbi. That process accelerated in June, when China expanded its year-old renminbi trade settlement scheme to every country in the world and to 20 Chinese provinces and municipalities, allowing imports and exports to be invoiced and settled in renminbi.Even if the use of the currency is to be limited to trade, companies and banks still need to be able to hold and invest renminbi offshore – which started to become possible in some scale from July when the authorities allowed renminbi-denominated financial markets to spring to life in Hong Kong. A month later, a select group of investors, including foreign central banks, were given limited access to China’s onshore bond market. Malaysia is believed to have become the first central bank to hold mainland renminbi assets in its reserves.The effect has been dramatic. The People’s Bank says trade settled in renminbi totalled Rmb340bn between June and November – from zero just a year and a half ago. The pace has stunned senior western bankers who know the region. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong banks surged 45 per cent in October to Rmb217bn – another reflection of the use of the Chinese currency in trade.For Chinese companies, the attractions of settling cross-border trade in their own currency are clear. Avoiding the dollar allows them to cut transaction costs and minimise foreign exchange risks – a huge benefit in a world at risk of a global currency war.Sinochem, China’s biggest trading company, is one of the pioneers. The group’s offshore trading division in Singapore this year received renminbi as payment for sales of petrochemicals, rubber and fertiliser, after what it says were requests to do so from Chinese companies as well as units of Sinochem on the mainland. “This allows us to build a stronger bond with our customers,” says Song Song, finance manager at Sinochem International (Overseas), who expects the trend to continue.Indeed, an increasing number of western multinationals – including McDonald’s from the US, Ikea and Nokia in the Nordic region and Germany’s Metro – are also experimenting with using the renminbi in trade deals. “For our corporate clients, US dollars and euros are no longer the de facto currencies of trade,” says Shivkumar Seerapu, Asia head of trade finance at Deutsche Bank.Deutsche, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are among banks rapidly building the infrastructure needed to process renminbi transactions across the world. Standard Chartered and its rival HSBC are meanwhile already well placed to capitalise on the internationalisation of the renminbi because they have strong positions in Hong Kong, the designated offshore centre for the Chinese currency. Makers of products “from garments to gas cylinders” have started using the renminbi, says Neil Daswani, head of transaction banking for North Asia at Standard Chartered.Demand has been strongest from Hong Kong, he adds, but has also come from Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, the Middle East and the UK. According to economists and trade finance experts, the use of the renminbi in trade is likely to take off first in Asia and then between China and other developing countries.Momentum is clearly gathering behind the renminbi internationalisation drive, yet it is still a highly unusual process and one that is not guaranteed success. In the past, market forces have driven the greater international role of a currency: but in the case of China, that development is being developed by bureaucratic plan. “The attempt to create an international and eventually fully convertible currency through a policy-driven process is unprecedented – nothing like this has ever been tried before, even partially,” says Paola Subacchi of the UK’s Chatham House think-tank in a recent paper. “Beijing is openly aware of the fact that there is no roadmap to guide this process.”What makes the push even more unusual is that Beijing still intends to retain a raft of capital controls, to insulate its economy and to prevent the currency from becoming fully convertible for the time being, because of the leadership’s fears about the volatility of foreign exchange markets and the impact of open capital flows on the country’s still underdeveloped financial system. As Ms Subacchi says, “past experience shows that convertibility and opening of the capital account have always preceded the international use of a currency, rather than the other way round”.Instead, China is trying to use Hong Kong as a laboratory, where it can encourage international companies and investors to hold and trade renminbi-denominated products. The dim sum bonds are one part of that plan.Meanwhile, to boost the foreign availability of renminbi, Beijing has over the past two years signed currency swap agreements with central banks in eight countries – Argentina, Belarus, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea – totalling a little over Rmb800bn. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de facto central bank, last month drew down Rmb10bn of its Rmb200bn swap line, opening a new way for commercial banks in the city to obtain renminbi for their corporate clients to use in trade deals. Hong Kong banks can also obtain renminbi via mainland banks and the local branch of Bank of China, subject to quotas.Chinese officials admit, however, that while the offshore market in Hong Kong can help lay the groundwork for greater international use of the currency in trade, the renminbi cannot become a reserve currency until there is much greater access to the mainland bond markets and the renminbi is easier to trade on the foreign exchange market.Given China’s caution about liberalising its financial system, all of this suggests a process where the renminbi takes a greater international role over a period measured in decades rather than years, meaning it will be a long time before reserve managers are really considering shifting substantial holdings of dollars into renminbi.“There’s not a lot of point buying renminbi in Hong Kong if you can’t ultimately buy assets in China,” says John Greenwood, Invesco chief economist and architect of Hong Kong’s exchange rate mechanism. “[But Chinese policymakers] have got to be careful that they don’t make a hole in the dam that allows a huge flood in all directions – either inwards or outwards. China has a long way to go before its domestic capital markets can be opened up to foreign inflows without it being hugely destabilising.”Yet one of the big questions posed by the Chinese plan is whether the authorities will really be able to keep such a tight rein on the process. HSBC estimates that within three to five years at least half of China’s trade flows with other developing economies will be conducted in renminbi – about $2,000bn – making it one of the three top global trading currencies. With such a huge volume circulating outside the country, it could become much harder to prevent unwanted capital from entering.By encouraging the use of the renminbi, Beijing is also creating a constituency of investors, companies and central banks that will be lobbying for ever greater access to the currency and to Chinese markets.Indeed, one reason global financial institutions are so excited about the internationalisation process is that they expect it to punch new channels through the wall of controls that protect the domestic financial system. By pushing for greater use of its currency, China could open up more quickly than many in Beijing might think.
252;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-13T11:35:38Z;HK gold exchange plans renminbi contract;;The Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange, Hong Kong’s century-old bullion exchange, plans to launch the first international gold contract denominated in the renminbi in early 2011.The new contract comes as China pushes for greater international use of the currency and as Hong Kong’s precious metals industry seeks to take advantage of booming gold demand on the mainland.Haywood Cheung, president of the exchange, said that the new contract could boost trading volumes by 20 per cent. The exchange trades 3-4m troy ounces of gold per day, worth about $5bn, all settled in the Hong Kong dollar.But the contract will face major challgenges, according to industry executives. Shanghai has already launched a Chinese-only gold contract denominated in the renminbi. Furthermore, as Beijing liberalizes its domestic gold market, the need of Hong Kong as the backdoor for China’s gold industry is diminishing.The trading volume in the new contract will largely depend on the extent to which the Chinese currency flows out of the mainland and accumulates in the accounts of offshore investors. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong surged 45 per cent in October from the previous month to a record Rmb217bn ($32.5bn), as companies in the city received renminbi through trade transactions with groups on the mainland.In July, regulators lifted a series of restrictions blocking the free flow of renminbi in Hong Kong. Since then, companies including Caterpillar and McDonald’s have sold renminbi bonds in the city while banks and asset managers have started offering renminbi-denominated hedging tools and investment products.Hong Kong has been in the past a key route for gold in and out of the Chinese mainland, which is already the world’s biggest producer of the metal and the second largest consumer. But traders said that as China opens up its domestic market, gold is already flowing directly into the country, bypassing Hong Kong.This month China revealed the size of the imports – more than 209 tonnes of gold during the first 10 months of the year, a fivefold increase from an estimate of 45 tonnes last year. Analysts estimate Chinese gold demand will hit around 600 tonnes this year, second only to India, which will consume around 610 tonnes.The exchange is not the only group aiming to capitalise on China’s growing gold demand. The Hong Kong government last year set up a high-security gold vault, allowing overseas investors to store their gold in the city, while a company called the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange is preparing to launch gold futures.Founded in 1910, the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange is the sole exchange in Hong Kong that trades spot gold. It started electronic trading in 2008 but maintains an open-outcry trading floor for its 171 members.
253;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:27+0000;Russia’s VTB Bank to issue renminbi bond;;Russia’s second-biggest bank will become the first emerging market issuer outside China of “dim sum” bonds denominated in renminbi, in a sign of the growing Chinese presence in financial markets.VTB Bank plans to issue Rmb1bn in three-year bonds, expected to yield about 3.125 per cent, according to people familiar with the situation.Only a few foreign companies, including McDonald’s in August and Caterpillar last month, have issued “dim sum” bonds, which are issued in Hong Kong, where the offshore market is developing.The recent issues follow the opening up of regulations by the Chinese authorities earlier this year.“China is the future. More and more companies and banks recognise the importance of China. It is the fastest-growing economy in the world and a lot of companies want to do business there, which means they need the currency,” said Nigel Rendell, senior emerging market strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Separately, Galaxy Entertainment Group, a casino operator listed in Hong Kong, was able to sell bonds at yields lower than in Shanghai and below those on gaming debt in the US because of strong demand, another sign of the Hong Kong market’s potential.Galaxy, which is building a 2,200-room complex in Macau with the world’s largest rooftop wave pool, sold Rmb1.38bn of three-year bonds on Thursday priced to yield 4.625 per cent.Since February, it has become possible for any company in the world to tap the “dim sum” market. But issuers still need to gain approval from Beijing to move the proceeds from Hong Kong to the mainland.Some banks have been issuing these “dim sum” bonds since 2007. There have been about 20 so far, as issuance was initially restricted to Chinese financial institutions.The trend reflects the growing “internationalisation” of the renminbi, while also providing many foreign companies operating in China with an enhanced funding base. Beijing has liberalised the use of the renminbi in Hong Kong as part of a much bigger plan to boost the international role of the currency and reduce China’s reliance on the US dollar.The Galaxy bonds were the first speculative-grade corporate debt offered in Hong Kong’s renminbi market, according to Standard & Poor’s.They yield 58 basis points less than similar maturing investment grade bonds in Shanghai, and less than half the dollar debt of MGM Resorts International.VTB saw strong demand from Asian investors, fund managers and banks, with the deal heavily subscribed. HSBC and VTB Capital are managing the issuance.Bankers said the deal by the Russian bank should help foster closer financial co-operation between China and Russia.The McDonald’s and Caterpillar bonds also experienced strong demand.Both of the companies need the Chinese currency to fund their expansion in the country.
254;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-08T15:09:06Z;Johansson to step down from helm of Volvo;;Leif Johansson is to step down next summer as chief executive and president of AB Volvo, the Swedish truckmaking group said.Volvo said on Wednesday that Mr Johansson, who has headed the company for nearly 14 years, had informed its board of his decision to resign in conjunction with his 60th birthday, which falls in August 2011.Mr Johansson said that he was announcing his intention to step down now to give Volvo’s board enough time to find a successor.“For another eight months, I will concentrate wholeheartedly on Volvo, but I wanted to look at other opportunities”, Mr Johansson told the Financial Times.He said that he was not leaving to pursue another chief executive job, but that he would “definitely” continue to sit on other companies’ boards and pursue academic and other interests.Louis Schweitzer, Volvo’s chairman, said that Mr Johansson had done an “impressive job”. He said the board would now focus on finding his successor.Since joining Volvo from Swedish appliance maker Electrolux in 1997, Mr Johansson has presided over a significant expansion of the group’s global business, then more recently a deep restructuring during the worst market downturn in the company’s history.In 1999 he sold Volvo’s cars business to Ford Motor for $6.5bn in order to concentrate on building scale in commercial vehicles. The decision was unpopular in Sweden at the time but Volvo, as he pointed out, was the world’s 23rd-largest independent carmaker “and there was no 24”.When the European Union blocked Volvo’s attempt to buy its Swedish rival Scania, it acquired the Renault and Mack truck brands in 2001, then in 2007 Nissan Diesel, since renamed UD. Volvo is now the world’s second-largest producer of heavy trucks after Germany’s Daimler.Mr Johansson acquired Samsung’s excavators business in 1998 in a bid to build Volvo’s construction-equipment business, today the industry’s third-largest after Caterpillar and Komatsu.When the financial crisis began in 2008 Volvo suffered mass cancellations of orders as companies cut capital goods spending.Mr Johansson put in place a restructuring programme that saw the group cut about 22,000 jobs – more than a fifth of its total headcount – and reduce costs by SKr21bn ($3bn).The world truck market has since revived, and Volvo reported a third-quarter net profit of SKr2.85bn, compared with its third-quarter loss of SKr2.91bn a year previously.Mr Johansson said that the timing of his departure was “good both with respect to my personal situation and with respect to the more stable situation for the company”.
255;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-07T00:45:23Z;Employer optimism increases in big economies;;Hiring in the US and half a dozen other leading economies will increase for the first time in more than two years during the first quarter of 2011, according to a report released on Monday by Manpower, a global recruiting firm.Manpower’s Employment Outlook Survey – used by the Bank of England and Wall Street as an economic indicator – shows plans are stable or improving in the US, Japan, Germany, UK, Canada, France and Italy.This marks the first time employers across these seven economies have been positive about taking on new staff since the third quarter of 2008. The US forecast is the most positive outlook since the first three months of 2008.The report suggests the economic recovery is gathering pace in the leading developed economies, even as companies in Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Ireland and Spain prepare to shed workers in 2011.US companies’ intentions to hire new workers will be welcomed by the Obama administration. The US economy created only 39,000 jobs last month, according to data released last week, far worse than the 150,000 Wall Street had expected.The US’s jobless rate rose to 9.8 per cent in November, while the broad unemployment rate – which includes people forced to work part-time or who have given up looking for jobs – remained at 17 per cent. Even the manufacturing sector, at the vanguard of job creation, shed 13,000 workers.Manpower’s survey suggests that improving optimism is mirrored across most of the world. Companies in 32 of 39 countries surveyed indicated a greater appetite to take on new workers in the first quarter of next year compared with the first three months of 2010. Employers in India, China, Taiwan, Brazil, Turkey and Singapore reported the strongest hiring plans.In spite of the positive tone, Jeff Joerres, Manpower chairman and chief executive, cautioned that companies in developed economies were yet to hire significant numbers of full-time workers.“The global market still has a long way to go,” Mr Joerres added. “At this point companies are either hiring very selectively and/or increasing their use of contingent labour.”The Manpower chief said hiring patterns in developed economies contrasted with those in emerging regions. “The employment picture is very different in the Asia-Pacific market, where employers are feeling the talent crunch in the face of strong demand and are working hard to recruit and retain employees,” he said.Rich Lavin, head of emerging markets at Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, told the Financial Times this month that there was “intense competition” for management talent in China and India.Manpower’s survey is based on interviews with nearly 64,000 public and private employers around the world.
256;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-12-06T16:16:17Z;Ups and downs in the world of dealmaking;;Sentiment about a recovery in global dealmaking has swung between optimism and scepticism throughout 2010 as chief executives struggled to gauge the economic outlook.In January, bankers were full of hope that companies would start to spend cash piles accumulated during the previous two years. Kraft’s $18.9bn takeover of Cadbury, the chocolate maker, gave impetus to the idea that more US companies would attempt equally big acquisitions – particularly of UK companies, which looked relatively undervalued compared with other regions.When, just weeks later, Prudential, the UK insurer, announced a $35.5bn bid for AIA, the Asian assets of US rival AIG, bankers were convinced the outlook had turned. But Greece’s sovereign debt crisis in March caused managers to put their merger and acquisition plans on ice.Confidence – a key driver of deal volumes – was further eroded when negative investor reaction to the Pru’s M&A strategy, which ended after investors panned the AIA deal, sent even the bravest chief executives back to their desks.In August, a few acquisitive business leaders were coaxed out of their offices to announce two substantial cross-border hostile bids: Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceuticals group, launched an offer of $69 a share for Genzyme of the US, while BHP Billiton, the Anglo-Australian miner, bid $39bn for PotashCorp of Canada.Those were not enough to convince other companies to press the M&A button, and hopes of a recovery were dashed when BHP withdrew its bid after Canadian regulators ruled the deal with Potash would not be of “net benefit” to the country.The risks of doing large, cross-border deals hit home and – coupled with austerity measures, increasing taxes, currency conflicts and regulatory concerns – confidence in the global economy fell once more.Now, with only a few weeks left before the end of the year, bankers are still split over what 2011 will bring.So far this year, the volume of global M&A stands at $2,450bn – 20 per cent higher than during the same period last year, according to Dealogic, the data provider, but still well below the volume at the peak of the debt boom in 2007.Optimists believe chief executives’ appetite for growth through acquisitions is being outweighed by macroeconomic fears and market volatility.Frank Aquila, M&A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm, says that while most chief executives and their boards continue to be concerned about the fragility of the recovery, there is an increasing view that the worst is behind them.“On a macro level, all the key conditions are in place for a strong resurgence in dealmaking,” Mr Aquila says. “Multinational corporations have an unprecedented amount of idle cash, debt financing is available at historically low rates, equity valuations remain cheap and cost-cutting has made most corporations lean and efficient.”Philip Noblet, co-head of European M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, echoes these sentiments. “The availability of acquisition finance in size, at very attractive pricing, must eventually overwhelm macro concerns about Europe as boards choose growth acquisitions over returning cash to shareholders,” he says.However, he predicts deals will look markedly different from those struck during the debt boom, and most likely will be capped at roughly $10bn as investors remain averse to risky mega-mergers financed with large amounts of debt.“There will be a lot less financial engineering and more focus on targeted acquisitions with much greater commercial overlap between acquirer and target, which ultimately means higher multiples will be paid,” Mr Noblet says.Others are more pessimistic about the immediate outlook, citing Ireland’s debt crisis and fears that it may spread as investors lose confidence in policymakers’ efforts to stem it.Cary Kochman, head of Americas M&A at UBS, who recently advised Bucyrus, the US mining equipment manufacturer, on its $8.6bn sale to Caterpillar, the maker of earth-moving equipment, urges caution. “The outlook for M&A is one of cautious improvement,” he says. “While discussion and activity is creeping up, everyone has an eye on the broader environment. A key driver is simply volatility, which is the nemesis of dealmaking.”Private equity deals are unlikely to lead the way out of the recession, as they did following the collapse of the dotcom boom in 2001. But buy-out groups, which have substantial equity capital available and a healthy appetite for deals, will help increase the flow of transactions. “This means that corporate acquirers can expect to find an outlet to unload unwanted business units and surplus assets following significant deals,” Mr Aquila says.Although secondary buy-outs, where private equity firms sell assets to each other, have accounted for half of Europe’s €30bn ($39bn) of private equity deals in the year to September, bankers expect this to change as strategics, or trade buyers, become involved in auctions and banks lend more.The average debt component of buy-outs has increased this year, from 30.4 per cent of deal financing in 2009 to 44.3 per cent, according to data from Mergermarket, the research company.Industry participants are also concerned about the overhang of capital left from the last buy-out bubble, which, they argue, is causing some groups to pay “extraordinarily high” prices for deals.Speaking at the SuperInvestor conference in Paris in November, Michael Queen, chief executive of 3i, the UK’s biggest listed private equity group by market capitalisation, said buy-out groups were paying 10-13 times earnings for businesses that were not even underperforming, meaning buy-out investors could end up being disappointed by the returns on those investments.But while rainmakers may be divided over how quickly dealmaking will take off in the new year, nearly all agree that the focus will continue to be on cross-border deals, between companies in developed markets as well as the Bric countries of Brazil, India and China.The US was the most targeted nation so far this year, with $783.7bn of deals, up 13 per cent on the same period last year, according to Dealogic. China, which saw volume increase by 10 per cent to $160bn in the year to date, was the second most targeted nation, followed by the UK with $158.1bn of deals thus far this year.“There will be a continuation of 2010’s focus on cross-border combinations, especially where the target has exposure to growth economies and from the resurgence of private equity as the well of equity is spent relatively rapidly,” Mr Noblet says.A rise in global protectionism, however, will continue to make these deals hard to complete. BHP witnessed this trend with its bid for Potash.In spite of failing to close three multibillion-dollar deals in the past two years, BHP says it will not give up its pursuit of resource assets. But its size – it is the sixth-largest company in the world, with a market value of roughly $250bn – means that any deal of any size in almost any jurisdiction will come up against regulatory obstacles.Large-scale transactions have been noticeably absent this year, with BHP’s offer for Potash marking only the third bid this year valued at more than $30bn. Still, bankers can earn more fees from a steady stream of deals valued at between $1bn and $5bn, which still provide growth for a buyer and stand a better chance of closing than riskier transformative transactions.Smaller, strategic deals with synergies are also easier to get past investors who have been vocal about the value of deals since the crisis took hold.Institutional shareholders have suffered from below-par returns for several years and are seeking enhanced returns, which could give rise to more shareholder activism. Bankers say hedge funds, and even traditional institutional holders, are likely to push managements and boards to accept significant premiums when they are on offer.

surging 4.6 per cent to $18.07 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.1 per cent to $105.49.The S&P 500 industrials index jumped 2.6 per cent with Caterpillar, the best performing Dow stock in November, gaining 3.4 per cent to $87.45, Cummins adding 3.5 per cent to $100.52 and Honeywell advancing 2.4 per cent to $50.88.Investors were cheered by the Chinese Purchasing Managers’ Index, which climbed to a seven-month high, and the ISM index of US manufacturing activity, which slipped only slightly in November after a very strong October.In a big day for US economic data, ADP’s national employment report released before the opening bell showed that the number of private sector jobs had risen more than expectedin November.“Although we do not put great weight on ADP employment in our payroll forecast, it is worth noting that this is the strongest reading on ADP private payroll growth since Nov-ember 2007 (the month before the onset of the recession),” said John Ryding, of RDQ Economics.A separate report showed US non-farm productivity in the third quarter had grown faster than previously estimated. The upward revision of the figure, a leading indicator for hiring, matched economists’ expectations.Recruitment companies, which have risen significantly in the past couple of months, gained after the report. Monster Worldwide, which rose 25 per cent in November, added 1.7 per cent to $22.97 while Manpower was up 2.4 per cent to $57.27.Fears about the stability of the eurozone, which have dominated the market in the past two weeks, subsided after Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said the ECB could step up its purchases of eurozone bonds.A report showed US shoppers had spent 16 per cent more online on Monday, the busy internet shopping day now dubbed Cyber Monday, than on the same day last year.

258;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-11-30T04:14:55Z;Caterpillar powers up for Asia drive;;Rich Lavin, Caterpillar’s head of emerging markets, is getting ready for his big move: in January he will take up residence in Hong Kong, becoming the company’s first senior executive based in Asia.His relocation follows similar moves by senior leaders at General Electric and HSBC, which are designed to demonstrate that China is not merely a “foreign market” but an essential part of each company’s future.“It’s a fairly strong indication of our company’s commitment to that part of the world,” says Mr Lavin. “It sends a message that Caterpillar sees this as a critical market, a market of ever-growing importance for us.”As Caterpillar expands its presence in emerging markets, it faces a number of challenges, just like other multinationals, says Mr Lavin, 58.“The single biggest challenge we have in China is developing our supply chain to support a much more aggressive total manufacturing plan,” he says.“We’ve got a very aggressive manufacturing capacity plan for China for the next four to five years and we have got to bring our supply base along with us.”The company plans to raise the proportion of Chinese-made components used in its factories in China from 55 per cent to 60 per cent now to more than 70 per cent within five years.This shift involves Chinese suppliers expanding their production beyond basic parts to more complex components.These are currently imported from Japan, which has traditionally been one of the company’s key design and manufacture bases for excavators.Mr Lavin says the company’s suppliers in China have made big improvements and are at the cusp of being able to make sophisticated parts. He warns, however, that the process will take years rather than months.“Obviously, there is going to be a validation period once we think the Chinese supplier has reached the level where he can replace the Japanese supplier, and then it’s a question of validating that component in a machine operating in the field,” he says.Another challenge is finding young Chinese people who will become Caterpillar senior executives of the future and will lead its expansion in China.In the US, manufacturers struggle to find good engineers, while managerial talent is more widely available. In China and India, Mr Lavin says, the situation is reversed: engineers are “relatively plentiful” but finding good future managers is tricky.“It’s a challenge – and no question, it becomes more of a challenge as we grow,” Mr Lavin says. “There is intense competition for talent in every one of the growth markets.”He says the increasing competition comes both from other big foreign investors expanding within China as well as from the emerging domestic manufacturing sector.“We’re all competing for the same type of people,” says Mr Lavin.“As some of the domestic manufacturers really take their business model outside of China – as they begin to compete in Europe, in Australia, in North America – they are really looking to up their game in terms of talent. They are looking for global leaders and managers, just as we are.”He sees the financial arm as the key to the challenge of growing Caterpillar’s relatively modest customer base in China from about 7 per cent today.Caterpillar issued Rmb1bn ($150m) of two-year notes in Hong Kong last week, which it will use to fund loans to customers in China at attractive rates.“We’re very satisfied with our Hong Kong offering in how it is going to position us from a funding standpoint inside China. It’s going to be an important part of our overall strategy,” says Mr Lavin.“At the same time, we’re very interested in where the Chinese government is going with the debt market inside China,” he adds. “My sense is that they will develop a bond market inside China that we will be able to tap.”From his new Hong Kong offices, Mr Lavin should get a much better sense of what is happening in Caterpillar’s fastest-growing market.
259;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-11-29T22:27:42Z;Caterpillar to source more parts from China;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, plans to switch “as much as possible” of its sourcing of complex parts for its Chinese factories from Japan to China.“How quickly we can move from Japan to China depends on the ability of the Chinese supply base to do more,” Rich Lavin, Caterpillar’s head of emerging markets, told the Financial Times.“As they show their ability to manufacture more complex components we’ll move capacity out of Japan and into China,” he said, adding that the aim was to move “as much as possible”.Caterpillar’s plans are not only a blow to Japan’s industrial base but also a sign of China’s maturing manufacturing sector.The company imports about 40 per cent of components for its Chinese excavator factories from Japan, but is planning to reduce that by at least a quarter within five years as a first step towards a bigger shift.Mr Lavin’s comments will cause concern in Japan as they come shortly after Carlos Ghosn, Nissan chief executive, said the carmaker would shift the balance of its production and support functions towards dollar-linked economies to protect against currency volatility.Caterpillar entered China in the 1970s and its fastest-growing market is home to 11 of its 175 manufacturing facilities worldwide and a workforce of 7,400.China is expected to account for just under a tenth of the company’s annual revenues this year, which could reach $42bn. Caterpillar has a market share in the Chinese heavy machinery sector of about 7 per cent.Mr Lavin said Caterpillar was running pilot programmes with its Chinese suppliers to determine their ability to manufacture complex parts currently imported from Japan.The proposed shift in its regional supply base comes as Caterpillar is expanding its manufacturing operations in China. A new hydraulic excavator factory is due to start production in Wujiang in 2012, with a new large engine factory opening in Tianjin in 2013. It also has plans to expand its Xuzhou excavator plant by 2014.Caterpillar last week became the first industrial multinational to issue renminbi-denominated debt in Hong Kong, placing Rmb1bn ($150m) of two-year notes with institutional investors. It will use the proceeds for customer financing.

It beat expectations in its third quarter as same-store sales rose 7 per cent. It also raised its earnings forecast for the full year to a range above analysts’ expectations.Durable goods orders unexpectedly fell in October, down 3.3 per cent, in the biggest drop since January 2009. The jump in September was revised higher to an increase of 5 per cent.But S&P 500 industrials still managed to rise the most in the wider indices, up 2.1 per cent, with Caterpillar up 2.5 per cent to $84.69, Textron up 4.2 per cent to $22.44 and Cummins up 3.9 per cent to $98.65.Deere fell 0.1 per cent to $76.23, even though the maker of farm equipment issued a profit forecast for 2011 that fell short of analyst estimates. It beat expectations in its fourth quarter as sales shot up 35 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Shares in Dynegy rose 2.6 per cent to $5.13 after it was reported that it might get an offer of more than $6 a share from Seneca Capital and another investor.On Tuesday Dynegy ended an agreement to sell itself to Blackstone Group.
261;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:27+0000;Caterpillar launches renminbi bond;;Caterpillar, the US-based manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, launched a two-year Rmb1bn bond with a coupon of 2 per cent in Hong Kong on Wednesday, becoming the first foreign industrial multinational to issue debt in the Chinese currency.The issue, which is only the second of its kind by a multinational to date, dwarfs a Rmb200m issue launched by McDonald’s in August. The deal will give momentum to the nascent offshore market in renminbi-denominated debt which financiers hope will become an important fundraising route for companies with operations in China.The offering, which was placed with institutional investors by Goldman Sachs, was said to be seven times oversubscribed. McDonald’s three-year note was also quickly oversubscribed and secured a 3 per cent coupon.Caterpillar has secured approval from Chinese regulators – including the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange – to transfer the proceeds of the bond sale to the Chinese mainland, where it can be loaned out to support customer purchases.“Proceeds from the issuance will be utilised to support Cat Financial as it provides competitive financing options for Caterpillar customers in China through its subsidiary, Caterpillar (China) Financial Leasing Company,” the manufacturer said.Caterpillar, which has operated in China for three decades, has a substantial manufacturing and dealer presence in the country, where it employs about 7,400 workers.“In the late 1970s, Caterpillar was the first heavy equipment manufacturer from the United States to sell into China, and now, Caterpillar’s captive finance subsidiary is one of the first US companies to issue renminbi-denominated notes,” said Jiming Zhu, Caterpillar’s vice-president with responsibility for China.China is expected to account for about 9 per cent of the company’s $41bn-$42bn annual revenues this year. Caterpillar has a market share of about 7 per cent in the Chinese heavy machinery sector.Rich Lavin, the manufacturer’s group president and head of its emerging markets team, will be based in Hong Kong from January. The relocation is intended to show Caterpillar’s commitment to China.HSBC last year signalled its determination to expand in China and across Asia by moving Michael Geoghegan, its chief executive, from London to be based full-time in Hong Kong.Caterpillar’s bond, which is being arranged by Goldman Sachs, comes two days after China’s government announced it would sell Rmb8bn ($1.2bn) of bonds in its second such sale in Hong Kong.The Chinese finance ministry will sell Rmb5bn of the debt to institutional investors this month, with maturities of three, five and 10 years, while Rmb3bn of two-year bonds will be allocated to individuals.By issuing debt at a range of maturities, the government intends to deepen the offshore market for renminbi-denominated debt and establish pricing reference points for corporate issuers.McDonald’s became the first multinational company to sell renminbi bonds in Hong Kong in August, after China lifted a series of restrictions on the use of the currency outside the mainland.While so-called “dim sum” bonds – renminbi-denominated bonds issued in Hong Kong– have been around since 2007, there have been about 20 deals so far, as issuance was initially restricted to Chinese financial institutions.Since February, it has become possible for any company in the world to tap the “dim sum” market. But issuers still need to gain approval from Beijing to move the proceeds from Hong Kong to the mainland.Beijing has liberalised the use of the renminbi in Hong Kong as part of a much bigger plan to boost the international role of the currency and reduce China’s reliance on the US dollar.
262;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:07:36+0000;A valuable lesson in quiet leadership;;"Why do some companies live longer than others? Part of the answer lies in that overused word “reinvention”. Some long-lived companies – Procter & Gamble, for example, in branded consumer products, or Caterpillar in construction machinery – have succeeded by staying in or close to the businesses they started out with. But others – and this is a more common experience – have found it necessary at some point in their history to change direction; their existing business was disappearing or could no longer generate adequate profits. Which path to choose at those critical moments is often the subject of intense internal debate and the outcome may depend on the persuasive powers of individuals.Such was the case at GKN, the aerospace and car parts maker. That GKN still exists as one of Britain’s few internationally successful engineering companies is due in part to decisions made in the 1970s, and the man who played a central role in getting those decisions right was a thoughtful, piano-playing former accountant called Trevor Holdsworth.Holdsworth, who died at the end of September at the age of 83, had joined GKN in 1963. At that time the company was predominantly a steelmaker, although it also made screws, nuts and bolts, as well as semi-finished products such as castings and forgings; most of these businesses derived from the three-way merger that had created the group in 1901-02.In 1967, GKN lost a large chunk of its portfolio when the Labour government nationalised the steel industry. The company withstood that shock because it had other businesses to fall back on, but Sir Raymond Brookes, its long-serving chairman, assumed that when a Conservative government got back into power, GKN would buy back its steel plants and resume its old métier. This was indeed what Brookes planned to do after the Conservatives under Edward Heath won the 1970 election.Holdsworth, who had just joined the board as group controller, believed going back into steel would be a serious error. GKN’s future, in his view, lay in proprietary products based on unique technology and in internationalisation, not in a UK-based commodity business.GKN had an opportunity to move in this direction as a result of an acquisition that Brookes had made a few years earlier. In 1967, GKN had bought Birfield, an engineering group whose prize asset was Hardy Spicer, a manufacturer of propshafts and other components for the motor industry; it was also the sole supplier of constant velocity joints for the Mini, the first front-wheel drive mass-production car.Birfield also had a 39 per cent stake in Uni-Cardan, a German manufacturer of propshafts and constant velocity joints and a key supplier to Volkswagen and other continental European carmakers.Brookes did not like minority stakes and spent many months trying to persuade the owners to allow GKN to raise its holding above 50 per cent. By the time the Germans eventually agreed, Brookes had begun to lose interest in Uni-Cardan, and, with the opportunity available to get back into steel, he wanted to sell out.Convinced that both decisions would be wrong, Holdsworth had a big argument with Brookes. At this critical juncture, as Andrew Lorenz recounts in his history of the company*, Brookes “demonstrated his ability to bow to a superior argument and change his mind”. GKN did not go back into steel in a big way (it acquired one small plant making special steels), and it increased its stake in Uni-Cardan. Over the next 20 years GKN was able to establish a powerful position in Europe’s strongest motor industry at a time when British carmakers were fading. This would not have happened without Uni-Cardan.After Holdsworth became chairman in 1980 (he retired from the post in 1988), he continued to build up the vehicle component division while at the same time cleaning up the portfolio by selling off peripheral businesses inherited from the past. A courteous, mild-mannered man who led by reason rather than charisma, Holdsworth had a clear idea of what sectors GKN should be in and not in.To say that Holdsworth saved GKN would be an exaggeration. It had some valuable assets before he came to the fore, and his successors have been able to make the group much more international and to take it in new directions; aerospace components now account for about a third of group sales. Nevertheless, the technology and market connections that came into GKN through Uni-Cardan have been crucial, linking the company to a business that has become a growth industry once again. If the argument between Brookes and Holdsworth had gone the other way, GKN would not be what it is today.The writer is a senior fellow at the London School of Economics’ Department of Management and a former editor of the Financial Times"
263;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Emerging markets demand helps fire up coal;;Coal might be dirty and out of fashion, but it is in great demand.The commodity, which is used to fire power stations and as a key ingredient in steelmaking, has seen a renaissance this year as consumption in emerging markets, such as China and India rises sharply.The rebound in demand, which has surprised the industry, has pushed up prices to a two-year high, triggering a wave of merger and acquisitions activity.This week alone, the sector has seen $15bn in deals. Besides US-based Walter Energy’s $3.3bn bid for Western Coal of Canada, Vallar, the UK-based cash shell founded by financier Nat Rothschild, said earlier this week that it was paying $3bn for stakes in two large coal miners in Indonesia.Meanwhile, Caterpillar spent $8.6bn buying US-based Bucyrus, a manufacturer of mining equipment, which makes the gigantic excavators used in opencast coal mines. Ed Rapp, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, said the coal industry was one of the principal growth markets the company was targeting.Commodities bankers believe the dealmaking trend will continue in the near term. The prices offered by Walter and Vallar underscores the rising value of coal assets. Bankers believe that other companies in the sector will be tempted to cash in.The board of Massey Energy of the US is consider whether to put the company up for sale, even as it eyes acquisitions of its own.Meanwhile, privately held Drummond, based in Alabama, is looking at a sale of its thermal coal assets in Colombia, which could fetch between $6bn and $8bn.Despite the uptick in activity, resource-hungry Asian companies have been largely absent from the coal market recently.“I’m surprised that China has not had a greater presence in the latest round of M&A in coal, or at least not been financing more of the expansions,” says Melinda Moore, commodities analysts at Credit Suisse in London.Asia is particularly short of coking coal, used to manufacture steel. Spot coking coal prices have surged recently to about $225 a tonne, more than double the price of $85 paid in annual contracts two years ago, according to traders estimates. However, prices remain below spot quotes highs of more than $375 a tonne reached in mid-2008.Mining companies are scouring the world for new deposits to supplement existing production in Australia and the US. But new coking coal sources are elusive, and the latest findings are in more difficult areas, including Mozambique and Mongolia.Thermal coal, used to fire power stations, is more abundant.Even so, China’s shift to become a net importer has pushed the cost of coal in the Australian port of Newcastle to a 2-year high of $115 a tonne, up 65 per cent from the lows of early 2009.Beijing’s switch to imports comes on the back of a clampdown on illegal mining, which forced the closure of hundreds of small mines in Shanxi province, the key producing area, and booming demand for electricity.Analysts estimate that the country will import, on a net basis, more than 100m tonnes of thermal coal this year, compared with net exports of up to 80m tonnes in 2005.China could overtake Japan as the world’s coal importer as soon as next year.Amid strong supply and demand fundamentals, traders and mining executives believe that the annual contracts for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, which starts in April and whose negotiations are about to start, are likely to be settled at the second highest-ever level, only below the $125 a tonne of 2008-2009.The trend of rising prices bodes well for the world’s top producers: PT Bumiof Indonesia and London-listed Xstrata in thermal coal and the alliance between BHP Billiton and Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corporation in coking coal.Additional reporting by Helen Thomas and Ed Crooks in New York
264;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
265;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-11-16T15:05:07Z;Caterpillar changes gear to hit ‘sweet spot’;;Even before he took over as Caterpillar’s chief executive little more than four months ago, Doug Oberhelman was changing the culture at the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment by revenue.In June, as head of the rail services division, Mr Oberhelman led the company’s $820m acquisition of Electro-Motive Diesel, one of the US’s largest rail locomotive manufacturers, from Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group, the private equity houses.Last month, he paid €580m ($787.3m) to buy MWM, the German engine maker, from 3i, the private equity group – outbidding General Electric and Dresser-Rand.This week, the Caterpillar chief clinched the deal of his career: a $8.6bn agreement to take over US-based Bucyrus International, one of the largest manufacturers of mining machinery, a purchase that has generally been viewed in the industry as a sensible long-term bet on commodity markets and emerging economies.However, the purchase also demonstrates how Mr Oberhelman – whose first undertaking upon assuming the top job was to overhaul and streamline the company’s management structure – is turning the manufacturer into a leaner, more nimble giant.Mr Oberhelman said in a conference call with analysts on Monday that the deal indicated “a faster-acting, more sense-of-urgent company at Caterpillar than you all have seen”. He pointed out that the MWM and EMD deals were each stitched together in fewer than 90 days, while the Bucyrus agreement came together in 60 days.“The quickness in which we got this one done is indicative of what you’re going to see in my expectations of Caterpillar moving forward,” said Mr Oberhelman, apparently marking a distinction with the somewhat more-sedate approach of Jim Owens, his predecessor.Adam Fleck of Morningstar, the independent research firm, notes that the purchase surprised the markets, in spite of Mr Oberhelman’s reputation as a dealmaker. “Historically, Caterpillar has not been an acquisitive company, although you would not know that from the past six months,” he says.“The new chief executive had given notice of his interest in M&A activity but people had expected more bolt-ons, and this is a pretty big deal. It basically doubles the size of their mining business.”In the new strategy he outlined upon taking over, Mr Oberhelman identified mining equipment as an important sector in which Caterpillar wanted to expand its presence. Mining, he said, was a “sweet spot” that was not only an attractive sector, but one that fits into the manufacturer’s current business model.The acquisition is a response to miners’ spending plans: Rio Tinto, the mining group, will raise its capital spending from $1.8bn in the first half of 2010 to $13bn in the 18 months to the end of 2011. Across the sector, capital expenditure is forecast to increase by at least 15 per cent next year, according to a report by Jeffries & Company, the US investment bank.It is also the latest sign of booming commodities activity as demand in China and other emerging countries tightens mining markets ranging from copper to iron ore. The London Metal Exchange’s index – a basket of the cost of aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc – rose last week to a two-year high above 4,000 points, nearing the 2007 all-time high.In particular, the deal represents a judgment that global coal mining has a bright future in spite of concerns about pollution from fossil fuels. About half of Bucyrus’ revenues come from the coal-mining industry.Caterpillar may be able to use Bucyrus’s reputation with coal miners in China, where it has a strong presence. “There’s certainly more of a movement on to accept western suppliers, in the coal sector in particular, in China,” says Tim Sullivan, Bucyrus chief executive.Caterpillar will sell Bucyrus products through its extensive dealer network. Also, investment-grade-rated Caterpillar has a substantial financing business, where it helps clients fund purchases of its trucks and equipment – making financing Bucyrus products cheaper and easier than previously.The purchase brings together two companies with complementary product offerings in the mining-equipment market – estimated to be valued at about $30bn – to give Caterpillar the widest range of products for the sector of any global manufacturer.Touting the vision of the merged company as a superstore for mining customers, Mr Oberhelman said he could now provide miners with “one-stop shopping from one supplier”.Mr Oberhelman said that would appeal to the big global mining companies that were looking to simplify their supply chains and make them more efficient. “As our customer base and Bucyrus’s customer base has consolidated over the last few years, they’ve become very big,” he said.“They have come to us …and said: ‘help us with our business becoming more efficient. By putting this broad product range together …customers are going to get a better deal.”Mr Sullivan was also keen to point out that selling to Caterpillar would bring together two large US manufacturers – based in the neighbouring states of Illinois and Wisconsin – to create a powerful North American player in a global sector that is expecting fierce competition from emerging-market rivals.“It’s a great day for the Midwestern part of the US,” he said. “We’re bringing together two American icons …bringing the expertise of American know-how together to more effectively compete in the international market.”Chinese manufacturers of heavy machinery, such as Sany Heavy Equipment and International Mining Machinery Holdings, have grown fast in recent years. Robert Wertheimer at Morgan Stanley notes that the Bucyrus acquisition positions Caterpillar to compete at the top end of the market.“[Emerging Chinese competition] is something that’s on the mind of every investor and every company,” he says. “The biggest ways to succeed in that are to have differentiated product, strong service and support and to pick markets that value system costs rather than initial price.”Additional reporting by Helen Thomas in New York
266;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-11-15T21:39:03Z;Deal activity fails to boost US stocks;;Deal activity including an $8.6bn move from Caterpillar failed to stop US stocks slipping late in the trading day.Caterpillar gained 1 per cent to $81.82 after the industrial equipment maker agreed to buy Bucyrus International in its largest deal ever.Bucyrus, which makes mining equipment, jumped 29 per cent to $89.80. The $8.6bn offer translates to $92 per share, a 32 per cent premium over the stock’s closing price last Friday.Other mining equipment companies also gained. Joy Global rose 7.5 per cent to $77.77, Terex climbed 2.9 per cent to $25.13 and CNH Global advanced 5.4 per cent to $44.94.Caterpillar shares have risen 44.1 per cent this year, but analysts at Morgan Stanley have a $100 price target on the stock.“Despite the rally in the shares, we still don’t think most folks believe Caterpillar can transform its operations and earn $8-$10 per share versus [its] last peak of $5.66,” said Robert Wertheimer, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. “We think the signs of structural improvement are already there.”The wider indices spent most of the day in positive territory but were mixed by the close.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,197.75, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,201.97 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,513.82.In technology, EMC Corp, which makes storage computers, edged 1.2 per cent lower to $21.45 after it said it would acquire IsilonSystems for $2.25bn to gain its video storage equipment.The deal, at a 29 per cent premium to Isilon’s share price at the close last Friday, is the latest in data storage that has seen acquisitions by Dell and Hewlett-Packard in recent months. Shares in Isilon soared 28.5 per cent to $33.77.Speculation about other potential mergers also buoyed shares. Massey Energy, the US coalminer, added 0.9 per cent to $47.55 after it was reported that, if it decided to sell itself, ArcelorMittal would be interested in buying it.

267;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Caterpillar in $8.6bn deal to buy Bucyrus;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, took a long-term bet on commodity prices and emerging market growth by striking an $8.6bn (£5.3bn) deal to acquire Bucyrus International, a US manufacturer of mining machinery.The deal is the latest sign of booming commodities activity as demand in China and other emerging countries tightens mining markets ranging from copper to iron ore.The London Metal Exchange’s index – a basket of the cost of aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc – rose last week to a 2-year high above 4,000 points, nearing the 2007 all-time high.Caterpillar, an industrial bellwether and Dow component, offers a relatively narrow range of mining equipment compared with rivals such as Joy Global of the US and Japan’s Komatsu.Purchasing Bucyrus will ­enable the company to offer the widest range of mining equipment of any global manufacturer and take a bigger share of the $30bn market.The deal – the biggest in the company’s history and in the mining industry for several years – will accelerate the pace of Caterpillar’s expansion into the sector.It follows the company’s announcement in June of a $700m three-year expansion into the mining equipment market, including plans to begin production of a full range of mining shovels for the first time.“There’s no way that we’re not into a very strong, sustainable commodity cycle,” Tim Sullivan, Bucyrus chief executive, said.“When I entered the business world, three-fourths of the world was closed – China, Russia, Vietnam, India, most of Africa,” said Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar chief executive. “In 2010, the entire world is wide open, the developing world is growing twice as fast as the developed world and there’s still arguably several billion people out there that will modernise and progress.”Caterpillar will pay $7.6bn for Bucyrus and assume $1bn of debt. Bucyrus shareholders will receive $92 per share, representing an implied premium of 32 per cent to Bucyrus’ share price as of Friday. Caterpillar said it would fund the acquisition with $5bn of debt, up to $2bn in equity, and cash.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London
268;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-11-15T19:39:51Z;Caterpillar buys Bucyrus;Investors should dig a little deeper into the market’s rosy assumptions;Mining is a wondrous business. Prospects for the decade long boom in commodity prices to continue have sprinkled magic coal dust over valuations of all companies connected to the extraction of raw materials. So Caterpillar could announce its largest ever acquisition on Monday – the purchase of mining equipment maker Bucyrus for $8.6bn including the assumption of debt, paid for in part by issuance of up to $2bn of new equity – and see its share price rise. The market also included Bucyrus’ main competitor Joy Global in the celebration, pushing its shares up 8 per cent.Caterpillar’s strategy is simple. Miners have been consolidating and, the company claims, want their suppliers to do so as well. Bucyrus adds a collection of undergound and surface extraction equipment that will make the enlarged company a one-stop shop for mining equipment. The only real product overlap is in mining trucks, where Caterpillar is the largest manufacturer by sales, and Bucyrus one of the smallest. Emerging markets, it is assummed, will keep spending on capital equipment growing for years ahead.The valuation, however, is more troublesome. Caterpillar is to pay 10.5 times next year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Bucyrus only paid nine times ebitda when it agreed to buy Terex in February for $1.3bn, which now accounts for a third of the group’s sales. Furthermore, to generate an economic return above Caterpillar’s weighted cost of capital, operating income at the acquired group will have to at least double from the $688m consensus prediction for next year.Cost savings will help, although the $400m of synergies targeted for long-off 2015 are predominantly based on higher revenue growth. Investors, though, might ponder if it is really possible to strike a deal that benefits customers, competitors and both companies involved, and dig a little deeper into the market’s rosy assumptions.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

Unconventional oil and gas drilling in key North American basins boosted quarterly profits.Larger rivals Halliburton and Schlumberger have also reported better than expected earnings on the back of strength in onshore drilling.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, upgraded the energy sector to “market weight”.“Based on our models, earnings growth, margins, return on equity and cash flow for energy have improved markedly in the past several quarters, while valuations remain quite reasonable,” he said.“Our work indicates that the sector typically begins to perform well once earnings growth becomes positive. September 2010 was the first positive reading since 2008.”Cabot Oil & Gas soared 4.1 per cent to $30.16 and Anadarko Petroleum gained 2.6 per cent to $63.16.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,184.38, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,124.62 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent lower at 2,504.84.Investors eagerly anticipated Tuesday and Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open market committee, when many expect the central bank to resolve to deploy a second round of quantitative easing. They also expected a swing to the Republicans in the midterm elections on Tuesday.But analysts at JPMorgan said that although the outcomes of the FOMC meeting and the US midterms should help support stocks in the near term, the longer-term sustainability of the equity rally will rely on growth.“It is encouraging that the third-quarter reporting season has delivered another positive surprise in earnings growth, for the seventh quarter in a row,” they said.“[But in 2011] companies will have to rely more on revenues to generate earnings surprises. And this is becoming already more difficult,” they added.The S&P 500 industrials index rose sharply after data showed US manufacturing rose to a five-month high and the Chinese purchasing managers’ index beat expectations. But it finished the session up just 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar gained 0.9 per cent to $79.27 and Illinois Tool Works climbed 1.2 per cent to $46.23.In healthcare, Humana raised its earnings forecast for the current financial year and beat expectations in its third quarter. The health insurer benefited from lower medical and administrative costs and strength in its plans serving Medicare recipients.But the company would not project a detailed outlook for 2011 before the US government finalises new requirements for spending on medical costs.Humana’s shares, which have risen 16.3 per cent in the past month, were up 0.7 per cent at $58.68. Rivals also gained with Cigna up 0.6 per cent to $35.38 and WellPoint gained 0.7 per cent to $54.72.McKesson, the pharmaceutical distributor, rose 2.9 per cent to $67.88 after it said it planned to buy privately held US Oncology. The deal, valued at about $2.16bn, will help McKesson expand services in the fast-growing area of cancer care.Elsewhere in earnings news, Corning rose 1.2 per cent to $18.50 even though both profit and revenue missed analysts’ estimates.Its display technology division suffered after demand for flat-screen

It is the largest contingent of US chief executives to accompany a president on a state visit.Deals that are expected to be signed before, during or just after Mr Obama’s trip, include a $5.8bn sale by Boeing of C17 aircraft to the Indian government .In addition, either General Electric or Caterpillar is expected to win a $5bn order to supply locomotives to Indian Railways. Cummins and John Deere also have deals lined up.According to Ron Somers, of the US India Business Council, the total number of deals could help create or sustain 100,000 US jobs based on the US government’s formula of 11,000 jobs for every $1bn worth of deals.US businesses are eager to put commercial meat on a relationship unlocked by the US-India civil nuclear deal in 2008, under the presidency of George W. Bush. “We need to see some things that are going to demonstrate that this relationship has pay-offs,” said a US embassy official in New Delhi.Liberalisation of India’s restricted retail environment has been highlighted ahead of the visit. A closer defence relationship has also been identified. But obstacles remain. The US has struggled to agree an investment treaty with India and US companies are wary of intellectual property abuses.
271;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-10-27T20:28:54Z;Upbeat earnings fail to cheer US investors;;Better-than-expected earnings from consumer goods companies including Procter & Gamble and Whirlpool failed to cheer investors, who focused instead on their cautious outlooks.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent to 1,182.45 on Wednesday, after paring its losses in the late afternoon as the rise in the dollar began to falter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 11,126.36 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,503.26.P&G edged up 0.4 per cent to $63.08 but the consumer staples index still fell by 0.5 per cent after the world’s largest consumer products company reported its quarterly earnings.Profit in its first quarter fell 6.8 per cent after it sold a pharmaceuticals division and suffered from rising commodity costs.But earnings were still slightly better than expected and sales just missed analysts’ estimates.The company also forecast earnings for the second quarter within a range that was a little less than it previously predicted because of commodity costs and a rise in marketing spending as a percentage of sales.“I think relative to where [P&G rival] Kimberly-Clark came in [on Tuesday], this is a pretty positive earnings report,” said Hank Smith, chief equity investment officer at Haverford Investments. “There’s a little bit of similarity to way back in the early-1990s when there was a period of economic weakness and a lot of branded companies were impacted. Its not a secular phenomenon, it's a cyclical fact.”He added that cost-cutting and strength in emerging markets was softening the blow at P&G.Shares in Kimberly-Clark suffered on Tuesday, falling 5.8 per cent, after it posted a 19 per cent drop in profit and lowered its forecasts because of rising materials costs.They continued to slide on Wednesday, down 0.4 per cent to $62.35.The consumer discretionary sector lost 0.5 per cent after home appliance makers beat expectations but warned that the outlook was volatile.Whirlpool said sales remained flat and it beat profit expectations by tightly controlling costs.Sales fell in the US and Europe as consumers refrained from buying large ticket items, some of which are closely tied to buying a new house, but sales grew in emerging markets. Its shares sunk 4.1 per cent to $81.04.Whirlpool’s announcement mirrored that of its Swedish competitor Electrolux, which reported its results earlier in the European session.US-listed shares in Electrolux dropped 4.4 per cent to $48.10.Before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures extended losses after a durable goods report showed that orders rose more than expected in September. But when the volatile transportation sector was excluded, orders actually fell.The S&P 500 industrials index lost 0.7 per cent with Boeing declining by 0.6 per cent to $70.86 and Caterpillar down by 0.6 per cent to $78.22.Dan Greenhaus, chief economist at Miller-Tabak, said business spending had shown a noticeable slowing over the past few months and it was one of the reasons why third-quarter GDP, due to be released on Friday, will not show a meaningful surprise on the upside.Elsewhere in earnings news, Comcast climbed 3.2 per cent to $20.27 after the largest cable operator in the US beat expectations with its quarterly earnings, excluding the costs related to its deal to take control of NBC Universal.Revenue was also better than expected as it sold more packages offering cable, phone and internet service, pushing up revenue per video customer and helping to compensate for customers who cut services because of the economy.But Sprint Nextel dropped 9.9 per cent to $4.30 after the mobile phone carrier reported a larger loss than expected.The company subsidised customer upgrades to phones capable of working on its new networks.The number of contract customers, who pay their bills after making the calls, fell at a lower rate but the company was still losing these valuable subscribers.
272;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-10-24T17:20:07Z;Overseas demand lifts US manufacturers;;The US economy may be faltering, but many big names in American manufacturing are going from strength to strength.In the past week, a succession of industrial companies, including Boeing, Honeywell, Caterpillar and Eaton, reported good third-quarter results and gave upbeat views on their prospects. Over the next two weeks, others, including Emerson Electric, 3M and Cummins are expected to show similar evidence of robust health.Yet in recent weeks, concerns over the strength of the recovery have been gathering force. Official data showed US industrial production fell in September, for the first time in more than a year. The discrepancy raises the question of whether US companies have been able to see sources of strength that macroeconomic data have missed, or have failed to appreciate the slowdown about to hit them.Honeywell, which makes industrial equipment and aircraft components, predicted on Friday that profits in its operating businesses would rise by 10 per cent or more next year.However, David Anderson, the chief financial officer, sounded a note of caution. “The markets we are in are generally in pretty good shape. But many of the macroeconomic indicators, particularly outside the industrial economy, are mixed to soft,” he said. “You have got to say, ‘How long will it continue?’ ”One reason for the disconnect is that markets outside the US are much stronger. The outperformance of the industrial sector this year compared with the broad S&P 500 index has reflected the health of overseas markets rather than that of the US economy.A common theme in all of last week’s good results was the strength of demand in China, other emerging Asian economies, the Middle East and Latin America.Most large industrial companies say they want to produce as much as possible in the markets they serve, but exports from the US are also rising, in a move towards the rebalancing of the world economy that is sought by many policymakers.About 25 per cent of US manufacturing output is exported, and David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, calculates that the dollar is about 10 per cent undervalued relative to its long-term average, giving US exporters an advantage. But the strength of exports may not be enough to sustain flagging growth.Eric Landry, who covers the industrial sector for Morningstar, the investment research company, warned: “Some of the forward-looking indicators can sometimes do better at predicting the outlook for companies than comments made by the companies themselves.”

Trading is somewhat subdued across financial centres as investors appear a bit reluctant to take fresh positions ahead of this weekend’s conclusion of the G20 finance ministers meeting in Seoul at which forex policy will be centre stage.The FTSE All-World equity index is slipping 0.2 per cent as the dollar flits in and out of positive territory. The buck’s moves are pulling gold about and crimping gains in industrial commodities. The S&P 500 in New York is up just 0.2 per cent.With few economic data catalysts on the slate and a relatively small batch of US earnings to parse, it is little wonder that traders are mesmerised by the subject that has probably most exercised strategists over recent days: “currency wars” and the fate of the dollar.The buck’s risk proxy characteristics are hardening, and many investors feel that the US unit’s fortunes will therefore dictate the progress of equities and commodities in coming weeks. The lower dollar is seen as a function of more quantitative easing– considered a positive for most major asset classes. Its decline is also a boost for US exporters.Indeed, it was noticeable in New York on Thursday that the S&P 500’s rally to fresh five-month highs was swiftly knocked back once the dollar showed signs of strength. Traditionalists may pooh-pooh the perceived tightness of this correlation, but provided enough traders believe it, the trend becomes self-fulfilling.In light of this, it is likely trading desks may wish to wait and see what emerges from Seoul before placing further significant bets.Asia-Pacific. Investors in Asian exchanges seemed more prepared to put a gloss on US earnings reports than their American peers. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index is up 0.3 per cent as traders were cheered by figures overnight from the likes of American Express and Caterpillar.Sentiment has also been boosted by earnings out of the region from groups such as Canon and Brambles, the pallet maker.The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 0.5 per cent, while Korea’s Kospi added 1.2 per cent after LG Display, the world’s second-biggest liquid crystal producer, also posted forecast-beating third-quarter profits.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6 per cent, while Shanghai shed 0.3 per cent and Hong Kong lost 0.6 per cent as banking stocks fell ahead of a bunch of their results next week.Europe. Bourses opened lower, mainly reflecting Wall Street’s pull back from early session highs overnight, and made little headway all day. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 is down 0.4 per cent and London’s FTSE 100 lost 0.3 per cent as selling in resource stocks saw the blue-chip index retreat from six-month highs.Forex. The first salvo has been fired in this weekend’s G20 currency skirmish. US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner said in a letter to his peers that the group should not seek to gain a competitive edge by devaluing currencies.The US dollar has been meandering in a fairly tight range and is currently flat on a trade-weighted basis at 77.41. Expectations for further easing from the US Federal Reserve has pushed the unit over recent weeks to 10-month lows.The euro is up 0.2 per cent to $1.3943, while China’s renminbi is 0.1 per cent weaker versus the buck at Rmb6.6583 and moving in the wrong direction for Washington’s taste.The yen is up a fraction at Y81.36, still not far from a 15-year high.Commodities. Gold is continuing to slide, down a fraction at $1,325. A quick glance at a chart of the dollar index provides a clue to the bullion’s slump. With the precious metal having gained ground on fears of dollar debasement, signs that the DXY may be putting in a floor is troubling for gold bugs.Industrial commodities are firmer, but off their highs as the dollar shows signs of stabilising. Copper is up 0.7 per cent, while oil is higher by 1.8 per cent to $82.04 a barrel.Rates. Core sovereign debt is mixed, with US bond investors jostling ahead of next week’s $109bn of new supply. The yield on the US 10-year note is up 2 basis points to 2.56 per cent.

The German engine company is one of 3i’s five biggest investments.Peter Wirtz, managing director of 3i Germany, said it had invested heavily in MWM’s production, research and development and distribution platforms. The company employs 1,200 staff and is forecast to generate revenues of €350m this year. Credit Suisse advised 3i on the sale.Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chief executive, said: “MWM is recognised for its leading technology and product strength.”The US group outbid rivals General Electric and Dresser-Rand for control of MWM.3i has now sold companies worth more than €2bn this year, including Ambea, the Nordic health group; Inspectorate, the testing and inspection business; Panreac, the Spanish chemicals company, and NSL Services, the parking ticket business.The private equity group is expecting first-round bids soon for Hyva, the leading maker of hydraulic pumps for waste and tipper trucks, which it values at about €500m and expects to generate a return of nine times its investment.3i has also hired Rothschild to advise it on a planned initial public offering in Frankfurt of Norma Group, a manufacturer of metal and plastic engineered joining products, which it values at about €700m.The sale of MWM comes a few weeks after 3i unveiled a shake-up of its buy-out team, by merging it with its growth capital business. The shift in strategy triggered the departure of a number of top dealmakers, including Jonathan Russell, 3i’s global head of buy-outs, and upset several of its limited partner investors.While it made a healthy profit on some deals, such as MWM and Ambea, 3i has also lost money on others, such as on Global Garden Products, the Italian lawnmower maker, British Seafood, the fish importer, and Ultralase, the laser eye surgery chain."

More important, fourth-quarter guidance has been very strong.”The gains were pared in the afternoon as the dollar strengthened and equities trod a path that has become familiar, moving in the opposite direction to the dollar. The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 1,180.26, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to 11,146.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,459.67.Increased demand for construction equipment in emerging markets helped Caterpillar beat expectations. Sales rose 53 per cent and profits were up 96 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Caterpillar, which is seen as a barometer for global construction, also raised its 2010 revenue forecast. Its shares, up 38.4 per cent this year, fell 1.2 per cent to $78.89.Investors also looked to United Parcel Services for signs of a strengthening global economic recovery. The world’s largest package shipping company can be seen as a bellwether for international trade.UPS beat expectations in the third quarter as net income jumped 69 per cent.It also raised its full-year outlook, saying it expected modest growth in demand during the holiday season.

The company raised its outlook for 2010 to $3.80-$4.00 per share, up from its previous guidance of $3.15-$3.85. It said revenue would be $41bn-$42bn, up on its previous guidance of $39-$42bn, while it expected sales to top $50bn in 2011.CNH made net income of $102m, or 43 cents per share, excluding one-off items, compared with a loss of $22m, or 9 cents a share, last year.

For setting up the design and manufacturing centres in the Midwest and South, GE negotiated about $78m in tax breaks.Over the past year a number of US companies ranging from Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment, to Wham-O, the maker of the Frisbee and Hula-Hoop, have announced similar plans to expand US production facilities.GE’s appliance units have now pledged to spend more than $1bn in the US over the next four years, supporting about 1,300 jobs.In 2009, GE said it would move production of a water heater to the US from China, creating 420 jobs at its site in Louisville, Kentucky.“Twenty years ago we were in the process of moving every appliance manufacturing job to China or Mexico,” Jeff Immelt, chief executive, said earlier this year. “[But]…when I open up the safe under my desk I can’t find the pennies that we have saved …So the next generation of products are going to be made in the US.”Even with the new projects, a majority of the kit sold by GE’s home and business solutions unit, which had revenues of $6.3bn in the first nine months of this year, will continue to be made outside of the US.However, James Campbell, chief executive of GE appliances and lighting, expects the balance to shift as the new centres ramp up.GE plans to use the capital to develop “centres of excellence” at plants in Louisville, Decatur, Alabama, Selmer, Tennessee, and Bloomington, Indiana – a site once earmarked for closure – and create new energy efficient products.In the US market the investments also make for useful headlines for GE. “You still have to be competitive but when all things are equal, being made in the US tips consumers in our direction,” Mr Campbell said. But behind the moves are a series of hard-headed calculations. Local manufacturing means faster product development and lower costs. GE has also used tough new labour contracts to reduce its domestic production costs.“Compared to five years ago we have made tremendous progress with our unions, which means the new people we hire on to these programmes will come in at reduced wage rates, and that has gone a long way to help us get competitive,” Mr Campbell said.

Shares in Norfolk Southern, which competes with CSX on the US’s east coast, rose 4.2 per cent to $62.21.“When CSX reports better than expected earnings, it shows that goods from international trade are moving strongly all over the country,” said Phil Dow, chief equity market strategist at RBC Wealth Management.Boeing, the aerospace group, added 1.8 per cent to $71.47, and Caterpillar, the equipment manufacturer, added 1.2 per cent to $80.29.US indices were at five-month highs. The S&P 500 index gained 0.7 per cent to 1,178.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1 per cent to 2,441.23.The Dow was up 0.7 per cent to 11,096.08. Seven of its 30 components declined.Materials stocks rose 1.6 per cent after Beijing policy moves are set to allow Chinese banks to lend more to new infrastructure projects.Alcoa, the aluminium group, added 1.3 per cent to $13.39. Owens-Illinois, a maker of glass containers, rose 4.1 per cent to $27.23 a share.The sharpest one-day rise in gold prices in five months sparked a 3.5 per cent gain for Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold to $98.47 – the group’s highest since July 2008.But estimate-beating results for Intel failed to lift the shares, which fell 2.7 per cent to $19.24. Intel said fourth-quarter sales could be below expectations.Analysts noted that its development of a new chip product, known as Sandy Bridge, could hinder future margin improvement.Linear Technology, which builds components for Apple’s iPad, missed its quarterly earnings target and said next quarter’s earnings could also miss. The shares lost 3.9 per cent to $30.15.However, the technology sector was broadly higher thanks to Intel’s steady consumer sales. Cisco was up 2.5 per cent to $23.18, and Hewlett-Packard added 2.1 per cent to $42.21.JPMorgan Chase topped estimates by reducing its credit loss write-offs, but income in its investment banking division declined. It also said it could incur more losses due to its mortgage portfolio.Its shares fell 1.4 per cent to $39.84.Financials were the only sector to decline, amid fears that banks would have to buy back bad mortgages and incur heavy losses.Wells Fargo fell 0.7 per cent to $25.81, Citigroup slipped 0.6 per cent to $4.28 and Bank of America was down 1.7 per cent at $13.29.The St. Joe Company, a Florida real estate developer, fell 9.8 per cent to $22.14 after David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital revealed that he was shorting the stock.“Mortgages continue to produce stiff headwinds,” said Glenn Schorr, head of financials equity research at Nomura Securities.Chevron, the US oil major, warned that costs due to the Gulf of Mexico drilling ban and the weaker dollar would hurt third-quarter earnings. Its shares fell 0.2 per cent to $83.67.Monsanto added 4.7 per cent to $54.69 after the agricultural group received approval from Argentina and Brazil to sell bio-engineered seeds.Yahoo rose 5.7 per cent to $15.25 after analysts at JPMorgan raised price targets, citing a faster improvement in display advertising revenue.Williams Company, a natural gas producer, jumped 9.8 per cent to $21.53 after it named a new chief executive, Alan Armstrong.Shares in Crown Media, owner of the Hallmark Channel, jumped 46 per cent to $3.72 after a report speculated that a recent recapitalisation may lead to a sale.A new sale of $500m of stock by MGM Resorts International, the hotel and casino group, led to an 11 per cent fall to $12.10. It also reported preliminary third-quarter results slightly below expectations.
279;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-10-10T16:50:26Z;US industrial groups target emerging markets;;Industrial groups have shown the strongest gains in earnings expectations of any US sector as followers bet that strong emerging market growth will counter the impact of a weak domestic economy.The third-quarter earnings season is about to get fully under way with a range of companies due to present updates in the coming weeks. The reports are set to provide further evidence of US companies’ dependence on foreign markets for growth.Expectations for overall earnings growth have slowed since July as hopes for growth in the financial sector have faded. But forecasts have accelerated for industrial and technology groups, with the common factor being their higher-than-average exposure to non-US markets.Analysts expect companies with more than 50 per cent of revenues coming from overseas to increase sales by an average of 10 per cent in the third quarter, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters, compared with 4 per cent growth for companies with mostly domestic revenue.“We think that geographic footprints will have a tremendous impact as we expect industrial companies to report much stronger results in emerging markets,” said Sam Stovall of Standard & Poor’s, who identified the strongest markets as China, India and Latin America.General Electric, which reports on Friday, is a good example. It has become increasingly international during the recession as it rebalances towards industry and away from financial services.Between 2007 and 2009, GE’s annual revenues fell by 16 per cent in the US to $72.5bn but in the rest of the world dropped only 2 per cent to $84.3bn.Announcing a $700m power station deal in Saudi Arabia last week, Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE’s power and water business, contrasted the slow recovery in the US and Europe with the dynamism of emerging economies that have a rapidly rising need for energy.“In countries such as China, India and Saudi Arabia, we are seeing very strong growth at the moment,” he said. “That is being reflected in some big projects going ahead.”The International Monetary Fund has forecast that China’s economy will grow by 10.5 per cent this year, India’s by 9.7 per cent, and the Middle East and north Africa by 4.1 per cent, compared with 2.6 per cent for the US.GE has pursued a series of bolt-on deals to tap those faster-growing markets. Last week, it announced a $3bn deal to buy Dresser of the US, and confirmed it had a $1.2bn offer rejected by the UK’s Wellstream. The two target companies both serve the global energy industry.Expectations for US growth this year have been waning. Car manufacturers, for example, began the year thinking the US market might reach 12.5m vehicles this year, up from 10.4m last year. It now looks likely to be less than 12m.In many emerging economies, however, forecasts have been revised up. Alcoa, which was the first US group to report for the third quarter, said last week it had raised its estimate of growth in aluminium demand this year from 10 per cent last December to 13 per cent now.Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa’s chief executive, said: “In countries such as China, Brazil, India and Russia, more and more people are moving into the middle class, driving demand in building and construction, transportation and packaging.”The strength of emerging markets is expected to drive US industrial companies’ strategy.“You don’t need to hire in the US and you don’t need to invest in the US. That’s the challenge the Fed has in trying to stimulate growth,” said Karl Mills, a portfolio manager at Jurika, Mills & Keifer.“If you’re running John Deere or Caterpillar, or Boeing or Apple, where do you want to put your next team of engineers?”For some companies, the answer is clear. Eaton, an Ohio-based manufacturing company that makes hydraulic components for trucks and power control systems for data centres, is planning further expansion in emerging economies to keep up with new orders.“In China we are expanding several facilities because we are simply out of capacity,” said Rick Fearon, chief financial officer of Eaton, which reports on October 20.“We are the world’s largest producer of valves for car engines. Temporarily we shipped in from elsewhere but you can’t do that long term.”He expects rapid growth there to continue. “If you take an economy the size of China and grow industrial production 12 per cent, that is an awful lot of equipment that has to be put in place.”It saw rapid growth during the first half of 2010 as customers finally replaced worn-out equipment but expects its growth rate to slow in the second half as the impact of stimulus spending and the inventory cycle ease.
280;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-10-05T20:47:21Z;US stocks rally on Bank of Japan’s QE policy;;US equities jumped to their highest since mid-May after the Bank of Japan unveiled plans to ease monetary policy and better-than-expected data on the US services sector sparked hopes of a speedier global economic recovery.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,160.73, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.8 per cent to close at 10,944.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.4 per cent higher at 2,399.83.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rallied more than 1 per cent with six soaring more than 2 per cent, led by the materials and industrials indices.The Bank of Japan said that it was considering creating a Y5,000bn ($59.7bn) fund to buy assets to increase liquidity in the financial system, and lowered its interest rate.Some investors hoped this might open the door for the Federal Reserve to extend its own programme of quantitative easing.Shares rose further after a report showed the US services sector was re-bounding faster than ex-pected.But the positive data made Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, question whether the Fed would be prepared to intervene.“Both the headline and the details of the non-manufacturing Institute of Supply Management index came in better than expected and as a result the pressure on the Fed to execute QE2 [a second round of quantitative easing] has been reduced,” he said.“QE2 is very data dependant because the way to convince the dissenters is for the data to come in weaker than expected.”The index rose to 53.2 in September, compared with the average economist forecast of 52.Materials and industrials sectors were lifted by hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, advancing 2.8 per cent with Dow Chemical adding 3.6 per cent to $28.47, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.5 per cent to $91.18 and Newmont Mining rising 1.5 per cent to $63.67.The industrials sector was up 2.7 per cent with Caterpillar climbing 2.8 per cent to $79.40 and Cummins rising 2.8 per cent to $92.24.In energy stocks, Chevron rose 2.6 per cent to $83.39 after the oil company said it plans to resume its share buy-back programme this quarter, repurchasing up to $1bn of stock.Financials also rose, up 2.4 per cent, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase said banks were likely to beat the third quarter profit estimates, even though many other analysts have recently raised concerns about their earnings.Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.56, Citigroup gained 2.5 per cent to $4.13 and JPMorgan Chase added 1.8 per cent to $39.64.Information technology stocks added 1.9 per cent with PC maker Dell rising 3.9 per cent to $13.40 after Steve Schuckenbrock, the head of its large enterprise business, said it was seeing good demand for new personal computers in offices.Texas Instruments soared 4.1 per cent to $28.33, Google jumped 3 per cent to $538.23 and Apple rose 3.7 per cent to $288.94.Although the earnings season officially kicks off with Alcoa’s results on Thursday, some companies were already updating the market on their performance in the last quarter.Fertiliser maker Mosaic missed expectations with its first-quarter earnings in spite of tripling profits as sales of its products surged 50 per cent. Earnings were 67 cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 71 cents. But the shares still rose 3.4 per cent to $60.80.Talbots, the women’s clothing chain, sunk 14.6 per cent to $10.71 after it forecast third-quarter sales would fall. It had previously predicted a rise in sales in the third quarter, but now sees a decline, because the number of customers passing through the doors has been “inconsistent”.The company predicts earnings per share for the quarter of between 22 and 28 cents compared with the average estimate of 27 cents. But for the full year, the retailer still sees a 1 per cent rise in sales and earnings per share of between 84 and 92 cents.MaxLinear also lowered its third-quarter sales forecast to no more than $18.6m, when the average estimate was $20.3m.Shares plummeted 11.7 per cent to $10.03.
281;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:06:19+0000;Obama open to lowering corporate tax rate;;Barack Obama signalled he was open to lowering the US corporate tax rate from its level of 35 per cent, amid speculation that the administration could seek broad-based reform of the tax code as early as next year.At a meeting of his economic recovery advisory board on Monday, the president said: “We would be very interested in finding ways to lower the corporate tax rate so that companies that are operating overseas can operate effectively and aren’t put at a competitive disadvantage.”But Mr Obama told the group, which is chaired by Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman, and includes Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, and Jim Owens, chief executive of Caterpillar, that any solution would have to be “revenue neutral”.“If there are ideas whereby we can lower corporate tax rates in a way that does not massively add to our deficit, but instead revolves around tax loopholes . . . that is something that we would be very interested in and we think could eliminate uncertainty,” Mr Obama said.The president’s remarks come as tax policy, including extension of the income tax cuts of the George W. Bush era, has risen to the top of the agenda in Washington and could remain there for some time.Some insiders believe there is scope for significant reform of the tax code, potentially echoing landmark legislation enacted in 1986. On Monday, Mr Obama said he was interested in a tax overhaul that would reduce business taxes. “That is an area where we’d like to collaborate,” he said.Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, held a hearing on the 1986 tax reform bill last month, demonstrating that Congress is also gearing up for potential negotiations on the fiscal structure of the US.Any tax reform proposals would probably take their lead from the bipartisan commission on fiscal responsibility, which will release its conclusions on ways to cut the deficit on December 1.
282;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-10-04T21:47:00Z;US suppliers widened customer bases in downturn;;Smaller US companies that make components for big manufacturers broadened their customer bases during the recession, strengthening their competitive position at a time of economic stress, industry executives say.Subcontractors are moving into new sectors, as well as seeking new customers, because of fears that big manufacturers could fail or scale back orders.“While diversification has been a longer process, it’s really accelerated over the past 18 months in response to the recession,” said Richard Rubin, president of Maxi Container, a maker of industrial packaging for customers such as Campbell Soup, BASF and Ford. At the same time, big manufacturers such as Boeing, Caterpillar and Ford have moved to streamline their supply bases, which increases the pressure on such companies to keep their suppliers healthy.David Speer, chief executive of Illinois Tool Works, a US conglomerate that owns hundreds of suppliers to industrial manufacturers, said the result is that the recession has “led to a more rational approach” to supply-chain relations. “When you see some of your suppliers go out of business because they can’t make money, it’s a wake-up call,” he said. “If I really want viable suppliers I’ve got to work with them.”A survey of more than 3,000 manufacturing executives released on Monday by ThomasNet, an online marketplace for manufacturers and suppliers, found that the leading concern of small and medium-sized US industrial businesses is that the companies they supply could go bankrupt. Suppliers such as Keats Manufacturing, a metal stamper in the Chicago suburbs whose customers include Delphi, Siemens and Emerson, have gone as far as rejecting opportunities to expand for fear of growing overly concentrated.“Some of my competitors had one customer as 50 per cent of their work. That’s too big a risk,” said Matt Eggemeyer, vice-president. “We actually shied away from certain products to avoid that.” When orders slowed in 2007, Keats began supplying defence companies and medical-device manufacturers. “Because I was diversified I didn’t get hit as hard as some of my competitors,” he said.Tim Hanley, industrial products leader at Deloitte, the consultancy, said the downturn has “encouraged companies to think increasingly hard about whether they had too many eggs in the same basket”.
283;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-10-01T20:50:37Z;US stocks edge higher amid mixed data;;US stocks edged higher in choppy trading after strong Chinese factory data boosted energy and materials stocks, but concerns remained about the pace of the US recovery after a report showed a slowing in US manufacturing growth.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,146.24 by the close on Friday but lower by 0.2 per cent for the week, its first weekly loss in five weeks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to close at 10,829.68 and was down 0.3 per cent over the five days. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher ending the day at 2,370.75, losing 0.4 per cent over the week.Before the opening bell, investors were cheered when manufacturing in China rose more than expected in September.But the sentiment was short-lived. Figures showed that US manufacturing had expanded at the lowest pace for 10 months. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell to 54.4 from 56.3 in August in line with expectations but the details disappointed.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said: “The spread between new orders and inventories has finally moved into negative territory (which means the inventory index is higher than orders), suggesting that production should slow somewhat over the next few months as an increasing portion of new orders can be met by drawing down existing inventories.”In a busy day for economic data, other releases were mixed.Among the positive numbers, US consumers were shown to have been spending slightly more than forecast, car sales rose and construction spending had unexpectedly risen. The final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment was also a little better than expected.But prices barely rose in August, showing that inflation remains subdued,Materials and energy benefited from hopes of rising Chinese demand for metals and oil.The energy sector led the risers, up 1.3 per cent, with Hess Corp adding 3 per cent to $60.92 and Marathon Oil Corp gaining 2.2 per cent to $33.81.The materials sector advanced 1.2 per cent, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold adding 4.4 per cent to $89.13 and iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources rising 4.2 per cent to $66.58.But the effect of the Chinese data on industrials was muted by a couple of ratings downgrades so the S&P 500 industrials index was up only 0.1 per cent.Caterpillar fell 0.6 per cent to $78.22 after its rating was cut from “buy” to “neutral” by analysts at Bank of America. They view the shares, which have risen 15.4 per cent in the past month, as having the strong earnings expected in the next year priced in.Deere & Co also suffered after analysts at JPMorgan Chase reduced it from “overweight” to “neutral”, saying higher pension and research and development costs could weigh on earnings. Wells Fargo also cut its rating on the farm equipment maker. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $68.57.Elsewhere, HP declined 3.1 per cent to $40.77 after the company named its new chief executive. After the closing bell on Thursday, the technology company announced it was appointing Leo Apotheker, the former chief executive of software maker SAP, to the top job.The choice surprised analysts because Mr Apotheker spent only a year as SAP’s sole chief executive and they had not expected an appointment from outside the US.Also in technology, Google edged lower by a fraction to $525.62 after David Drummond, its chief legal officer, said the search engine operator was increasing staff and trying to win new advertisers in China, in spite of its clash with the authorities over censorship.
284;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-09-24T21:00:32Z;US stocks rally on durable goods figures;;"US stocks rallied after data showed that spending on durable goods rebounded in August and that the figure for July was better than previously reported.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,148.67, up 2 per cent over the week, its fourth successive weekly gain.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.9 per cent to close at 10,860.26, rising 2.4 per cent over the five days and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.3 per cent higher to close at 2,381.22, up 2.8 per cent on the week.Data released on Friday showed orders for durable goods, excluding the volatile transportation sector, climbed 2 per cent in August. Economists had forecast an increase of 1 per cent for the leading indicator of manufacturing activity. Including transportation, orders fell 1.3 per cent as Boeing saw civilian aircraft orders decline sharply.“It’s the realisation that the double dip is receding in probability and I would say the durable goods data today is in some sense the frosting on the cake,” said Bob Baur, chief global economist with Principal Global Investors. Mr Baur said it was natural to see a weakening in economic growth after a sharp rise.“Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard was bare so manufacturers had to ramp up production very fast from a low level just to put stuff on the shelves. Then this began to decelerate and that’s where everyone starts to worry.”All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose – nine rising more than 1 per cent and six more than 2 per cent.Industrials led the risers, up 2.8 per cent, on hopes for a speedier economic recovery. Caterpillargained 4.6 per cent to $79.73 and Cummins added 2.9 per cent to $90.86.Housebuilders, which were yo-yoing all week in response to mixed data on the housing market, soared 3.1 per cent after new-home sales remained steady, at a low 288,000, in August. The financials sector, which has suffered after some analysts lowered their projections for quarterly bank profits, advanced 2.8 per cent, wiping out the week’s losses.Morgan Stanley added 1.7 per cent to $25.15, Goldman Sachs rose 1.6 per cent to $147.28 and Citigroup jumped 2.7 per cent to $3.90.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index added 2.6 per cent, lifted by news from Nike. The world’s largest manufacturer of athletics shoes beat expectations with its first-quarter profit and offered a positive outlook. Earnings per share were $1.14 compared with predictions of $1 per share after strong demand in China and the US.Sales soared 8 per cent and future orders jumped
13 per cent. Shares in Nike added 2.5 per cent to reach an all-time high of $79.57.But also in athletic apparel, retailer Finish Linefell 9.2 per cent to $14.25 after it missed estimates because it failed to restock popular items quickly enough.The technology sector, which has been the biggest riser so far in September, up 12.6 per cent, advanced 2 per cent. Amazon hit an all-time high, rising 5.2 per cent to $160.73.Chipmakers were in focus after Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, said the software maker might buy a chip manufacturer.Oracle fell 0.6 per cent to $26.96 but US-listed shares of ARM Holdings, which designs chips that power iPhones, surged 7.6 per cent to $19.79 on speculation that it could be a target.Advanced Micro Devices, a chipmaker, rose 6.9 per cent to $6.84 in spite of saying third-quarter sales would be weaker than predicted because of lower demand for notebook computers in Europe and North America.Rival Intel, which reduced its forecast at the end of August, gained
2.3 per cent to $19.42.Gold companies, which have risen this week with the price of gold, continued to climb, with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold up 2.8 per cent to $86.61."
285;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-09-14T22:30:10Z;Eaton looks for ‘Plan B’ on derivatives;;Eaton Corp, the US manufacturer, is exploring ways to bypass proposed legislation on derivatives that some industrial companies fear may spell trouble for their operations.The planning underscores the level of concern among leading manufacturers over the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in July, which included provisions to bring closer scrutiny to the murky world of derivatives.As a result of the legislation, companies defined as “major swaps participants” are likely to face higher capital and margin requirements for their derivatives trades.Manufacturers which use the instruments to reduce currency, commodity and interest rate risks were promised exemptions but this will remain unclear until the specific rules are produced by regulators.At the end of 2009 Eaton had about $879m of notional hedging exposure as part of contracts to smooth interest rates, reduce currency volatility, and lock in the costs of raw materials such as iron and plastic between the time it receives an order and the time it delivers – often months later.Richard Fearon, Eaton’s chief financial and planning officer, told the Financial Times his company needed a “Plan-B” in case regulators threw a wide net around derivatives, capturing indu­s­trial companies as well as financial speculators.Options being considered by the maker of power equipment include using providers of derivatives contracts that are based outside the US “so that you don’t have those restrictions”, Mr Fearon said.In Europe, for example, industrial companies have recently gained some crucial exemptions in derivatives legislation being drafted by the European Commission due to sustained lobbying.Alternatively, Mr Fearon said that Eaton and other manufacturing companies could secure long-term fixed-price contracts with raw material suppliers – in effect including a hedge into deals to purchase commodities.Manufacturers have been vocal with their concerns about the proposed rule changes.The NAM, a lobby group whose members include companies such as Caterpillar and General Electric, is pressing the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to seek a narrow authority.SEC and CFTC officials have requested public comments by mid September.

better than expected economic data from China.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent at 1,121.90, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,544.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.89 per cent higher at 2,285.71.The S&P 500 broke through its 200-day moving average and all 10 main S&P sectors rose, five by one per cent. Global regulators agreed to phase in rules for lenders to comply with their new, more stringent, capital reserves rules from January 2013 to January 2019. Todd Hagerman at Collins Stewart said on average large US banks have 8.79 per cent tier one capital, which is more than the 7 per cent equity component that Basel III will require.Keith Horowitz, an
analyst at Citigroup, added that the best capitalised of the large caps were likely to begin to return capital through dividends and
buy-backs, and he cited JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and US Bancorp as possible examples. The S&P 500 financial index led the risers, up 2.3 per cent, after the Basel III committee unveiled the new rules.Goldman Sachs added 2.7 per cent to $154.37, JPMorgan Chase climbed 3.7 per cent to $41.24 and US Bancorp was up 3.3 per cent to $23.37. Bank of America rose 3 per cent to $13.95 and Citigroup rose 2.1 per cent to $3.99. Among regional banks, Marshall & Ilsley rose 4.5 per cent to $7.27 and Zions Bancorporation added 7.4 per cent to $21.31.Chinese data on industrial production and retail sales showed that the economy seemed to be stabilising. Industrial stocks, many of which make a large proportion of their revenue in the region, rose with General Electric up 1.7 per cent to $16.25, Caterpillar up 1.4 per cent to $72.24 and Honeywell up 1.1 per cent to $43.30. The broader industrials sector rose 1.1 per cent.Oil companies benefited from oil prices reaching a four-week high, partly due to the continuing closure of the largest oil pipeline from Canada to the Midwest of the US after a leak, and partly on the back of the Chinese economic data.ConocoPhillips rose 1.2 per cent to $55.38 and Suncor Energy was higher by 1.1 per cent to $33.26.

The facility lets them rotate multi-dimensional projections of the train and its components to see how easily they can be maintained, how comfortable the driver will be and other minute details.Similarly impressive work is undertaken at General Electric’s main locomotive plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, where the company works to cut fuel consumption and develop hybrid, power-saving techniques.The world’s big-three passenger train manufacturers – Siemens, France’s Alstom and Canada’s Bombardier – along with GE and Caterpillar’s EMD Division, the dominant forces in diesel locomotives, have long bet advanced technology would keep them on top of the world’s rail supply market. All have transferred some technology to Chinese partners, largely trusting their designs will not be misused to develop other products.All argue that, while their products might cost more to buy than those from emerging economies, their superior technology makes them cheaper and more reliable.But the results of the latest rail market report commissioned by Unife, the European railway industry association, raise the possibility that the big manufacturers could lose market share to cheaper Chinese products.According to Peter Ulrich, the Boston Consulting Group partner who oversaw production of the report, the question for the big rich world manufacturers is no longer how they should position themselves in the Chinese market. “It’s also: ‘How do I position myself with the Chinese or against the Chinese outside China?’ ” Mr Ulrich says.The dilemma has already faced Siemens after it initially bid to supply high-speed trains for Saudi Arabia’s inaugural high-speed rail project – between Mecca and Medina – then instead decided to join a Chinese-led consortium.Chinese manufacturers are expected to challenge to build infrastructure and supply trains in emerging markets, such as Brazil, Vietnam and South Africa, which are considering developing high-speed rail services. The country’s trainmakers could be natural choices to supply diesel locomotives to the many railways being built or modernised by Chinese companies in Africa.Such developing markets may not feel their needs are met by sophisticated European and North American products, Mr Ulrich says.But China’s suppliers face uncertainties. While there are many Chinese-built high-speed trains in China, all current models are based on European or Japanese technology, and under the technology transfer agreements, exported trains must be new and cannot be based on this.According to Henry Posner, a US-based railway investor with experience of Africa, reliability problems have also been reported with some Chinese-built diesel locomotives exported to African countries.European and North American suppliers’ technology is expected to retain an edge for some time.“With European suppliers, with some products it’s taken time for us to develop the maintainability and reliability of our products,” Michael Clausecker, director-general of Unife, says. “There’s still a gap.”Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE’s transportation division, hopes there will be space in the marketplace for all the suppliers. His company has some joint ventures with Chinese suppliers, as well as competing with them elsewhere.“We focus on technology and making sure we provide what customers say they need,” he says.Yet Mr Ulrich’s study predicts a slowdown in average annual growth rates in Asia’s rail markets to just 2.5 per cent in the period to 2015-16. That could leave factories supplying China’s high-speed network with spare capacity. “Those companies will look for opportunities outside China,” Mr Ulrich says.

0.9 per cent higher at 2,228.87.A successful government bond auction in Portugal helped to ease fears about the health of European banks.Shares briefly pared some of their gains after the Federal Reserve said it had seen “widespread signs” of slowing over recent weeks as it released its Beige Book, an economic report based on evidence from 12 regional banks.Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research, said there were no major surprises in the Beige Book.“There’s no definitive answer – it’s not a double dip, we’re falling off a cliff and running for the exits [situation] but that also means there’s no definitive action by the Fed,” he said.“It puts us back where we came from.”Financials, which led the fallers on Tuesday, rebounded. The S&P 500 financials index rose 1.1 per cent and JPMorgan climbed 2.2 per cent to $39.12.Goldman Sachs shares jumped on reports that KKR, Perella Weinberg, and BlackRock were all in talks to hire Goldman’s US proprietary traders.But shares later gave up much of their gains after it was revealed that Goldman faces a large fine in the UK as part of an investigation into its Abacus investment and closed up 1.6 per cent at $147.54.Shares in KKR were flat at $10.25 and BlackRock was up 0.8 per cent to $151.94.In industrials, Boeing gained 1.7 per cent to $64.50, Caterpillar advanced 1.5 per cent to $70.74 and Textron added 2.4 per cent to $18.66.The energy sector was up 0.9 per cent. US-listed shares in BP rose 3.2 per cent to $38.37 after it released its internal investigation into the causes of the rig blast that led to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.The oil company blamed “a sequence of failures” for April’s disaster, including mistakes it said were made by Transocean, which leased the rig to BP, and Halliburton, which was responsible for cementing the well. US-listed shares in Transocean were higher by 1.3 per cent to $53.74 and Halliburton rose 1.2 per cent to $30.21.Shares in Anadarko Petroleum, which owns 25 per cent of the well, gained 4.2 per cent to $52.39.The retail sales index rose 3 per cent last week, showing sales at department and chain stores in the final leg of the back-to-school season had been higher than in the same period last year. The S&P 500 retailers index gained 0.8 per cent.But Talbots suffered after it became the latest company to beat expectations on earnings but fall short on revenue. The retailer fell 1.3 per cent to $10.97, after sinking as much as 8 per cent. Profit was boosted by tighter inventory management, but sales fell 1.3 per cent to $300.7m.The company’s forecast for its third-quarter profit was also lower than analysts had expected, at between 22 cents and 28 cents per share, compared with a consensus estimate of 30 cents.In contrast, Phillips-Van Heusen raised its full-year forecast from an upper level of $3.65 a share to as much as $3.80. It reported a net loss in the second quarter, but, excluding costs to acquire the Tommy Hilfiger brand, beat earnings expectations. Shares jumped 7.1 per cent to $54.07.Teen retailer Wet Seal rose in early trading after it said it was planning to buy back up to $25m of shares. Retailers including Ann Taylor, Gap and Chico’s have all announced share buy-backs in the past month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to close at 10,447.93, 2.9 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.5 per cent higher at 2,233.75, rising 3.7 per cent over the five days.All of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were up, adding to a two-day rally that began after positive manufacturing data were released on Wednesday.The August non-farm payroll report showed the number of people employed fell less than expected. Payrolls were down 54,000 even as temporary census jobs fell by 114,000. Economists had forecast a drop of almost double, at 105,000.Private employment, viewed as a better gauge of the health of the labour market, climbed 67,000. But the unemployment rate rose from 9.5 per cent last month to 9.6 per cent.Payrolls from June and July were revised to show that 123,000 fewer jobs were lost than previously reported.But shares came down slightly from their highs after a report showed non-manufacturing activity in the US grew more slowly than expected. The ISM index fell to 51.5, compared with forecasts of 53.5.Michael Yoshikami, president and chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors said the payrolls report also showed the service sector is still suffering.“I think the softness is obviously in the service sector and I think that really does suggest that as the US is so much of a service economy, we’re going to have a high unemployment rate for a long time,” he said. “The positive surprise is that things aren’t getting worse.”He added that a rise in temporary workers showed a structural shift in how companies were prepared to hire.Shares in providers of temporary employees rose, with Robert Half International climbing 4.5 per cent to $24.03 and Kelly Services increasing by 9 per cent to $12.46.Monster Worldwide, the online recruitment service, soared 7 per cent to $12.33 on the back of hopes more people will be using its website to successfully find jobs.Financials and industrials stocks rose on hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 financials index, the sector that suffered the most in August, climbed 2.2 per cent.Goldman Sachs soared 5.4 per cent to $147.29, Morgan Stanleyclimbed 3.8 per cent to $26.66 and JPMorgan Chase rose 2.7 per cent to $39.17.Industrials rose 1.4 per cent with Caterpillar adding 2.3 per cent to $70.08 and Honeywell gaining 1.9 per cent to $42.82.Technology stocks also advanced 1.7 per cent, with Cisco, which has made two acquisitions in the past week, putting on 2.5 per cent at $21.94.Google rose 1.5 per cent to $470.30 after it was reported that it intends to create a music download service that would compete with Apple’s iTunes software. Shares in Apple also gained, rising 2.6 per cent to $258.77.Meanwhile there were some bright spots for corporate outlooks. US Airways surged 3.3 per cent to $9.97 after the airline said its passenger revenue per seat mile increased by about 15 per cent.But earnings news was more mixed as Campbell Soup Co became the latest company to beat earnings expectations because of cost-cutting but miss revenue estimates. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $36.21.In contrast, H&R Block, the US tax arranger, reported a first quarter net loss from continuing operations of 36 cents per share which was less than the 41 cents which analysts had expected. Its shares surged 5.8 per cent to $13.30.
290;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

If the Chinese PMI was weak and the US ISM was strong, I speculate there would not be such a strong reaction in the markets today.”Investors brushed aside negative data on private payrolls and construction spending.Private sector payrolls unexpectedly declined by 10,000 in August while construction spending was also worse than expected, falling to a 10-year low in July.But the S&P 500 homebuilders index still rose 4.5 per cent, and the industrials and materials sectors gained after the positive manufacturing data.Industrials led the risers, surging 3.9 per cent, with Caterpillar up 4.6 per cent to $68.16 and General Electric advancing 3.7 per cent to $15.01.The materials sector gained 2.9 per cent, with iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources jumping 6.1 per cent to $64.95 and aluminium producer Alcoa climbing 3 per cent to $10.52.Shares in energy companies followed the oil price higher, with the sector rising 3.6 per cent and ExxonMobil gaining 3.1 per cent to $60.91.Hopes about a pick up in the pace of the global economic recovery also pushed up financials and consumer discretionary stocks. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index advanced 3.4 per cent.The S&P 500 financials index jumped 3.9 per cent, with Bank of Americasurging 6.1 per cent to $13.21, Citigroup gaining 3.7 per cent to $3.85 and JPMorgan Chasejumping 3.8 per cent to $37.74.Applerose 3 per cent to $250.33 after it unveiled new versions of all its iPods and announced changes to its TV set-top box and iTunes software.Its rivals also rose with Googleup 2.3 per cent to $460.34 and Microsoftrising 1.9 per cent to $23.90.In deal news,Genzyme, the pharmaceutical group that is the target of a bid by Sanofi-Aventis, rose 0.4 per cent to $70.38 after Henri Termeer, chief executive, said he was willing to sell the company – but not for Sanofi’s offer of $69 a share. US-listed shares in Sanofi surged 3.9 per cent to $29.73.Dell had until Wednesday to make another offer for “cloud computing” company, 3Par.Rival Hewlett-Packard is the highest bidder with an offer of $30 a share in a battle that Dell started a couple of weeks ago.Shares in Dell rose 3 per cent to $12.12, Hewlett-Packard added 2 per cent to $39.21 and 3Par nudged down 0.1 per cent to $32.08.Other potential deal targets include Burger King, which surged 14.7 per cent to $18.86 after it was reported that the fast-food chain was in talks with 3G Capital Management about a possible sale.AT&T rose 1.2 per cent to $27.35 after it was reported that it may be considering a bid for London-listed company Cable & Wireless Worldwide.Share repurchasing also continued, with Sysco Corp, the largest distributor of food to restaurants, hospitals and schools, rising 2.4 per cent to $28.14 after it said it would buy back 20m shares.In earnings news Borders reported a 11.5 per cent drop in revenue in its second quarter.

292;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-08-24T20:56:45Z;Gloomy data spark Wall Street sell-off;;"US stocks sunk on Tuesday as investors across the world fled risky assets and Wall Street feared that weak housing figures could pave the way for even more disappointing economic data.The S&P 500 closed down 1.5 per cent to 1,057.43, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to close at 10,040.45 and the Nasdaq Composite was lower by 1.7 per cent to close at 2,123.76.Eight of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell in a broad-based sell-off, with seven down more than 1 per cent.Existing home sales in July dropped more than expected. The S&P 500 housebuilders index was only down 0.1 per cent after a Citigroup analyst said they may be a good investment in the longer term. But the wider market was still shaken by the drop in sales.Ryan Detrick, senior strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said that the housing data could signal a double-dip but that there was other data, including manufacturing, which were not indicating a return to recession.However, he added: “The overall sentiment is getting very negative here and rightly so as we see things quickly deteriorating on the economic front. That’s how short-term violent bottoms can form.”Investors were unimpressed by data from the Richmond Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index, which was better than expected but still showed a fall in industrial activity.Instead, they turned their attention to a possible revision to the second-quarter GDP figure, due to be released on Friday.Most economists are predicting that GDP, which was reported to have risen 2.4 per cent, will be revised down to about 1.4 per cent.Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said the consensus estimate was also too high and that it will actually be revised down to 1.1 per cent.He added that the Federal Reserve will probably ease monetary policy further.The S&P 500 industrials index slid 2 per cent on fears about the impact of a slower economic recovery on demand for their products with Caterpillardown 2.7 per cent to $65.04 and Boeing falling 3.7 per cent to $60.93.The materials sector fell 1.3 per cent with iron producer Cliffs Natural Resources down 3.3 per cent to $57.83 and Alcoa, the
aluminium producer, losing 2.9 per cent to $10.06.Financials also suffered with Bank of America down 1.8 per cent to $12.64 and Goldman Sachsfalling 1.9 per cent to $144.03.Markets were briefly buoyed on Monday morning by potential deal activity, including Hewlett-Packards bid for 3Par, the data storage company.Dell, which had already entered a bid for 3Par last week, fell 3 per cent to $11.59 after it was reported that it might raise its offer. Shares in 3Par, which have surged 48.4 per cent in the past week, rose 3.6 per cent to $27.04. HP shares fell 1.7 per cent to $38.39.The other big potential deal – between PotashCorp and BHP Billiton – continued to be in the spotlight as Vale, Latin America’s largest mining company, ruled itself out of the bidding. Vale shares fell 1.9 per cent to $26.67 while US-listed shares of PotashCorp edged down 0.7 per cent to $149.11 and US-listed shares of BHP Billiton fell 2.6 per cent to $65.42.Genzyme, subject to a bid from French pharmaceutical group Sanofi-Aventis, fell 0.5 per cent to $67.39 after it was reported the companies were at odds over the threshold price
at which Sanofi could start its due diligence on Genzyme’s books. US-listed shares in Sanofi-Aventis were down 2.5 per cent to $28.28.In earnings news, Burger King was up 1.7 per cent to $16.90 in spite of a fall
in profit and sales. Earnings per share were better than expected at 36 cents compared with estimates of 34 cents per share.But profits came from cost savings as total revenue fell 1 per cent to $623m.Bookshop chain Barnes & Noble, which put itself up for sale this month, reported a larger-than-
expected loss in its first quarter as sales continued to slide. Its shares sank 2.3 per cent to $14.66.At rival Borders, chief finance officer Mark Bierley resigned sending its shares down 7.6 per cent to $1.10."
293;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-08-22T13:12:24Z;Frustrating time for picking stocks;Shares are not responding to fundamentals;"Talk about digging yourself out of a hole. Caterpillar, maker of construction machinery and an icon for young boys everywhere, produced a stellar set of results – like many of its peers in yet another excellent corporate earnings season. Revenue was up, the profits outlook was raised, and earnings came in 27.6 per cent ahead of analyst expectations.So Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, cannot have been happy with the stock market reaction. Caterpillar’s shares over the three days spanning the results, measured relative to the market, were up a measly 0.4 per cent. Mr Oberhelman is far from alone: whether companies came in ahead or behind expectations made little difference to the stock price. According to Jonathan Golub at UBS, only in half of sectors were companies rewarded for better than expected results. In other words, the market reaction to results was no better than blind luck.For investors focused on picking winning stocks, this is a frustrating time. Fund managers who blame the market for their failures usually get short shrift from investors. But right now, they have a point.Shares are not responding to fundamentals, and both good and bad companies are seeing their shares blown by economic winds, not profits or earnings. On good days, the entire market rises, with little regard for the differences between stocks. On bad days, everything falls.In fact, the tendency of the top 1,000 US stocks to move in the same direction as the overall market – their correlation – hit its highest point since at least 1950 in July, according to Barclays Capital. Correlations between the blue-chip S&P 500 index and the mid-sized S&P 400 reached 98 per cent while the blue-chip and small company indices were 99 per cent correlated over three months; contrast this with Citigroup’s figures showing just 68 and 72 per cent correlation, respectively, over 10 years. The options market is pricing in high levels of future correlation, too.This matters. The whole point of paying a fund manager to select stocks is that he or she is supposed to beat the market. But if the shares of both “good” and “bad” companies perform similarly, that manager has little chance of success. It is bad enough that so few mutual fund managers are able to beat the market even in normal times. Additional headwinds for active managers will persuade more investors to give up on highly-paid humans and switch to cheap computer-run index trackers.Ironically, this could make the situation even worse. The rise of index tracking, and more recently of exchange traded funds, in part explains why shares increasingly trade alike.Back in 1980, there was less than $50bn tracking the S&P 500 index, and correlation was about 30 per cent, Birinyi Research calculates. It should be no surprise that at this point equity mutual funds were outperforming the market by the most – 3.12 percentage points – of any period since, according to Jane Li at FundQuest.There is now well over $1,000bn tracking the S&P 500. Rapid-fire computer-driven trading is further reducing the differences between shares and the index – increasing correlations – by arbitraging exchange traded index tracking funds. This probably explains the shift upwards in correlation during the 2000s, from 30-40 per cent to 45-50 per cent.Correlations are not just driven by the amount of money in passive funds, though. At times of crisis, investors dump their holdings indiscriminately, pushing up correlations. And at times of economic uncertainty, such as today, investors want to make macroeconomic bets – either stocks will do well (buy the index) or not (sell the index) – rather than views on particular companies. This explains why share performance has become so tightly linked to the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, something determined entirely by the economic outlook. It also explains why correlations between the S&P 500 and its members shifted up again in 2007, mostly remaining in a 60-70 per cent range since then.For those willing to bet on the long term, this could be a great time to put on individual company positions. When the market drives down the value of quality companies in line with the dross, buy the quality and sell the rubbish. Just don’t expect the market to reward such trades any time soon.james.mackintish@ft.com"

Potash, the world’s largest fertiliser producer, described the proposal as “grossly inadequate”.“There’s nothing like a headline-grabbing takeover bid to get the “animal spirits” back up,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist for Prudential Financial.“Its odd because it is an Australian company going after a Canadian company but …it is that kind of potential deal which drives home the fact that companies have cash, that there is value and that there’s going to be growth globally.”US-listed Potash shares soared 27.7 per cent to $143.17, with US-listed shares of BHP Billiton falling 2.4 per cent to $70.21.Data showing production in the US rose more than expected in July pushed up shares in the materials and industrials sectors. Production climbed 1 per cent – more than double the average forecast.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, up 2.3 per cent, with commodity stocks adding to Monday’s gains. Alcoa advanced 3.3 per cent to $10.95 and Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4 per cent to $62.87.The industrials sector was up 1.8 per cent with Honeywell rising 2.9 per cent to $42.39 and Caterpillar climbing 1.8 per cent to $69.74.But investors shrugged off weaker than expected housing data with the S&P 500 homebuilders index rising 2.6 per cent, after falling 1.1 per cent on Monday on the back of a report showing housebuilder confidence fell.The S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.8 per cent after bellwether chains reported better than expected results and raised profit forecasts.Walmart rose 1.2 per cent to $51.02 after it posted a better than expected quarterly profit of 97 cents a share for the second quarter. On average, analysts had forecast profit of 96 cents a share. The company also raised its forecast for the full year to $3.95 to $4.05 a share from a previous projection of $3.90 to $4 on the back of cost cuts and international growth.But the world’s largest retailer said sales at US stores open for more than a year fell and warned that the consumer remained cautious.Home Depot also beat analysts’ estimates but sales missed expectations. Second-quarter earnings per share were 72 cents compared with the consensus forecast of 71 cents but sales missed forecasts.In contrast to competitor Lowe’s which said on Monday that full-year profit would come in below some analysts’ expectations, Home Depot raised its profit forecast. It said cost-cutting would boost profits but the home improvement chain also cut its sales forecast. Shares rose 3.4 per cent to $28.31.Fashion chains Urban Outfitters and Abercrombie & Fitch joined the list of retailers beating expectations.Urban Outfitters, reporting after the closing bell on Monday, said sales jumped 20 per cent in the last quarter, 7 per cent at stores open at least a year. Less discounting boosted margins and second-quarter profit rose 46 per cent. Shares rose 5.1 per cent to $32.95.But preppy clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch fell 6.9 per cent to $35.05 in spite of reporting better than expected second-quarter profit as discounts damaged profits and concerns about a rise in inventories weighed on the shares.TJX, the owner of retail chains including TJMaxx, rose 1 per cent to $41.78 after reporting a rise in profit as customers continued to flock to buy its discount designer brands.Saks, luxury retail chain, rose 2.6 per cent to $7.81 after reporting a second-quarter loss that was narrower than analysts estimated.
295;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-08-12T20:43:13Z;Cisco warning dents Wall Street's technology sector;;US stocks fell after disappointing jobless figures and cautious company outlooks reinforced investor concern about the possibility of a double-dip recession.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent to 1,083.60 by midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to close at 10,319.95 and the Nasdaq closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,190.27.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose by 2,000 to 484,000 last week, the highest level since mid-February. Economists had expected claims to fall to 465,000.The S&P 500 opened 0.9 per cent weaker after the jobless data but was off its lows by mid-morning.Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said that, from watching Vix, a measure of volatility, he believes the sell-off will not last long.“Vix did not jump yesterday [on Wednesday] as much as one would expect,” he said. “Generally when Vix jumps less than expected, it means the sell-off is not going to continue and, although we do have a continuation today, it’s well off the lows.”Companies from Cisco, the technology company, to Kohl’s, the retailer, re-ported positive earnings but forecasts were worse than expected.Cisco, the world’s largest maker of networking equipment, sank 10 per cent to $21.36 in spite of better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and a 79 per cent jump in net income.Investors were spooked after John Chambers, Cisco chief executive, borrowed words from Fed chairman Ben Bernanke to warn of “unusual uncertainty” in the economy and forecast revenue for the current quarter of between $10.64bn and $10.83bn, below the average analyst estimate of $10.95bn.The company is seen as a barometer for the technology industry because it dominates the market for products that direct the flow of internet traffic.The S&P 500 information technology sector was down 1.7 per cent with Juniper Networks, the second-largest maker of computer networking equipment, falling 6.8 per cent to $25.78.Kohl’s, the department store chain operator, repor­ted earnings that beat ex­pec­tations but analysts were disappointed by a worse-than-expected outlook.Like Macy’s, which reported its earnings on Wednesday, it gained market share by adding exclusive lines. But it warned rising costs would put pressure on earnings in the third quarter, which the company forecast to come in between 57 and 63 cents a share, below analysts’ est­imates of 74 cents. Its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $46.50.Sara Lee, the food and household group, was also down 0.7 per cent to $14.37 after issuing a forecast that fell short of expectations. It said earnings for the year ending June 2011 would be between 88 cents and 95 cents a share compared with a consensus forecast of $1.02. Fourth-quarter earnings also missed expectations after wheat, meat and coffee prices rose, squeezing profit in its North American retail division.Estée Lauder also fell after forecasting earnings for 2011 below the average analyst estimate. The cosmetics company said profit would be between $2.80 and $3.05 a share, excluding some items, compared with the consensus forecast of $3.19. Shares dropped 2.6 per cent to $58.80 after it also missed expectations for its fourth quarter.Brinker International’s Chilis chain and the Wendy’s-Arby’s Group Arby’s chain suffered from declining sales in their restaurants. Brinker rose 5.1 per cent to $15.65 after it said margins would rise in 2011 but Wendy’s-Arby’s edged down 0.2 per cent to $4.40. Industrial stocks slid on fears about economic recovery. The S&P 500 Industrials was down 0.8 per cent with Caterpillar off 1.8 per cent to $67.50 and Textron falling 2.9 per cent to $18.43.Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, slid 3.6 per cent to $54.17 after India became the latest country to say it might ban the device if security issues were not addressed.American International Group fell 2 per cent to $37.10 after it was reported it had started negotiations with potential investors to sell stakes in AIA, its Asian life insurance business, before a planned initial public offering.
296;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-08-01T19:14:56Z;Supply chain woes threaten global recovery;;Large industrial companies around the world are defying fears of a “double-dip” recession, reporting signs of increasing strength in demand and striking a cautiously optimistic note about the growth of the global economy.Many industrial groups reported better-than-expected profits for the second quarter and raised their full-year growth forecasts. However, big manufacturers could be held back by their inability to secure vital components from supply chains weakened by the downturn and unable to increase production fast enough to meet demand.Caterpillar, FedEx and Honeywell in the US, Honda and Hitachi in Japan, and Siemens in Europe all raised their outlooks last week, while results from companies such as Boeing, Nissan, BASF and VW exceeded analysts’ consensus forecasts.Yet some suppliers to large industrial multinationals that cut costs sharply in the early part of the downturn are finding it hard to increase production capacity rapidly, while many report that financing remains expensive and difficult to access. Manufacturing supply chains in the US and Europe are showing signs of straining to cope with demand.“The problems that suppliers are facing in this upturn are noticeably bigger than in the comparable stages of the recoveries we saw after previous recessions,” said Daniel Corsten, a supply-chain expert at IE business school in Madrid.Some 51 per cent of big US manufacturers said they experienced “significant supply chain disruptions” in the second quarter, while 42 per cent of small and medium-sized suppliers said they had received queries or work from larger companies in need of urgent assistance because of supply chain problems, according to a survey by MFG.com, an online marketplace for manufacturers.Caterpillar, the US-based maker of earth-moving equipment, said last week that many of its most popular products were not being made as quickly as it would like because suppliers had not increased production fast enough. Boeing, the US maker of aircraft, suggested it could struggle to meet demand for commercial aircraft over the next decade because its suppliers might not be able to raise their output accordingly.Supply chain difficulties appear to be particularly affecting electronic components such as semiconductors. Audi and Porsche, the German carmakers, were forced to slow production in some plants last month because their supplier of car radios, Harman Becker, was short of microchips.“Anybody in the electronic supply chain has seen the tightness around certain components,” said Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, last week. Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said “around $50m of revenue maybe got hung up at the end of the quarter in the supply chain”.In response, some companies are building up buffer stocks of components to make sure they have them on hand.Additional reporting by Daniel Schäfer in Frankfurt, Jeremy Lemer in New York, Peter Marsh in London and Jonathan Soble in Tokyo
297;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Industrials’ success squeezes suppliers;;So far, this earnings season has been good to industrial companies.In Europe, the US and Asia, many big manufacturers have been reporting healthy profits and forecasting slow-but-steady growth to come. While not universal – GE’s second-quarter results, for example, underwhelmed investors – the trend underlines how the industrial sector has been leading the recovery in developed economies.As Peter Löscher, chief executive of Siemens, put it last week after revealing that the German engineering group had an €89bn ($116bn) order backlog – the highest in its 163-year history: “Germany is benefiting from its industrial strength and export power.”In part, the strong profits reflect the global nature of demand, with much of the earnings driven by strength in emerging markets. Manufacturers have also been helped by stable pricing for raw materials. However, what for large multinationals is a source of strength has contributed to the weakness of some of their smaller suppliers, which slashed capacity to such an extent that they are now struggling to ramp up production.“In the downturn, companies were extremely quick to turn off the tap,” says Gautam Dalal, head of diversified industrials at KPMG, the consultancy, in London. “In some cases this caused suppliers to cut back greatly on capacity and in some cases to go out of business altogether.“Now that the big companies want to turn the tap back on again, they are finding it difficult to do this effectively.”As well as the logistical problem of adding capacity quickly, many small and medium-sized suppliers are also continuing to find it difficult to secure loans at reasonable rates. The Financial Times reported last month that US small businesses are having to pay more to borrow relative to the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate than at any time in at least 25 years.The pace of industrial production is expected to moderate in the rest of the year. Coupled with continuing uncertainty about the global economy, that is leading suppliers to be cautious about re-investing.The supply chain is arguably more important to big manufacturers than in previous cycles, since many large groups have re-oriented their strategies towards outsourcing, putting more onus on suppliers to ramp up deliveries than in the past, when more capacity was kept in-house.This pressure has been aggravated by the strength of the recovery in industrial demand, which took many groups by surprise.“We’ve seen some of our facilities go from zero to up 50 per cent, 60 per cent, 70 per cent this year and a supply chain that had zero notice,” Ed Rapp, Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, said last week.“We’re just in this kind of middle of the year where we’ve had to digest all of this as the supply chain ramps up from a dead stop in the last part of ‘09.”Supply chain problems are not happening in all sectors and regions. Electronic component makers are among the companies struggling most.The global semiconductor industry is operating at 94 per cent capacity, according to the most recent data from the Semiconductor Industry Association, up from 56 per cent in the same period last year.Infineon, the German chipmaker, said last week it was having a hard time to catch up with rapidly rising orders. “Since the end of the second quarter, our plant utilisation …ranges between 90 and 100 per cent and it is therefore close to the capacity limit,” said Peter Bauer, Infineon chief executive. “This will persist until the end of 2010.”In the US, Altera, the semiconductor-maker, said its lead times have lengthened from a maximum of 16 weeks to 26 weeks.Europe and the US appear to be the regions most affected by supply chain difficulties. Japanese manufacturers, by contrast, tend to work more closely with their suppliers, sometimes extending credit to help fund capacity expansion, a relationship that has traditionally protected them against cyclical shortages.However, a move toward more overseas production in recent years has exposed Japanese groups to new risks – illustrated by recent strikes at Chinese parts makers affiliated to Honda and Toyota, which disrupted output at the carmakers’ Chinese assembly plants.In the US and Europe, while some manufacturers are trying to keep inventories low, others are said to be stockpiling scarce components as a buffer in case supplies run out.Big manufacturers may well take the lesson that careful stewardship of the supply chain is important at all stages of the cycle. “Many of them are starting to realise that they should have paid more attention [in the early stages of the recession] to keep supply lines going at least from their most critical suppliers,” says Mr Dalal.Additional reporting by Daniel Schäfer in Frankfurt and Jonathan Soble in Tokyo
298;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Heavy industry;The latest crop of quarterly earnings shows sector in rude health;"Whatever happened to the fabled double dip? The latest crop of quarterly earnings shows global industry in rude health. Germany’s Siemens, heralding its “best result of all times” displayed an industrial order book up by almost a third. Operating profit more than doubled at earth movers Caterpillar of the US and Komatsu of Japan. Germans are moaning about a dearth of engineers; Boeing grumbles about capacity constraints.Two factors explain the dichotomy. Companies inhabit a parallel universe because, unlike households and governments (not to mention banks), they have done most of their de-leveraging and are buying machinery and hiring staff. The US ratio of capital expenditure/capital consumption is firmly on the turn, while German unemployment is at its lowest level since November 2008. Secondly, companies’ remit is far more global than that of the average jobseeker or sovereign. They are thus turning their attentions to the industrialising nations that are providing the bulk of economic growth. Caterpillar’s second-quarter revenues were up 116 and 62 per cent in Latin America and Asia Pacific respectively; at current growth rates the latter would overtake North America in 2013. ABB is going one further and buying the part of its Indian unit it doesn’t already own.Corporate belief in the business cycle is borne out by macro data. Global industrial production is at record high levels, according to the Dutch Statistics Bureau, clearly led by Asia. But this is backward looking; investors are justifiably sceptical on how far it can run once inventories are restocked and emerging market government cheques exhausted. The great rebalancing of global consumption has yet to convince. China’s stimulus has largely gone into infrastructure (some of which local governments will struggle to keep financing), while domestic consumption remains low. Moreover, industrial production – even in Asia – cannot keep galloping ahead; the upcoming PMI series is likely to show some faltering in momentum. The world is not yet on a roll, whatever business thinks.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"
299;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;FedEx raises earnings outlook;;FedEx became the latest big US company to raise its full-year earnings guidance on Monday, adding to evidence that the country’s industry is steering its way through an uneven global recovery.In spite of fears of a double-dip recession, concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and slowing industrial production in Asia, several big companies have reported second-quarter earnings that were better than expected. Of 176 S&P 500 companies reporting this quarter, 125 beat Wall Street estimates, 18 missed expectations and 33 were within 2 per cent of forecasts.A handful of industrial companies such as Caterpillar and Eaton Corp have upgraded their outlook for the full year.General Electric partially restored its dividend last week after slashing it in 2009. Analysts said the moves indicated that US corporations were picking their way through the difficult environment, tapping growth in regions and markets that were recovering and benefiting from tight cost controls elsewhere.“Anything touching automotives, trucks, construction equipment and semiconductors has just been white hot,” said Nigel Coe, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, though defence and commercial construction markets had been slower to recover.He noted that in the industrial arena companies had raised revenue forecasts by 4 per cent for the second half of the year and increased the midpoint of profit estimates. “That suggests that the worst-case scenarios are now off the table,” he said.FedEx expects volumes at its International Priority unit – which handles express deliveries – to grow more than 20 per cent this quarter, helping it achieve full-year earnings per share of $4.60-$5.20, up from previous guidance of $4.40-$5.00 per share. FedEx shares were up 5.6 per cent at the close of trading.“Our revenue and earnings growth are exceeding original expectations, primarily due to better-than-anticipated growth in FedEx Express and FedEx Ground volumes,” said Alan Graf Jr, chief financial officer.In June, Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, dismissed what he called “an undue sense of pessimism”.FedEx’s forecast is based on stable oil prices and a “moderate recovery in the global economy”.
300;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Wall Street bounces back on earnings;;"US stocks were boosted on Thursday by positive earnings news and companies raising their profit forecasts, outweighing worse than expected jobless claims.The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,093.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2 per cent to 10,322.00 and the Nasdaq was 2.7 per cent higher at 2,245.89.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 bounced back from Wednesday’s late sell-off. The index made its largest leap for two weeks, with industrials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks leading the charge.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, continued his testimony to Congress. But his comments largely reflected topics covered on Wednesday and did not weigh on sentiment. Investors also downplayed data that showed US jobless claims rose more steeply than expected last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were up 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 464,000.There was some relief as existing house sales fell less than expected by a seasonally-adjusted 5.1 per cent in June. The S&P 500 housebuilders rose 3.4 per cent.Michael Yoshikiami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET, said: “When you see home sales numbers and jobless claims numbers that go beyond this earnings season, we can see that the next earnings season is going to be the one that’s very difficult.” He added that although companies were raising earnings projections, it was because their original forecasts were “unreasonably negative”.Among stocks in the news, AmeriCredit surged 21.4 per cent to $23.91 after General Motorsannounced it was buying the auto finance lender for $24.50 a share. The $3.5bn cash deal aims to make car-buying easier for subprime shoppers.Dell was flat in after hours trading after the SEC charged the computer maker with failing to disclose material information to investors and accounting fraud. Dell is to pay $100m and Michael Dell $4m in settlement. Amazon fell 16 per cent to $100.85 in after hours trading after it missed analysts’ estimates in its second quarter.In contrast, both Microsoft and American Express beat analysts’ expectations when they released results after the close. But after rising during the session, Microsoft nudged down 0.1 per cent to $25.81 and American Express dropped 1.9 per cent to $42.35 in after hours trading.Caterpillar, the biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, was up 1.7 per cent to $68.00 as it beat expectations and raised its full year outlook. It said its strong order book was defying concerns about the global economy. It posted a second-quarter profit of $1.09 a share, up from 60 cents a share.The S&P 500 industrials sector gained 3.1 per cent as 3M raised guidance. Emerging markets growth helped it report a 43 per cent jump in profits. Its shares rose
3 per cent to $84.75.The delivery companyUPS, seen by investors as a leading indicator for global trade, raised its annual profit forecast and posted better than expected profits. Its shares rose 5.2 per cent to $63.15. Demand for smartphones boosted earnings at AT&T, the largest US phone group and Qualcomm, which makes chips for mobile phones. AT&T reported better than expected profits. Earnings before some exceptional items were 61 cents per share, against average estimates of 57 cents. Its shares rose 2.4 per cent to $25.51.Shares in Qualcomm pushed up 8.2 per cent to $39.11 as it benefited from strong demand for smartphones based on Google’s Android technology which needs more complex, expensive chips.Earnings rose to 47 cents per share from 44 cents per share for the same period a year ago. The S&P financial sector rose 3.1 per cent and the regional banks rallying 3.9 per cent. Fifth Third Bancorp led the way, up 10.4 per cent to $12.45 after posting its first profit in four quarters and announcing lower loan loss provisions.Other companies beating expectations included Ebay, which rose 3.8 per cent to $20.94. Philip Morris International was up 1.9 per cent to $50.84.Starbucks raised full-year guidance after it reported a 37 per cent rise in third quarter profit, in line with expectations. Its shares fell 0.1 per cent to $24.69."
301;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Banks volatile ahead of stress test verdict;Pound boosted by strong UK GDP data;Equities, commodities and the euro enjoyed a strong session on Thursday as investors cast aside their doubts about the global recovery and instead embraced a batch of robust earnings and economic releases.Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, unnerved the markets on Wednesday when he spoke of an “unusually uncertain” outlook for the US economy, and said the central bank was prepared to take further policy actions.But analysts said the Fed chief had said little that was actually new. Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank said: “In reality the sell-off after Mr Bernanke’s comments could be seen as a reversal of the expectations that some form of policy easing would be announced.”Investors quickly put aside any disappointment as strong economic data in Europe and encouraging corporate earnings in the US rekindled confidence in the global outlook.The imminent publication of the results of stress tests on European banks also seemed to hold few fears for the markets, though there was deep scepticism among some in the markets as to how useful they would actually be.Marc Ostwald at Monument Securities said: “Why should these stress tests be viewed as some form of cathartic panacea from which markets can take reassurance about the health of the European banking sector, and identify the so-called villains?“If history teaches us one thing, it is that these tests will not test for whatever is actually the next stress event, and will not account – or at least not sufficiently – for the lateral or nuclear fallout events associated with whatever engenders the stress.”However, there were more concrete signs that the non-financial corporate sector was weathering the crisis. Caterpillar, 3M and, crucially, United Parcel Service – often seen as a bellwether for the US economy – all unveiled forecast-beating quarterly results and improved outlooks. Positive data releases on both sides of the Atlantic also helped investors put aside worries that the global recovery was faltering.The day’s key release showed that the eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index rose from 56.0 to 56.7 in July, compared with an expected drop to 55.2 – indicating increased activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors in the region.That offered a marked contrast to recent declines in the US manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs and suggested the eurozone might be evading the risk of a double-dip recession, analysts said.UK retail sales also offered a positive surprise as they rose 0.7 per cent last month, more than expected, although economists said this was due in no small part to the “World Cup effect”.The encouraging economic newsflow continued across the Atlantic, where US existing home sales and the Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators both fell by less than expected last month.The burst of optimism among investors drove equity prices higher.In New York, the S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained 2.1 per cent.In Asia, Shanghai rose for a fourth straight day, buoyed by hopes of easier monetary policy in the second half, although the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 0.6 per cent.The Vix equity volatility index fell 3.6 per cent to 24.72.Commodities rallied across the board. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index struck a one-month high as US oil jumped $2 a barrel and copper struck a two-month peak above $7,000 a tonne.In the currency markets, the euro rose back above $1.29 and the commodity-focused Australian and New Zealand dollars also gained ground.A drop in dollar interbank rates added to pressure on the US currency. Three-month dollar Libor fell below 0.5 per cent for the first time since May.In government bonds the two-year US Treasury yield was steady at its record low of 0.56 per cent, while the 10-year yield rose 3bp to 2.93 per cent.The 10-year German Bund yield rose 5bp to 2.67 per cent.
302;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Industrial groups defy gloom with strong orders;Bullish calls and sound profits from both Caterpillar and 3M;Two of the US’s biggest industrial companies on Thursday brushed aside concerns about a further global economic slowdown as they raised forecasts for full-year profits and said their order books were strengthening.Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, and 3M, which manufactures a wide range of products from sticky tape to traffic signs, both issued the bullish calls while reporting second-quarter profits ahead of Wall Street expectations.The results and improved outlooks pushed up the companies’ share prices, in turn helping to lift the broader market in New York. Caterpillar and 3M are components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Worries over weak private sector job creation, uncertain equity markets and a moribund construction industry have prompted many observers to take an increasingly gloomy view of the US’s economic recovery.With Europe’s financial woes and signs of slowing growth in China, many are concerned at the prospect of a double-dip recession.However, the US industrial sector is striking a quite different tone. The results from Caterpillar and 3M came a day after United Technologies, Eaton Corp and Textron issued results well ahead of analysts’ expectations.“While there are significant economic concerns around the world that we are watching closely, orders have continued to outpace our shipments, and we expect to increase production in the second half of the year,” said Doug Oberhelman, Caterpillar’s chief executive.Caterpillar made a net profit in the quarter of $707m or $1.09 per share, up from $371m or 60 cents a share in the same period last year and beating analysts’ consensus forecast of about 85 cents per share.Caterpillar’s revenues in the second quarter were $10.4bn, up from $8bn last year and above expectations of about $9.8bn.The company increased its outlook for the full year, saying it expected 2010 profits of $3.15-$3.85 per share on revenues of $39bn-$42bn, up from its prior forecast of $2.50-$3.25 per share and revenues of $38bn-$42bn.Meanwhile, 3M made a net profit of $1.12bn or $1.54 per share in the second quarter, up from $783m or $1.12 per share last year and ahead of analysts’ expectations of $1.48 per share. Revenues rose to $6.7bn from $5.7bn a year earlier.The company expects full-year earnings of $5.65-$5.80 per share, up from its prior projection of $5.40-$5.60.“There will possibly be a period of slower growth in end markets later this year,” said George Buckley, chief executive of 3M. “This isn’t a “double-dip” per se. It’s just a soft spot – very normal as economic growth takes a breather for a while.”
303;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;European hopes trump US uncertainty;Solid economic data spark rally in euro and equities;Thursday 20:00 BST. A solid bunch of European economic data and US company earnings has overshadowed Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s cautious tone about the pace of the economic recovery.The FTSE All-World equity index has reversed an early decline and is now up 1.9 per cent, commodities are higher and US Treasury yields are moving up. The S&P 500 index in New York has closed up 2.3 per cent, its best performance in two weeks.Uncertainty is a market’s kryptonite. So, when Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, said late on Wednesday that the outlook for the US economy was “unusually uncertain”, it swiftly weakened traders’ resolve, and US and Asian markets fled from risk.Mr Bernanke during his second day of testimony has helped to counter that soundbite. He acknowledged that recent economic data did not “radically change our basic outlook” of a moderate recovery, and stressed what the Fed could do – rather than on Wednesday, when he talked about what it could not do – if the economy were to falter.On some days, merely mentioning that possibility would be enough to send markets into a tailspin. But traders took it all in their stride as European economic news was surprisingly strong. UK retail sales, and eurozone services, manufacturing and industrial orders data all beat forecasts, reducing fears about economic fragility.Notably, US traders were not cowed by a rise in initial jobless claims, which were dismissed as mere summer volatility from seasonal plant shut-downs. New claims were still below the fear level of 500,000. US markets were also unconcerned by less-than-forecast dips in existing home sales and the leading economic indicators.The bulls are also getting excited about relief from another uncertainty: the European bank stress tests. The stage has been set for a positive result to the stress tests. Various media reports suggest that Greek and Spanish banks will do quite well, though all is still in the realm of rumour. Their ultimate impact on sentiment may also be blunted by fears that the conditions used were not terribly stressful.A batch of upbeat company reports was icing on the cake. Caterpillar said its order book for industrial equipment was still strong, and raised its forecasts for later this year. To some degree, markets already knew about the industrial recovery. More interesting was Blackstone’s report that improving property values powered its return to profit.UPS, AT&T and 3M also beat expectations, and Credit Suisse, like Morgan Stanley on Wednesday, posted decent enough results, as profits rose 1 per cent over last year. The FTSE Global Bank index is up 2.7 per cent.After the closing bell, results from Amazon, American Express, and Microsoft were the focus of attention and Amazon missed estimates sparking a plunge of 14 per cent in the internet retailer’s stock price in after-hours trading. Amex and Microsoft beat estimates, and their stocks have rallied in after-hours activity.Also making news is Dell, as the computer maker has agreed to pay $100m, while Michael Dell, the chief executive officer will pay $4m to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims that the company used fraudulent accounting to meet earnings targets. The stock is up 2.5 per cent in after-hours trade.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index closed up 0.1 per cent as the region reacted relatively calmly to Wall Street’s drop. Most of the damage was done by Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 fell 0.6 per cent as the rising yen again battered exporters.Hong Kong added 0.5 per cent and the increasingly maverick Shanghai market climbed 1.1 per cent. This is the fourth day in a row that the mainland benchmark has gained ground and has left investors hoping that the previously under-performing exchange may have put in a floor.● Europe. Bourses opened lower by about 0.6 per cent in reaction to Wall Street’s late slide, but the upbeat economic data and hopes for an early release of the bank stress tests soon encouraged buyers. The FTSE 100 in London was up 1.9 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was higher by 2.1 per cent as banks and miners gain ground.Energy producers were also among the top performers, following an announcement that the world’s biggest oil companies, except BP, had agreed a $1bn fund for spill clean-ups.● Forex. The dollar has resumed its usual position as the loser in a risky asset rally, and is today down 0.9 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. It is also off 1.1 per cent versus the euro at $1.2897, as the single currency continues its bull run amid European economic improvement and, of late, anticipated relief following the stress tests.The yen was again the beneficiary of broader market malaise early on as the Japanese unit continues to be the reluctant haven of choice. But the improvement in sentiment has seen the yen pull back. It is down 0.9 per cent against the surging euro at Y112.03, though it is mostly flat against the dollar, still hovering near 20-month highs near Y86.● Debt. Bonds are not seeing nearly as strong a reaction as equities. The two-year note yield is sitting unchanged at its record low of 0.56 per cent, while the 10-year yield is up 4 basis points at 2.93 per cent, near its 2010 lows. Mr Bernanke’s soothing offer of potential government support may ease economic fears, but it also fuels many bond bulls who see looser monetary conditions ahead.Europe’s periphery received a boost after investors purchased the entirety of a Hungarian auction of 12-month bills. Though the yield was 5.75 per cent, 32bp higher than the previous sale of such bills, to sell the whole run was a relative success. Investors balked at two auctions last week, following the International Monetary Fund’s concerns that Hungary’s austerity measures were insufficient.Greek bonds were higher, with the 10-year falling 9 basis points to yield 10.55 per cent, though Portuguese and Spanish debt yields ticked upwards. The stress test rumours were most specific about the six Greek banks, which were said to have mostly passed, even with tougher conditions.● Commodities. A greater aversion to risk and pared growth expectations initially led to selling in the metals complex. However, most metals are now higher.

304;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-07-22T12:52:25Z;Caterpillar shrugs off industrial concerns;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, brushed off worries about a slowdown in global industrial demand on Thursday, saying its strong order book was defying concerns about the world economy as it raised its forecast for full-year profits and reported earnings for the second quarter of the year that were far ahead of Wall Street expectations.The company – which is widely seen as a bellwether for the global industrial economy – made a net profit in the quarter of $707m or $1.09 per share, up from $371m or 60 cents per share in the same period last year and beating analysts’ consensus forecast of about 85 cents per share.Caterpillar’s revenues in the second quarter were $10.4bn, up from $8bn last year and above expectations of about $9.8bn. Two-thirds of the manufacturer’s revenues come from outside the US.The company increased its outlook for the full year, saying it expected 2010 profits of $3.15-$3.85 per share on revenues of $39bn-$42bn, up from its previous forecast of $2.50-$3.25 per share and revenues of $38bn-$42bn.Doug Oberhelman, chief executive, said the improved forecast reflected “an increase in sales and revenues and a more significant increase in profit” as a result of cost-cutting.“While there are significant economic concerns around the world that we are watching closely, orders have continued to outpace our shipments, and we expect to increase production in the second half of the year,” Mr Oberhelman said.The company said it had taken on 3,650 employees so far this year to help ramp up production, 1,250 in the US and 2,400 outside the US. Caterpillar has plans to take on 9,000 workers this year.Caterpillar shares were up slightly in pre-market trading at $66.90.
305;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-07-18T22:40:29Z;Caterpillar chief warns over tight credit;;Lenders in the US have gone too far in tightening credit requirements for small and medium-sized companies, putting unnecessary strain on the supply chains that serve some of the US’s biggest companies, Caterpillar’s new chief executive has warned.In his first big interview since taking the helm at the world’s largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment this month, Doug Oberhelman also said he expected that Caterpillar would have to extend into next year a programme the company introduced during the downturn in which it extended credit to its suppliers who were unable to secure loans.“Companies like Caterpillar, with our credit rating, are very liquid. We can raise adequate funds with great spreads. But as you go down there’s a liquidity crunch,” he said.“The sad thing is that most banks that serve our customer and contractor base are also liquid, but they’re not lending.”“There’s a lot of uncertainty in the system about where we’re going and the capital requirements have risen – which is wise – but if that swings too far, like it has, we have a liquidity crunch for mid-size and small customers. That’s what we see today.”Mr Oberhelman’s comments come amid widespread concern that smaller US companies – which account for the vast majority of hiring – are finding it increasingly hard to borrow. The Financial Times reported last week that small businesses are having to pay more to borrow relative to the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate than at any time in at least a quarter of a century.The Obama administration is concerned that smal-ler companies’ restricted access to capital could hamper growth and job creation. It has proposed a $30bn fund to help community and neighbourhood banks raise their lending.The Caterpillar chief’s comments suggest big US corporations are also worried about the effect the credit squeeze could have on companies in their supply chains.Like other big groups such as Walmart, IBM and Cisco, Caterpillar offered supplier companies credit to help them through the downturn. “A lot of our suppliers and some of our competitors do not have the strength on the balance sheet that they need or had,” Mr Oberhelman said.He said he expected Caterpillar to extend the credit programme through the rest of this year and into 2011, suggesting that accessing loans could remain difficult for smaller companies for some time yet. He also said US manufacturing could be damaged by relatively high corporate tax rates. “When I started at Caterpillar in 1975, the US had the lowest tax at 35 per cent. Japan was at 60 per cent, Germany was at 65 per cent. Now everyone else is lower. I’m worried about that for the manufacturing base of our country.”
306;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:59:57+0000;CEO who gets down and dirty;;Doug Oberhelman does not want to meet at Caterpillar’s corporate headquarters. He prefers a rubbish dump.The new chief executive of the world’s biggest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment asked to be interviewed at a landfill project in Clinton, Illinois, about 50 miles south-east of the company’s head office in Peoria. Standing in front of a man-made crater as truckloads of garbage are dumped out, he beams, enthusiastically pointing out the Caterpillar trucks, tractors and compactors being used to process the waste.Mr Oberhelman, who officially took over at the start of July, believes seeing Caterpillar’s products being put to use is more instructive than sitting in boardrooms. It reminds people that customers come first, he says.With that in mind, he recently brought the company’s entire senior leadership team – some 35 people – on a surprise trip to the Clinton landfill. “We told them to meet in a hotel in Peoria and said: ‘Be in your chair at 8am,’” he recalls. “When they got there, there were no chairs. They were told: ‘Get on the buses, we’re going.’”At the site, the executives were split into teams and spent time with customers who had gathered there. “We listened to some good things and some bad things,” Mr Oberhelman says. “The whole point was: whatever the customer has to say, you’d better be listening.”After touring the site, the executives were taken to the main building at the plant, where they sat in the shadows of hulking Caterpillar vehicles as Mr Oberhelman outlined his new strategy. “It was very different from what we usually do,” he says. “The message was: ‘We’re going to be a different company in the future and we’re going to emphasise customers first and foremost.’”While that is not a new approach for the 100-year-old manufacturer, the 57-year-old chief executive intends to give it a renewed emphasis. He also hopes it will serve as a focus after the downturn, which hit Caterpillar hard. The company was one of the first big US corporations to warn in 2007 that the economy was entering a recession. It cut deeply in response, shedding 19,000 full-time jobs and 18,000 contract-worker positions.Now back in hiring mode, the new chief executive’s task is to set out a vision for what comes ahead. The Clinton visit came after five months of strategising about Caterpillar’s future that began last year, shortly after Mr Oberhelman was designated to be the company’s next leader.One way in which the customer-centred strategy is put into practice will be to institutionalise the kind of visit the senior executives made to the Clinton landfill.Mr Oberhelman, who rose through the company on the finance side, has only been in his office for a total of one month out of the past six. “This is my fifth visit to a customer this week and I love it,” he enthuses. “We want to be ‘in the dirt’ with a customer once a week.”Mr Oberhelman, wearing an open-necked Caterpillar-branded shirt, clearly feels more inspired in the open air than the air-conditioned office suite. He enjoys fishing and hunting, and lives on a farm near Peoria, part of which he is restoring to a wildlife environment using a Caterpillar bulldozer and wheel loader he owns.Mr Oberhelman says such hobbies help keep him grounded, although he does not get to work on his land as often as he would like.“I like an hour or two on a tractor, being able to think about things and sort them out. For a non-engineering type, I feel like I have some dirt under my fingernails,” he laughs.Those interests – and his soft-spoken, gentle and friendly approach – also reflect his Midwestern roots. Although he was born in California, he was raised in a small town in northern Illinois, where his father was a salesman for John Deere – the Illinois-based company that is the world’s biggest tractor maker and one of Caterpillar’s most serious rivals.“I still give him Caterpillar toys and trinkets at Christmas and he gives me John Deere stuff,” he smiles. “I’m the only Caterpillar person with a John Deere shelf at home.”However, when it comes to John Deere as a company, Mr Oberhelman intends to step up the rivalry. Beating the competition is the other main plank of his strategy. “Our stated goal is to be the leader in every region in which we participate,” he says. “My definition of leadership is everything: financials, market share, customer satisfaction, whatever it is. So if the leader is a competitor, that’s who you’re aiming at.”To aid that drive, his first act was to eliminate one group president position – taking the number of Caterpillar’s most senior leaders from six to five – and three vice-president posts, cutting their number from 32 to 29. As part of the shake-up, Mr Oberhelman gave group presidents more responsibility for the performance of their divisions.“We set up a very strategic business model,” he says. “I expect people to manage their businesses. I’m not going to tell them how to do it. But every month, every quarter, every year, we’re going to check in on our strategy and see how we’re doing. I’m not one for deep hands-on management.”Mr Oberhelman suggests that Caterpillar’s units had concentrated too much on performing better than each other rather than competing more efficiently with rivals. “It had been a while since we really thought about our organisation,” he says. “We had gotten off track a little bit in terms of inter-company battles. So we said: ‘Wait a minute. What we’re really after is our competition’.”He thinks the company has emerged from the downturn well equipped for that task, and draws on his own experience for parallels, working for Caterpillar in Uruguay in 1981 – shortly after devaluation in Mexico and recession in Argentina.“We had had healthy sales in South America, but they stopped after that. So I learnt business on the harsh side of recession,” he says.“I’ve seen some very tough financial times. One thing I tell our young managers is that this 2008-10 period is the best thing that ever happened to them and our company. They have now learnt what really tough conditions are like – and we haven’t had tough conditions for 20 years.”His international experience has also given Mr Oberhelman a good perspective on the global market – useful for a company two-thirds of whose sales come from outside North America. For the first time, the company is basing one group president in Asia, and it will have one-fifth of its senior leaders in the region by the end of this year. “We have a bull’s-eye on Asia for this company – short, medium and long-term,” he says.So how soon before Caterpillar has a Chinese chief executive?“We’ll see one,” he says, “though it’ll probably be a couple of generations down the road.”
307;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-07-14T20:47:07Z;Weak retail sales data leave Wall St flat;;US stocks closed mostly flat on Wednesday after a six-day winning streak, in spite of a relatively strong start to the earnings season, as a report showed that retail sales had fallen more than expected last month.Headline retail sales fell 0.5 per as car sales dropped 2.3 per cent, the second consecutive month of declines. However, core retail sales, which exclude petrol, building materials and cars, increased by 0.2 per cent, the first gain since March.There has been a steady decline in bullish sentiment on the sell-side, said John Horcher, director of sell-side sales at First Coverage, a research group that tracks market sentiment. “We are seeing the sell-side get a little more scared of the market as it’s been rising recently. Sentiment is trending downward.”After a choppy morning, the S&P 500 closed flat at 1,095.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, at 10,366.72, while the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.4 per cent to 2,249.84.Yum Brands, a fast-food chain operator that owns Taco Bell among others, was 1.2 per cent lower at $41 following the release of its second-quarter results after the market’s close on Tuesday.The company said it expected to earn $2.43 per share this year, below the average analyst estimate of $2.48.However, its earnings for the past quarter beat expectations, coming in at 58 cents per share compared with the average estimate of 54 cents.Intel added 1.7 per cent to $21.36 after reporting the best quarter in its history. Its corporate customers increased information technology spending, boosting hopes that businesses are engaged in a long-awaited “refresh” of both hardware and software in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 1.1 per cent to $7.44.But the disappointing retail sales data weighed on retailers.

308;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-07-14T01:25:02Z;JCB digs deep to restore lost profitability;;JCB, the yellow-digger maker and a bellwether for the UK industry, expects to make “substantial improvements in profitability” this year, the group said.The private company was hurt by the global construction downturn in 2009 but avoided losses, recording pre-tax profits of £29m ($44m) on sales one-third lower at £1.35bn.Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman, declined to forecast profit numbers during an interview at JCB’s Staffordshire headquarters, but predicted that volumes would rise from 36,000 units last year to 48,000 in 2010. This compares with 57,000 in 2008 and 72,000 in 2007. He said: “Sales and profits are up substantially in the first half of this year.”Sir Anthony said that recoveries in Asian construction markets such as China, India, Vietnam and Indonesia were driving sales growth.However, he was “concerned that there is no bright spark in mainland Europe, where we could go back into recession”. The UK is also exposed to a double dip, the prominent Tory donor said, but the rapid fiscal deficit reduction masterminded by George Osborne, chancellor, was “absolutely right”.David Phillips, managing director of Off Highway Research, a construction machinery consultancy, said: “The fact that JCB stayed profitable makes them one of the few companies in the industry to have weathered the recession in a meaningful way.”Mr Phillips said that the group’s private status – it is owned by the Bamford family – had helped it respond faster to the downturn than some quoted rivals.The business responded to the construction slump by cutting its workforce from 10,000 to 7,000, 4,000 of whom are based in the UK. JCB is now recruiting again and is sponsoring an engineering academy for 14-18 year olds in Staffordshire.The company absorbed the bulk of redundancy costs in 2008, with the result that profits fell to £28m that year from £187m in 2007. Matthew Taylor left the chief executive role after revealing the decline, to be replaced by Alan Blake.JCB ranks third in the world by volume in its segment of the earthmoving machinery market, behind Caterpillar of the US and Komatsu of Japan. It ranks sixth overall, according to Off Highway Research.The company has built a strong competitive position in India, where it sells 34 per cent of all earthmoving equipment. However, it is less strongly represented in the larger Chinese market, which is forecast to grow at 15 to 20 per cent this year.JCB has invested £80m in developing fuel-efficient diesel engines as part of a broader push by manufacturers to improve their environmental credentials.The company has also departed from its “any colour as long as it’s yellow” design philosophy by producing diggers with Union flag paint jobs.………………………………………….Chairman voices piracy worries to China’s premierSir Anthony Bamford has called unlicensed copying of western technology by Asian manufacturers “a cancer” and has complained to Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, writes Jonathan Guthrie.Sir Anthony, chairman of JCB, described intellectual property theft by Asian rivals as “a hell of a challenge”. He said it was a greater problem for western manufacturers than the low-cost bases of Asian counterparts.JCB was one of a group of western construction machinery companies that reported Asian rivals to the German police at the Bauma trade show in Munich this year, alleging intellectual property theft. As a result, machines with suspect features were removed from display stands by police.JCB is taking legal action against a Chinese company and a South Korean group in the German and Indian courts. Sir Anthony said JCB would sue copyists “wherever they sell these products”. He said: “They are scooping up on a huge scale products that took a lifetime to develop.”The industrialist raised the Chinese design piracy issue with Mr Wen at a banquet. According to Sir Anthony: “He said that China was a vast country with millions of mouths to feed, and that many Chinese businesses were suing Chinese competitors for the same reason [we were].”
309;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-06-29T22:02:17Z;Caterpillar expands in emerging markets;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment, on Tuesday signalled a big increase in production in emerging markets, expanding its manufacturing facilities in China and Brazil and preparing to base a top executive in Asia for the first time.The moves underline how US manufacturers have used the recession as an opportunity to redistribute their global workforces to reflect more accurately the sources of demand.Caterpillar – which receives about two-thirds of revenues from non-US sales – shed 19,000 full-time positions and 18,000 contract-worker jobs last year. This year, it plans to hire 9,000 workers, but two-thirds will be outside the US in markets such as Asia and Latin America, which have driven demand for its products.Like many companies in the sector, Caterpillar– a bellwether industrial company – has been buoyed by sales outside North America and has focused on emerging markets as the central element of its growth strategy. The company raised its expectations for sales this year to $38bn-$42bn in April, citing strong demand in emerging markets.To demonstrate its commitment to international sales, Doug Oberhelman, who will take over as Caterpillar chief executive on Thrusday, is relocating Rich Lavin, his group president with responsibility for emerging markets, to Asia – the first time in the company’s history that one of its senior leaders will be based outside the US or Europe. It is understood that Mr Lavin will operate from Hong Kong.Caterpillar said on Tuesday that it will build a new facility in Brazil to produce backhoe loaders and small-wheel loaders for the Latin American market. It said it was finalising the location of the new factory, which it expects to begin building late this year or next.The equipment-maker also announced plans to quadruple its production of excavators in China within four years by building a third plant in Xuzhou. Caterpillar added that it would buy out the 16 per cent stake in its Chinese joint venture from Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, making its facilities wholly owned by the US company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.“For Caterpillar to maintain its industry leadership, it is critical that we continue to invest in our operations in emerging markets to support our customers,” said Mr Lavin.“In the next few years, we expect China to continue to invest heavily across the country in a wide range of infrastructure improvements, and it is critical for Caterpillar and its dealer network to continue investing in China to increase manufacturing operations, research and development, marketing and customer support for success in this growing market.”

The company has yet to announce a decision on whether it will pay a dividend to shareholders.Barack Obama, US president, wants the oil major to set up an escrow account to pay the claims for damages caused by its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Helix Energy Solutions climbed 10 per cent to $11.59 as it was hired to help BP in its efforts to clean up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Cablevision Systems advanced 5 per cent to $24.57 as the cable network provider agreed to buy Bresnan Communications, a cable services operator, from Providence Equity Partners for $1.37bn to expand in the western US.Ocwen Financial, a provider of residential and commercial mortgage loan servicing, added 5.6 per cent to $10.98 as the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Jefferies with a target price of $13 per share.The company recently bought HomEq, Barclays Capital’s subprime residential mortgage servicing unit, for $1.35bn.Positive comments by analysts at Deutsche Bank boosted airline stocks as the bank initiated coverage of the sector.AMR, the parent of American Airlines, increased 2.3 per cent to $8.45 as it was rated a “buy” by the broker.Delta Air Lines, a big network airline, was also rated “buy”, sending its shares up 1.8 per cent to $13.69.Referring to these national airline stocks, the analysts said: “We think the names are highly leveraged to an economic recovery; will benefit from balance sheet deleveraging; focused on growing margins rather than gaining market share (i.e. capacity-less recovery); and attractively valued.”JetBlue Airways, a low-cost airline, rallied 2 per cent to $6.63 after the stock was rated “buy” by Deutsche and upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at Bank of America.Industrial stocks led the market’s rise, with Caterpillar climbing most. The construction and mining equipment maker rose 1.3 per cent to $61. Fluor, an engineering and construction company, gained 0.4 per cent to $45.81, while rival URS added 2.1 per cent to $42.95.Marsh & McLennanrose 3.5 per cent to $22.85 as Mercer, its consulting unit, agreed to pay $500m to settle a lawsuit brought by the Alaska Retirement Management Board.Mosaic, a leading fertiliser maker, was 2.8 per cent lower at $43.97 on reports it was in talks to acquire Grupo Fertinal, a Mexican fertiliser company, in a deal worth up to $1bn. It would give Mosaic its first presence in Mexico."
313;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-06-13T20:18:56Z;Interview with Steve Roell, Johnson Controls chief executive;;From deep in the bowels of Johnson Controls’ headquarters in the Milwaukee suburbs, Steve Roell is being watched.On a bank of monitors, an employee surveys information about the temperature and lighting around the complex – down to the detail of conditions in the chairman and chief executive’s office. On sunny days, lighting can be dimmed to save energy. When employees clock out, the lights and air conditioning in their offices are automatically switched off.The control room highlights the sort of building efficiencies that Johnson Controls expects will be an increasingly important part of its business in the coming decade. When the company doubled the size of the building two years ago, it added efficiencies that it reckons accrue to $1.5m in energy savings annually.In the car world, Johnson Controls is thought of as just one of several auto suppliers, a maker of a range of products from electronics to seats. Yet Mr Roell’s vision for the future of the company revolves more around its building efficiency division.He says building efficiency will become Johnson Controls’ main revenue stream within a decade, accounting for 80 per cent of acquisitions and 17,000 new workers – compared with the 15,000 jobs the company cut last year, most of them in its auto unit.The chief executive is keen to point out that plan represents a return to the historical roots of the company, which was founded in 1885 by Warren Johnson, inventor of the thermostat.“We’ve only been in the auto industry for 25 years,” Mr Roell says. “We’ve been in building efficiency for 125 years.”As well as its headquarters, Johnson Controls is touting its project to retrofit the Empire State Building, which it says will save 38 per cent on energy costs and pay for itself in three years.In spite of this focus, the stimulus-led boom in car sales has in the meantime re-established auto as the company’s principal source of revenues after slumping last year. The unit has also drawn attention because of Johnson Controls’ $1.25bn bid last month for Visteon’s interiors and electronics business.The Visteon acquisition would give Johnson Controls both new technology and a much enhanced presence in China, but is opposed by Visteon’s board, which wants to press on with its own plan to exit from bankruptcy.Although Johnson Controls has indicated it could sweeten the bid after some due diligence, Mr Roell says his interest is not unconditional. Would he still be interested in Visteon if it emerges from Chapter 11? “It depends. Not as much as we’re interested in them now,” he says.“There are some economics that make it attractive now that don’t make it attractive in a post-bankruptcy world. There’s a window right now [for a deal to be done].”Johnson Controls’ interest in the auto sector and in green technology come together in its battery-making unit. The company is the first in the industry to produce lithium-ion batteries for mass-produced hybrid vehicles for Mercedes-Benz.In a joint venture with Saft of France and with a $300m grant from the US stimulus package, it is also building a facility in Michigan and has production contracts with Ford, Daimler and BMW and pre-production development contracts with Jaguar Land Rover and Volkswagen.In general, Mr Roell says the US auto suppliers have emerged stronger than he expected from the downturn, and their relations with GM and Chrysler are “much more open and strategic” than before.He is worried, though, about Europe, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of Johnson Controls’ revenue. “Some of the lower-tier, privately held European suppliers got over-extended,” he says.“A lot of small firms put in a lot of capacity back in 2007-08, so they’re highly leveraged. The majority of our issues on the supply base are in Europe – particularly around plastics and injection-moulding. That supply base has weakened.”Mr Roell expects economic recovery in the US to be slow, but does not fear a “double dip”. He says recent disappointing data on job-creation reflect a wariness among US companies that could come back to haunt them.“Productivity has shot through the roof and people have enjoyed that, and now they’re just being cautious. They may get caught if the recovery is stronger,” he says. “If people are too conservative in investing, or have taken too much capacity out, they won’t be able to take advantage of the recovery.”“As the economy recovers, the ability to attract and recruit talent’s going to get more difficult. If you wait too long, you could end up not being able to take advantage of some of the opportunities that exist.”In a global market, however, the talent pool is international. Like other big US manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Johnson Controls has used the recession as a way to diversify its employee base away from established markets. While most of the cuts it made last year were in North America and western Europe, many of its hires will be in emerging economies.In a view that the Obama administration would find difficult to stomach, Mr Roell says that is a pattern he sees more generally across big US manufacturers.“Hiring is going to have to come from outside the US and western Europe – in eastern Europe, Brazil and Asia, because that’s where the growth will be,” he says. “It’s hard for me to perceive that the US is going to be the global driver of jobs in the future.”
314;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-06-09T23:06:41Z;CVS steps up battle with rival drugstore;;CVS Caremark, the drugstore and benefits management company, on Wednesday hit back at its rival Walgreens in an escalating war between the two largest US drugstore chains over their multibillion-dollar prescription drug sales.CVS said that members of its Caremark benefit plans would no longer be able to fill discounted prescriptions at Walgreens, taking away a business that directly accounted for 7 per cent of its rival’s annual revenues of $63bn last year.Walgreens said on Monday that it would no longer participate in new or renewed plans developed by CVS Caremark, in a challenge to the three-year-old $26bn merger of CVS’s drugstores and Caremark’s prescription benefit manager (PBM) business.It accused CVS of using Caremark to steer business to its own stores and mail order service.PBMs such as Caremark, Medco and Express Scripts negotiate bulk drug discounts and process payments on behalf of employers and insurance schemes.CVS Caremark yesterday again accused Walgreens of a “transparent attempt to try to raise the pharmacy reimbursement rates it receives” when it fills prescriptions.It also argued that its retaliatory move, which takes effect in 30 days, would not hurt the attractiveness of its PBM.CVS Caremark said its network had 57,000 participating pharmacies without Walgreens and only 0.2 per cent of its members would now have to travel more than three miles to find a participating drugstore.The battle comes at a time when the competition implications of the CVS Caremark merger are under investigation by 24 states, and by the Federal Trade Commission.The deal has also faced bitter complaints from independent pharmacy operators.The conflict highlights the changing dynamics of the retail prescription industry, with pharmacy chains exploring different tactics to steer prescription business to their stores and to compete with low cost mail order services.Both Walgreens and Walmart, the discounter, have been working on preferential drug plan arrangements, developed under a new direct-to-employer plan now used by Caterpillar, the US heavy equipment manufacturer.Walgreens is particularly unhappy with CVS Caremark’s Maintenance Choice prescription plan for chronic ailments, under which patients are required to use either its own stores, or use mail order.In an interview with the Financial Times, Greg Wasson, chief executive of Walgreens, said the plan was “a restrictive network that prevents patients from being able to use their pharmacist”.“And one patient that has known our Walgreens pharmacists for years and can no longer use them is more than enough for me.” He declined to estimate the impact of the lost business on Walgreens’ non-pharmacy sales.Carol Levenson, analyst at Gimme Credit, the bond research firm, said in a note to clients that “common sense says that the two need to reach some kind of agreement” in what she characterised as a contract negotiation over reimbursement rates that has come into the open.

The commander of the US spill-response team said it was not known how much crude continued to leak from the company’s Gulf of Mexico well. BP faces pressure by US lawmakers to reduce its dividend payment.Caterpillar rallied 1.4 per cent to $56.61 after the construction equipment company affirmed its long-term profit target. It said it expected to earn $8 to $10 per share during 2012.Talbots, an apparel retailer, lost 9.5 per cent to $12.20 in spite of reporting better-than-expected second-quarter profit. It forecast full-year earnings that beat average analyst estimates.Dollar General gained 2.1 per cent to $29.83 after the discount retailer reported its first-quarter results and raised its profit forecast for the full year. It expects to earn as much as $1.69 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share.Fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s pushed 2.4 per cent higher to $68.38 as it reported better-than-expected May sales. Established restaurant sales were up 4.8 per cent globally.But the company said a weak euro was expected to lower full-year profit. About 41 per cent of McDonald’s revenues were recorded in Europe last year.Rival Burger King said on Monday it was also expecting unfavourable currency conversion effects to hurt its full-year results. The chain was up 0.8 per cent to $18.37 on Tuesday.Materials stocks were some of the session’s best performers as the price of gold and copper rose.Southern Copper added 6.3 per cent to $27.89, Newmont Mining climbed 2.3 per cent to $56.45 and Alcoa rallied 2.4 per cent to $10.76.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was 4.8 per cent higher at $61.48.

Netflix, an online film rental company, bucked the trend to rise 1.1 per cent to $110.33 as its target price was increased to $130 from $120 at Caris.JPMorgan Chase rose 2.9 per cent to $37.78 on reports it is selling about $716m of bonds tied to commercial properties on less favourable terms than when the debt was issued.Bank of America was up 3.4 per cent to $15.33, Citigroup added 2.2 per cent to $3.72, and Morgan Stanley advanced 1.2 per cent to $25.59.
316;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-06-04T18:06:50Z;S&P in retreat after weak jobs report;;US stocks turned sharply lower on Friday after a disappointing jobs report reignited doubts about the strength of the economic recovery and put the market on track for losses over the week.US employment rose by 431,000 jobs last month, considerably fewer than the consensus economist estimate of 540,000.Census hiring added 411,000 temporary jobs to the payroll gain.“The unemployment numbers were abysmal,” said Andrew Neale, a partner at Fogel Neale Partners. “We are recommending our clients to be underweight equities and we have been for several weeks now, until we get some strength back in the underlying fundamentals.”However, the unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent was better than the 9.8 per cent estimate.The negative news on jobs, which came as a surprise, snapped two straight days of gains for US stocks in a week shortened by the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.By midday on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 2 per cent to 1,080.96, on course for a weekly decline of 0.8 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 2.1 per cent to 10,042.69, set for a weekly loss of 0.9 per cent.Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 1.8 per cent on the day to 2,262.36, which would make for a slight gain of 0.2 per cent on the week.Mr Neale said the stock market remained in “correction mode” and that he expected volatility ahead.Volatility “may be good for professional traders, but it is very unnerving for the small investors”.The Vix, a widely watched measure of market volatility, on Friday jumped 11 per cent to 32.69.Beyond assessments of the health of the US economy, ongoing concerns about Europe, most recently Hungary, also continued to weigh on sentiment during the week while efforts to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil spill remained in focus.Within the S&P 500, energy stocks seesawed during the week and on Friday were down 1.2 per cent, but they still were outperforming the wider market.Industrial and financial shares, which were lower by 3.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent, respectively, were being hit hard on the back of the jobs report.Among the laggards at midday were General Electric, down 3.9 per cent at $15.81, and JPMorgan, which had lost 1.9 per cent to $38.34. Caterpillar had lost 3.8 per cent to $58.80, helping to weigh on the Dow.Bank of New York Mellon was 3 per cent lower to $26.45 after it announced that it would offer $700m of common stock to help fund its purchase of a unit of PNC Financial Services.The world’s biggest custody bank agreed in February to pay $2.3bn for Pittsburgh-based PNC’s global investment-servicing business as BNY Mellon aimed to add more hedge fund and mutual fund clients.Shares in bailed-out insurer AIG lost 1.3 per cent to $34.74.Robert Benmosche, chief executive, is reported to have asked the board for time to consider options besides a public offering for spinning off AIA, its Asian unit.A deal to sell AIA to Prudential, a London-listed insurer, collapsed on Wednesday.US Steel dropped 5.9 per cent to $42.59 after the steel producer was removed from the Americas conviction buy list at Goldman Sachs.Rival AK Steel dropped 5.6 per cent to $13.67.US-listed shares in AngloGold Ashanti declined 1.4 per cent to $41.96 after the world’s third-largest gold producer said it had “fully closed” its Moab Khotsong mine in South Africa following a fatal accident on Wednesday.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts rose 12 per cent to $4.13 as the food chain lifted its earnings forecasts. It is projecting full-year operating profit of up to $15m.
317;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-06-03T22:39:52Z;US manufacturers cautious on recovery;;When Boeing, the world’s second biggest aircraft-maker, announced this year that it planned to increase production of its 777, 747 and 737 models ahead of schedule, it was a positive sign for global industrial demand.Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing for Boeing’s commercial arm, deemed 2010 “the year of overall economic recovery” and said the company was anticipating greater customer demand for aircraft.Yet, as it readies itself for the production increases, Boeing is not only holding off on hiring significant numbers of new employees, it is completing a job-cutting plan that will see the company shed more than 10,000 positions – the vast majority of them in the US.As the US releases closely watched non-farm payroll figures on Friday, companies such as Boeing which are cutting jobs are likely to appear the exception. Economists expect the report to show that the US economy added more than 500,000 jobs in May, a sharp increase on the 290,000 jobs that were added in April.While much of the rise relates to a one-off increase in hiring of census workers by the US government, the manufacturing sector is expected to add some 30,000 new jobs. Manufacturing has played a critical role in job creation as the recovery has started to establish itself more firmly in the US.Since December 2009, the sector has helped lead the way for the broader economy, rebounding sharply and adding a little more than 100,000 jobs out of a total increase of about 573,000.Yet if Boeing – one of the US’s biggest manufacturers and exporters – is being cautious, it suggests that the industrial sector may not be able to bear the job-creation expectations that have been thrust upon it.“It is difficult to imagine the pace of downsizing slowing even further, considering that the economy, while recovering, is still in a relatively fragile state,” said John Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the placement company.One factor that may restrain hiring in the manufacturing sector is greater productivity. Non-farm productivity rose at an annualised rate of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter, better than the 2.5 per cent increase most economists had expected. “Companies continue to squeeze quite a bit of output from only small increases in hours worked,” observed analysts at Goldman Sachs.Boeing’s reluctance to wade into the hiring pool stems in part from productivity improvements resulting from capital investment and evolving production techniques, said Tim Healy, a company spokesman.Other manufacturers have used the recession to reassess the global distribution of their workforce. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, shed 19,000 full-time positions and 18,000 contract-worker jobs last year. This year, it has announced a plan to hire back 9,000 workers, but two-thirds of them will be outside the US, in markets such as Asia and Latin America, which have driven demand for its products.As that experience suggests, much of manufacturing’s recent strength has been built on sales abroad. The export component of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index climbed to its highest reading in two decades in May. “This is good news for manufacturers since manufacturing dominates US exports [59 per cent] and more than a quarter of manufacturing employment is supported by exports,” said David Huether, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.However, the US export drive could be damped by contracting European demand and a possible slowdown in Chinese industrial demand.Back in the US, some stimulus spending is starting to be exhausted, while the recently expired new homebuyers’ tax credit is expected to retard growth in new home sales.Industrial hiring is starting again from a low base. Since the start of the recession, US manufacturers have cut more than 2m factory jobs. Many will never be replaced. Mr Huether believes that only 30 per cent will come back over the next six years. IHS Global Insight, a research company, predicts that perhaps half of the lost jobs may return.But even if growth and job creation in manufacturing – in the US and elsewhere – slows somewhat, most economists expect the trend to continue. JP Morgan estimates global industrial production will grow at an annualised rate of 6 per cent in the next quarter.
318;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-06-01T20:41:18Z;Wall Street lower on mixed data;;"US stocks bounced around the flat line on Tuesday but closed lower on the day, as the day’s mixed macroeconomic data gave support to both the bulls and the bears.Early in the session investors digested disappointing manufacturing reports from China, which suggested that future global economic growth might be weaker than previously expected.However, strong US manufacturing data provided evidence that a domestic recovery remains relatively unaffected by problems in the eurozone.The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing survey index fell less than expected by economists, to 59.7 in May, just off the six-year-high mark reached in April.Jim Dunigan, executive vice-president and managing executive of investments at PNC Wealth Management, was bullish on US growth prospects.He said: “The bottom line is that, in spite of all the negative news, the recovery here remains on track.” Mr Dunigan expects sectors that are most exposed to the recovery to perform best, namely technology and industrials.The S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,070.71, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 10,024.02 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent lower to 2,222.33.US-listed shares in BP sank 15 per cent to $36.52 as traders got their first chance to react to news that its latest attempt to cut the rate of oil leaking from its well in the Gulf of Mexico had failed.The company’s ‘top kill’ strategy failed to close the leak at the weekend, forcing it to start a long process of installing a cap on the well.There was also speculation that BP, whose shares have lost almost 40 per cent of their value since the spill begun, could be a takeover target.Transocean, the deep-water driller and owner of the oil rig, lost 11.9 per cent to $50.04 and Halliburton, a contractor on the oil rig, declined 14.8 per cent to $21.15. Among the session’s biggest fallers were oil drillers and energy-related stocks. Diamond Offshoreslumped 7.3 per cent to $58.51, Smith Internationalfell 8.3 per cent to $34.45 and Schlumberger retreated 7.8 per cent to $51.75.Construction equipment maker Caterpillar declined 2.5 per cent to $59.27 after it said its Progress Rail Services unit would buy Electro-Motive Diesel for $820m in cash from Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group, two private equity groups.The target had $1.8bn in revenue last year.AIG fell 3.2 per cent to $34.25 as the insurer rejected a revised $30.4bn cash and shares offer by London-listed insurer Prudential for its Asian insurance business but remained in negotiations.RadioShack bucked the day’s downward trend and rallied 2.8 per cent to $21.01, making it one of the best performers of the session, on renewed rumours that the electronics retailer is in negotiations to sell itself.Reports named Blackstone Group, a private equity group, as a leading bidder. The deal may be worth as much as $3bn.Consumer staples companies were some of the strongest performers. Hershey, a confectioner, rallied 2.6 per cent to $48. The

The target price on the stock was raised by at least two brokers.Barclays Capital and UBS, which have an “overweight” and a “buy” rating on Apple, respectively, both raised their price target from $315 to $320.Financials were lower. JPMorgan pulled back 2.6 per cent to $38.54 and Morgan Stanley lost 3.6 per cent to $26.13.Citigroup slipped 2.8 per cent to $3.85 even as Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jaber Al-Thani, Qatar’s prime minister, was reported to have said his government is considering buying a stake in the bank."

It then rallied to 1,087.69, 1.5 per cent higher – but still 12 per cent off its 2010 peak.“A 10 per cent correction, even in a bull market, is pretty normal,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff. “The European debt crisis is certainly the catalyst for this renewed round of risk aversion but is not out of line with market patterns over the past century.”The Nasdaq composite was down 5 per cent for the week, but 1.1 per cent higher on Friday at 2,229.04.Counter-cylical shares reversed their pattern for the week and were among the underperformers. Dollar Tree, the discount retailer, fell 1 per cent to $61.04 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from “hold” to “buy”, calling it a “defensive” play on the overleveraged consumer.Walmart was 1.8 per cent lower on the week and AT&T fell 2.2 per cent, both relatively better than the broader indexes.On Tuesday Walmart reported a 10 per cent rise in quarterly earnings. Shares in Target, which also reported earnings, including a rise in same-store sales, were off 1.4 per cent for the five days.Gap raised its full-year profit outlook. The apparel retailer reported a 4 per cent gain in same-store sales in its first quarter. Shares were 1.9 per cent higher at $22.15.According to Thomson Reuters, company earnings for the quarter are up 57 per cent this quarter among the S&P 500 year over year, versus 37 per cent in the previous quarter.Larry Hatheway, economist at UBS, said that, given the continued growth in earnings, “for now, [it] is not evident” that recent weeks are the beginning of a bear market, rather than a correction.Dell, the PC maker, said its margins had fallen nearly 20 per cent and warned of slower demand in the next two quarters, though it blamed seasonal patterns. Its shares fell 6.8 per cent to $13.35.Cyclicals tied to the broader economy gained on Friday, with Alcoa jumping 2.5 per cent to $11.35 and Boeing adding 2.5 per cent to $64.56.But the group was down sharply for the five days. Caterpillar lost 7.4 per cent for the week to $60.09, matching the broader decline. Industrials suffered after a weak Empire State manufacturing survey and a drop in core inflation.Shares of US companies that generate a majority of their revenues in Europe were higher on Friday, but still got hammered over the week. Audio equipment maker Harman International fell 12 per cent, and solar-panel manufacturer First Solar fell 5.6 per cent.

Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, lost 4.5 per cent to $58.67.General Electric’s shares lost 5.8 per cent to $16.26. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries filed a US antitrust lawsuit against GE over patents related to wind turbines.Leading banks also slipped. The US Senate, in a party-line vote, sent the financial reform package to a final vote. Citigroup was down 4.7 per cent to $3.63 and Bank of America lost 6.3 per cent to $15.28.Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at UBS, said investors would be watching banking shares as credit risk indicators to determine whether conditions had bottomed out.“Markets have become increasingly concerned about the sufficiency of measures taken to defend the euro as well as the impact of proposed austerity plans,” said Mr Golub.Harman International, an audio equipment maker that receives nearly three-quarters of its revenues in Europe, slipped another 3.7 per cent to $30.56.Net income for Autodesk, the design software maker, jumped 11 per cent in its first quarter over the same period last year, beating analyst expectations.But the group, which said it sold more software overseas, also warned those gains could be fleeting. Shares fell back 6.9 per cent to $28.28.“[Our] enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy,” said Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive.VeriSign, an internet software provider, lost 1.5 per cent to $27.56 after agreeing to sell its security unit to Symantec for $1.3bn. Symantec fell back 5.6 per cent to $14.76.Advance Auto Parts shares were 6.9 per cent higher at $48.99 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $55, citing an economic backdrop in which more drivers would be servicing their own cars, as well as the group’s ability to provide “customer service focus, direct sourcing and price optimisation”.Sears said its earnings fell 39 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year, which the retailer attributed to declining margins in appliances and other big-ticket items. Its shares plummeted 11 per cent to $88.70.Drugstore chain Walgreens lost 6 per cent to $32.71, after analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded it from “outperform” to “neutral”.Ross Stores was 1.1 per cent higher, to $52.28, after it reported higher-than-
expected profits and record sales margins.MasterCard, the payment network, was also among the few gainers. It advanced
1.5 per cent to $205.50 after said Heartland Payment Systems would pay it $41.4m in claims related to security breaches. Visa, however, was 0.2 per cent lower at $72.82."
322;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-05-19T20:51:27Z;Wall Street lower on Europe growth worries;;US stock markets reversed opening gains as traders sold shares tied to the global economy, ignoring the usually bullish signal of a stronger euro.“What’s interesting is that we’re still seeing the same risk-off trade,” said Jeremy Zirin, US equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “We’re shifting from structural concerns about the eurozone to worries about European growth rates and the global recovery.”After opening higher, the S&P 500 index was down 0.5 per cent to 1,115.05 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 10,444.37. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,298.37.Shares with significant European exposure were hit hard. Harman International, a maker of audio equipment, receives more than two-thirds of its revenues from Europe. Harman led S&P 500 decliners, falling 7.7 per cent to $31.73.Also weighing on sentiment was a weaker-than-expected consumer price index April report. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was just 0.9 per cent higher than this time last year – the smallest annual rise since 1966 – indicating a very mild uptick in economic activity.Industrial companies broadly declined. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, led the Dow decliners, losing 2.8 per cent to $61.44. Aerospace group Boeing fell 2.2 per cent to $66.21 and 3M, the diversified industrial, lost 1.1 per cent to $82.54.“Fundamentally, things are not changing yet but, since the market went up prior to the fundamentals improving, the market can also begin to discount a slight pullback prior to actually getting the data,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet, an agency brokerage.Losses were pared later in the afternoon once the S&P 500 neared 1,100, its 200-day moving average, but bounced higher soon after hitting it. “When sentiment is deteriorating, technical levels have outsized significance,” said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies.Support also came from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting notes, in which policy makers raised their 2010 growth forecast and reiterated their dovish stance.Quarterly net income at Deere & Co, manufacturer of agricultural equipment, jumped from $472m to $547m year on year. Shares reversed and were up 3 per cent to $58.87.Financial stocks took a breather amid encouraging signs on regulatory reform. They were the only S&P 500 economic sector to rise, adding 0.2 per cent.Opponents were fighting an effort to bring the bill to an up-or-down vote, and a push to include a provision authorising states to regulate credit-card interest rates looked to have failed.Visa added 4.1 per cent to $72.97, and MasterCard was flat at $202.45. Shares are still down 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, since an amendment to regulate debit card fees was added to the bill on Friday.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at UBS, reiterated his “buy” ratings on Visa and MasterCard, saying markets were pricing in “unrealistic bear case regulatory scenarios”.Capital One Financial, the consumer credit card lender, added 2 per cent to $42.38. American Express added 0.8 per cent to $40.17.Leading banks were stronger, in spite of pressure from Germany’s decision to limit naked short selling, which led to a drop in shares of European banks. Citigroup added 2.1 per cent to $3.81 and Bank of America led Dow risers, up 2.3 per cent to $16.31.Peabody, the biggest US coal producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $38.49, and rival Massey lost 4.2 per cent to $31.35 as natural gas prices rose closer to $4.30 per million British thermal units.Target, the big-box retailer, reported that net income rose 30 per cent from the first quarter a year ago thanks to stronger apparel sales. European sales worries, however, led shares down 0.4 per cent to $54.03. Walmart dipped 1.2 per cent to $53.04.Hewlett-Packard added 0.5 per cent to $47.00, after first-quarter income beat consensus estimates.Healthcare was also a source of some support. Amgenadded 1.1 per cent to $55.26. JPMorgan reiterated its “outperform” rating on Gilead, citing the likelihood of approval for a key drug, boosting the shares by 1.9 per cent to $39.01.

324;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Dollar damage to profits;A strong greenback will hit multinationals’ earnings;With the luxuries of a huge domestic market and the international reserve currency, Americans normally put exchange rates far down on their list of economic worries. But, whether or not they realise it, their stock market is far more cosmopolitan than America in general. Nearly half of the S&P 500’s revenue now comes from abroad and almost 30 per cent from Europe, compared with only 12 per cent of US output from gross exports, a fact that boosted dollar earnings substantially in recent years. That effect may soon go into reverse, however, as the euro takes a tumble and China faces pressure to revalue the renminbi.The impact of currency weakness is naturally uneven, with utilities, telecommunications companies and others barely affected, while the largest US corporation, ExxonMobil, is mostly indifferent as oil is priced in dollars everywhere. But other multinationals such as General Electric, Caterpillar, Pfizer or Apple stand to see big translation gains from 2006 until 2008 become losses.Analysts at Bank of America laid out scenarios for the S&P 500’s earnings in 2011 based on various oil prices, growth levels and exchange rates. Holding oil and growth steady at moderate levels, earnings could range from $78 to $95 based on either euro-dollar parity or a rate of $1.30, respectively. In other words, investors could be paying as little as 12 or as much as 15 times prospective earnings by owning US equities – no small difference.Even this understates the sensitivity as a big fall in the euro might stem from an economic trauma such as a Greek default. US investors who pay little attention to exchange rates may soon learn the hard way that household names such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s are as American as spinach pie.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
325;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-05-17T20:58:35Z;Wall St flat after weak industrial report;;Wall Street investors shifted into defensive sectors as disappointing manufacturing figures and hovering regulators added to its already cautious mood.The market reversed earlier losses to end the day flat. Advances were led by consumer staples and telecom companies, while energy and industrial shares led the declines.“The equity market may be transitioning from last year’s ‘high-octane’ rally to a ‘regular’ or ‘unleaded’ rally driven by a mixture of later- and counter-cyclical sectors,” said Barry Knapp, portfolio strategist at Barclays Capital.After falling by as much as 1.3 per cent, by close the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,136.94. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 0.3 per cent to 2,354.23, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was marginally higher at 10,623.18.The Vix index of volatility declined slightly but remained elevated at 31, still above its 2010 average.Deal activity provided some support. Pactiv, a food service and packaging company, jumped 19 per cent to $28.44 after it was reported that Apollo, a private equity group, was interested in taking it private.Competitor Sealed Air, a manufacturer of speciality packaging, also jumped 5.6 per cent to $22.32 as investors anticipated further activity in the space.Pharmaceutical groups OSI and Astellas moved closer to finalising a deal, with Japan’s Astellas agreeing to acquire the US oncology specialist for $4bn. But OSI shares declined 4.1 per cent to $57.35 after arbitrageurs cut holdings to bring its price in line with the reported deal terms.The sense of a peak was sparked by an Empire State manufacturing survey that was lower than expected. The Federal Reserve’s general economic index of the New York region dropped to 19.1 from a cyclical high of 31.9 in April, as both new orders and shipments of goods declined.“The first look at manufacturing for the month of May does hint that we may be seeing the first signs of slowing in the rapid manufacturing expansion,” said Zach Pandl, desk economist at Nomura Securities in New York.Purveyors of consumer staples were the top performers, rising 0.6 per cent as a group. Kraft gained 1.8 per cent, Procter & Gamble gained 1.4 per cent, and Walmart added 1.2 per cent.Also seeing gains amid investors’ cyclical shift were sellers of prepaid mobile phones. MetroPCS jumped 3.8 per cent to $9.05. Sprint Nextel’s CFO said its revenue declines were easing as the market for prepaid phones was “improving dramatically”. Shares added 3 per cent, to $4.49.Cyclical industrials led the decliners in the Dow. Alcoa, the global metals group, dropped 2.1 per cent to $12.10. Caterpillar, supplier of construction and farming equipment, fell 1.7 per cent to $63.78.There was some optimism, however. ProLogis, a real estate investor in factories, jumped 4.3 per cent, to $12, after it was upgraded from “sell” to “buy” by Citigroup. “[I]ndustry fundamentals are poised to surge given increased industrial production, global GDP and historically low construction starts,” said Michael Bilerman, analyst at Citi.Lowe’s, the do-it-yourself home retailer, dipped 3.1 per cent after it lowered its forecast for 2010. Shares were trading at $25.26. Rival Home Depot was up 1.1 per cent to $35.39.Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, West Virginia, where 29 miners were killed in an explosion, led the drop in energy stocks after the US Department of Justice said it was launching a criminal probe.Massey shares dropped 10 per cent to $33.29. Peabody, the US’s biggest coal miner, dropped 5.3 per cent to $39.61. Citigroup led a decline across banking. A provision that banks should spin off their swaps operations remained in the US financial reform bill, in spite of Wall Street’s lobbying efforts.Citi was down 4 per cent, to $3.82, its lowest level since early March. S&P 500 financial shares were broadly down 1.2 per cent.American Express shares added 1.4 per cent to $41.22 after it reported the steepest drop in delinquent consumer loans. Amex said charge-offs declined from 7.5 per cent in March to 6.7 per cent in April.

The bank said it had not been contacted by any investigators.Mr Armiger, whose portfolio is underweight on financials, said: “The big investment banks are doing okay because of the low borrowing rates but they are not doing much lending. We’re not excited about the sector.”Bank of America fell 0.5 per cent to $17.07, AIG lost 3.5 per cent to $41.40, but Goldman Sachs was 3.7 per cent higher at $147.20.Department store chain Macy’s rallied 3.4 per cent to $24.70 on strong first-quarter results, boosted by rising revenues.Net income was 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of 21 cents per share a year earlier and average analyst expectations of a 4 cent per share profit.The company maintained the full-year earnings forecast it issued last month for annual earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share.Disney pulled back 1.8 per cent to $35.13, in spite of its first-quarter results beating analyst expectations.Its television business recorded lower-than-expected results but the movie division was
stronger-than-expected, boosted by the success of its Alice in Wonderland 3D blockbuster. The group’s second-quarter net income was $953m, or 48 cents per share, compared with $613m, or 33 cents a share, in the previous year. It topped average analyst expectations of 45 cents per share.Intel, the microchip maker, rose 3.6 per cent to $23.09 after a bullish investor day on Tuesday.The company said it expected to double its earnings in the next few years as it pushes into new fast-growing segments, namely smartphones and TVs. Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, also said he was “highly confident” that it would achieve its financial goals for the current quarter.Electronic Arts retreated 5.8 per cent to $17.71, making it one of the day’s biggest fallers, after the video game company lowered its first-quarter and full-year outlook for 2011 in a restatement, disappointing some investors who had expected a rise.Pharma group Merck was 0.4 per cent higher at $33.64 after its annual research and development briefing day. “Merck remains our top pick in US major pharma [sector], given relative valuation, strong pipeline, and near-term synergy potential,” said Anthony Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital. “We would be buyers at these levels.”Industrials stocks performed well across the sector. Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, was up 3.2 per cent to $68.15 and Deere & Co, the maker of agricultural equipment rallied 2.8 per cent to $61.14.Consumer staples stocks were higher. Tyson Foods, a meat production company, rose 0.6 per cent to $18.13.

327;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Exemption sought to OTC derivatives rules;;Large US industrial and manufacturing groups have intensified their campaign to ensure they will be exempt from proposed rules to reform the over-the-counter derivatives market. They say the draft legislation does not ensure that they will be allowed to continue using the contracts to hedge against interest-rate and currency fluctuations.OTC derivatives have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, and reforming the market is central to regulatory reforms being considered by the Senate. US lawmakers and regulators want most OTC deals – in which two parties privately agree a customised contract – to be traded and cleared centrally.But debate has intensified over who will be exempt from requirements to process OTC contracts through a clearing house, which would entail posting cash margins on every trade.“The fiercest part of the debate is over where exactly the line is drawn on exemptions,” Terry Duffy, chairman of the CME Group, the world’s biggest listed futures exchange, told the Financial Times.David Hall of Chatham Financial, the interest rate and foreign-exchange risk management advisers, said: “If you don’t get the exemption, you’re going to be forced to abide by all the most stringent clearing margin and trading provisions,”Although the bill on the Senate floor includes an exemption for industrial hedgers, the Coalition for Derivatives End-Users – a lobbying group that includes industry bodies such as the National Association of Manufacturers, the US Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute – warned on Tuesday that its members could still find themselves unable to qualify for the exemption.In a letter to senators, the coalition said under the current proposal, “many end-users of derivatives would be forced to divert precious working capital away from productive use to margin accounts, move their hedging practices overseas, or forgo hedging altogether – leaving them exposed to the volatility and price uncertainty that OTC derivatives have so effectively mitigated.”Dorothy Coleman of the NAM said that under the current version of the financial reform bill, the financing arms of big manufacturers, such as Boeing Capital Corporation or Caterpillar’s CAT Financial, were not eligible for the end-user exemption.Ms Coleman added that the current definition of “swap dealers”, who would not qualify for an exemption, was far too loose. “For example, it includes companies that regularly engage in the purchase and sale of swaps in the ordinary course of business. That causes a lot of concern – this is pretty broad.”The NAM also fears that regulators will raise capital and margin requirements on OTC derivatives.
328;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Global bourses mixed after Wall St stumble;Greek bonds fall sharply on continuing default worries;22:15 BST. Optimism over the US economy and corporate earnings encouraged traders to pick up stocks on Monday, though the rally ran out of steam at the end of the global session.The FTSE All-World equity index rose 0.4 per cent, just shy of a 19-month high, industrial metals saw demand.However, gains for the euro and European and Asian bourses were lost as further falls for Greek sovereign debt showed markets remain concerned about the chances of a default by Athens, adding to concerns over unpredictable US politics.The S&P 500 in New York was down 0.4 per cent to 1,212, with well-received results from Caterpillar and Whirlpool keeping sentiment on an even keel during most of the session, but worries about bank reform in the US and the US Treasury’s impending sale of up to 1.5bn in Citi shares knocked back financials toward the close.Many riskier assets such as stocks and commodities are at, or close to, cyclical highs. The “unloved bull market” as it has come to be known appears to have been all the more powerful because it has required a stoic stubbornness to climb a wall of worry over recent months.Indeed, one original concern, the health of the global recovery, has become a strong positive for sentiment during the past several weeks. Few could claim that economic data out of most regions have not been improving – though some may argue about its sustainability.Likewise, corporate profits have rebounded by more than expected. The current US first-quarter earnings season has for the most part been greeted warmly by analysts.The two main issues weighing on the market persist but appear to have only intermittent and minimal broader impact. The Greek debt crisis is still being treated as a containable one-off – away from the eurozone peripheral sovereign debt complex, at any rate. Investors seem reluctant to consider that the fiscal problems facing Athens are a harbinger for the fall-out from less intense, but more important, budget messes elsewhere.In addition, market optimism has not been soured by the harsher regulatory environment proposed for the financial sector – particularly in the US. For the moment it is only the likes of Goldman Sachs whose shares have been significantly affected for now.Both the fiscal and regulatory issues could yet come back with a vengeance to batter risk appetite. A sudden sharp collapse in the euro and rise in the dollar, or a downturn in global economic growth metrics, may also halt the rally.But there is one other factor that may prove crucial to whether the bulls continue to charge, and one which will feature prominently this week: monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve completes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Most analysts don’t expect a change to the “extended period” promise for low rates. However, with even the US housing market showing signs of life and stronger growth forcing peers to consider tightening (Canada will likely raise rates in June), the time is getting closer for Mr Bernanke to signal a move.Whether traders see this as a return to normal to be celebrated, or the liquidity tap being closed that will parch the bulls, may determine the market’s trajectory over the summer.“Global equity markets remain in rally mode – in the aftermath of eight consecutive weeks of gains in the U.S indices, ” said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in a note to clients.“There’s little doubt [about] the widespread confidence in the economy’s new-found verve, although the real tests lie ahead as all the stimulus from the Fed’s quantitative easing program, tax refunds and housing credits fade away.”● Asian stock markets had a good session as investors reacted to strong economic data out of the US on Friday. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index jumped 1.5 per cent, led by a 2.3 per cent surge in Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 benefited from a softer yen, which helped exporters. Sydney was closed for a public holiday.The Hang Seng in Hong Kong followed the regional trend to add 1.6 per cent as property developers rebounded, but the Shanghai Composite was typically quixotic and fell 0.5 per cent.European bourses were aided by Wall Street finishing Friday’s session at a 19-month high. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 1 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5 per cent as miners and banks forged ahead.● The euro initially added to Friday’s strong advance as traders hoped the aid package for Greece would draw a line under the eurozone’s fiscal difficulties. However, hopes for a Greek bailout have followed a similar pattern over recent months. Talk of aid on a Friday has often led to a rally, which has then fizzled early the next week as doubts about its application come to the fore.So it was that comments this Monday from Angela Merkel, German Chancellor, expressing the need for Greece to show it means business about cutting its deficit before receiving aid, again hit the euro and battered Greek debt.The single currency was flat versus the dollar to $1.3403. The dollar index, a measure of the buck against a basket of its peers, fell 0.2 per cent to 81.21 in a late swoon as bank stocks tumbled.● Greek bonds lost early gains. The yield on the 10-year note rose 74 basis points to 9.39 per cent, taking the premium Athens must pay over German Bunds to nearly 700bp. Greek 2-year notes at one point yielded more than 14 per cent, and were later trading up 285bp at 12.99 per centPortugal’s 10-year yield rose 26 basis points to 5.20 per cent, a near 8-year high as contagion worries resurfaced.US Treasuries firmed as the sell-off in eurozone “peripheral” debt took hold, their yield falling 2bp to 3.80 per cent. The US will auction $129bn of debt this week.● Commodities were mostly down on US market jitters. Copper fell 0.4 per cent to $3.35 in New York trading. However, the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodities basket, fell 0.2 per cent, dragged lower by a 0.3 per cent fall in oil to $83.93 a barrel.Gold was just about flat at $1,154 a troy ounce. Cocoa earlier in the session hit a new 33-year high of £2,368 a tonne as worries about poor supply out of the Ivory Coast met increased demand from confectioners.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm
329;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-04-26T21:41:16Z;US stocks fall on financial reform worries;;US stock prices ended the session lower on Monday in spite of a burst of merger and acquisition activity and strong earnings from Caterpillar and Whirlpool.Worries about financial reform weighed on bank shares and dragged the broader market lower.Results from a Charles Schwab survey of more than 500 of its active traders showed that bullish sentiment was sharply down.Only 28 per cent expressed a bullish outlook for the market in the next six months, down from 50 per cent in the last survey published in December 2009. About 51 per cent are neutral.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,212.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 11,205.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was lower 0.3 per cent at 2,522.95.Caterpillar rose 4.2 per cent to $71.65, making it the best performer in the Dow, as the construction and mining equipment company reported better than expected first-quarter profit, citing an improving global economy, especially in Asia and Latin America.The company also raised its full-year guidance for earnings and revenues.Appliance maker Whirlpool was up 10 per cent to $112.42 as it increased its full-year earnings guidance to between $8 and $8.50 per share, surpassing the average analyst estimate of $6.83 per share. The company also reported strong first-quarter results with net income up to $164m from $68m a year earlier.Bank stocks were lower across the board.As Goldman Sachs prepared to defend its practices in Congress this week, its stock lost 3.4 per cent to $152.03.The bank released internal documents over the weekend in an attempt to rebuff aggressive allegations from a Senate subcommittee, which suggested that Goldman had profited on the subprime meltdown just as its customers were suffering big losses.Citigroup declined 5.1 per cent to $4.61 after the US Treasury department said it had authorised the sale of up to 1.5bn of the bank’s shares as it takes its first step to offload its stake in the bank.The Treasury said it would give Morgan Stanley, its sales agent, authority to sell more shares after this initial amount as it works to sell its 27 per cent stake in the bank in an “orderly fashion”.BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, dropped 8.6 per cent to $192.95 as its first-quarter results missed expectations.Net profit was $2.40 per share compared with an average analyst estimate of $2.44.Car rental group Hertz jumped 14.1 per cent to $14.69 on news that it is to acquire smaller rival Dollar Thrifty for about $1.2bn as it attempts to boost its presence in the leisure rental market. Dollar Thrifty rose 10.9 per cent to $43.07.WuXi PharmaTech, a Chinese pharmaceutical group, added 17.1 per cent to $19.41 on news that Charles River Laboratorieshad agreed to buy the company for about $1.6bn in order to expand its global footprint in contract research and drug development services.Charles River was down 15.6 per cent to $33.55.Office Depot rose 5.9 per cent to $8.95, its highest level since July 2008, as the office supplies retailer was upgraded from “underperform” to “neutral” at Credit Suisse.Thomas Weisel Partners rose 68.12 per cent to $7.33 as the company agreed to be bought by rival Stifel Financial, a brokerage group, for about $318m in stock, or $7.60 per share.Stifel lost 2.4 per cent to $54.41.Continental Airlines rose 4.5 per cent to $22.99 while UAL Corp, parent company of United Air Lines, fell 2.7 per cent to $22.36.The two airlines are rumoured to be in merger talks with reports suggesting that they are struggling to agree on the price of a potential stock for stock deal.Shares in Texas Instruments rallied 1.8 per cent to $27.16 ahead of its earnings release after the session’s close.CKE Restaurants retreated 3.7 per cent to $12.38 after the fast food restaurant operator said it was to sell itself to Apollo Management, a New York-based private equity company, for $12.55 per share in cash, or about $694m.
330;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Industrials get nod over OTC derivatives;;"Industrial companies have won recognition from European regulators that they should be granted exemptions from sweeping regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets.It marks a partial victory amid fears that a crackdown on off-exchange derivatives markets, blamed by some for exacerbating the financial crisis, could unfairly penalise corporate users of such instruments.Companies on both sides of the Atlantic say being forced to use derivatives that are traded on exchanges and cleared through clearing houses, as regulators insist to make the system safer, would drain cash and prevent legitimate hedging of business risk. They include the airline Lufthansa, heavy plant maker Caterpillar and aerospace group Rolls-Royce.Clearing requires market participants to post funds as collateral against default, something companies do not have to do since they negotiate OTC derivatives – such as foreign exchange and interest rate swaps – from banks directly.In a “discussion paper” from the European Commission’s directorate general for internal markets, regulators say that “in principle, non-financial institutions could be exempt from the clearing obligation”.It says the main mechanism for transferring risk to the real economy during the crisis was through the financial sector. “This suggests that the appropriate boundary for a clearing obligation is between the financial sector and the non-financial sector.”Richard Raeburn, chairman of the European Association of Corporate Treasurers, said: “This suggests that [the Commission] supports the need for an exemption for non-financial users. It is certainly the first time that we’ve seen such a clear statement.”Eact in January sent a letter to Brussels, signed by 160 companies, warning that without exemptions there could be “a reduction in the amount of funds allocated to productive investment in the [European] economy”.However, the paper falls short of a “clear carve-out” that companies had sought.It suggests three ways to approach corporate exemptions: complete exemptions (which it says has “significant downsides”); to use accounting rules to determine whether companies are speculating in OTC derivatives; or devising “thresholds” that would warn regulators if companies were making too much use of privately-negotiated OTC derivatives.The paper is being circulated ahead of Friday’s meeting of EU members’ “working group” on derivatives and market structures.The paper also warns that any policy adopted by the EU “is mindful of the policy approaches adopted by other jurisdictions, notably the USA, in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage and/or unjustified differentiated treatment of corporate end-users”.Legislation passed by the US House of Representatives already exempts non-financial users of OTC swaps under certain circumstances, but the Senate has yet to decide what to do. A draft OTC derivatives bill is expected this month from the chamber’s agriculture committee."
331;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-03-28T19:40:37Z;Washington challenges US groups’ health bill charges;Obama administration plays down corporate claims;Large US corporations that have announced they will take charges this quarter because of healthcare reform, which was passed into law last week, are exaggerating the negative impact of the legislation, a top aide to President Barack Obama has said.Valerie Jarrett said in an interview on ABC News that a provision in the new law, which will change the amount of tax companies can deduct on a government subsidy they use to help pay for pensioner drug benefits, was “nothing compared to the enormous financial benefits” the companies would receive under other measures included in the legislation.AT&T, the US telecommunications group, announced on Friday that it would take a $1bn non-cash charge in the first quarter to account for the change, which comes into effect in 2013.Verizon, another telecoms company, also said its costs would increase in the short term. Caterpillar, the largest maker of earth-moving equipment and a vociferous critic of healthcare reform, said it would take a $100m charge, while John Deere, the world’s biggest maker of agriculture equipment, said it would see a $150m charge.The announcements are a political sore point for the Obama administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who have insisted that healthcare reform will expand healthcare coverage and bring down costs.Democratic lawmakers have asked Verizon, Caterpillar and John Deere to hand over more information about how they have historically accounted for the subsidy on Medicare drug benefits for their retired workers in an attempt to challenge the companies’ assertions.Companies began receiving the subsidy under a 2003 law that was passed during the Bush administration.Under the old law, companies received a 28 per cent tax free subsidy if they continued to provide prescription drug coverage to their retired workers on Medicare, the government-sponsored insurance programme for the elderly.In other words, under the old law, for every $100 that a company spent on Medicare drug costs, it received $28 from the government, which was tax-free. In addition, it could take a full tax deduction on the $100 it spent on drug costs.Under the new law, the subsidy will still be tax-free, but can no longer be deducted on taxes.Politicians are not the only ones who are playing down the projected financial impact of the bill on large companies. In a report entitled “Don’t overreact to the hit on earnings”, Credit Suisse analyst David Zion said the effect on corporate results expected this quarter was, in effect, the recognition of a future tax increase that was being put into current period results.Mr Zion estimates that 45 companies in the S&P 500 may take a charge of more than 10 per cent of their consensus first-quarter earnings estimates.However, he found only eight companies in which the estimated charge on earnings would be more than 0.5 per cent of the market capitalisation of the company.S&P 500 companies may have to pay an additional $361m in taxes in 2013 as a result of the change, and $2.8bn in additional tax through 2019, with telecoms and utilities and industrial sectors accounting for 63 per cent of the new tax, said Mr Zion.
332;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-03-23T17:44:36Z;US business hardens stance on renminbi;;Bill Hickey has a long perspective on US manufacturing. From his office at the Chicago headquarters of Lapham-Hickey Steel – whose customers include John Deere and Caterpillar – he has watched the sector cope with many competitive threats in the 30 years since he inherited the business.But in the past decade, he has seen swaths of US manufacturing wither in the face of Chinese competition. “We’ve seen our customers from auto-parts manufacturers to kitchen appliance-makers just disappear,” he says. “We’re seeing the hollowing out of American manufacturing because the politicians don’t get it.”Mr Hickey sees China’s currency policy as part of “a mercantilist plan” to gain market share in the US. “If their currency is 40 per cent below its real market value, they can undercut US producers and that’s what’s eroding the manufacturing base here,” he says. “That’s their plan. Their government is basically subsidising that. The currency policy acts as a subsidy and an import tax.”Fuelled by a soaring unemployment rate and tinged with plenty of populism the debate over how the US should respond to the concerns of manufacturers such as Mr Hickey is again high on the agenda on Capitol Hill. The latest chapter will come on Wednesday as China’s exchange rate policy is the focus of a hearing before the House of Representatives’ ways and means committee.But there are signs that the dynamics of debate are changing. Manufacturers and their lobbyists in Washington have frequently pushed hard for the US to take a tougher stance on China’s currency policy. Suddenly, however, they have found more allies across a corporate America that, with an eye on China’s potential as a market, had previously been less willing to take on Beijing. Behind it is rising disaffection with China on a range of issues, from its efforts to tilt government procurement contracts towards Chinese companies that practise “indigenous innovation” to its ineffectiveness at protecting intellectual property rights, to currency policy.“I don’t think the Chinese government can count on the American business community to push back and block action,” says Myron Brilliant, vice-president for international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce.This shift has given impetus to efforts in Congress to adopt legislation that would impose punitive measures on China if it does not let the renminbi appreciate. Pressure is also growing on the US Treasury to brand China a “currency manipulator” in a report due out on April 15 – a move that could lead to sanctions against Chinese imports.Charles Freeman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank, said even though many companies might be dismayed by the prospects of a trade war, there were “less people willing to stand up and sing the praises” of the US-China economic relationship.Some parts of corporate America are still urging caution. Erik Autor, vice-president and international trade counsel at the National Retail Federation, says China is a sourcing location and good potential market for US retailers and “both of these could be jeopardised if we don’t handle China trade and economic issues carefully”.“We cannot come out guns blazing and feel that we can achieve something helpful,” he says.Other companies that source low-cost components from China would also be adversely affected if the country changed its currency approach.Charles Cannon, chief executive of JBT, which makes food-processing machinery and airport equipment, says his company’s profits would be squeezed if the renminbi appreciated, potentially forcing him to search for low-cost components elsewhere. “We might not have to leave China but our margins would be affected,” he says.US banks also seem reluctant to press for more aggressive policies towards China, even though many have been disappointed by Beijing’s sceptical attitude towards them after the financial crisis.“A more market based [renminbi] is important – mostly for China. But as a remedy for trade imbalances, the focus on the currency is demonstrably overstated,” says John Dearie, executive vice-president for policy at the Financial Services Forum in Washington. “The far more effective approach to tackle the trade imbalance is to further open China up to US goods and services.”Back in Chicago, Mr Hickey says he believes Beijing will be forced to change its currency stance. “The largest customer that China has is the US,” he says. “There has to be reciprocity: there’s no good relationship where one partner sucks the other one dry.”
333;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Caterpillar moves to cut links with Iran;;Caterpillar, the US building equipment group, has become the latest company to bow to a lobbyists’ “name and shame” campaign by announcing steps to sever trading links with Iran.The company said it would bar its non-US subsidiaries from accepting orders for products that they knew were destined for delivery to Iran.The New York-based United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which spearheaded a campaign against the Illinois company, greeted the announcement as its second victory in a month after Huntsman, the Texas chemicals manufacturer, announced in January that its foreign subsidiaries would suspend sales to Iran in view of the “reputational risk” posed to the company.As western pressure mounts at the UN for a new round of global sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme, UANI and other lobbyists have targeted 200 US and foreign companies whose business with Iran is currently legal under US and international law. Companies have faced write-in campaigns and threats of divestment if they did not change their practices.Lobbyists have also been active in drafting US legislation that would oblige Barack Obama, US president, to act against foreign companies, in spite of warnings from the state department against restricting the president’s diplomatic flexibility in seeking broad international consensus in dealing with Iran.While the lobbyists have close connections with figures in the Obama administration and the Republican party, peace and human rights groups maintain that some campaigns act as a front for foreign policy hawks seeking to pursue a strategy of confrontation.Other companies, forced to choose between their image in the US market and sometimes limited dealings with Iran, have already caved in to lobby pressure, or in anticipation of stricter measures from Congress.UANI persuaded General Electric to sign a voluntary declaration that it would have no dealings with Iran. Siemens, Italy’s ENI oil company and German insurers Munich Re and Allianz are among others that have announced they were either pulling out of Iran or not renewing business there.UANI’s database of targeted companies includes industrial brand leaders in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, and oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Petrobras.As part of the Caterpillar campaign, the pressure group this month erected a roadside billboard near the company’s headquarters in Peoria, Illinois that pictured one of the group’s earth diggers alongside a headshot of Mahmoud Ahmadi-Nejad, president of Iran, and the slogan “Today’s work, Tomorrow’s Nuclear Iran”. UANI said the billboard would be removed after a company statement late on Friday.Caterpillar denied that it had extensive business in Iran, as the lobbyists claimed, and said it had no assets, operations or employees in that country. It acknowledged that Caterpillar products had reached Iran via third-party independent resellers as part of a secondary market which the company was unable to control.UANI had sought to make a link between the activities of Lovat, Caterpillar’s Canadian tunnelling subsidiary that is engaged in a sewage project in Tehran, and Iran’s alleged use of tunnels to hide secret nuclear weapons facilities.
334;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-02-18T22:49:10Z;Recovery on course for US industry;;The US’s manufacturing economy showed further signs of recovery on Thursday when Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, said equipment sales turned positive in Asia last month for the first time in 14 months, while the pace of decline slowed elsewhere.The disclosure came after the US Federal Reserve reported this week that industrial production rose in January at the fastest pace in five months.John Deere, the world’s biggest maker of agricultural equipment, said that North American farmers had started buying big machinery such as combine harvesters and large tractors in much greater numbers than it had previously anticipated, prompting it to raise its profits forecast for the year.Caterpillar said last month that it would depend on China and other emerging economies for growth this year, saying that the economies of North America, Europe and Japan “remain weak and have not rebounded as quickly as developing countries”.In spite of its recent surge in the US and Canada, Deere is also depending on emerging economies for its growth – looking in particular to Brazil.“This is encouraging for manufacturing,” said Adam Fleck at Morningstar in Chicago.“Caterpillar and Deere have been talking about emerging economies for several quarters now and that now seems to be becoming reality.”Jim Owens, Caterpillar chief executive, has praised China’s government for the speed with which it has funnelled economic stimulus spending into infrastructure projects.In contrast, Owens has been scathing about the US’s stimulus efforts, saying that very little was devoted to helping boost infrastructure.He also attacked the “Buy America” clause inserted into the proposal.Mr Fleck said that the company’s renewed growth in Asia – while sales in the US remain sluggish – reflected that difference. “The infrastructure boom seems to be continuing,” he said. “This is the results of continued stimulus spending in China.”Wall Street is increasingly looking to large companies in the manufacturing sector to help pull the US out of the downturn.Morgan Stanley upgraded Caterpillar this month, while UBS had upgraded the group last month.Caterpillar this week hired 100 workers at a plant in Indiana.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Caterpillar said that its sales in the Asia/Pacific region in January were 1 per cent higher than last year, following falls of 31 per cent in November and 12 per cent in December. Year-on-year sales have been down in the region since November 2008.All other regions showed sales continuing to fall, but at an increasingly slower pace. In North America, Caterpillar sales were down 40 per cent last month compared to a year ago, but that was an improvement from a 46 per cent decline in December and a 54 per cent fall in November.Caterpillar shares were up 0.6 per cent at $57.86 by mid-afternoon trading on Thursday in New York.
335;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-02-17T22:23:51Z;Wall St buoyant as earnings news and economic data shine;;Encouraging January housing starts, better-than-expected earnings and receding fears on the European sovereign debt situation boosted risk appetite on Wednesday and prompted Wall Street stocks to rise moderately for the second consecutive session.January industrial production figures from the US Federal Reserve were also better than expected.Output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9 per cent following a 0.7 per cent increase in December.“We are starting to see the early signs of a virtuous circle in the recovery,” said Brian Bethune, chief US financial economist at IHS Global Insight.“Solid gains across a number of key spending categories, including consumption, housing, exports and business equipment spending [are starting] to reinforce each other, leading to lean inventories and upward leverage on production.”The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,099.51, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent at 10,309.24 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent higher at 2,226.29.Walgreens, the largest US drugstore chain, was up 0.3 per cent to $34.19 after announcing plans to buy rival Duane Reade for $1.08bn, a figure that includes $457m of debt, from affiliates of Oak Hill Capital Partners, the private equity group.The acquisition will enable Walgreens to expand in metropolitan New York.It would dilute profits in the first year after closing – expected to happen at the end of August – but add to earnings the following 12 months and thereafter, Walgreens said.Shares in Citigroup moved ahead 3 per cent to $3.41 as Paulson & Co, the hedge fund run by billionaire investor John Paulson, was revealed to have increased its stake in the bank in the past quarter, making the fund one of its largest institutional stakeholders.Prominent investor George Soros also revealed his fund had increased its stake in Citigroup last year.Whole Foods, a natural and organic food supermarket chain, improved 12.6 per cent to $34.35 after posting a quarterly profit that beat analyst estimates and revising upwards its fiscal 2010 sales and earnings forecasts.The company said identical-store sales, a closely watched indicator, rose 2.5 per cent after five quarters of declines.Retailers at the value end of the market also performed well. Walmart rose 0.9 per cent to $54.06, Target was up 1.4 per cent to $50.60 and Kohl’s moved up 1.1 per cent to $51.21.The software and technology sector was in focus as it prepares to fight an Obama administration plan to reduce offshore tax avoidance, according to Business Software Alliance, a Washington-based trade group that represents the sector.A proposal in President Obama’s 2011 budget targets an accounting technique known as transfer pricing, which allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities by transferring intangible property such as patents, trademarks and licenses to offshore subsidiaries. It is thought to be worth about $15.5bn annually.Microsoft was up 0.9 per cent to $28.59, Hewlett-Packard gained 1.4 per cent to $50.12 but Dell declined 0.2 per cent to $14.11.The proposals are also likely to affect companies that have valuable intangible assets and significant international operations and rely on this accounting technique, such as those in the pharmaceuticals sector.Merck fell 0.9 per cent to $37.34 and Pfizer lost 0.3 per cent to $17.67.Shares in Deere jumped 5 per cent to $56.48 after the maker of farm equipment reported first-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations.It also raised its full-year net income forecast to about $1.3bn from $900m.Rival machinery producer Caterpillar improved 0.7 per cent to $57.60.Martha Stewart Living strengthened 8.3 per cent to $5.76 after the company reported a fourth-quarter profit against a loss in the same period a year ago.The media sector overall performed well. Walt Disney was up 1.3 per cent to $30.86 and CBS, the television network, rose 1.9 per cent to $13.52.
336;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-02-09T22:16:05Z;Coca-Cola and industrials help stocks rally;;Encouraging results from Coca-Cola and renewed optimism in the industrials sector helped US stocks bounce back yesterday.Reports of a rescue package for Greece also reassured investors who had feared the country’s fiscal problems could spark a wider crisis across the eurozone.The S&P 500 gained 1.3 per cent to 1,070.52, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.5 per cent to 10,058.64 and the Nasdaq was 1.2 per cent higher at 2,150.87.“The recent bearish charge appears to have run into a brick wall,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Rumour-driven or not, investors’ jitters were abruptly abandoned as traders began to put faith in some kind of practical resolution for Greek state finances.”Strong demand from China, Brazil and India helped Coca-Cola to offset declines in North America and post quarterly results in line with estimates. The soft-drinks maker also gained market share during the period, both in the carbonated and non-carbonated segments. The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $54.01.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, McDonald’s reported that sales had risen 2.6 per cent at restaurants open for more than a year. While revenues continued to decline in the US, sales rose in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Shares in McDonald’s the rose 1 per cent to $63.57.Caterpillar added to the market’s gains after Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment to “overweight” from “underweight”. Analysts at the bank also upgraded the US industrial sector to “attractive” from “in-line”, citing stronger than expected order books. Caterpillar added 5.4 per cent to $53.53, while the S&P 500 industrials index rose 1.7 per cent.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, also benefited from an upgrade and was up 2 per cent at $75.72. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised their rating on the group to “buy” from “neutral”, saying it was well-positioned to gain market share in US corn seed.It emerged that India’s government rejected the country’s first genetically modified food after protests by farmers. Monsanto had supplied the gene for the test vegetable, and the government’s decision to halt production was considered a blow to the group’s prospects for growth in India.NYSE Euronext climbed 5.1 per cent to $23.65 after the transatlantic exchange operator posted a higher profit for the last quarter than analysts had been expecting. Cost-cutting had helped offset declining trading volumes and a diminishing share of the equities market.ADC Telecommunications also surprised the market by reporting a quarterly profit. Analysts had expected the telephone equipment maker to break even. Its shares surged 21.4 per cent to $6.53.Electronic Arts weighed on the market, tumbling 8.8 per cent to $15.96, after the video game publisher gave a disappointing forecast for next year. The group, which is the world’s second-largest player in the sector, blamed its lowered guidance on the lack of blockbuster titles, poor demand in Europe and the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements.Pulte Homes, the country’s largest housebuilder, posted a smaller loss for the last quarter thanks to tax benefits. Revenues rose 5 per cent in the period but the results were worse than expected. Shares in the Michigan group lost 0.5 per cent to $11.08.In the pharmaceutical sector, Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, reported encouraging results from trials of a bone-strengthening treatment. After early strength, the shares lost 0.4 per cent to $57.21.While financial stocks rebounded from the previous session’s lows, the sector still lagged behind the market.Lincoln National, one of the country’s largest life insurers, climbed 4.3 per cent to $24.50 after reporting a higher-than-expected profit for the last quarter.The group suffered from investment losses in the financial crisis but was given a $950m cash injection by the government and has also raised additional funds through a share offering.
337;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-01-30T04:21:17Z;Honeywell maintains conservative outlook;;Honeywell International, the US industrial conglomerate, closed a difficult year with improved fourth-quarter results but maintained a conservative outlook, noting it was prepared for a rapid economic recovery but planning for a much slower rebound.The results and comments echo those of industrial companies such as Tyco, Caterpillar and United Technologies that have seen stabilization in the last quarter but remain cautious on the prospects for the coming year.Such conglomerates expect modest rebounds in sales to benefit the bottom line thanks to aggressive cost cutting in the downturn. But market expectations for a recovery have run ahead and their forecasts have undershot analyst’s consensus estimates.“We are, as usual, planning conservatively in 2010, with modest organic sales growth,” said Dave Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, which makes everything from electronics for fighter jets to home security devices.“While we should all be cautious about the year ahead of us, particularly the first half, I feel good about the investments we have been making.”For the first quarter, Honeywell now expects earnings of between 35 cents and 40 cents per share on revenue of between $7.2bn and $7.6bn. Consensus estimates were for profits of 47 cents per share and revenues of $7.63bn.For the full year, Honeywell reaffirmed its earnings guidance for $2.20 to $2.40 per share due to an 80 cents per share headwind from non-cash charges related to pension accounting but roughly in line with analyst estimates.Honeywell shares fell about 3 per cent per cent to $38.63 in spite of new government data showing that the US economy grew at the fastest rate in six years during the fourth quarter, raising hopes that the recovery is gaining steam.In the fourth quarter net income was roughly flat at $698m, or 91 cents per share, compared to the same period in 2008 on sales down 7 per cent to $8.1bn as airlines bought fewer parts. The results were just ahead of analyst expectations.Overall 2009 was a tough year for Honeywell. In July the company was forced to warn its investors that profits would fall at the low end of the range it had set earlier in the year as the recession squeezed all important divisions.Still, Mr Cote said Honeywell had come through the downturn in good shape. Cost cutting held margins steady despite falling sales and the company preserved its industrial base, developed new products and expanded its emerging market presence.For the full year, net income fell 23 per cent to $2.2bn leading to $2.95 of earnings per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2008. Revenues fell to $30.9bn, down from $36.6bn in 2008, led by 15 per cent declines in its aerospace unit.
338;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-01-27T22:13:21Z;Sixth day of equity losses as risk aversion prevails;Wall St turns positive after Fed statement;21:25 GMT. Wall Street rallied on Wednesday, offsetting further weakness across global equity markets after the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve.The US Federal Reserve left its main interest rate unchanged as expected and reiterated its promise to keep rates “exceptionally low for an extended period”. However, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig dissented, saying he wanted the central bank to withdraw this promise.“This should not be ignored,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “As the economy continues to turn, other Fed members are likely to join Mr Hoenig in believing that an end to ‘exceptionally’ low rates for an ‘extended’ period is no longer necessary.”Risk aversion was the prevailing theme in Asia and European trading.The FTSE World equity index fell 0.4 per cent, recording a sixth consecutive day of declines as traders faced a double-barrel policy blast out of Washington, and worries remain that world economic growth is still very fragile.In contrast, the rally on Wall Street after the Fed meeting was led by financial stocks, pushing the S&P 500 up 0.5 per cent.Later still, President Obama will deliver his State of the Union speech. Traders will be concerned that the bank-bashing rhetoric may be ratcheted up another notch, while bond investors will want to hear about the White House plans for the budget deficit.● News that Greece is hawking up to €25bn of its bonds to China did nothing to help its risk profile, or for that matter, calm the sovereign debt fears of the broader market. The yield on Greek 10-year debt spiked more than 60 basis points to breach 6.9 per cent at one stage, its highest since late 1999. This resulted in the spread between Greek 10-year debt and that of the eurozone benchmark, the German Bund, to jump to a record high near 360 basis points.“Today’s developments confirm that the eurozone’s fiscal problems will continue to flash red on the markets’ radar screen,” said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit.“These political and market tensions will be with us for a while as markets decide how to re-price different macro and fiscal fundamentals.”Other peripheral eurozone government bonds also suffered, and the Markit iTraxx SovX western Europe index of credit-default swaps on 15 governments rose 9.25 basis points to a record 87.25. The yield spread of Portugal’s 10-year bond over Bunds widened 12bp to 105bp amid concerns about a possible credit downgrade after a disappointing budget. The Spanish-German spread widened 2bp to 85bp.The flight away from eurozone peripherals initially triggered buying of US government bonds – with further support coming from strong demand at a $42bn auction of five-year paper. But late in New York, the yield on the policy sensitive two-year Treasury was up 3 bp at 0.91 per cent.● In New York, the S&P 500 spent most of the session in the red, with the new slew of earnings reports providing little positive impetus. Worries about sovereign debt risk and further falls in new US home sales also hurt sentiment. Caterpillar, the US machinery group considered a proxy for the health of global construction activity, beat expectations. But the shares fell 6 per cent at one point on a disappointing outlook for 2010.Asian bourses had another rotten session. The FTSE-Asia Pacific index fell for the eighth day in a row, losing 1.2 per cent. The Shanghai Composite, China’s benchmark, lost 1.1 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.4 per cent, to a four-month low, after sentiment was soured by Rusal suffering a big plunge following its IPO.The Nikkei in Tokyo lost 0.7 per cent as the stronger yen hurt exporters and traders had the first opportunity to react to news that S&P had put the nation’s debt on watch for a possible downgrade.Europe tracked Asia lower and was also wary of Wall Street’s late slide into negative territory overnight. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.9 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London lost 1.1 per cent, with banks again under the cosh.● The dollar added 0.4 per cent to the previous day’s rally but the main feature in forex was the early haven flows into the yen.The Japanese unit flirted with Y89 to the dollar, but was later down 0.4 per cent at Y89.99. Against the euro, the yen was unchanged at Y126.19. At its height in early European trading the yen had posted an advance of about 5 per cent in nine sessions against the single currency. Many analysts see the EUR/JPY cross as a good gauge of risk appetite, so this move may be worrisome for those expecting more optimistic positioning by investors.● A more stable dollar lent no support to gold and the bullion fell 1 per cent to $1,087. Oil fell 1.4 per cent to $73.67, following a mixed report on US inventories. Analysts at MF Global Energy said the technical picture for oil looked “uninspiring”. “The short-term downtrend is still intact, setting up what we think will be an imminent test of trend-line support between the $70-$73 levels.”
339;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-01-27T22:04:23Z;Wall Street financials lead rally after Fed statement;;A late rally in financial stocks lifted Wall Street out of the red on Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve reiterated its promise to keep rates “exceptionally low” for an “extended period”.The Fed kept interest rates unchanged as expected but said there had been some dissent over whether to retain this key promise.However, banking stocks still surged on the prospect of loose monetary policy and a prolonged supply of cheap money.Bank of America gained 2.8 per cent to $15.19 while Citigroup rose 1.6 per cent to $3.20. The S&P 500 financials index added 2.3 per cent - its biggest daily gain since November.However, traders were also bracing themselves for President Barack Obama’s first State of the Union address.After spending most of the day in the red, the S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1,097.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 10,236.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent to 2,221.41.“The Fed repeated its message that everything it has previously put into place is working, albeit slowly,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “It must be content that the liquidity pressures it tackled a year ago through monetary and quantitative policies have been dealt with successfully, but now it continues to rely on that old adage that time is a great healer.”The market had initially struggled to make sense of mixed earnings reports from the industrials sector.Caterpillar, the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment, posted a higher quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting and noted encouraging signs of economic recovery. However, the group gave a disappointing profit forecast for this year, sending its shares down 4.3 per cent to $53.44.Boeing, the second-largest maker of commercial aircraft, also beat estimates but disappointed Wall Street with its outlookThe company said that its defence business had suffered from government budget cuts while demand for air travel remained low.Its shares initially fell back before the opening bell but were later trading 7.3 per cent higher at $61.93.United Technologies, the diversified manufacturer, also weighed on the market in spite of posting results and a forecast that were just above the average analysts’ forecast.Profit fell about 6 per cent in the past quarter due to restructuring costs and lower revenue from commercial airline contracts. Its shares slipped 1.3 per cent to $67.61.Elsewhere in the industrial sector, shares in Rockwell Automation jumped 10.2 per cent to $50.84 after the industrial software maker posted quarterly results above the consensus forecast and boosted its outlook for 2010.While the group has trimmed costs by closing facilities and cutting jobs, it has also seen higher demand as industrial production increases in the economic recovery.Concerns over tighter monetary policy in China still haunted the market, pushing the S&P 500 materials index 0.8 per cent lower.Apple helped the Nasdaq to outperform the wider market, gaining 0.9 per cent to $207.81 after the company launched a new $499 computer.After the closing bell on Tuesday, Yahoo posted fourth-quarter results broadly in line with expectations. It gave a promising outlook for the current quarter, prompting the shares to surge in early trading. However, they were later down 0.1 per cent at $15.98.RF Micro Devices, which makes chips for mobile phones, posted a higher profit than analysts had been expecting but mainly as a result of cost cuts. Revenues, however, were worse than expected, causing its shares to fall 4 per cent to $4.10.Amazon.com added to the sector’s gains, rising 2.7 per cent to $122.75 after Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”.Analyst Aaron Kessler said that the company was in a good position due to its low prices, offers of free shipping and trustworthiness and was a particularly attractive investment given its shares had just suffered a 15 per cent correction.

341;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-01-27T19:15:21Z;US industrials offer cautious outlook;;"Some of the largest US industrial companies on Wednesday sounded a cautious note in their outlook for this year, saying they were seeing signs of recovery but suggesting prospects for real growth were uncertain.Caterpillar, Boeing and General Dynamics, three of the US’s biggest manufacturers, all projected full-year earnings below Wall Street’s expectations. Illinois Tool Works also issued earnings guidance for the first quarter that fell short of analysts’ estimates.The forecasts suggest that the manufacturing sector, which many economists have predicted will lead a US economic recovery this year, may find the going tougher than expected.Shares in Caterpillar dropped 6.6 per cent to $52.17 by midday trading in New York on Wednesday after the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment and heavy-duty engines said it expected full-year profits this year of about $2.50 per share, below analysts’ average forecasts of about $2.71 per share.The company said it would depend on China and other emerging economies for growth this year, saying the economies of North America, Europe and Japan “remain weak and have not rebounded as quickly as developing countries”.For the fourth quarter of 2009, Caterpillar unveiled net profit ahead of analysts’ expectations, although revenue fell short of predictions. The company’s net profit was $232m, or 36 cents per share, although excluding redundancy costs net profit was 41 cents per share. However, they exceeded average analysts’ forecasts of about 28 cents per share.As expected, the results were well down from the previous year, when Caterpillar made a net profit of $661m, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter. Revenues fell to $7.9bn, down from $12.9bn last year and below expectations of about $8.1bn.Boeing, the world’s second-biggest aircraft-maker, said it expected revenues for 2010 of $64bn-$66bn, down from $68.3bn last year. It forecast full-year earnings per share of $3.70-$4 – below the $4.25 analysts were expecting.However, the company also said it expected revenues to rebound in 2011, boosted by its 787 Dreamliner. The aircraft is now in flight testing, albeit more than two years behind its original schedule, with first deliveries projected for the fourth quarter this year. The longer-term outlook helped propel Boeing’s shares 5.3 per cent higher by midday at $60.78.Boeing made a net profit of $1.3bn, or $1.75 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to a net loss of $86m, or 12 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier and well ahead of analysts’ expectations of about $1.36 per share.Revenue was $17.9bn, up from $12.7bn a year earlier, broadly in line with Wall Street forecasts. Fourth-quarter results in 2008 reflected the impact of a damaging two-month-long machinists’ strike and a writedown on the 747 programme.General Dynamics, which makes tanks and submarines for the US military as well as business jets, said earnings for 2010 would be $6.40-$6.50 per share, below analysts’ average forecasts for earnings of about $6.53. The company’s shares were 2.1 per cent lower at $67.27 by midday.Boeing, which generates half of its revenues from its defence unit, and General Dynamics both face the uncertainty of the forthcoming US defence budget and Quadrennial Defense Review, which will be released on Monday.Boeing said it expected a “reduced scope on army modernisation and missile defence programmes” this year, while Jim McNerney, chairman, president and chief executive, said the company would look to “further reposition our defence, space and security business”.After almost a decade of strong growth, US defence companies are bracing themselves for a more challenging outlook. The budget is expected to indicate
modest increases in 2011 spending on research and kit while confirming long-term declines.The Quadrennial Defense Review, the Pentagon’s long-range planning document, is likely to reaffirm the Department of Defense’s recent efforts to shift spending towards current conflicts such as Afghanistan and away from expensive platforms designed for conventional wars.Illinois Tool Works, the industrial conglomerate, also disappointed Wall Street, saying it expects first-quarter profit from continuing operations of 48-60 cents per share, below analysts’ average expectations of about 63 cents per share. Its shares were 2.5 per cent lower at $44.06 by midday in New York.United Technologies, another industrial conglomerate, reaffirmed its earnings guidance of 7-13 per cent growth this year, but cautioned revenues would pick up more slowly.The company said its Carrier unit, which sells heating and air conditioning systems and is exposed to early cycle businesses, was seeing a recovery in residential housing orders, but its aerospace businesses had yet to turn.Its shares fell 1.7 per cent to $67.33 by midday."
342;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar looks to China for growth;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment and heavy-duty engines, said on Wednesday it would look mainly to China and other emerging economies for growth next year, saying it expected North America, Europe and Japan to remain weak.The company made the statement as it unveiled profits ahead of analysts’ expectations, although revenues disappointed, sending Caterpillar shares down in pre-market trading. IThe group made net income of $232m, or 36 cents per share, although excluding redundancy costs, net profit was 41 cents per share.As expected, the results were well down from the prior year, when Caterpillar made a profit of $661m, or $1.08 per share, in the fourth quarter. However, they exceeded average analysts’ forecasts of about 28 cents per share.Revenues fell to $7.9bn, down from $12.9bn last year and below expectations of about $8.1bn.The company reiterated its 2010 sales outlook, saying revenues would be up between 10 per cent and 25 per cent from last year, while profit would be about $2.50 per share.Two-thirds of Caterpillar’s sales come from outside North America and the company signalled it would depend primarily on those markets for growth. “We continue to see signs of economic improvement, particularly in China and most developing countries,” it said.“We are also seeing signs of improvement in North America, Europe and Japan, but these economies remain weak and have not rebounded as quickly as developing countries.”The company said improving commodity prices were helping to drive demand. “We have seen a marked increase in demand for mining equipment – a result of continued strong commodity prices and growing confidence in economic recovery,” it said.“We have also seen improvement in sales of aftermarket service parts, which is usually an early indicator of growing demand for machines and engines.”Caterpillar shares have risen in recent days in anticipation of the results. On Tuesday they rose 1.3 per cent.However, the lower-than-expected revenue figures for the fourth quarter may weigh on investors in Wednesday’s trading session.
343;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2010-01-05T19:05:35Z;Businesses demand OTC exemptions;;More than 160 of Europe’s largest companies have swung behind efforts to persuade regulators to exempt corporate users of over-the-counter derivatives from tough new regulations.The move is a sign that European company boards believe there are differences emerging between the US and European approaches to reforming the OTC markets that could adversely affect their operations.Lawmakers in the US and officials in Brussels are finalising sweeping rules that would force more OTC derivatives on to regulated exchanges and to be processed through clearing houses, to safeguard against counterparty risk.Companies on both sides of the Atlantic have been lobbying for exemptions from requirements to use OTC derivatives that are cleared and traded on ex-changes, arguing that this would cause a huge drain on cash and choke off what they see as legitimate options for hedging routine business risks.Clearing requires market participants to post funds as collateral against default, something companies currently do not have to do since they negotiate OTC derivatives – such as foreign exchange and interest rate swaps – from banks directly. Legislation passed by the House of Representatives last month exempted non-financial users of OTC swaps under certain circumstances, partly as a result of intense lobbying by US companies such as Caterpillar, the equipment maker.But the Senate, in a draft bill, has taken a firmer stance. While final legislation is some way off, companies in Europe fear that any toughening of the US stance might prompt Brussels to follow suit, even though European officials have so far signalled flexibility on the issue.The European Association of Corporate Treasurers on Tuesday sent a letter to the European Commission warning that if proposals being considered were not “further refined” there could be “a reduction in the amount of funds allocated to productive investment in the [European] economy and less use of prudent hedging to eliminate market risks, with a resulting increase in uncertainty and volatility in the real economy of Europe”.Richard Raeburn, EACT chairman, said companies were looking for a “clear carve-out” from the clearing and exchange-trading requirements.“My fear is that what happens in the US will pre-empt the ability to be sensible over here,” he told the Financial Times.The letter was signed by 164 companies including Beiersdorf, the consumer goods company, Cable & Wireless, Linde, the chemicals group, Renault, Skanska and Wolters Kluwer, the publishing group.Mattias Levin, an official in the internal market and services unit of the Commission, said last month staff did not believe it was possible to exclude “non-financial users” of OTC derivatives from the proposed regulations.He also said, however: “This is something that the Commission has taken to heart. We will not do anything to harm them [companies] excessively.”
344;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-12-29T22:57:59Z;Small US factories downbeat on growth;;Nearly a third of small US manufacturers polled by a consultancy expect to see no growth at all in demand next year, with business only starting to pick up in 2011, according to a report due to be released next week.The survey of 150 manufacturers by Frost & Sullivan suggests that industrial companies with fewer than 1,000 workers – which collectively employ the vast majority of people in the sector – are more pessimistic than their larger counterparts.Many bigger companies say they are already seeing tentative signs of growth and expect economic recovery to take hold next year.The US government said last week that the economy grew more slowly in the third quarter than previously thought, with gross domestic product expanding at an adjusted annual rate of 2.2 per cent.This month the Federal Reserve upgraded its assessment of the economy, saying economic activity had “continued to pick up”.However, Tim Geithner, US Treasury Secretary, said last week that he did not expect positive job growth until spring.But the Frost & Sullivan report indicates that the initial sense of recovery in the wider economy has not yet trickled down to smaller industrial companies.Jeff Owens, chief executive of Advanced Technology Services, the manufacturing equipment maintenance company that commissioned the survey, said businesses were treading carefully after the experience of the downturn.“Manufacturers were surprised by the strength of the downturn and got caught with inventories,” said Mr Owens.“Now companies are being cautious because they don’t want to set their budgets and plans on some optimistic revenue number and then get stuck with a bunch of costs mid-year.”Mr Owens said that although some bigger US manufacturers such as Caterpillar and John Deere had pointed to signs of “green shoots” in the economy, the recovery was not established enough to benefit the smaller industrial companies that depend on supplying large manufacturers.“The larger companies aren’t guaranteeing orders right now. Everyone’s staying very flexible. So it’s hard for small companies to say they know they’re going to grow next year.”One positive sign from the report was that of those manufacturers that said they had been adversely affected by the economic downturn, 75 per cent said they were planning to re-hire full-time workers when conditions improved.However, Mr Owens said companies were likely first to move back to full capacity, bring back workers who had been moved to temporary contracts and use overtime before considering hiring new permanent employees.“There are several phases that we have to work through before you can think about significant full-time employment coming back,” he said.
345;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Medicines discount deal for Caterpillar staff;;A health plan for workers at Caterpillar will steer them towards pharmacies operated by two leading retail chains, in a cost reduction effort that could be followed by other large US employers.The plan is being implemented from January 1 with Walmart, the largest US retailer, and Walgreens, one of the largest drugstore chains, affecting 120,000 employees, dependants and pensioners covered by the US heavy equipment maker’s health benefits.The move will lower payments for Caterpillar employees who opt to fill their drug prescriptions at the two retailers, rather than at rival pharmacies.Caterpillar said that the new direct scheme used “transparent cost-plus pricing . . . to eliminate unnecessary and hidden costs in the prescription drug supply chain, in turn lowering Caterpillar’s cost to purchase prescription drugs”.The two retailers will charge Caterpillar based on the wholesale price they pay for each individual drug, introducing more transparent pricing than the systems used by most large US employers.They are also likely to benefit from additional traffic to their stores from the arrangement, challenging the traditional system handling the $300bn annual US prescription drug market.Conventionally, large US employers employ a prescription benefit manager (PBM), such as Medco or Express Scripts, to negotiate discounts from manufacturers on their bulk prescription drug needs.The PBM then charges the employer a price that is different, usually higher, than the price charged by the pharmacy that fills the prescription, creating an opaque system that offers no incentive for the retailer, or the employee, to opt for lower prices.PBMs have also begun to compete with retailers by operating their own mail order pharmacies, increasing the attractiveness of the new model to stores.Caterpillar, which spends about $150m annually on prescription drugs for its employees, tested a pilot scheme for the programme with Walmart in 2008, with Walgreens announcing its participation this summer.Walmart said the “cost-plus” model could save employers 30-35 per cent of the cost of non-branded drugs with some savings also possible on branded drugs.Members of the Caterpillar health plan will be able to obtain basic prescriptions for free at Walmart and Walgreens, in place of the previous $15 co-payment previously required. The plans’ co-payments on more expensive prescriptions of $20 and $35 will be half the cost of going elsewhere.Walgreens said it would also offer Caterpillar health plan members discounts on non-prescription purchases at its stores.The two retailers together operate more than 10,000 pharmacies across the US and 85 per cent of Caterpillar’s plan members live within 10 miles of a branch.
346;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-12-02T01:02:54Z;Europe and US split on derivatives reform;;Europe’s largest companies have accused the US of being “adamantly unwilling” to relax proposed reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives markets, exposing the first transatlantic split over how far to clamp down on the opaque markets.The comments, made by the European Association of Corporate Treasurers (EACT), raise the possibility that Europe and the US may go their own ways in implementing reform of the OTC derivatives market even as US and European policymakers have pledged to collaborate on the outcome.Companies in the US and Europe have been lobbying against regulators’ demands that as many OTC derivatives as possible be shifted onto exchanges and processed through clearing houses.The administration of Barack Obama in the US and the European Commission argue this is needed to reduce so-called counterparty risk in the financial system since clearing houses ensure that transactions are completed even if one party to a trade defaults.Companies counter that they would be unfairly penalised if such reforms became law because the laws would oblige them to set aside extra cash – margin – to guarantee those trades. Companies generally negotiate OTC derivatives, such as foreign exchange swaps and jet fuel derivatives, with their banks and no such margin is required.There have been signs of a tougher stance by US lawmakers on whether to exempt non-financial users of OTC derivatives from the reforms. Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives’ financial services committee, last month surprised commentators by saying foreign exchange derivatives should not be exempted from a requirement that they be cleared, reversing a position taken in key legislation.Richard Raeburn, chairman of the EACT, whose members include Volkswagen, Siemens and Rolls-Royce, said his body would not hesitate to “look to the European Commission and Parliament to be prepared to take a more considered and pragmatic approach” than that of the US.Writing in today’s Financial Times, he described the US approach as being “driven by political grandstanding at the expense of rational policymaking”.“Over the last month it has become clear that congressional input to the legislative drafting in the US has become more hardline on the possibility of sensible exemptions to protect US business.“This poses a huge policy dilemma for those working in [Brussels] to refine their proposals, in what I welcome as a constructive response,” he said.Mr Raeburn said that if this resulted in “divergence from the US, so be it”.Martin O’Donovan, policy director, technical at the UK’s Association of Corporate Treasurers, said companies’ concerns had “got through to the [European] Commission” and all that remained was to “find a way of expressing some sort of exclusion for companies which is not too wide and that does not leave any loopholes”.He said that if this resulted in companies paying more to use OTC derivatives, “reluctantly companies are going to have to accept that”.In the US, the issue of company exemptions from OTC derivatives reform is likely to be raised today at a hearing of the Senate’s agriculture committee.The Coalition for Derivatives End-Users, a recently formed lobby group representing 180 US companies including Apple, Intel, Caterpillar and 3M recently wrote to House speaker Nancy Pelosi urging lawmakers to “preserve the ability of companies to manage their individual risk exposures by ensuring access to reasonably priced and customised over-the-counter derivatives”.
347;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:59:57+0000;From cornfields to Hollywood;;John Deere, the Illinois-based agricultural equipment manufacturer, is better known for green tractors than Hollywood attire. Yet in recent years, the company’s baseball caps have become popular in celebrity circles, seen on the heads of A-list actors such as Ashton Kutcher and George Clooney, while their green T-shirts have developed a cult following, spotted on the dancefloors of European nightclubs. It is all about as far from the cornfields of the Midwest as one could imagine.John Deere is not the only heavy industry company to thrive in fashion circles. The logos of Chevron, JCB and Caterpillar grace everything from watches to T-shirts.“It started years ago with promotional hats,” says Jeffrey Gredvig, director of brand licensing at John Deere. “What has developed over time is that these items have become a way of expressing a strong relationship with the brand. Customers want to associate with the company and people respect our values. Apparel started with our dealers and then demand grew beyond that.”Industrial companies put their names on items such as apparel, toys and accessories for a number of reasons. First, to improve the company’s profile, especially if it operates in a non-retail environment. Second, it can be a great money-spinner. But sometimes such new business ventures are simply driven by demand from existing customers and fashion-conscious shoppers who may want to associate themselves with the brand.The companies do not make products themselves but license the brands to apparel and toy manufacturers. Nonetheless, the jump from oil or heavy machinery to high street fashion needs to be handled carefully. As Mr Gredvig points out, John Deere has to ensure it does not fall victim to faddism. “We don’t chase fashion trends,” he says. “When George Clooney wore a John Deere hat it did create a lot of interest but the direction we take has to be sustainable – what we have to remember is that we don’t sell a lot of farm machinery in Hollywood.”Chevron, the energy company, has a nostalgic appeal for many customers due to its variety of brands and retro logos deriving from its long history as a petrol station chain owner. Glenn Weckerlin, the company’s global director of brands and product line management, says: “We have some great brands [such as Gulf and Texaco], which people have often grown up with and have a lot of good associations with. We are also a retailer with a great product, although we don’t actually want you to touch the product. This way, you can. If we can get people to wear our brand, it is a kind of success.” Besides, he adds, if one of the best-known fashion labels in the world is called Diesel, why shouldn’t a real-life gas station license T-shirts and jackets?When it comes to brand extensions, however, one company towers above all the rest – Caterpillar. “Our [consumer retail] department is 21 years old and it is a very significant business for us now,” says the company’s retail programme manager, Mark Jostes, adding that last year, sales of its licensed products topped $1bn (including clothing, boots, bags and toys) – the company’s total sales are just over $31bn. “We’re even opening lifestyle stores in places like Shanghai and Dubai. Caterpillar eyewear is very big in the South African market and our watches are very popular in the Caribbean.”In fact, Caterpillar’s clothing ranges have become so well known that its brand is rated 66th in Interbrand’s Best Global Brands Survey. Mr Jostes says the company has achieved what may be a kind of Holy Grail for industrials that branch into consumer markets – he knows of one instance where a man was so impressed with the service he received with his Cat boots that he bought a huge piece of earth-moving equipment.Rita Clifton, chairman of Interbrand, the branding consultancy, says there are good reasons for industrials to move their brands into retail. “One is to make more money. When you have a strong brand and loyal consumers, you want to try to extend your audience.” Moreover, she says, such companies appeal because of their solid and reliable reputation, built on well-made, robust and functional products. The world may not need another clothing chain but, in a retail market obsessed with “authenticity”, these brands have it in spades.Ms Clifton says that because these brands have their rugged heritage to fall back on, “they’re timeless. They don’t live or die by catwalk fashion. They can adopt and absorb trends, but they’re not a slave to them in any way.” Indeed, the fact that these brands have a slight disdain for fashion trends is part of their appeal to fashionistas.The only real downside, she says is “if the products are [poor quality] it could reflect badly on the host brand” and to this end companies need to police licensed products rigorously. For Caterpillar, this is a huge job. “Our quality control is very strict,” says Mr Jostes. “We receive 600,000 boxes a year for review, covering 20,000 products.”Along with ensuring the products are up to scratch, he says, there are some areas that the company feels do not fit with the brand. “We don’t do categories such as underwear and perfume.” There is an interesting object lesson here in one of Humvee’s consumer ranges – the Hummer fragrance for men, which causes sniggers in the UK where “hum” can mean to have body odour. Mr Gredvig says: “We walk away from quite a few licensing proposals – the brand is number one and money is number two.”Mr Weckerlin believes it is important to keep a sense of perspective. “We’re a company that makes fuel and if we can carry the quality of our brands through to other products, that’s great,” he says. “But for us, internally, this is one person’s day job. We could walk away from it, so you shouldn’t get your expectations of what it is out of whack.”There are plenty of businesses resisting the siren call of the licensees, in spite of demand. Copenhagen-based Maersk, whose primary activity is container shipping, has a Facebook fan group for devotees of the company’s distinctive star logo called “I Appreciate The Maersk Logo On An Almost Spiritual Level”. A common posting is “I want a Maersk T-shirt”.But, says the company, these are only available internally and there are no plans to make them available to the public. Which, of course, only makes them more desirable.
348;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-11-19T00:19:22Z;Forex bankers alarmed by clearing plans;;Foreign exchange bankers reacted with alarm on Wednesday to proposals from Barney Frank, the powerful chairman of the House financial services committee, that would require trades in currency derivatives to be processed through a centralised clearing system.Bankers said the proposals would introduce new systemic risks into the financial system and that the sheer size of the market would dwarf the risk that could be sustained by any clearing house.About $3,200bn of currency is traded daily around the world. About two-thirds of that trade is in derivatives that are used frequently by companies during the normal course of business to hedge the risk that currencies move sharply between a deal being struck and completed.Bankers say that companies would face higher costs for these hedges under centralised clearing and that potentially they could be required to post extra collateral.But some large users of currency hedging said on Wednesday they were unconcerned by the putative change, having calculated that the potential increase in cost would be “marginal” and outweighed by greater security and price transparency.The proposals by Mr Frank, outlined in an interview with Risk magazine, come as lawmakers and regulators tussle over the detail of legislative proposals governing the vast over-the-counter derivatives market.Some companies have shrugged off entreaties from their banks to lobby members of Congress over derivatives reform, concluding that their interests could be better served by the broad shift to central clearing and exchange trading.Others – such as Caterpillar this week – have argued they face costly margin requirements under some versions of the regulatory reforms now under way.Mr Frank said that mooted exemptions for foreign exchange trades from the OTC market reforms being considered by Congress would not be adopted, despite extensive lobbying from bankers.“The administration had asked for that amendment, but we are going to take away the exemption for foreign currency [swaps and forwards],” he said.It is far from clear whether the proposals would survive the legislative process.Bankers lobbied Congress to get an exemption for foreign exchange trading, arguing that it is essentially the glue that holds the financial system together.“This isn’t about us protecting our business, central clearing is about deliberately introducing concentration risk into the market – its nuts,” said the head of foreign exchange at one of the largest forex banks.One senior official at a large US bank added: “Companies are already baffled why they’re caught up at all in this given that what they do here didn’t contribute to the crisis. Now they’ll be baffled squared.”
349;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:28:41+0000;Manufacturers seen as missing link to revival;;Manufacturing is the “missing link” that could galvanise Britain’s economic recovery by maximising the commercial uses of its scientific and technological ideas, according to one of the country’s leading industrial thinkers.Mike Gregory, the head of Cambridge University’s Institute for Manufacturing, said it should not be regarded as a narrow segment of the economy but as a “sequence of operations that knit together the processes of innovation” and transfers this into wealth.“The UK is in an excellent position to do well as we move into a new era of manufacturing where we think of it as a whole range of activities encompassing design, research, logistics, marketing and other services, as well as bending metal,” said Prof Gregory.If the official statistics on manufacturing included these activities its contribution to the economy would be substantially higher, he said.“While under the conventional way of working out the data manufacturing accounted last year for only about 13 per cent of the UK economy, if you define the activity more broadly the contribution rises to 25-30 per cent,” Prof Gregory said.The Cambridge institute, whose new £15m headquarters is being opened on Thursday by the Duke of Edinburgh, trains students in disciplines ranging from engineering and production skills to management and green manufacturing. It also works with companies including Unilever, Rolls-Royce, Caterpillar, Boeing and BAE Systems on research projects and employee education.Prof Gregory, a 61-year-old engineer who began his career in the machine tool industry before becoming a Cambridge University academic in 1976, welcomed the government’s new-found interest in “high-value” manufacturing as a means of speeding economic ­recovery.“I applaud the efforts of Lord Mandelson [the business secretary] to try to understand better the forces shaping manufacturing and use this to help devise the right policies to help manufacturers,” he said.But he argued that high-value manufacturing required a broad definition. “The areas of manufacturing you can put into this category encompass a lot of areas that require unusually high levels of skill and experience, and involve products where the design needs to change frequently to accommodate shifts in taste and technology,” Prof Gregory said.“Once you’ve settled on a definition [for high-value manufacturing] you will find it covers a wide range of fields, from the design and production of babies’ buggies to chocolate manufacturing.”Prof Gregory said that companies doing a mixture of service and manufacturing activities, which are not always classified as manufacturers under conventional ways of analysing the economy, also constitute an important economic force.“We have a group of companies – servi-manufacturers – that add up to a more important part of the economy than a lot of people recognise,” he said.Another unsung group is the “virtual manufacturer” – companies that concentrate on the design of goods but leave the physical act of manufacturing to producers in lower-cost countries, such as China.“These [design-based] companies are still at heart manufacturers since they are concerned with the transformation of materials into products. Whether they choose to contract out production itself or put it offshore is a matter for them.“If it makes sense to use the offshoring method, then companies should go down this route so long as they maintain control of as much intellectual property associated with manufacturing as they can,” Prof Gregory said.
350;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-11-16T20:28:47Z;Performance in Asia crucial for Caterpillar;;"For Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, a true test of how well his company emerges from the recession will be its performance in the next few years in Asia.In this regard, the score card for the world’s biggest manufacturer of construction equipment is a mixture of good and bad. While Mr Owens is happy with Caterpillar’s progress in China, he is “disappointed” with Caterpillar’s weak showing in India.In both countries, purchases of earth-moving machinery look set to rise next year in line with huge amounts of cash being ploughed into big infrastructure projects such as roads and buildings.China is regarded by Mr Owens as a success story for Caterpillar, with the company’s sales having held up against competitors such as Komatsu of Japan and state-owned Chinese machinery makers.But in India, Caterpillar languishes in fourth position in sales of diggers, loaders and other construction machines, and well behind the industry leader – the much smaller JCB of the UK.“JCB has kicked our bums in India, and I am determined we will do better,” Mr Owens says.With Caterpillar’s sales in other parts of the world having been pushed down by the economic downturn, its activities in Asia have taken on more importance.In 2008, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 17.5 per cent of Caterpillar’s sales of $51.3bn.However, on the evidence of figures for the first nine months of 2009, this year the region is likely to be responsible for more than a fifth of full-year revenues, expected to be about $32bn.Looking further ahead, Mr Owens has set his sights on Caterpillar’s annual sales returning to about $50bn by 2011-2012; with Asia playing a big role in the intended growth, along with a strong contribution from the US as the country’s economy picks up.In the whole of Asia, a willingness to be patient and think ahead is a prerequisite for success, says Mr Owens – a 63-year-old economist who has had the top job at Caterpillar since 2004, and is stepping down next October.“If you want to do well in Asia, you’ve got to think about the next 5-10 years, not just the next set of quarterly results,” he says.In China, Caterpillar started its first sizeable joint production venture in 1994, in partnership with state-owned Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group.Since then, Caterpillar has not only gained control of the venture through an 87 per cent stake but followed a similar pattern to acquire 100 per cent of another former government owned business, Shandong SEM.Mr Owens says that Caterpillar has worked hard in China to convince government authorities that it can be a responsible owner of such facilities.“We’re not a ‘buy and then sell out’ kind of company,” says Mr Owens. “We’ve spent a lot of time in China spelling out how we aim to be good stewards of businesses in China for years to come.“Last year, Caterpillar had sales of about $2.5bn in China, where it now has 11 plants, and is keen to increase this revenue significantly in the next few years.To help in this goal it has started a $1bn investment programme in China to strengthen its manufacturing and sales operations in the next few years.As for India, the story is far less upbeat.In 1986, the company signed a deal under which Hindustan Motors, an engineering supplier, made some of its machines under licence. But Caterpillar was slow to take control of manufacturing operations in the country, acquiring Hindustan only eight years ago.Since then Caterpillar has moved ahead in India much less quickly than JCB – a company whose worldwide sales last year of £2bn [$3.3bn] were about a fifteenth of its own.“Sir Anthony Bamford [JCB’s chairman and owner] has recognised the importance of India for a long time and has done a good job there,” Mr Owens says.According to Off-Highway Research, a UK consultancy, Caterpillar last year in India was in fourth position in terms of sales of construction machines, accounting for only 7 per cent of the 34,500 units sold.JCB – the leader – accounted for 39 per cent.Last year, Caterpillar started a $200m investment programme in India to improve its position in that market.The investments by Caterpillar include new engine and equipment manufacturing operations and moves to strengthen its dealer network.Mr Owens declines to give detailed figures for the company’s sales in India, saying that last year they came to a “few hundred million dollars”. JCB says its own sales in Asia are about £400m.The one positive point that Mr Owens could make about China and India is that – at present – the former adds up to a much bigger market for construction machines than its economic rival.According to Off-Highway Research, last year in China sales of the equipment added up to $14bn, seven times as much as the comparable market in India.However, by the time demand for construction machines in India start to rival those in its more economically powerful neighbour, Mr Owens hopes Caterpillar’s own performance in the country will have shown a considerable improvement."
351;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Caterpillar warns on OTC regulation;;US manufacturers could be hampered from creating jobs and contributing to the economic recovery if Congress presses ahead with plans to curb the use of “over-the- counter” derivatives, Caterpillar has warned.The warning from Caterpillar – the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment and a bellwether of the US economy – reflects mounting concern that industry could suffer from lawmakers’ efforts to reform the oversight of OTC derivatives, which have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.A draft bill to reform US financial regulation presented last week by Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate banking committee, would introduce tougher capital rules on institutions using OTC contracts, including many industrial companies that trade the contracts to protect themselves from volatility in commodity prices, exchange rates and interest rates.US regulators and lawmakers want most OTC deals – in which two parties privately agree a customised contract – to be centrally traded and cleared.Bespoke contracts that cannot be centrally cleared would be subject to relatively high margin requirements.While proposals put forward by committees in the House of Representatives would exempt most “end-users”, such as industrial hedgers, from these margin requirements, the Dodd plan takes a stricter line.“This is a narrower approach than what the House had and we’re concerned about that,” Clay Thompson, Caterpillar’s head of government affairs, told the Financial Times. “Posting margin would have a big impact on our working capital. We’d be using working capital to post margin that could otherwise be deployed in our core business. Our ability to grow the company would be affected.”Dorothy Coleman of the National Association of Manufacturers said Congress was mistakenly bracketing industrial hedgers with financial swap dealers. “The end-user market, which represents about 10 per cent of the OTC market, did not have anything to do with the financial crisis,” Ms Coleman said. “It’s a market that worked well, didn’t cause the problem and has nothing to do with systemic risk.”European companies have also warned about the impact of OTC reform, with German utility Eon saying it could cause it to raise up to €7.5bn ($11.2bn) in additional credit lines.Boeing, the US’s biggest aircraft-maker, has warned that it might be forced to cut jobs if access is restricted to customised OTC derivatives, since the inability to manage variable costs would force the manufacturer to raise its prices to uncompetitive levels.Ms Coleman said if OTC trading were made very expensive, many manufacturers would not be able to hedge their risk, which would add much more volatility to their earnings statements.
352;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-29T20:59:21Z;Wall St buoyant after US GDP grows;;Wall Street rose strongly on Thursday, reversing a four-day losing run, after the US economy emerged from the worst recession for more than 70 years.Stocks were also underpinned by better-than-expected corporate earnings, which raised hopes that the seven-month equity rally can continue.The S&P 500 finished 2.2 per cent higher at 1,066.11 – its biggest one-day gain since July 23.The Nasdaq Composite index, the technology index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue-chip stocks also moved higher. The Nasdaq rose 1.8 per cent at 2,097.55. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 per cent at 9,962.58.The economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.5 per cent in the third quarter, its first expansion in a year.A rebound in consumer spending and investment in new home-building were behind the growth, which was higher than expected. Weekly US jobless claims also fell, although the drop was less than expected.Stronger-than-expected results from some of the market bellwethers, among 50 companies reporting earnings in the S&P 500, reinforced the optimism among investors, helping most sectors to gain ground, with financials and materials leading the way.Even poor results from ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest company by market value, could not sour the mood. It saw a fourth consecutive fall in profits, lower than expectations, after a slump in demand for fuel. But its shares still rose 0.16 per cent to $73.96. The shares have dropped nearly 10 per cent this year.In spite of Thursday’s gains, the S&P 500 is still 3 per cent down since Thursday last week as many investors have taken profits following the powerful rally over the past seven months. But the index is up more than 50 per cent since the low this year on March 9.Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “US GDP has boosted the markets. The consensus was for a rise of 3.2 per cent, and the numbers were comfortably above that. We are confident stocks can rise from here, with technology and consumer discretionaries helping to drive the market.”Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, added: “We may see the market trend lower until Thanksgiving at the end of the month, but I am not too worried. The weaker dollar and stimulus are underpinning stocks and will continue to do so.”Bellwethers Kellogg, Colgate-Palmolive, Procter & Gambleand Motorola all saw their share prices boosted by earnings.Motorola’s shares enjoyed some of the biggest gains of the day on their profits, which took investors by surprise. Its shares rose 9.80 per cent to $8.74.Kellogg topped analyst expectations, posting a higher quarterly profit as the company was helped by lower commodity costs. Its shares rose 2.78 per cent to $51.38.Procter & Gamble saw first-quarter profit fall less than analysts estimated after price increases helped counter volume declines. This prompted a 4.04 per cent rise in its share price to $59.54.Colgate-Palmolive saw its shares rise by 1.62 per cent to $78.94 on higher-than-expected third-quarter profits.Other stocks that were up strongly included Caterpillar, Alcoa and American Express.Caterpillar’s shares rose 5.18 per cent to $57.25, Alcoa’s were up 8.97 per cent to $13 and American Express rose 5.11 per cent to $36.44.Financials, materials, consumer discretionaries, energy, industrials and technology were the best performing sectors. However, analysts warned that the big test for stocks lay ahead as the authorities removed the vast amount of stimulus.Mr Orlando said: “It is the back half of 2010 that we worry about, regarding a sustained economic recovery and what that means for stocks, as some of the stimulus starts to be pulled.”The US Federal Reserve bought $1.94bn of Treasuries on Thursday, completing its buy-back programme for government bonds.The purchase programme began in March and was designed to reverse the steepest US recession since the 1930s.
353;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;JCB sees no recovery signs outside China;;JCB faces a struggle to avoid its first annual loss this year, its chief executive warned, as he cautioned that he saw no recovery in demand for construction equipment outside of China next year.Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the UK’s largest maker of earth-moving machines, said that JCB’s revenues could drop between 35 to 40 per cent this year, which would make it one of the biggest year-on-year falls in the company’s 64-year history. He declined to give an outlook on JCB’s profits for 2009 but indicated that it faced a tough struggle to avoid losing money.“The company has never made an [annual] loss and we are going to work hard to try to prevent this happening,” Mr Taylor said. He forecast that unit sales could drop to 35,000, compared with 56,000 in 2008.Mr Taylor said he thought demand for construction machines outside China this year would fall by about 50 per cent, making 2008 one of the sector’s most difficult years since the second world war. “In 2010 we are planning for demand [outside China] to be flat,” Mr Taylor said.“Looking around the world, with the exception of a few countries that include India, I can see few positive signs in relation to underlying demand,” he added.The privately-owned company – controlled by the family of Sir Anthony Bamford, its chairman – will report on Wednesday that pre-tax profit in 2008 fell to £39m ($63.7m) from £187m in the previous year as revenues declined 12 per cent to £2bn, from £2.25bn.Since the beginning of 2007, JCB has cut its global workforce from 9,500 to about 7,000. It employs 4,500 in the UK where it has its main factories.The company is one of the world’s top eight makers of construction equipment by value. Its focus on smaller, less costly machines, however, pushes it up to third in terms of unit sales – though still some distance behind Caterpillar of the US and Japan’s Komatsu, the industry leaders.Last week, Caterpillar cheered investors when it said it expected economic conditions to improve quickly, and indicated its revenues next year could rise by 10 to 25 per cent. However, its relative confidence is linked to the company being helped by fairly high demand for large diggers and other such machines used in mining – an area to which JCB has much less exposure.Based on JCB’s sales figures last year, the UK company’s products accounted for just more than 10 per cent of the world market for earth-moving equipment.In China – where JCB has opened a factory but has a small presence – demand for machines this year will probably increase 10 to 15 per cent, Mr Taylor said, and a similar rate of growth was likely next year.China accounts for between a quarter and a third of world demand for construction equipment, which in 2008 totalled about £100bn.A bright spot for JCB is India, where the company is the largest company in construction machines by units, accounting last year for just more than half the total 30,000 machines sold. India and the UK are JCB’s two biggest markets, accounting for 20 to 25 per cent of its sales each year. This year India is likely to become the company’s biggest destination for sales.
354;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-26T22:58:18Z;Caterpillar move adds to hopes of US recovery;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment and heavy duty engines, announced on Monday it was rehiring workers for the first time since the economic downturn took hold two years ago, in a tentative sign that the US industrial economy might be recovering.The manufacturer is widely seen as a bellwether of the US and global industrial economy. In 2007 it was one of the first big US companies to warn that the country was entering a serious economic downturn.Caterpillar has sacked 34,000 workers around the world in the past two years, in response to slumping demand and plunging commodity prices. Its regular announcements about job cuts have punctuated the decline in US manufacturing.The company said on Monday that it would rehire 550 of its US employees before the end of next year, including support, management and production employees. At the same time, it said it would permanently sack 2,500 US-based workers who had been placed on temporary redundancy. However, these numbers were already included in the 34,000 job cuts.“The 550 rehires are more significant than the job cut figure,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.“It’s an important first step, showing increased activity. With commodity prices heading up and with dealers replacing their inventories, we now seem to be more in the hiring part of the cycle than the job-cutting part.”When Barack Obama, the US president, pushed for Congress to pass its $787bn stimulus bill earlier this year, he argued that it would allow Caterpillar to hire back some of the workers it had let go.However, Jim Owens, Caterpillar chief executive, recently told the Financial Times there had been a “miscommunication” over how quickly the manufacturer could rehire workers. “Passing the stimulus bill doesn’t translate into jobs overnight,” he said.Last week Caterpillar gave an upbeat view of the global economy.It said conditions were improving and revealed it was making plans for a quick rebound, as it delivered third-quarter results. It raised its outlook for this year and issued a bullish forecast for next.The company said it expected sales and revenue to increase between 10 per cent and 25 per cent next year from the midpoint of 2009, as dealers stopped winding down inventories.Caterpillar’s share price has recovered strongly since hitting a low of $30.29 in July. Last week Bank of America-Merrill Lynch raised its price target and RBC Capital gave an “outperform” rating.The company has named Doug Oberhelman, head of its engines and turbines unit, to succeed Mr Owens, who will retire next year.
355;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-23T21:33:39Z;Overview: Strong results fail to shift cautious mood;;The US earnings season was the primary driver of global markets this week, as investors reacted positively for much of the week to forecast-beating reports from sector bellwethers such as Caterpillar and Microsoft.Equities in most leading economies touched highs for the year as confidence about global growth boosted the price of oil and heightened risk appetite, causing the dollar to dip below significant levels. However, the positive tone fizzled out by late Friday in New York, with key stock indices lower on the week.Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC, noted that with more than a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation having now reported, the season was comfortably trumping expectations.“Our analysis shows that 78 per cent of the constituent companies have provided a positive earnings per share surprise in the third quarter and only 12 per cent have missed [on average, 60 per cent beat expectations and 20 per cent miss].“However, it’s not just the number of companies beating expectations that has impressed, but also the magnitude of the beat – we estimate a positive EPS surprise of 21 per cent for the S&P 500 index.”Analysts would now move to upgrade earnings for the fourth quarter and this “should continue to provide a nice tailwind for the equity market over the next few months”, he said.However, a sharply contrasting view of the equity market’s prospects came from Andrew Smithers, at City of London research boutique Smithers & Co.He examined the S&P 500’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio and its q ratio – the market capitalisation of companies compared with their net worth.“Valid approaches [to valuation] must agree and these do. They currently show that the US stock market is around 40 per cent overvalued,” he concluded.The sentiment had to contend with some apparently counter-intuitive reactions to two pieces of important GDP data.Markets had a wobble on Thursday after China revealed its economy had grown by 8.9 per cent in the third quarter and investors worried that such robust activity might hasten the removal of stimulus programmes.In contrast, Friday’s news that the UK economy had shrunk by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter – against expectations of 0.2 per cent growth – was greeted by an initial gentle improvement in London stocks as traders reasoned the data ensured the Bank of England’s ultra-loose monetary policy would remain in place for the foreseeable future.The S&P 500 index succumbed to some profit taking, falling 0.7 per cent over the week to 1,079.6, having at one stage breached the 1,100 level.In London, the FTSE 100 flirted with 5,300 but ended 1 per cent higher at 5,242.6, after mining stocks put in a good performance.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended flat at 1,008.9, helped by some well-received purchasing managers and German business confidence data released on Friday.A number of emerging markets were particularly buoyant. In China, the Shanghai Composite recovered its poise to end the week up 4.4 per cent at 3,107.85. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 3 per cent to 22,589.73.In Brazil, the stock market stuttered on Tuesday following an attempt by the authorities to curb the appreciation of its currency by imposing a 2 per cent tax on foreign portfolio investments.The Bovespa index shed 2.9 per cent on the news but by Friday closed down 1.7 per cent for the week.The Pakistan stock market suffered from growing concerns that the army’s campaign in Waziristan could further destabilise the country. The Karachi SE 100 index lost 7 per cent over the week.In currencies, improved investor sentiment meant little demand for the haven status of the US dollar.The US dollar fell through the $1.50 level against the euro and flirted with parity against the Swiss franc.However, Neil Mellor at Bank of New York Mellon, said he saw little indication that central banks were poised to act on the falling dollar.“Despite the fact that the incidence of pain caused by reciprocal currency strength is being broadly-felt, there are a number of authorities currently conveying an air of indifference.”In commodity markets, the sliding dollar also provided extra impetus to the oil price.The benchmark US crude contract hit $82 a barrel during the week but retreated to $80.50.Gold ended the week little changed at $1,058 a troy ounce.Government bond markets saw selling as traders plumped for riskier assets. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury rose from 3.413 per cent at the start of the week to 3.49 per cent.
356;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-20T23:28:31Z;Upbeat start to US earnings season;;Corporate America issued a string of quarterly earnings results on Tuesday that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, reflecting how big US companies have cut costs faster than revenues have fallen.However, stocks fell as investors focused on the lack of top-line improvement, with the S&P 500 index slipping 0.6 per cent to close at 1,091.06.“A lot of the numbers are not due to revenues but due to cost-cutting, so the market has sold off slightly, regardless of the fact that the results have been good,” said Doreen Mogavero, a floor trader on the New York Stock Exchange.Caterpillar, an industrial bellwether that is the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, exemplified the trend, smashing analysts’ earnings-per-share expectations while suffering dramatic falls in both net profits and revenues.Excluding a one-off tax windfall, the manufacturer reported a net profit of $275m, or 48 cents per share, down from $868m, or $1.39 per share, a year ago – but far above analysts’ average forecasts of 6 cents a share.Sales in the third quarter were $7.3bn, down from $13bn last year – and slightly below average analysts’ forecasts. But Caterpillar said sales had hit a bottom, with Jim Owens, chief executive, citing “signs of improving economic conditions”.Yahoo lifted projections after reporting a tripling of third-quarter profits, helped by the previously reported sale of a small stake in Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba.com and cost cuts.The previously reported sale contributed $98m to the quarterly net of $188m, or 13 cents a share, up from $56.2m, or 4 cents, in the same quarter of 2008. Analysts had expected a net of 7 cents a share. Revenue fell to $1.58bn from $1.79bn, but the drop was less than expected.“Brand spending is starting to happen a little bit more,” said Yahoo’s chief financial officer, Tim Morse.Coca-Cola said falling sales in the US and Europe were offset by double-digit growth in India and China, enabling it to earn $1.9bn, or 81 cents per diluted share, unchanged from last year.Muhtar Kent, chief executive, said: “I think China, India, Brazil – and others like Indonesia, Vietnam, places in the Middle East and Eurasia – are all showing recovery is on the way.”Results at State Street, the institutional money manager, were boosted by job cuts and reductions in dividends and employee bonuses. It reported an 8 per cent rise in net income to $516m.Cost-cutting also helped Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, exceed expectations in spite of lower sales, as some of its most popular drugs lost patent protection. Excluding extraordinary items, it made profits of $3.5bn or 51 cents per share, down from $4.2bn or 62 cents per share a year earlier.Other companies to report better-than-expected results on Tuesday included BlackRock, the asset management group, and Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor.
357;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-20T21:28:01Z;Overview: Profit taking sees Europe and US lose ground;;Western stock markets endured profit-taking on Tuesday as downbeat economic news trumped upbeat earnings reports, though Asian equities rallied to fresh 13-month highs.A strong showing by Wall Street on Monday, and better than expected results from Apple after the bell, helped the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rise 1 per cent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gain 0.8 per cent and the Shanghai Composite add 1.5 per cent. The FTSE Asia Pacific Index rose 1 per cent. However, by the time the trading day reached Europe, investors had become more circumspect.The sale by Qatar of £1.4bn of Barclays shares was interpreted as evidence that after the strong rally in financial stocks, some investors considered now was a good time to take some of their chips off the table.European bourses and the global equity futures benchmark – the S&P 500 contract – lost ground in response.A further slew of well-received US earnings reports, including an optimistic forecast from construction and farming equipment maker Caterpillar, led to initial hopes for another day of gains. But sentiment was again dented by downbeat macroeconomic news.New construction of US homes in September rose by 0.5 per cent to an annual rate of 590,000. This was less than the forecast 610,000 increase and again raised concerns that the hoped for housing recovery was proving anaemic.In addition, US producer prices fell 0.6 per cent last month – against expectations they would be flat – prompting analysts to predict companies’ pricing power would remain subdued. “The rise in commodity prices seems to be pushing core intermediate and raw materials higher, but low capacity utilisation levels should keep finished goods inflationary pressures benign,” said Anika R. Khan, economist at Wells Fargo Securities.Paul Ashworth, at Capital Economics, argued that deflation rather than inflation still posed the biggest risk to the global economy. “Falling prices alone are not necessarily a big problem. However, if the decline in prices and wages coincides with a high level of indebtedness, then you have all the ingredients needed for a potentially devastating economic meltdown,” he said.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent.The Vix index, a measure of US equity volatility, was down 2.5 per cent at 20.96 suggesting investors were fairly sanguine about the session’s losses.The FTSE 100 lost 0.72 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.5 per cent.Brazil took the wooden spoon for the worst performing major market after the government imposed a tax on foreign investments in local stocks and bonds.The move by Brasilia, which was intended to stop the real from further appreciating, trimmed 4.1 per cent off São Paulo’s Bovespa index.Government bonds were boosted by the falling stock markets and the soft US inflation numbers.The yield on the US 10-year benchmark fell 6 basis points to 3.33 per cent, while the yield on the German 10-year bund fell the same amount to 3.24 per cent.News that UK government borrowing rose to £77.3bn in the first six months of the financial year, more than double the amount for the same period last year, did not sap demand for gilts.The yield on the 10-year gilt fell 7.7bp to 3.53 per cent. The Canadian dollar was the main feature in the currency markets.It fell 2.2 per cent to C$1.0506 against the US dollar after the Bank of Canada warned that the strength of the currency would damp growth.Meanwhile, the dollar threatened to breach the $1.50 level to the euro in early trade, before deteriorating investor risk appetite gave it a fillip.The dollar was later up 0.3 per cent to $1.4925.In commodities markets oil stole the limelight. It briefly traded above $80 a barrel – its highest level for 12 months – but then fell 0.7 per cent to $79.09 as equities lost ground and the dollar rallied.Gold was also hit by the dollar’s turnround. Late in New York, gold had fallen 0.7 per cent to $1,056.88 a troy ounce.
358;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-20T21:20:13Z;Caterpillar;;The view from the mud is pretty optimistic. Caterpillar was in upbeat mode on Tuesday as it reported third quarter results that were less bad than feared. Assuming that central banks don’t throw sand in the gears by raising interest rates too soon, the world’s largest maker of earth moving equipment expects the global economy to grow by 3 per cent next year. Having hit bottom, the group expects its own sales will rebound by a swift 10-25 per cent.Such cheer may be reasonable because hitting the lower end of that range merely requires no further decline in end-demand. Caterpillar dealers simply have to stop clearing out their inventories to provide a revenue boost. There should also be pent-up demand to satisfy. The US – still the group’s largest and most profitable market – peaked back in 2006, and McGraw Hill Construction forecasts total US construction will grow by 11 per cent in 2010.The conundrum for investors is assessing how fast and far earnings can rebound. After almost tripling from its March low, Caterpillar trades on about 30 times the consensus earnings estimate of $2 for next year. Yet from the previous 2002 trough, earnings were five times higher by 2006. Caterpillar’s management aspires to make $8-10 per share in 2012.Two reasons suggest caution though. First, there is a risk that the current recovery is an unusual seasonal pattern – a pick-up after temporary factory closures in many industries over the summer could be skewing the data for September and October. Second, the scale of job cuts at Caterpillar (34,000) and its suppliers will make revving production back up again quickly a challenge, particularly while credit remains scarce. It is possible to slip up while climbing out of the mud.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
359;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-20T20:48:06Z;Weak economic data weigh on Wall Street;;US equities fell on Tuesday, with indices pulling back from their highest levels in more than a year as traders focused on weak economic data rather than higher-than-expected earnings, including impressive figures from Apple and Caterpillar.Optimism that equities would post a second day of gains this week on strong earnings fizzled out when data on new residential construction showed a smaller- than-expected rise in September and the producer price index unexpectedly dropped during the month.The S&P 500 lost 0.6 per cent to 1,091.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.5 per cent lower at 10,041.48 and Nasdaq dropped 0.6 per cent at 2,163.47. On Monday, all three indices touched their highest levels in a year and the S&P traded above 1,100.The weaker-than-expected data weighed on homebuilders’ stocks and fuelled uncertainty about the lingering effects of the financial crisis and economic recession. “Housing is the epicentre of this whole crisis,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “So, anything to do with housing matters.”Mr Stone said that, after the rally in stocks over the past few weeks in anticipation of a strong earnings season, Tuesday’s declines also represent a pause for the results to catch up with those rosy expectations.Nonetheless, many earnings reports have provided evidence to support an economic rebound.“All the key bellwethers – Google, Intel, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and now Apple – have been really strong,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “That is what we were hoping to see. That is what will give us some confidence that the cycle is turning.”After the close of trading on Monday, Apple saw profit jump to a record $1.67bn, or $1.82 a share, from $1.14bn or $1.26 a share, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.42. Its shares rose 4.7 per cent to $198.76 and had traded near the all-time high of $202.96 hit in December of 2007. Caterpillar, maker of construction and farming equipment, on Tuesday announced third-quarter earnings of 64 cents per share, down from the third quarter of 2008, but a massive jump on analysts’ forecast of just 6 cents a share.Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive, offered an upbeat outlook. “We believe the third quarter marked the low point for Caterpillar sales and revenues in what has been the toughest recession since the 1930s. We are seeing encouraging signs that indicate a recovery may be under way.”Caterpillar shares ended up 3 per cent to $59.61.Pfizer said third-quarter revenue fell 3 per cent to $11.6bn versus the same quarter a year ago, but it still beat consensus estimates of $11.4bn, and its profit rose. Shares rose 0.3 per cent at $17.93, paring earlier gains. Lexmark, which makes printers, rose 16 per cent to $26.16 after better than expected revenue and profit.Shares in Lockheed Martin were down 6.5 per cent to $71.99. The world’s largest defence contractor, said that its third-quarter profit rose by 1.9 per cent as it enjoyed stronger sales of electronics and aeronautics, but it projected that earnings would drop next year.Net income at Lockheed rose to $797m, or $2.07 a share, from $782m, or $1.92 a share, in the same quarter a year ago, beating expectations of $1.82 a share.Coca-Cola was off 1.3 per cent at $54.07 after its quarterly revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations and the soft drinks maker warned that economic conditions would continue to weigh on consumers. Net revenues fell 4 per cent to $8.04bn versus analysts’ forecasts for $8.11bn. Coca-Cola reported earnings of $1.9bn or 81 cents a diluted share, unchanged from the same quarter last year.Boeing dropped 2.9 per cent to $51.89 after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underperform from equal weight and cut the target price to $43 from $50 on concerns about further delays on the 787, negative 2010 cash flow and poor aircraft order demand.Boston Scientific lowered its guidance for full-year net sales, prompting a 15.7 per cent drop in its shares to $8.57. After the close, Yahoo! reported a strong increase in third-quarter profit. Shares rose 1 per cent in after hours trade.
360;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-20T13:05:54Z;Caterpillar plans for quick economic rebound;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment and heavy-duty engines, gave an upbeat view of the global economy on Tuesday, saying conditions were improving throughout the world and revealing that it was now planning for a quick rebound, as it raised its outlook for this year and issued a bullish forecast for next year.The manufacturer is widely seen as a bellwether of the US and global industrial economy. It was one of the first big US companies to warn, back in 2007, that the US was entering a serious economic downturn.“While we are still navigating through a very difficult environment in 2009, we see signs of improving economic conditions throughout most of the world,” said Jim Owens, chief executive.“While 2010 will still be a difficult year, we expect improvement in our top line from the lows of 2009, and it’s critical that we manage on the way up as well as we did in the face of declining volume. As a result, we’ve already started planning for an upturn. When it comes, it can come quickly, and we, our dealers and our suppliers will be prepared.”The company said it now expected 2009 full-year profits of between $1.10 per share and $1.30 per share, compared with its previous forecast of 40 cents to $1.50 per share. For 2010, Caterpillar said it expected sales and revenues to increase 10 per cent to 25 per cent from the midpoint of 2009, as dealers stopped winding down their inventories, a trend that has hit sales this year.Caterpillar improved its forecasts as it reported quarterly earnings well ahead of Wall Street’s expectations. The manufacturer made a profit of $404m, or 64 cents per share, in the three months to the end of September, down from $868m, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier but above analysts’ average forecasts of 6 cents per share. Sales in the quarter were $7.3bn, down from $13bn last year and slightly below average analysts’ forecasts.Expectations about strong earnings pushed Caterpillar shares up sharply on Monday, prompted by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch raising its price target for the company and RBC Capital initiating coverage of Caterpillar with an “outperform” rating.Caterpillar shares were up 6 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday at $61.30.
361;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-10-05T18:55:52Z;Financial stocks lift mood on Wall Street;;Financial stocks led US equities higher on Monday, helping investors to regain some confidence after two weeks of losses.Goldman Sachs advised buying shares in large banks, lifting JPMorgan 3.3 per cent to $43.22 and Wells Fargo 5.6 per cent to $27.76.The bank said larger institutions were set to outperform regional banks as the acquisitions they made at the height of the crisis begin to pay off.Goldman Sachs itself gained 2.9 per cent to $184.72 after it emerged that the bank stands to receive a payment of about $1bn if the commercial lender CIT files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Last week, CIT launched a debt exchange as part of a restructuring plan to avoid collapse. CIT shares were up 2.6 per cent to $1.20.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of Citigroup’s main investors, urged the US government to sell its stake in the bank as soon as this year in order to boost investor confidence, according to reports. Citi gained 2.6 per cent to $1.20.Bank of America rose 2.3 per cent to $16.71 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the bank had plans to select an emergency chief executive this week if legal issues force Ken Lewis to leave before the end of the year.American Express gained 2.2 per cent to $33.19 after Alfred Kelly, the credit card issuer’s president, said he would leave the company next year to seek an opportunity as a chief executive elsewhere.Renewed optimism in the sector helped lift the mood on Wall Street after discouraging economic data and falling commodity prices caused the S&P 500 to lose 1.4 per cent last week and 2.2 per cent during the previous week.By midday, the S&P 500 was up 1 per cent to 1,035.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 9,559.09 and the Nasdaq rose 0.8 per cent to 2,064.15.The Institute for Supply Management’s September reading of the services sector was also better than expected, helping stocks extend their early gains.Economists had been expecting a reading of 50, indicating growth after 11 months of contraction, but the ISM recorded a level of 50.9. Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage, said the market was now focused on the third-quarter earnings season, which begins this week.“We’re waiting for the big news in the form of earnings and revenue expectations for the quarters to come,” he said. “That’s going to be what drives the market.“Companies need to show positive expectations for higher revenue because cost-cutting measures can only take you so far,” Mr Colvin said.Industrial stocks rebounded on Monday after last week’s losses.General Dynamics rose 2 per cent to $64.36 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “equal-weight”, saying it expected a recovery in the company’s Gulfstream jet unit from 2011.Caterpillar announced plans to raise prices on most of its machinery by up to 2 per cent next year. Its shares gained 2.7 per cent to $50.15.The pharmaceutical sector was also in focus. Seattle Genetics fell 16.9 per cent to $10.94 after the biotechnology company halted trials of its experimental drug, which had been designed to treat patients with lymphoma.Amicus Therapeutics said it would not pursue final stage trials of a drug for Gaucher disease after a study showed the treatment was ineffective. JPMorgan then downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “overweight”, increasing pressure on the shares, which plunged 32.3 per cent to $5.78.Meanwhile, Depomed climbed 24.7 per cent to $5.50 after announcing late on Friday of positive results from trials of its neuropathic pain drug.While technology stocks lagged behind most sectors, Brocade Communications Systems, which provides networking solutions, climbed 16.9 per cent to $8.94 after reports that the company had put itself up for sale.Oracle advanced 0.4 per cent to $20.43 and Hewlett-Packard was up 1 per cent to $45.72 after speculation that they could be potential buyers.

Disappointing new home sales soon renewed investors’ concerns and Wall Street gave up its fleeting gains.“Typically, consumer sentiment would be a really good gauge on how likely they are to spend,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “But this is why the unemployment figures next week will be so important. People can be as optimistic as they like and they may feel like things are getting better but that’s not going to bring about a great deal of spending right away.”The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent lower at 1,044.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 9,665.19 and the Nasdaq fell 0.8 per cent to 2,090.92. Since last week, the S&P lost 2.3 per cent, the Dow was down 1.6 per cent and the Nasdaq fell 2 per cent.After a shaky start to the week, Wall Street hit 11-month highs on Tuesday due to the weak dollar and rising commodity prices. As the US currency strengthened and oil sank below $70, commodity stocks pulled the market lower on Wednesday and Thursday. Poor data from the National Association of Realtors on existing home sales also hit sentiment and the Federal Reserve’s policy statement left the market nervous.This week has been the most active week for equity listings since December 2007 and analysts at JPMorgan said heavy issuance may have been weighing on equities.Textron, the industrial conglomerate, added to the woes of the sector on Friday. The shares fell 2.5 per cent to $17.88 after Cowen cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “outperform”. General Electric fell 1.3 per cent to $16.37.Caterpillar, after closing 2 per cent lower on Wednesday and Thursday due to falling commodity prices,fell 1.3 per cent to $51.20. The shares had been lifted in early trading after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral”. Homebuilders were firmly in negative territory even before the release of the home sales data.KB Home, the Los Angeles homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, posted a narrower loss for its third quarter after cutting costs and focusing on selling smaller houses. Its chief executive said he did not expect to see any “meaningful improvement” in the US housing market in the near future. KB’s shares fell 8.5 per cent to $16.96.The pessimism spread to KB’s rivals and Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, fell 1.2 per cent to $19.96 and Beazer Homes fell 5 per cent to $5.49.Research In Motion, which makes BlackBerry phones, added to the losses on the Nasdaq. The group posted quarterly results just above analysts’ estimates late on Thursday but gave a disappointing outlook. Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy,” saying it had doubts about the company’s ability to maintain market share in North America. The shares fell 17 per cent to $68.19.Allos Therapeutics erased early gains and was down 3.5 per cent at $7.87. The shares had spiked after it secured approval for a drug designed to treat lymphoma. Consumer groups performed well early on as investors looked for less risky stocks. Sara Lee lifted confidence after Unilever said it had agreed to pay $1.87bn for its personal care brands. The shares gained 6.4 per cent to $11.21.
363;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-09-04T21:55:04Z;African power shortfall a boost for Aggreko;;"When the east African rains failed this summer, Kenya’s government knew it was staring at more than just a food crisis.Electricity demand from its fast-developing economy has nearly doubled since 2000. More than half of production comes from hydro power, which is dependent on the annual rains to replenish reservoirs.Faced with a 160-megawatt shortfall in generating capacity, the government started a programme of power cuts last month, to complaints from local businesses. But for Aggreko, a Dumbarton-based renter of diesel generators, the crisis represented an opportunity.Rupert Soames, chief executive, said: “They asked us how quickly we were able to respond, and we said we could get them 40MW within five weeks.”Within a fortnight of the planned blackouts starting, the company had signed a deal with Kenya’s state-owned power company to provide a further 100MW within the next five weeks.Once all the equipment is installed, Aggreko will be producing about a third of the Kenya’s electricity. In neighbouring Uganda, the figure is close to half.The energy crisis in the developing world is transforming Aggreko from an equipment rental business into something resembling an energy company.“From my perspective it looks as much like an electricity utility in a developing market as anything else,” says Andrew Darke, a support services analyst at Ambrian.As recently as 2006, Aggreko’s international power division accounted for only 29 per cent of group profits; this year that figure is expected to be more than 50 per cent.The centre of this operation is a pair of sheds on the north bank of the Clyde in Dumbarton, just downstream from Glasgow.Aggreko’s core products are diesel generators housed inside 20ft shipping containers. On its own, a single generator costs £120,000-£140,000 to build and can generate 1MW of power. Chain dozens together, and you have a medium-sized power station that can be built as quickly as the containers can be shipped to the site.The bulk of Aggreko’s fleet – capable of generating 6,000MW, equivalent to 9 per cent of the UK’s generating capacity – has been assembled from mostly off-the-shelf parts in Dumbarton, before being shipped out to depots round the world.The standardised nature of the product, and the global nature of the business, means that excess capacity can quickly be moved to where it is most needed.“The equipment today servicing the Harry Potter film set in London could tomorrow be on a construction site in the Middle East,” says Mr Soames.Half of the 140MW being sent out to Kenya at the moment has been taken out of the more sluggish local business, which provides emergency backup for utilities and off-grid power to building sites and events such as the Glastonbury festival and Beijing Olympics, Mr Soames says.The company is staking a lot on the growth of the international power business. Unlike the local business, where Aggreko faces a host of competitors including the network of dealers affiliated with $50bn-revenue (£30bn) Caterpillar, the international power market is all but untapped.Management have invested accordingly. Capital expenditure has risen from £55m in 2003 to £256m last year, when Aggreko added an extra 800MW of capacity to its fleet. The entire fleet size of its nearest international power competitor is estimated at only 150MW.That said, the business is not without risks. International power’s order book has decreased from 22,000MW last year to 18,000MW at the end of June – to about 10 months’ worth of revenue, as contracts have ended and new clients have switched to shorter-term deals.Further off, any developing countries that can turn round their ongoing energy supply deficits will also have less need for Aggreko’s expensive emergency power. In Uganda the much-delayed Bujagali Dam, designed to provide 200MW of power, is expected to come onstream in 2011.However, Mr Soames is as bullish about the prospects for the business as he is bearish about the ability of governments to deal with the supply crunch. He points to recent government estimates indicating that even Britain could be facing an energy shortage by 2017.Underinvestment is not confined to developing countries, he argues: replacing the UK’s ageing power plants, at a time when renewable energy and nuclear power are still trying to get off the ground, could open up opportunities closer to home.“We are facing a real problem in this country. There are not many constituencies in Britain that want to think about this,” he says."
364;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-09-01T20:37:59Z;Wall Street sell-off led by financials;;US stocks tumbled on Tuesday sending the S&P 500 back below 1,000 as worries over the banking sector outweighed the first expansion for manufacturing in 18 months.All the main 10 S&P industry groups closed lower in New York, led by a broad sell-off in the financial sector, which was down 5.3 per cent - its biggest fall since late June.Regional banks fell harder with the KBW index closing nearly 6 per cent lower.Among leading banks, Wells Fargo fell 4.8 per cent to $26.21, Citigroup slid 9.2 per cent to $4.54, while JP Morgan was down 4.1 per cent at $41.67.After the closing bell, Wells reiterated in a statement that it would not raise money in order to pay back $25bn bailout funds.After a brief rally, Bank of America followed its peers lower. It emerged on Tuesday that the bank was planning to repay part of the $45bn aid package it received from the US government at the height of the financial crisis. But the shares closed down 6.4 per cent at $16.46.The S&P 500 closed 2.2 per cent lower at 998.04 and selling accelerated during late trade. Equity volatility was sharply higher with the CBOE’s Vix, known as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’ rising towards a reading of 30 - its highest level since mid-July.The sell-off in equities followed a brief period of investor optimism in the morning following the release of the index from the Institute for Supply Management. The gauge of US manufacturing activity rose to 52.9 in August, up from 48.9 in July. It marked the first expansion since January 2008, and the headline index was at its highest level since June 2007.But the mood on Wall Street quickly changed and after the early rally investors turned bearish. The Nasdaq also lost 2 per cent, falling to 1968.89, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2 per cent at 9,310.60.Of the 30 Dow stocks only Wal-Mart rose on Tuesday up 0.2 per cent to $50.97. Financials were among the worst blue-chip performers with General Electric closing down 4 per cent at $13.34.Investors have been preparing for a possible pullback this month following strong rallies over the summer.“We have a lot of opposing forces in September,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. While September was often a bad month, the economic story seemed to improving, he said. “Everything is building the case for the third quarter being a strong inventory rebuild,” he said.The gloom across Wall Street even roiled defensive sectors, with the S&P consumer staples and utility groups down 1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively.Whole Foods was down 3.1 per cent at $28.18. Similarly, Estee Lauder, the cosmetics group, fell 3.2 per cent to $34.70.After an initial peak following the positive manufacturing data, the industrials and materials sectors were also broadly down.Boeing fell 1.8 per cent to $48.77 while Caterpillar, the maker of mining and forestry machinery, lost 3.2 per cent, falling to $43.84.Steel manufacturers also saw some big declines with United States Steel falling by 4.2 per cent to $41.95. AngloGold Ashanti, the global gold producer, fell 5.5 per cent at $36.31 after the company announced that it had plans to offer 7.8m new shares.In other news, Ebay, the online marketplace, was down 2.1 per cent at $21.68. That reversed a brief rally in the morning when it announced that it was selling a 65 per cent stake in its Skype internet phone service to private investors in a $2bn deal.Elsewhere in the sector, Yahoo was also down 2.9 per cent at $14.18 after it emerged that Carl Icahn, one of its biggest shareholders, had sold 12.7m shares in the company.In spite of vehicle sales rising 17 per cent on an unadjusted basis in August, shares in Ford Motor fell 4.7 per cent to $7.24 since the results missed forecasts. Investors also remained concerned about future growth following the termination of the government’s “cash for clunkers” programme.Moody’s said previously that up to 60 per cent of vehicle sales under scheme represented “stimulated demand”.
365;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-08-31T21:11:45Z;Wall Street falls amid deals;;US stocks fell on Monday amid a flurry of deal-making as investors focused on a further steep decline in Chinese stocks.Walt Disney agreed to buy Marvel Entertainment, the group that created characters such as Spider-Man, for $4bn in cash and stock, sending the shares in the smaller company up 25.1 per cent to $48.33.DreamWorks, a rival of Marvel and maker of the Shrek films, was also up 6.5 per cent to $33.76 on speculation that it might become a takeover target.In one of the sector’s biggest takeovers for the past decade, Baker Hughes, the oilfield services provider, also revealed that it was buying rival BJ Services in a $5.5bn cash-and-stock deal.Shares in BJ Services were up 4.2 per cent at $16.08, while Baker Hughes was down 9.6 per cent to $34.42.But declines on the Chinese stock market set the tone for trading in spite of better-than-expected manufacturing data closer to home from the Chicago index.After the bell in New York, the S&P 500 was down 12.21 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,016.72. The Nasdaq Composite index closed down 27.46 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 2,001.31, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 90.09 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 9,454.11.Last week, the S&P 500 rose to a high for the year and ended August with a gain of 3.4 per cent. In spite of Monday’s fall, the S&P has recorded a sixth straight month of gains, its best run since June 2006 to January 2007.Oil companies were some of the market’s worst casualties as investors took note of China’s declines and fears about overvalued commodities. ExxonMobil closed down 1.1 per cent to $69.33, while Chevron fell 0.9 per cent to $70.03.Manufacturing and engineering stocks also fell. Caterpillar, which makes mining and forestry machinery, fell 3.0 per cent to $45.29. Boeing was also down 2.6 per cent at $49.70.Cooper Industries, the wrench maker, suffered further from news that it would be replaced by Airgas, the maker of industrial gases, on the S&P 500. Houston-based Cooper has decided to move its headquarters to Ireland, thereby making the company ineligible for the index.Shares in Cooper were 4.0 per cent lower at $32.28, while Airgas closed 1.1 per cent higher at $46.52.Financial stocks – the best-performing sector this month – also fell as August drew to a close.Shares in Citigroup closed down 4.2 per cent to $5.01 and AIG shares were down 10.3 per cent to $45.06 after sharp rises throughout August.Shares in Bank of America fell 2.1 per cent to $17.61 while Fannie was down 5.9 per cent to $1.92.After big rises during the month, Freddie Mac gave back 7.9 per cent to $2.21.Shares in KKR Financial Holdings, the private equity group, were up 18.5 per cent to $3.85 after it was upgraded by JMP Securities, which cited improved liquidity and trends in the credit market.As equity prices often fall in September, the focus is on whether the rally can be sustained. Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citi, said: “There is a tendency for investors to chase stocks higher near year-end and thus, a notable pullback in the September-October timeframe sets things up for a late-year rally.”In the pharmaceutical sector, AstraZeneca closed up 0.7 per cent at $46.61. A study by a British medical journal reported that a blood-thinning pill developed by the company worked better than Plavix, a rival drug made by Sanofi-Aventis.Sanofi was down 1.2 per cent at $34.11 as a result. A decision by the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday to grant Delcath Systems seven years of exclusive marketing for its liver cancer treatment sent the company’s shares up 18.4 per cent to $3.60.Faced with the global declines in stocks, investors looked to healthcare companies in the hope of finding a financial haven.Procter & Gamble, the company behind brands such as Gillette and Pantene, closed up 1.8 per cent at $54.12.Ecolab, which provides cleaning and sanitising products, also ended the day up 0.6 per cent at $42.32.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

In an arrangement mostly agreed between companies and banks, the latter do not usually require much of the margin against the positions to be paid in cash or liquid securities.The ACT comment paper, submitted on Thursday to the EC, says the proposed rules could introduce new risks to companies.“In attempting to remove the credit risk between a company and a bank which is not systemically significant, a serious liquidity risk for the firm would be introduced instead.”

369;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-08-26T20:23:16Z;Wall Street shrugs off mixed data;;"US stocks closed a whisker higher after a choppy day of trade on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed set of economic data.A disappointing reading on durable goods orders for July weighed on industrial stocks, which were the day’s weakest sector.Although the headline figure was encouraging, analysts focused on the number that excluded transportation, discounting the temporary effect of the government’s cash-for-clunkers programme.That data was worse than expected, which triggered widespread selling in the industrial sector.Caterpillar, the machinery maker, dropped 1.2 per cent to $47.25, while
Honeywell, the manufacturing conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $37.12.General Electric was also caught up in the selling, in spite a new $2.7bn contract to build a power plant in Kuwait and reports of a possible $2bn sale of its security unit. The shares fell 1.3 per cent to $14.11.The early falls were mitigated by a sharp rise in monthly sales of new homes , which boosted the homebuilding sector.Lennar gained 4.1 per cent to $15.58 and DR Horton climbed 5.7 per cent to $13.79.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all closed a fraction higher at 1,028.12, 9,543.52 and 2,024.43, respectively.That constituted the seventh successive positive session for the Dow.“Until it becomes clear that there is a sustainable economic trend you are going to see this kind of mixed data,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential.“More worrying is the fact that the markets have sold off towards the close recently.”Metals producers came off their recent highs as commodity prices dipped. Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $63.13, while Nucor, which makes steel, fell 2.4 per cent to $45.28.“Commodity shares could find a headwind with Chinese stocks soft and crude oil finding resistance at $75,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Financial stocks were also lower in spite of the housing data as well as figures showing that mortgage applications rose last week, defying a rise in mortgage rates.Signs of stabilisation in the housing market have lifted banks to the forefront of the recent rally, but they slipped on Wednesday as investors took an opportunity to take profits off the table.Citigroup declined 2.5 per cent to $4.63 and JPMorgan lost 0.6 per cent to $43.30.Morgan Stanley drifted 2.2 per cent to $29.53, even as rumours intensified
surrounding the sale of its Van Kampen investment unit, with Bloomberg reporting that the bank has approached at least three other asset managers with offers of a possible partnership or sale.Retailers were higher during the day, building on the gains made during Tuesday on the back of an unexpectedly sharp rise in consumer confidence.Budget retailers were especially strong, carried by the momentum from the previous session, when Big Lots reported better earnings than expected.The company was one of Tuesday’s strongest performers and rose again on Wednesday morning, picking up 3 per cent to $26.37.Rival Family Dollar climbed 3.5 per cent to $30.82.Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, jumped after it reported a surprise profit and said that tight inventory control would see it earn more over the year than previously forecast.The sharp cost cuts mitigated slumping sales at the company, which also owns the Pottery Barn furnishings chain, and the shares rose 11.3 per cent to $17.21.Health insurers suffered however, as analysts predicted that the death of Senator Edward Kennedy could provide further impetus to government plans to reform healthcare.They said the Democrats may want to honour the memory of one of the strongest advocates for such reform.With the current plan proposing cuts in government subsidies to large health insurers, Humana lost 2.7 per cent to $36.15, while UnitedHealth fell 3.3 per cent to $28.93."

JAC said details of the joint venture would be released soon.The talks come just months after Caterpillar announced it would expand its global joint venture with Navistar to produce commercial vehicles outside North America.Caterpillar also said it would withdraw from being an engine supplier for US truck makers due to declining sales on the US market. July engine sales tumbled 33 per cent year-on-year.The venture will also provide JAC, a mid-size automaker in China, with capital, expertise and more international exposure.Industry experts believe the company would benefit from the joint venture as it has not been performing well, reporting a 32 per cent fall in net profit in the first half of the year, in spite of a slight increase in sales.The heavy truck sector in China, which is the focus of the joint venture, was measured at roughly 500,000 units in 2008 and is expected to grow further as China invests more in infrastructure projects.Although the market is predominantly controlled by domestic players such as Sinotruck, Dongfeng Motor and FAW Group, foreign groups have made increasing inroads to the market in recent years.Daimler, the world’s largest truck maker, forged a deal with Beiqi Foton in a similar joint venture last year and MAN, another German truck maker, bought a 25 per cent stake of Sinotruck for €560m ($780.6m) just last month.

That is better than the forecast drop of 35.2 per cent prior to the start of earnings season.“Much of the improvement in profitability appears to be the result of expense-cutting via workforce reductions and inventory management, as opposed to top-line revenue growth,” said USAA Investment Management Company. “We believe that the recovery is likely to take longer than prior postwar recessions and exhibit lower growth than the US has enjoyed in recent decades.”The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent higher at 1,002.62, it’s highest level since November.The S&P has rallied almost 50 per cent from its closing low of 676.53 in early March and, for the year to date, is now up 11 per cent.Among the significant 10 sectors of the index, materials was higher by 3.5 per cent, followed by a 2.7 per cent gain in financial stocks, while energy rose 2.3 per cent as oil prices closed above $71 a barrel, their highest price since late June. Lagging sectors included telecoms providers and consumer staples.Equity volatility dipped, with the CBOE’s Vix index easing 1.3 per cent to 25.58.A rally in commodity prices boosted shares of Freeport-McMoRan with the copper miner 8 per cent higher at $65.14.Further evidence that manufacturing activity is improving, from the Institute for Supply Management, boosted US Steel, with its shares rising 8.3 per cent to $43.03.“The July ISM data is very much in keeping with a recovery picking up some momentum, even if the overall index has yet to make its way out of the contraction zone,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Securities.“The auto sector could provide a major boost to this index going forward as auto assembly has picked up and the clunkers programme will add significantly, albeit temporarily, to demand.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5 per cent to 2,008.61, its first close above 2,000 since last October. Shares in Apple gained 1.9 per cent to $166.53 while Google was up 2.1 per cent at $452.21.Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, resigned from Apple’s board amid increased competition in operating systems and software between the two technology companies.“The decision was mutual and understandable in our view, especially given that Schmidt has, for some time, been unable to fully participate in Apple’s board meetings because of this building issue,” said Scott Kessler, technology analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,286.56.Strength in blue chips was led by 3M, up 2.3 per cent at $72.14, IBM, up 1.7 per cent at $119.92, Travelers, higher by 4.5 per cent at $45.02, and Caterpillar, which rallied 2.4 per cent to $45.12. Alcoa was higher by 7.2 per cent at $12.60.Banking shares also rallied, with a key banking index up 2.6 per cent in the wake of Barclays and HSBC reporting stronger-than-expected earnings.Shares in Bank Of America were 3.6 per cent higher at $15.32 while JPMorgan rose 2.5 per cent to $39.60 and Morgan Stanley gained 2.8 per cent to finish the day at $29.31.The success of the cash-for-clunkers programme of replacing old cars, had powered shares in Ford higher. The carmaker reported that car sales rose 2.3 per cent in July. It was Ford’s first monthly rise since November 2007. The stock gained 4.1 per cent to close at $8.33, and its earlier peak of $8.86, was the stock’s highest intra-day price since November 2007.
372;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Interview: Jim Owens of Caterpillar;;"Speaker key:HW: Hal WeitzmanJO: Jim OwensPart 1: On the US economyHW: Mr Owens, thank you for joining us.JO: My pleasure, Hal.HW: Let’s start by talking about the US economy. Two years ago Caterpillar became one of the first big American companies to warn that the US was entering a serious economic downturn. Now, this year you’ve been more optimistic, but in the first three months of the year you actually recorded your first quarterly loss for 17 years, and last week you warned that you might make a loss in this current quarter. So are we seeing green shoots or are they withering?JO: Well, let me be careful here. I’m not that caught up on the quarterly numbers at all. I think we warned about a slowing of the economy because the US economy peaked in 2006 and, as you recall, housing starts were about 2.2 million starts back then. It came off pretty sharply. We could see this bubble building and we felt the economy was going to come off so by late 2007- 2008. The housing market, for example, in the US was cascading down, which had a big impact on a lot of our product lines in the United States. We recorded all time record sales results, revenue and sales results in 2008, but we did that despite the fact that the US, Japan and Western Europe were in outright recession for the latter half of the year and, of course, the US was in it even earlier than that. And particular sectors that we serve, like housing, were down and very severely depressed. In fact, 2008 was the worst year we’ve had since World War II. So we were well into it. And the first quarter of this year, we came into this year – keep in mind the post Lehman Brother’s collapse, so the September 15th to November 15th period of time – the global economy literally flipped upside down and got a lot worse, particularly the global credit markets.So we went from, well, let’s call it normal cyclical recessionary conditions in the US, Europe and Japan and good growth in the emerging markets, to a world that was upside down, in 90 days. And most people forget, how quickly we forget, a couple of factors. One, is that the best three years of growth since World War II were the 04 to 06 period. In that period we were scrambling and booming to add capacity worldwide. In this post Lehman period, the 90 day period, essentially every stock market in the world dropped between 35% and about 80%. Every major commodity from oil and gas to iron ore to copper, the big market segments we serve, dropped between about 35% and 60% in 90 days. And currencies, of course, moved dramatically in this period also. Credit markets became dysfunctional, literally a seizure in those. So only the very best companies were able to borrow at all. And we went from three year order backlogs for many of our product lines to mass order cancellations, which we allowed recognising the economic game had changed; and changed overnight almost.In the first quarter, I guess, we lost money for the first time but we made money on an operating basis, the redundancies that we took. We did some right things for our people in that we offered early retirement programmes that cost us more than just firing people. We offered to maintain health insurance, for example, for our American employees where that’s a big issue, for one year into a layoff - it went that long. And we offered to do some supplemental compensation. We wanted our managers to rightsize the organisation to compete with radically lower volumes, and do it quickly. So all those costs we took in the first quarter.In the second quarter the markets were pleasantly surprised because it was really a post management story. We were able to take out cost associated with about 34,000 people that showed up for work every day within a four month period. So we had, kind of, strategically positioned ourselves to be flexible, we exercised that flexibility and we see a significantly lower, going forward cost run rate by the second quarter, in place. So I think we demonstrated the elephant here could dance pretty well when forced to. A lot of unpleasant things we certainly …it’s a lot more fun to grow and to hire people, but quite frankly, to be successful in the capital intensive goods business you need the flexibility that we’ve tried to build into our systems.HW: But are you optimistic now? Do you think we’ve now reached the bottom in terms of demand for the heavy equipment that Caterpillar makes?JO: The green shoots, and I think they are still green shoots at this time, there’s a couple of things. First of, global credit markets and particularly for companies that are good credit risk, such as ourselves, the credit markets have stabilised, largely normalised, we are able to go to market for medium terms notes in Europe and Canada. The US market is functioning well, commercial paper markets are functioning well. Our CapFinance company is now solidly profitable again, we can look at growing that portfolio. We’re confident about its ability to do good underwriting and manage lending to our customers, which will help them. Four or five months ago that business model was completely upside down because the banks that were guaranteed at very low interest rates and everyone else, regardless of quality, paid a huge premium. Those spreads have now narrowed, and in fact, in the last few months we’ve been able to borrow at rates lower than we were borrowing a year ago. So we’re encouraged on that front.Secondly, our sales to users, retail sales if you will, which were in freefall from October of last year through to the first quarter, kind of bottomed out in that April/May timeframe, and we looked at sequential months we’re seeing stabilisation and maybe even a slight improvement in that.Part 2: On the global economy and protectionismHW: You spoke about raising money around the world and Caterpillar is a very global company, almost two thirds of your revenues come from markets outside North America. Where do you see the best recovery happening? What geographic area of the world?JO: We were into a discussion about the emerging markets of the world being our growth opportunity in 2008 – in fact they were carrying the day. There’s not been a complete decoupling of the world certainly, and when the OECD world, all of it, is in severe recession and credit markets sees the emerging markets are also negatively impacted. But we still think that’s a fundamental court case for the macro economy for the next decade. That the emerging markets of the world, particularly emerging Asia – it’s China, India, South East Asia, the ASEAN group, it’s parts of the Middle East, the southern part of Africa, it’s Latin America almost in total and eventually CIS and Eastern Europe, which have been the most adversely impacted by this crisis.But we see the growth rates in that large group of countries with vast populations, growing at two to three times the OECD world growth rate in the decade ahead. And we think they’re at the economic development stage where that’s going to drive demand for a fair bit of commodities, both energy and basic minerals, just because of the stage of economic development, the emerging middle class that’s present in those countries and we think that plays to our product line strengths.HW: You’re an outspoken advocate of open markets and free trade.JO: Absolutely.HW: Are you concerned about the drops in global trade that we’ve seen and possibly the rise or the return of protectionism?JO: I’m very concerned about that. I think that the greatest risk we have today in the world economy would be a reversion to nationalism, protectionism, call it what you will, that impedes the flow of goods and services around the world. I think the world benefited hugely by cross-border investments and rapid growth in exports and imports, standards of living in countries that were open improved much faster. The big change that facilitated the very impressive growth that we registered in the 04 to 06 period was the opening of markets, be it China or Russia and Eastern Europe, and bringing them into the global family of trading nations. I think specifically about the United States where it’s really encouraged us – we’ve kind of led trade liberalisation since World War II. Some in our country would argue that we could be a great country by building a big enough wall down the southern border and I think it’s nonsense.HW: On that note, you criticise the buy America provision that was included in the US stimulus bill. Has that been as damaging as you had feared?JO: I think it’s been damaging on a psychological front. It’s relatively small in terms of its real impact on the imports or exports, but the fact that we as a country put a buy America provision in our stimulus bill, says we don’t have confidence in American companies’ ability to compete for and win that business in open competition. I feel our construction equipment customers should, quite frankly, have the choice between JCB and Komatsu and Volvo and Caterpillar. And I’d like to think that we can provide products and services that will allow us to win that business. In the same context, I want to be able to compete for business in Europe and Japan and China and Brazil and other countries. I think by us, the United States, putting a buy America provision in our stimulus package; we encourage other countries to do the same – tit for tat here.HW: You are a member of President Barack Obama’s economic recovery advisory board. Do you feel that the administration has listened to industry and the concerns of industry and lent its support during this downturn?JO: I think it’s early days. President Obama came to office when the economy was pretty much in freefall, particularly following Lehman’s collapse. So his first order of business was, A), just restoring confidence that we have a sound government, that we’re going to aggressively address the issues in the early days, stabilising the banking system, which I think they’ve done a pretty good job of addressing and getting it stabilised. And now, maybe moving back from having to do that with better, more thoughtful regulation but without direct government intervention is going to be an important step. Getting a stimulus bill passed, it wasn’t a perfect stimulus bill even by the President’s measure and certainly not by industry’s measure, but it was a stimulus bill that helped us rebuild and restore confidence that we weren’t going to go over the falls into a deep global depression. I think most people in the business community, financial community, would say that we are now confident, we’re not going to go into a depression. It may be a prolonged period of slow growth and the question now before the House is going to be to get the macro-economic policies in place that will get real economic growth in the world going back at a level which begins to employ a lot of people again.Part 3: On the US stimulus and American manufacturingHW: But it’s interesting that you bring up jobs because President Obama came here to Peoria, to Caterpillar’s home town last year to promote the stimulus. And he said at the time that if this is passed companies like Caterpillar will be able to hire back some of the workers that they’ve let go in recent months. Now more recently we’ve heard the criticism that this stimulus has not lived up to its billing as a job creation package. What are your views?JO: I think first off there’s always leads and lags here. It takes time for the stimulus money to get into the economy and to create jobs and that was one of my cautions coming in – we had a little miscommunication on the timing …HW: What was the miscommunication?JO: Over how soon a stimulus bill would positively effect employment in the economy in general. I think, first off, unemployment is a lagging indicator, so it stays higher for a little longer and then when it starts going down there will be probably several quarters of positive GDP growth before we see employment beginning to pick up again. In the case of our own plants, yes, an effective stimulus bill which generates real growth in the United States eventually creates jobs at Caterpillar. But passing the stimulus bill doesn’t translate into jobs overnight and if there was any lack of clarity it was around… this was a sell the stimulus bill speech and the realities of how long it takes it to work through and create jobs in a Caterpillar plant …HW: So President Obama did not consult you before he said that there might be jobs created by Caterpillar?JO: He consulted me on the idea of the stimulus bill and we certainly agreed that the country needed, I think at that time, a substitute stimulus bill. The press has tried to drive up a big wedge here between our views on the need for a stimulus bill; I was absolutely in agreement we needed a stimulus bill. Now, the stimulus bill that we passed in the United States, I think, was a little more geared to a lot of social programmes and some necessary support for people in transition and it was a little light on hard infrastructure investment. And the amount of spin there, over a two year period, is less than at 6% or 8% of say our construction spending in the country. And you have residential construction and non-residential construction and even state and federal budgets going down, so they more than offset the amount of money in the stimulus.HW: Was that the difference between the US stimulus and the Chinese stimulus package.JO: The Chinese went very heavily for hard infrastructure, for roads, bridges, railroads, airports, ports – so they’re building real capacity to facilitate economic growth in the future. And one of the things, I think, we need in this country is we’ve got a lot of infrastructure that’s in a state of ill repair, so a lot of repair and fixing of roads and bridges – in some cases expanded capacity, additional air transit capacity and rail quarter capacity. These are investments that I think are meritorious, because, first off, they create a lot of jobs, there’s a big multiplier associated with this, it’s not just the construction work, but it’s the rock and quarry work that has to go behind it. The steel, the cement and other materials, the construction equipment, the maintenance of all that that drives a lot of jobs. So the multiplier is, for instance for direct construction jobs, there is a three or four multiplier on it. Whereas a lot of the programmes in the initial stimulus bill don’t have much of a multiplier.HW: Presumably, with infrastructure spending in mind, you’ve floated the idea that the US might need a second stimulus package. Is that still your view and if so is there the political will in Washington to spend more money?JO: I think there’s going to be a need to have, probably, an additional stimulus. I think it could be focused in, for example the Highway Bill that’s coming up in the fall, and just accelerating some of that investment because in the construction related labour markets the unemployment rates are up in the 18% and 19% range. So there’s a lot of idle capacity, if you will, to build at this point in time and a lot of job creation that could come in that space. So I think, if we make good investments, and that’s a key word here, good investments in infrastructure and accelerate some of those, it would be a very wise use of government funds.HW: How do you think US manufacturing, generally, has fared in the downturn?JO: I think it’s been hit pretty severely and certainly, again, the magnitude of the drop and the speed has been pretty severe and the fact that is was global in nature. So we didn’t have exports to offset the domestic decline. We’ve got a lot of resilience in many respects and clearly we have problems in the auto sector but that’s a problem of global excess capacity and a cost structure problem for the Detroit-based auto companies that they needed to address anyway.HW: Do you think US manufactures should be concerned about low cost competition from abroad?JO: Absolutely. I think we should be concerned about it, I think we should be gearing ourselves to compete with it. I think, in many cases, that will lead to us needing to invest in other markets around the world to establish manufacturing presence. I still think it’s important for the United States to have a very strong manufacturing base within the country and that we need to focus on areas that we can be globally competitive and that we can both manufacture for the domestic market and export, that’s a nice balance. And one, I think quite frankly, as a country, we’ve given insufficient attention to it historically. We’ve tended to think in Washington about domestic economic policy and, in fact, we have to think about or economic policy in the global context, going forward, and how American based multi national companies and American manufacturers who export from here, can compete in the world market.HW: Mr Owens, thank you very much for joining us today.JO: It’s been my pleasure.LONG/SHORTHW: Okay, Mr Owens, now we’re going to play long short. Ready?JO: Ready.HW: US dollar?JO: Short.HW: US manufacturing?JO: Short.HW: North American construction?JO: Short.HW: The Midwest economy?JO: Short.HW: The US Stimulus?JO: Short.HW: The chance of a second Stimulus?JO: Long.HW: Oil prices?JO: Long. Long meaning I expect that they will go up steadily over the next decade or two.HW: The global economy to recover by next year?JO: Long.HW: Protectionism?JO: Short – I’m concerned.HW: Barack Obama?JO: Personally, long.HW: Mr Owens, thank you again."
373;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-07-30T20:48:52Z;S&P 500 flirts with 1,000 level;;US equity benchmarks closed at new highs for the year on Thursday, with investors optimistic that aggressive cost cutting by companies places them in a very profitable position once the economy recovers.In late trade, the S&P 500 had pulled back from testing the 1,000 level, for the first time since last November as traders awaited Friday’s report on gross domestic product for the second quarter.The Nasdaq Composite briefly breached 2,000 for the first time since last October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly rose 9,200, having been below 9,000 just a week ago.A number of earnings results, although mixed, sustained the rally as many companies continue to beat lowered estimates.“With about half of the S&P 500 having already reported, the number of upside surprises is running at a rate not seen since 1994,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “Companies have exceeded bottom-up expectations by about 14.8 per cent with all major sectors beating analyst’s projections.”Concerns that companies are only beating heavily reduced estimates is being downplayed by some analysts, who are focusing on the potential benefits of tough cost cutting.“Aggressive cost cutting in this recession is positioning US companies in an extremely competitive way and a stronger economy later this year will boost revenues and directly into bottom line profits,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan’s Private Bank.The S&P closed 1.2 per cent higher at 986.75, an eight-month peak. All of the 10 main S&P industry sectors rose, led by a 3 per cent gain for materials and a 2.7 per cent rally in financials.After propelling the Nasdaq above 2,000 for the first time since last October, technology stocks pared gains towards the close. The Nasdaq closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,984.30, taking its gain this year to nearly 26 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to close at 9,154.46.After the closing bell Walt Disney reported a 26 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings and in after-hours trade the stock was off 1.5 per cent at $25.5.Shares in General Electric, a Dow component, rallied 6.9 per cent higher to $13.11 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the conglomerate. Blue chips were led higher by Dupont, up 4.3 per cent at $30.81, 3M, firmer by 1.7 per cent at 69.90 and Caterpillar, higher by 3.8 per cent at $43.41.Stronger metal prices helped miners and Alcoa gained 4.1 per cent to finish at $11.46.Dragging on the Dow was Exxon Mobil, whose second-quarter earnings fell 66 per cent to $3.95bn and quarterly revenue dropped 46 per cent to $74.46bn. The stock slipped 1 per cent to $70.72, up from an earlier low of $69.91.Another Dow member reporting yesterday was Travelers, which posted a 21 per cent drop in earnings, below analysts’ forecasts. While the insurer, boosted its 2009 operating earnings outlook, the stock fell 1.6 per cent to $41.94.Elsewhere, Colgate-Palmolive saw its profits beat estimates for the second quarter amid cost cutting. The consumer staples company maintained guidance for the rest of the year. Sales fell 5.5 per cent to $3.75bn for the quarter and the stock lost 5.3 per cent to $71.83.MasterCard recorded a 26.4 per cent rise in net income for the second quarter, and net revenue rose 2.7 per cent to $1.3bn. Its shares rallied 3 per cent to $194.11 and the results came after Visa beat earnings estimates late Wednesday. Shares in Visa were 0.6 per cent higher at $67.21.Meanwhile, Dow Chemical recorded a loss of $486m for the quarter, due to charges stemming from its $16.5bn buy-out of Rohm & Haas and weak sales. Revenue fell 31 per cent to $11.32bn, down from $16.35bn for the same period a year earlier.The results were better than estimates and the stock rose 6.2 per cent to $21.53.Motorola reported a small profit, which surprised analysts, who were expecting a quarterly loss. Sales fell to $5.5bn from $8bn and its shares gained 9.4 per cent to $7.19.NYSE Euronext, swung to a loss in the second quarter as the exchange took a charge related to NYSE Life Clearing. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $27.21.For the third quarter running, Kodak reported a loss, with earnings falling $189m, while sales dropped 29 per cent to $1.77bn. Kodak declined 10.4 per cent to $2.94.Shares in Symantec dropped 14.3 per cent to $14.78, after the security software maker posted weaker than forecast fiscal first quarter earnings as sales dropped 13 per cent to $1.43bn, also below estimates.Akamai dropped 19 per cent to $16.51 after the company’s revenues missed estimates.
374;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-07-21T21:56:03Z;Coca-Cola / Caterpillar;;"The American earnings circus has rolled into town again and many stocks are up after beating analysts’ estimates. To be fair, managers are showing a keen focus on profits, but they cannot slash costs forever. For earnings growth to be sustainable – and for the global economy to recover – aggregate demand must rebound. Tuesday’s second-quarter results for Caterpillar (industrial cyclical) and Coca-Cola (consumer discretionary) offer a timely look at what is happening at opposite ends of the demand spectrum.It is not pretty. At Caterpillar, revenues are vanishing. Against last year, top-line growth fell 40 per cent. Dealers are still reducing inventories at an astonishing pace. Few on the ground expect a quick turnround. The US and Europe are particularly weak, but developing markets – on which hopes rest – are no salvation. Sales in Latin America and Asia Pacific were down by 40 per cent and one-quarter respectively.So the world is not playing with as many big yellow trucks. Is it having the odd soda? Coca-Cola’s results were solid, but here too there are few signs a pick-up in demand is imminent. Management agrees. In the past three months to July’s end, volumes are down in the US and flat in Europe. There is more life across emerging markets, where growth is about in line with trend output. The 10 per cent volume fall in Russia is a worry, hinting when things get tough beverages may be less of a staple than hoped in some developing countries.Companies should obsess about profits. But investors must keep an eye on revenues. Without them, forget about equities as an asset class, and about green shoots too.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

375;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Bernanke outlines Fed’s exit strategy;;Yields on US Treasuries fell sharply on Tuesday as Ben Bernanke outlined the Federal Reserve’s plan to extricate itself from its policy of near-zero interest rates but stressed the economy was too fragile to implement it soon.Following increasing ­pressure from investors and ­politicians, the Fed chairman set out the central bank’s “exit strategy” for its policies, which have pumped huge amounts of liquidity into the economy and prompted fears about inflation.Mr Bernanke stressed however that in spite of glimmers of improvement in the economy, the Fed intended to keep interest rates extremely low for an “extended period”.“I want to be clear that we have a very long haul here because, even if the economy begins to turn up in terms of production, unemployment is going to stay high for quite a while, so it’s not going to feel like a really strong economy,” he said in his biannual report to Congress.The Fed expects the economy to start growing again at the end of this year but thinks the unemployment rate– now at 9.5 per cent – will remain elevated through 2011.His testimony boosted Treasury prices and saw the yield on the 10-year note fall by 12 basis points to 3.46 per cent as investors were persuaded that rates would stay low for a long time. Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit, said that reaction might not last.“Long-term yields will again face upward pressures from a combination of inflation fears and recovery hopes,” he said.Mr Bernanke’s comments came as relief at the strength of US quarterly profits helped the UK’s FTSE 100 index record a seventh successive advance – its best winning run for four years.Encouraging data from Caterpillar and Merck added to the positive mood fostered last week by a string of investment banks, most notably Goldman Sachs, and chipmaker Intel.The S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to close at 954.58 after matching last month’s high for the year.Continental European shares have also risen for seven straight sessions, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index on Tuesday rising 0.8 per cent.Outlining the Fed’s exit plans, Mr Bernanke said the bank could raise the interest paid on reserve balances to help set a floor under interest rates, and use “reverse-repo” agreements in which it would sell securities from its portfolio with an agreement to buy them back later.Mr Bernanke also mounted a defence of the independence of the Fed amid calls for greater scrutiny.
376;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Overview: Upward track maintained after US earnings;;Positive US earnings news kept global equity markets on a broadly upward path on Tuesday. However, Wall Street pulled back after climbing to its 2009 highs.Investors’ appetite for risk was also reined in by cautious comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve.Further uncertainty was fostered by a warning from CIT Group, the US lender to small and medium-sized companies, that it might still succumb to bankruptcy in spite of a $3bn finance package secured over the weekend.After choppy trading for US equities, the S&P 500 eventually closed up 0.4 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent, buoyed by a sharp rise for Caterpillar shares after forecast-beating results from the industrial equipment maker.The Vix volatility index fell below the important 25 level.“The March rally for stocks remains intact and this remains a trading market with 1,000 a likely near-term target for the S&P,” said Bill Strazzullo, strategist at Bell Curve Trading.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended higher for a seventh day in succession as it rose 0.8 per cent to its highest close since January.Asian equities reached fresh 10-month highs as Tokyo returned from Monday’s holiday in a bullish mood. The Nikkei 225 Average rose 2.7 per cent to a two-month high, although other markets in the region showed signs of fatigue.Shares in Hong Kong and Australia ended flat, while the Shanghai Composite fell 1.6 per cent, its biggest one-day drop in five weeks, as subscriptions began for what is expected to be the world’s biggest initial public offering from China State Construction Engineering Corp this year.The early improvement in risk appetite helped credit derivatives improve sharply.The investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index, the continent’s main credit default swap index, tightened below the 100 basis point mark for the first time since September.But the mood in the markets was tempered by Mr Bernanke’s twice-yearly testimony to Congress – and an editorial piece in the US press – in which he said the outlook for the US economy appeared to be improving, although he warned that unemployment was likely to remain high, which could undermine consumer confidence.He said accommodative policies would probably be warranted for an “extended period” and that the Fed had the necessary tools to withdraw policy accommodation – when that becomes appropriate – “in a smooth and timely manner”.The Fed chairman’s remarks did not allay concerns among economists about a resurgence of inflation. “We don’t doubt that the Fed has the tools to reverse quantitative easing, or at least neutralise its inflationary effects,” said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics. “The problem as we see it has more to do with the timing of when to put those tools to work.”Mr Bernanke’s remarks helped government bonds move sharply higher in spite of the broadly firmer tone in equities.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell 11bp to 3.47 per cent and the two-year yield dipped 5bp to 0.91 per cent.However, Marco Annunziata at UniCredit warned: “Inflation will not be a risk for some time, but inflation fears could still complicate the Fed’s job sooner than it would like.”Elsewhere, the 10-year German Bund yield dipped 5bp to 3.35 per cent while in the UK, the 10-year gilt yield fell 6bp to 3.77 per cent.On the currency markets, the dollar managed to pull off a six-week low against the euro following Mr Bernanke’s speech, although it remained under pressure against the firmer yen.Sterling retreated as concerns about the health of the UK’s finances intensified. The pound fell 0.8 per cent against the dollar and 0.5 per cent against the euro.In commodities, copper prices rose to fresh highs for the year amid optimism about both supply and demand. Copper reached $5,470 a tonne, up 75 per cent since the start of the year, before easing back in late trade. Oil prices edged higher, but gold slipped as the dollar firmed.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
377;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-07-21T20:49:08Z;Late rally lifts US stocks;;A late rally for US stocks saw the markets build on Monday’s impressive gains on Tuesday and set new highs for the year, spurred on by signs of growth in global demand from Caterpillar.The machinery maker led the markets throughout the day after it beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings, and said it saw signs of stabilisation.The shares closed 7.7 per cent higher at $39.46 after a dip from even higher opening levels following a warning during the morning conference call that the company might make a loss in the third quarter.Rival equipment maker Deere & Co also rose, climbing 1.9 per cent to $40.54.“Caterpillar is talking about global stimulus looking as if it is beginning to have an effect on demand,” said Quincy Krosby, the market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Investors are starting to look beyond the US consumer for sources of growth.” Late buying saw equities follow Caterpillar upwards, despite earlier caution triggered by concerns over the timing of the Federal Reserve’s exit from quantitative easing and renewed worries over the future of CIT Group.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke was addressing Congress in his semi-annual testimony to lawmakers, but he did not say when the Fed would start to reverse its extraordinary measures used to stimulate the economy.This led to uncertainty and early selling pressure on Wall Street.“Investors are cautious, and I’m not sure that people want to take a position during the Bernanke testimony,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.That nervousness added to fresh concerns for CITafter the struggling commercial lender warned the $3bn finance package it secured over the weekend might not save it from bankruptcy. Its shares fell 21.6 per cent to 98 cents.The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw the sharpest rise, supported by encouraging earnings from several of its component companies.Drugmaker Merck was a strong performer after it beat expectations, helped by a lower effective tax rate and tight cost controls. The shares rose 6.1 per cent to $29.65.Shares in Schering-Plough, the smaller rival Merck has agreed to buy, gained 3.8 per cent to $26.53 after net income jumped 45 per cent on strong sales of an anti-allergy inhaler and arthritis treatment, helping it to beat expectations.DuPont, the chemical maker, also saw cost controls help negate weaker revenues but the shares slipped a fraction to $28.32.The company’s corn and soybean sales improved in its agricultural unit, and that was enough to give a jolt to shares in Monsanto, the market leader in that field, which picked up 4.6 per cent to $80.08.The Dow closed 0.8 per cent up at 8,915.94, while the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index both rose 0.4 per cent to 954.58 and 1,916.20, respectively.Both the S&P and Nasdaq were at new closing highs for the year.Not every Dow component impressed with its earnings, however. Coca-Cola lost 1.3 per cent to $50.35 even after beating estimates as investors focused on disappointing revenues.United Technologies fell sharply after the company cut its forecast for full-year earnings, with demand for its building and aircraft equipment remaining low. The shares gave up 1.8 per cent to $53.97.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, as Regions Financial reported a wider loss than expected, with mounting losses on commercial and real estate taking their toll on the bank. The shares lost 15.4 per cent to $3.42.BlackRock, the asset manager poised to buy Barclays Global Investors, also fell, dropping 0.4 per cent to $184.14 even after it saw profits beat expectations.Meanwhile, profits at UnitedHealth jumped after higher unemployment led more customers to sign up for its government-backed Medicare insurance plans. Its shares were 3 per cent higher at $25.59.Elsewhere, NRG suddenly jumped during the morning after shareholders in effect ended a $7.7bn hostile bid from rival Exelon by rejecting its nominations for NRG’s board. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $24.82.
378;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Caterpillar bullish on profits outlook;;Second-quarter profit at Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, fell by two-thirds from last year, but the results far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations and the company issued a more bullish profits outlook for the rest of the year.The results contrast with Caterpillar’s quarterly earnings release in April, when the manufacturer reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years. The improved earnings and outlook will feed hopes that the global industrial economy may be recovering. Caterpillar is widely seen as a bellwether of the US economy, but it depends on markets outside North America for about 60 per cent of its sales.The company said on Tuesday it made net profits of $371m or $0.60 per share in the quarter, down from $1.1bn or $1.74 per share during the same period last year but well ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about $0.22 per share.Caterpillar raised its profits outlook for 2009, saying it expected the mid-point of the range to be $1.70, excluding the cost of restructuring, up from the $1.25 it forecast in April but below the $2.50 it projected at the start of the year.The company has cut 26,000 jobs this year as the global economy worsened. It said redundancy costs accounted for $85m or $0.12 per share in the second quarter. For the full year, it expects redundancy costs to amount to $700m or $0.75 per share.“Team Caterpillar is now halfway through one of the most challenging years in the company’s history,” said Jim Owens, chief executive. “Our 2009 sales have been hurt by weak end-user demand and significant reductions in dealer inventory. In fact, dealers have reduced their machine inventories by about $1.5bn through the first half of the year and could reach close to $3bn by year-end.”“As tough as this year has been, the improved profit outlook is a tangible sign of what happens when the entire team is pulling in the same direction and deploying the trough strategy we put in place over the past four years.”Caterpillar shares were up nearly 11.8 per cent to $40.98 in early trading in New York on Tuesday. This followed a rise of 8 per cent on Monday after Bank of America/Merrill Lynch upgraded the company to a “buy”, saying the construction market had hit a bottom in the second quarter.

Investors were awaiting an official announcement from CIT Group, which lends to small and medium-sized businesses, but it was reported that bondholders would supply it with $3bn in emergency funding.“After a weekend where anything seemed possible for the group – including Chapter 11 – it now has some breathing space to sort out its balance sheet and develop a viable business plan,” said Manoj Ladwa at ETX Capital.Shares in CIT Group closed up 78.5 per cent at $1.25.Fears that a failure of CIT could cause a renewed bout of risk aversion led to a lacklustre performance from the main indices on Friday.The S&P 500 closed up 1.14 per cent to 951.13 on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.19 per cent to 8,848.15 and the Nasdaq Composite hit 1,909.29, up 1.2 per cent.Goldman Sachs said that it believed that the S&P 500 would enjoy its best second-half rally since 1982, and boosted its forecast for the index, predicting a 15 per cent jump from its closing level 919.32 on June 30, to 1,060 on December 31.The markets were given extra impetus during the morning after a measure of leading economic indicators improved for the third successive month. CIT’s news and strong earnings meant that cyclical stocks performed particularly well.Shares in Johnson Controls, the car-parts maker that has had to restructure following the bankruptcies of major carmakers, jumped after the company announced its first quarterly profit since last autumn. Cost cuts helped the company make up for disappointing demand and its shares climbed 7.25 per cent to $23.08.Caterpillar, another traditionally cyclical stock, advanced 7.83 per cent to $36.65 after analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said that demand for the company’s construction machinery had probably reached a bottom during the second quarter and is set to begin a recovery next year.Alcoa, the aluminium maker, which is also particularly sensitive to growth, rose 3.72 per cent to $10.60, while Halliburton, the oilfield services company edged 4.44 per cent higher to $22.33 after it announced revenue and profits ahead of estimates.In the financial sector M&T Bank rose 4.9 per cent to $57.11 after the company’s earnings beat expectations and Rene Jones, the chief financial officer said credit costs remained in line with the bank’s expectations and “continue to remain favourable” compared with the industry. But other banks fared less well – Citigroup and Bank of America both lost a chunk of last week’s impressive gains as investors digested mixed analysts reports following their earnings last week, which beat estimates only after large one-off gains. Citigroup gave up 7.62 per cent to $2.79 and Bank of America fell 5.04 per cent to $12.24.The technology sector showed strength, boosted by analyst upgrades for both Cisco and Yahoo.Cisco’s stock gained 3.12 per cent to $21.15 after Credit Suisse said that steady improvement in the North American enterprise business and tight cost controls should see it outperform other stocks.Shares of Yahoo, the internet company, were up 1.01 per cent to $17.01 after brokers at Jefferies & Co raised their price target from $19 to $20, saying that the company’s long-term prospects were good, particularly if it managed to strike a long-hoped for deal with software group Microsoft.Harman International, the hi-fi maker and long-term takeover target, endured a turbulent day after a mysterious fax was sent to newsrooms claiming that the company had received a hostile offer of almost double the company’s Friday closing price. This triggered an initial surge in the shares, but they then slumped, falling 17.6 per cent to $20.86 after the company said that it had no knowledge of any such bid.

Its shares picked up 4.2 per cent to $17.26.Other chipmakers also felt the benefit with AMD, Intel’s main rival, gaining 8.7 per cent to $3.86.Intel’s strong sales also provided optimism over personal computer sales and PC makers rose accordingly. Hewlett-Packard gained 4.5 per cent to $38.82.The rally gathered pace during the day and an upward revision in theFederal Reserve’s unemployment forecasts failed to knock it off course, as investors took confidence in a simultaneuos upgrade in the growth predictions.“The Intel numbers are enough to fuel the rally in the short term, but eventually the US unemployment rate is going to have an effect on the rest of the world,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 3 per cent up at 932.68, while the Dow rose 3.1 per cent to 8,616.21 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.5 per cent to 1,862.90.Anu Sharma, managing director of Nasdaq’s Market Intelligence Desk, described trading as a “short squeeze”, with short sellers having to buy back stocks in the worry that they might suffer heavy losses if the market rises further.There was also a warning sign on the stability of the current rally from the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility that usually drops when the market rises. It gained 3.4 per cent to 25.87 on Wednesday, suggesting investors were betting on an imminent drop.Materials stocks were also higher as the prices of metals picked up. Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper and gold, rose 5.7 per cent to $50.91. Its rival Newmont Mining gained 3.4 per cent to $40.45.Energy stocks were higher as the price of oil jumped. Chevron rose 2.5 per cent to $64.57 and Schlumberger climbed 5.3 per cent to $54.56. Investors also bought financial stocks, with banking shares continuing to bask in the afterglow of bumper profits from Goldman Sachs.But it was credit card companies that stood out after Capital One and Discover Financial both said loan losses in June had not been as bad as expected, in spite of the rising unemployment rate. Capital One jumped 11.8 per cent to $25.84 and Discover gained 6.2 per cent to $10.85.Shares in industrial companies also took part in the rally, helped by data showing industrial production had shrunk less than expected and factory output in the New York region had dropped by the smallest amount in over a year.General Electric rose 5.2 per cent to $12.24 and Caterpillar, which manufactures equipment for the industrial sector, put on 6 per cent to $33.84.The airline sector was boosted by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, which lifted the shares 4.3 per cent to $4.36.The general market optimism was tempered, however, by disappointing profits from Abbott Labs, one of the largest US drugmakers. The company also forecast full-year profits at the lower end of analysts’ expectations and the shares fell 2.6 per cent to $45.28.There were also worrying signs on consumer spending from Yum Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food franchises.It reported better earnings than expected but warned the rise in its same-store sales this year would disappoint. The stock lost 5.5 per cent to $34.05.Results from Gannett, which publishes USA Today, were more encouraging. It saw better-than-expected profit, powered by its online businesses. The shares soared 28.9 per cent to $4.50.
381;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-06-07T22:05:00Z;Caterpillar’s recovery hopes on shaky ground;;At Caterpillar’s annual shareholder meeting in Chicago last year, one questioner asked Jim Owens, chief executive, how the manufacturer got its name.Mr Owens is likely to face tougher grilling at this year’s shareholder gathering on Wednesday. Last year, Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, was navigating relatively well through the US recession – thanks to its growth in international markets and the boost that strong commodity prices gave the energy and mining sectors in emerging economies.The manufacturer, viewed as a bellwether of the US economy, depends on sales outside North America for more than half its revenue. Mr Owens boasted at the time that Caterpillar was on course to deliver record profits in spite of the US downturn.When the recession went global and commodity prices tumbled, Caterpillar proved less able to defy economic gravity. In the first three months of this year, the company reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years. It has shed 26,000 jobs around the world in recent months, slashed executive pay by up to 50 per cent and cut its profit outlook in half as it braces for what Mr Owens recently called “the most significant percentage decline in our sales since the early 1930s”.Nevertheless, at the company’s earnings call in April, Mr Owens suggested 2009 could mark the end of the global downturn, with a recovery beginning by next year. “The situation seems to be stabilising and we’re pleased to see commodity prices that have strengthened to levels that normally drive additional investment,” he said.Investors may be wondering if the plain-speaking Caterpillar chief is not too optimistic. While the manufacturer will ultimately depend on international sales in areas such as mining equipment to return to its former growth, in the near-term it is looking to the US – still its largest single market – to pull it out of the mire.Construction activity in the US shows little sign of co-operating. Robert McCarthy, an analyst at Baird, noted last month that Caterpillar “expects a US recovery by 2010, but non-residential construction spending only recently turned down and housing starts continue to decline”.John Kearney of Morningstar in Chicago cautions that although a bottom may have been reached in terms of heavy-equipment sales, that does not imply meaningful growth is imminent.“There may be a difference between reaching the bottom and getting a big upturn,” says Mr Kearney. “We could be close to a bottom, but the question is: do we just bounce along here or do we get some sort of activity where we get back up to more normalised production levels?”Mr Owens, a member of President Barack Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board and a friend of Ray LaHood, the US transportation secretary, has been critical of Washington’s $787bn stimulus plan, saying the portion dedicated to infrastructure was too small to offset the decrease in private-sector spending and puny compared with the investment in infrastructure contained in China’s economic stimulus plan.He has been pushing for a second stimulus, without which, he has warned, the recovery of the US’s industrial sector will be slower.Mr Owens has seen positive signs in China, with sales of heavy construction equipment returning. He can also point to a strong balance sheet, with $3.6bn cash on hand at the end of March. Market activity in Caterpillar share options suggests traders think its stock price is turning up.Mr Obama touted his stimulus plan in Caterpillar’s home town of Peoria, Illinois, saying it might allow the company to start hiring again. However, if growth fails to return to the US construction sector, Mr Owens may be forced to trim further.“Given their track record so far, the jobs cuts have not been enough,” says Mr Kearney. “If you were being conservative you’d have to be open to the possibility that there’s going to be some additional cuts going forward.”
382;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Corporations cry foul over tax fix;;In his quest for a $210bn tax boost, President Barack Obama will look as far afield as the Cayman Islands and Amsterdam, but the toughest fight is back in Washington with the serried ranks of corporate and conservative America.Anticipating reform, which was mooted by Mr Obama during his campaign for the White House, US multinational companies from Caterpillar to Pfizer are already engaged in fervent lobbying efforts to prevent more profits made in lower-cost jurisdictions being taxed at home.“It is the wrong idea, at the wrong time for the wrong reasons,” said John Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable. “It will cripple economic growth, reduce the competitiveness of US companies overseas and destroy jobs.”Clint Stretch, a tax partner at Deloitte, said the proposal rested on “a continuing belief that there’s a substantial pot of easy money in the international tax rules . . . a pretty tired idea”. He estimates the raft of changes would represent an 8 per cent increase in the corporate tax burden but much more for multinational companies. “This is not consistent with the tax policies of other industrialised countries,” he adds.The president sees things differently. On the campaign trail and in office he has not been shy to take aim at multinationals who expand overseas using the tax code or avoid tax by making foreign subsidiaries disappear using legal but convoluted means.“Even as most American citizens and businesses meet these responsibilities [to pay a proper level of tax], there are others who are shirking theirs,” Mr Obama said on Monday. “And many are aided and abetted by a broken tax system, written by well-connected lobbyists on behalf of well-heeled interests and individuals.”He plans to end the rule that lets companies take immediate tax deductions for expenses incurred in overseas investment but to defer – sometimes forever – paying US tax on the profits made from those investments.The target is not new – President John F. Kennedy made a strikingly similar speech 48 years ago. And Reuven Avi-Yonah, at Michigan University Law School, argues the changes are “much more limited in scope” than other options such as removing the right to deferral altogether.But while the impact on US jobs is contentious, the size of the tax take at stake is incontrovertibly large. By curtailing deferral and the practice of inflating the size of tax credits gained for paying overseas taxes, the Treasury calculates it will generate an additional $103.1bn (£69.5bn) in revenue between 2011 and 2019, balm to the budget deficit.A smaller part of the mooted tax grab comes from “getting tough on overseas tax havens”, with the administration targeting $95.2bn over 10 years by reforming the “check the box” rules that allow US companies to shift US taxable income to tax havens and by making it harder for individuals to hide money overseas.“US multinationals are going to be $190bn less competitive than their foreign competitors – it’s about that simple,” said Ken Kies, a tax lobbyist at Federal Policy Group, whose clients include Microsoft and General Electric. “This would be a dramatic departure. Most countries in the world don’t tax the active trade or business income of multinationals earned outside their borders, ever.”Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, said the measures were “balanced” and noted increased taxes would be partly offset by making permanent a research and experimentation credit, which he said was worth $75bn over the course of 10 years, and allowing research exemptions for the change to the deferral rule.While the traditional tax havens such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are targeted by plans to stop tax avoidance, larger jurisdictions that simply recoup revenue from US companies – Mr Obama mentioned the Netherlands and Ireland by name – will also face stronger competition for that money.“Once you are competing overseas, because that’s where the markets are, you also seek to reduce your foreign taxes,” says Raymond J. Wiacek, a tax lawyer at Jones Day. “For example, once in the EU, you likely base your operations in Ireland or the Netherlands…and not one of the higher tax countries. What is wrong with that?”On Capitol Hill, the move to take more foreign-earned profits is set to spark a battle that could last two years.If multinationals can persuade Democrats that the measures will cost US jobs, productivity and competitiveness, they could block the legislation. But if the administration can tie the tax take to specific policies such as healthcare reform, it could keep would-be Democrat defectors on side.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall
383;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Caterpillar chief hits at ‘buy American’;;"The Obama administration is likely to need another stimulus package if the US’s industrial sector is to recover, Caterpillar’s chief executive said on Wednesday.Addressing the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Jim Owens also attacked the “buy American” provision in the stimulus, saying it had prompted “a wave of concern throughout the world”.Mr Owens’ views carry weight both in Washington and globally. His company, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, is widely seen as a bellwether of the US and global industrial economy.The Caterpillar chief is also a member of Mr Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board and is close to both the president and Ray
La­Hood, the transportation secretary.Mr Obama promoted his $787bn stimulus plan in Peoria, Illinois, where Caterpillar is based, saying that if the package passed, the manufacturer might be able to rehire some of the 25,000 workers it has shed in recent months – raising expectations that Mr Owens has been trying to damp down ever since.The dramatic decrease in US private-sector investment in infrastructure was “more than enough to offset the fiscal stimulus”, Mr Owens said.“A very small percentage of our stimulus was related to fiscal infrastructure, whereas in China a large percentage was,” he said.“I would be surprised if we don’t need to come back and invest more in infrastructure – and invest is a good word – we’ve been under-investing for a number of years. Now is a good time to do it. It creates jobs,” he said.“To the extent we can identify very good projects – be they rail, highway, airport, dams – now would be a very meritous time to pull those investments forward and try to stimulate real economic growth.”Without such spending, Mr Owens said the US would experience “a much longer, slower recovery”.His comments come a week after Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years and slashed its profit outlook by half as it braced itself for what it said would be “the most significant percentage decline in our sales since the early 1930s”.Mr Owens said he was troubled by the “Buy American” provision inserted into the stimulus and said he had heard concerns from colleagues all over the world.“We cannot be a great country by building a wall down the southern border,” he said.“We have been the flag carrier for trade liberalisation.“We need to focus on strengthening our competitiveness, not on protecting ourselves,” he added."
384;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-04-22T20:52:15Z;US stocks fall in volatile trading;;"US equities fell on Wednesday as a late sell-off in the financial sector erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street as investors digested another busy day of earnings.Morgan Stanley fell after bad debts and real estate writedowns wiped out trading gains during the first quarter. The stock lost 9 per cent to $22.44.Capital One exacerbated ongoing fears of rising bad debts in the financial sector after reporting heavier losses than expected and putting aside more money for future defaults.It raised its guidance for the amount of money it would lose from defaulted payments, saying there was “significant uncertainty” over the outlook, and its shares closed 4.5 per cent down at $14.38.The results kept the markets lower despite a rally during the day triggered
by comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, that the government wanted to retreat from the banking sector as soon as possible.“What Mr Geithner knows that the market does not is the results of the bank stress tests,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams. “I would assume he thinks they are relatively positive or he wouldn’t be thinking we are out of the woods yet.”But neither Mr Geithner’s comments nor figures showing house prices unexpectedly rose during March were able to lift the gloom by the time the markets closed.Even Wells Fargo got caught in the late selling in spite of doubling its revenues to $21bn as more homeowners paid to refinance their mortgages.The bank sparked a steep rally earlier in the month by predicting record profits. But chief financial officer Howard Atkins sounded a more cautious note when he said he did not know what the government would say following their evaluation of lenders’ balance sheets. The company’s shares fell 3.4 per cent to $18.18.The benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.8 per cent to 843.55 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 7,886.57 points. The Nasdaq Composite index once more outperformed the other two, gaining 0.1 per cent to 1,646.12 points.“It seems we are stuck again,” said Colin Cieszynski of CMC Markets. “We are trading in a range, and that is simply part of the bottoming process.”The Nasdaq was bolstered by Yahoo, the internet search company, which said it would cut 5 per cent of its worldwide staff after reporting earnings in line with expectations. The company’s shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.48.Telecoms was a top performer on the S&P after AT&T reported earnings considerably ahead of estimates with revenues bolstered by customers transferring data over wireless services, especially on Apple’s iPhone. That boosted AT&T’s shares 1.8 per cent to $25.74.Apple lost 0.2 per cent to $121.51 ahead of earnings due out after the bell.Several industrial companies gained as Mr Geithner said he saw some stabilisation of global demand, helping the sector perform better than any other on the S&P.General Electric’s shares rose 0.9 per cent to $11.80 as its top executives addressed a shareholder meeting, during which Jeff Immelt, chief executive, reiterated his prediction that the company’s finance arm would make a profit for 2009.Meanwhile, Caterpillar built on the previous session’s gains, which came on the back of better-than- expected results, after JPMorgan upgraded the company to “overweight”. Its shares gained 3.4 per cent to $32.45.Boeing climbed, even though it made less profit than analysts predicted as the company kept its full-year earnings forecasts above analysts’ estimates. The stock gained 1.8 per cent to $37.30.Ingersoll-Rand, which makes refrigeration equipment, announced a narrower loss than expected and its shares rose 15.7 per cent to $19.35.Freeport McMoRan, the copper maker, bucked the trend, however, after reporting tumbling revenues and profits on weak demand and low metals prices.Its shares fell 0.7 per cent to $40.45.Elsewhere, Gilead Sciences was one of the top gainers on the S&P, advancing 5.7 per cent to $46.22 after reporting rising revenues on the back of strong sales of its Aids drugs."

Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
386;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar halves profits outlook;;Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, slashed its profits outlook in half on Tuesday, saying it was braced for “the most significant percentage decline in our sales since the early 1930s.”The downgraded forecast dampened hopes that the global industrial economy may be recovering. Caterpillar is widely seen as a bellwether of the US economy, but it depends on markets outside North America for about 60 per cent of its sales.“Bottom line is, we modelled a worldwide recession, but not one quite as severe as we’re currently seeing,” said Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive.Caterpillar also cast doubt on the ability of the US government’s stimulus package to revive the US’s industrial sector, saying it would be insufficient to offset the steep decline in private-sector construction spending.“The infrastructure portion of the stimulus package was disappointing,” the company said. “It was less aggressive than other countries and missed an opportunity to correct past underinvestment.”The manufacturer has sacked 25,000 of its workers around the world in recent months as it struggles to cope with the global economic downturn. The cost of that downsizing became clear on Tuesday as Caterpillar said it incurred $558m of charges in the first quarter because of the job cuts.Combined with a 22 per cent fall in sales to $9.22bn, that dragged the company into the red in the first three months of the year, its first loss-making quarter in 17 years.Caterpillar’s net loss was $112m or 19 cents per share, down from a profit of $922m or $1.45 a share in the same period last year. Excluding the costs relating to shedding workers, the company said earnings for the quarter would have been 39 cents a share.The company also issued a gloomy outlook for the rest of the year, saying that excluding the cost of more restructuring, it expected to earn $1.25 per share, down from the $2.50 per share it forecast just three months ago. It revised down its sales outlook to $31.5bn-$38.5bn from $36bn-$44bn.Caterpillar said it expected to incur about $700m of pre-tax restructuring costs for the full year, wiping about 75 cents per share off its profits for 2009.“While redundancy costs have been a considerable expense, it’s the right thing to do,” said Mr Owens.The company said it was braced for the global economy to remain in recession for most of the year, declining by about 1.3 per cent. It forecast economic declines of 2.5 per cent in North America, 3.5 per cent in Japan and nearly 2 per cent in Europe.However, Mr Owens also suggested 2009 could mark the end of the global downturn. “The situation seems to be stabilising and we’re pleased to see commodity prices that have strengthened to levels that normally drive additional investment,” he said.Caterpillar shares were up 1.2 per cent to $30.85 by noon in New York on Tuesday, reflecting that the results were not as dismal as some analysts had predicted.

Even after changes in accounting rules helped boost earnings at large US banks, including Citigroup and Bank of America, regional banks profits continued to suffer.“Some of the smaller banks don’t have the scale to withstand the strains in credit markets and global economic pressures,” said Joseph Brusuelas, analyst at Moody’s Economy.com, speaking generally.Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s biggest custodian of investor assets, said it was slashing its quarterly dividend as it reported profits fell by 51 per cent in the period and cut its dividend from 24 cents to 9 cents as it tried to bolster its capital base and take a step toward repaying Tarp funds.But the BoNY results left some analysts concerned about how the bank would fare in the Treasury’s stress test results. “Given that they had the lowest [tangible common equity] ratio of all 19 banks subject to the upcoming stress test, we think it is unlikely that the government will allow them to repay the [Tarp’s Capital Purchase Program funds],” said Mark Fitzgibbon, director of research at Sandler O’Neill and partners.Net income declined to $322m, or 28 cents a share, from $749m, or 65 cents, in the same period last year. The drop was worse than analysts had expected and came as fees and revenue fell 28 per cent in a volatile quarter for equity markets.But the bank had some success rebuilding its capital base during the last three months, improving its Tier 1 capital ratio to 13.8 per cent from 13.3 per cent at the end of last year, and boosting its tangible common equity ratio – a measure of financial health – to 4.2 per cent from 3.8 per cent.Earnings also suffered at US Bancorp, another large US regional bank. It reported a 50.8 per cent fall in first-quarter profits as it was hurt by higher credit costs, lower fees and more writedowns.Net income at the Minnesota-based bank fell to $529m, or 24 cents a share, from $1.09bn, or 62 cents. Revenue ticked up by 0.2 per cent to $3.88bn, but a big increase in US Bancorp’s allowance for credit losses disappointed analysts.“Credit costs continued to rise this quarter; an expected consequence of the weak economy and the primary contributor to the reduction in net income year-over-year,” Richard Davis, US Bancorp’s chief executive, said in a statement.The disappointing earnings come as Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told a Congressional oversight panel that evidence the bank bail-out had led to a credit thaw was ”mixed.”Although banks have been at the centre of the recession, industrial companies such as Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment, have been hit especially hard as the downturn spread to other parts of the economy.The Illinois-based company reported its first quarterly loss since 1992 and slashed its outlook for the year. The loss of $112m, or 19 cents a share, was fuelled largely by the costs of massive job cuts imposed during the last few months. In January, Caterpillar cut 20,000 jobs, or 11 per cent of its workforce, as orders plunged.Caterpillar’s revenue also fell sharply, declining by 22 per cent in the quarter to $9.23bn.The company, seen as a bellwether for the US industrial sector, took some comfort in the fact that its losses were due to the one-time costs associated with the job cuts. Excluding those, Caterpillar earned $237m, or 39 cents a share.Cutting its outlook, the company said it expected to earn 50 cents a share on $35bn in sales and revenues this year.”We will take action to keep Caterpillar lean, while at the same time making strategic product and operational investments to position Caterpillar for long-term success when the economy does recover,” said Jim Owens, chief executive.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks group, reported that its first-quarter profits were off by 10 per cent during the first quarter compared with the first three months of last year.Coke’s net income declined to $1.35bn, or 58 cents a share, from $1.5bn, or 64 cents. The company’s results were in line with analysts’ expectations.“While the global economic environment remains challenging, we are well positioned for long-term growth,” said Muhtar Kent, chief executive. “Our business was built for times like these.”Coke’s revenue declined by 3 per cent to $7.17bn during the quarter, but sales by volume were up by 2 per cent.In February Coke said it would raise its 2009 quarterly dividend by 8 per cent, making it the company’s 47th consecutive annual increase."
388;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-04-13T21:01:22Z;How business became the bogeyman;;When Klaus Zumwinkel, then chief executive of Deutsche Post, one of Germany’s largest companies, was arrested on charges of tax evasion a year ago, the public reaction against the business world was swift.Franz Fehrenbach, chief executive of Bosch, the €40bn ($54bn, £36bn) German industrial group, told the Financial Times a few months later that business had become a bogeyman. “When we as managers let ourselves be described as asocial [as one politician had called them], there is an issue,” he said.Christian Strenger, a corporate governance expert at Germany’s largest fund manager, said: “There’s a crisis of understanding. I’m not sure some people have ever really had confidence in the business world. Now, they just don’t understand these entrepreneurs any more.”That negative sentiment has since gone global.As the latest Financial Times/Harris opinion poll shows, public respect for business leaders is all but non-existent.About three-quarters of people in Europe and the US say their opinion of business leaders has worsened because of the economic crisis. Similar proportions think managers are overpaid and unethical. The percentage of people supportive in each case is in single figures. This is in large part because of scandals that have hit business leaders and companies around the world.In Germany, Mr Zumwinkel was convicted of tax evasionbut avoided prison. It was then revealed that he would receive millions of euros in pension from Deutsche Post, in spite of the circumstances of his departure. “There is a lot of anger at how rich people, particularly from business, seem to be able to avoid jail,” said the chief executive of one of Germany’s largest companies. “I’m very worried about the public backlash.”Scandals have rocked some of German industry’s biggest names such as Volkswagen, Siemens and Daimler. Other countries have experienced a similar backlash. A dispute in Britain over the pension of Sir Fred Goodwin, the former head of Royal Bank of Scotland who has been blamed for getting the company into trouble, caused public anger, culminating in a violent attack on an RBS branch during this month’s G20 summit in London.A wave of “bossnapping” has swept France. Senior managers in companies such as Sony, Caterpillar and 3M have been held hostage by disgruntled employees.A senior director at a large Swiss bank said a scandal over UBS private bankers doing things such as smuggling diamonds had damaged the reputation of corporate Switzerland. “It has affected not just financial services but every business,” he said.Several business leaders have given a slice of their gains to charity, while many others are struggling to articulate a coherent strategy for regaining public trust.“In Italy, we have some envy of people who have success,” said the head of a big Italian bank. “And most people who have money are doing too much showing off. I am worried that there could be an icon to fall.”Asked what businesses should do to counter such risks, the banker gave a shrug and an exhortation for “companies to engage with the people”.Some senior managers, such as Josef Ackermann, Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, have called on bankers and others to refuse bonuses in such poor economic times. But concrete proposals to improve the image of business are thin on the ground.“Chief executives need to do something collectively,” said the chief of a medium-sized German industrial company. “But what? I just don’t know.”
389;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-04-07T20:55:53Z;Wall Street falls on earnings fears;;US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors waited cautiously for Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, to kick off the earnings season after the close of the market.Alcoa dropped 1.5 per cent to $7.79 as analysts predicted that the company would make a first-quarter loss of $0.56 per share, with falling global demand taking its toll on profits. Its shares slipped further after the market closed when it reported a net loss of $0.61 a share, or $497m, on revenue of $4.1bn.Worries over earnings also weighed on Caterpillar, the machinery maker, which dropped 5.9 per cent to $29.45 after Andrew Obin, a Bank of America analyst, said the company was likely to make a wider first quarter loss than expected.“Investors are taking a little bit of profit off the table ahead of earnings,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “The financials have managed to rally over 60 per cent in the last few weeks. But I do not think anyone knows what their earnings are going to be like, so some of that money is coming back out.”This followed a subdued session on Monday, during which volumes were low and the market adjusted to the views of Mike Mayo, one of the first analysts to turn bearish on the banking sector, that banks might suffer the worst loan losses since the Great Depression.Those fears were exacerbated on Tuesday after it was reported that the International Monetary Fund is set to forecast global losses on toxic assets of up to $4,000bn.Citi added to the gloom when its analysts cut the US equities market as a whole to “underweight”, saying valuations did not look “particularly attractive”.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 2.4 per cent down at 815.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3 per cent to 7,789.56 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8 per cent to 1,561.61.“The market overextended on the way up and we’re seeing it correct itself a bit now,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “Equities have a tendency to overshoot in both directions.”But Lincoln National provided a bright spot amid a falling financial sector after the life insurer said it was considering selling assets to build capital as it pays down $700m in debt. Its shares gained 8.2 per cent to $6.89.Health insurers also performed well after Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a government agency, said that it would increase its basline payments to those companies by 0.8 per cent, higher than originally proposed.Humana gained 6.1 per cent to $27.92, while UniteHealth picked up 6.9 per cent to $23.45 and Coventry Health lifted 3.5 per cent to $14.26.General Motors fell, giving up all of the gains made during the previous session, after Bloomberg reported that the company was speeding up preparations for bankruptcy. Its shares lost 11.9 per cent to $2.Ford fell 7.4 per cent, meanwhile, to $3.49 as investors took profits after its shares jumped 16 per cent during the previous session on the news that it had swapped $9.9bn worth of debt for cash and shares.Sun Microsystems, the previous session’s heaviest faller, continued to lose ground as analysts predicted the technology company would find it difficult to find another suitor after IBM withdrew its offer for the company over the weekend. Sun’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to $6.28.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Applied Materials shed 8.7 per cent to $10.55 after the computer chipmaker said a $1.9bn solar power contract had been cut to $250m.In oil, Exxon Mobil retreated 1.9 per cent to $68.71 after Barclays cut its 2009 and 2010 earnings estimates for the energy company, having lowered its estimates for natural gas prices.Archer-Daniels-Midland, the agricultural conglomerate, lost 10.6 per cent to $25.66 after Citi recommended selling the shares, saying the decline in its agricultural services business had been extremely fast.Utilities was the only sector briefly to find gains during the day, pulled upwards in part by PG&E, the Californian energy provider, which was upgraded by Credit Suisse. Analysts at the Swiss bank said the Californian regulatory environment would help the company maximise its earnings. PG&E shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.83.

391;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-03-31T04:06:56Z;Auto fears drive down Wall Street;;The looming threat of bankruptcy at General Motors and Chrysler sent stocks tumbling on Monday after the White House rejected the carmakers’ turnround plans and forced out chief executive Rick Wagoner.GM plunged 25.4 per cent to $2.70 as investors feared for the company’s future after the US government promised to fund it only for another 60 days.Ford, which has said it is not taking part in any government bail-out, lost 2.8 per cent to $2.76.Banks took a hammering on investor concern they might need further government support after several European countries, including Spain, Germany and the UK, moved to shore up domestic lenders. Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, exacerbated those fears when he said some US banks would need “large amounts” of assistance.Bank of America was one of the heaviest fallers, down 17.9 per cent to $6.03 while Citigroup fell 11.8 per cent to $2.31 and Wells Fargolost 14.2 per cent to $13.37.The insurance sector also suffered, and Lincoln National fell 38.2 per cent to $6.41 after it withdrew an application to sell debt with a government guarantee, saying it did not meet the necessary conditions. Credit Suisse downgraded the company to “neutral” on the news, saying: “We expect tension between liquidity needs at the holding company as well as likely further pressure on subsidiary capital levels.”There were also fears that signs of discord from leaders of countries attending the G20 in London this week could hamper attempts at global economic recovery.Marc Pado, chief investment strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The G20 really achieved something in November when they agreed to work towards financial stability. But this time some countries, like Germany, are pushing against further stimulus packages, and that is worrying the markets.”The financial sector as a whole fell 9.4 per cent, which wiped out almost all of the gains made after Mr Geithner announced his plan last week to clear up banks’ balance sheets.A couple of financial companies avoided the gloom. Fifth Third gained 5.5 per cent to $2.48 after it generated $561m in cash by selling its payment processing division to Advent International, a private equity firm.Visa, the credit card company, outperformed the market after Barron’s, the investment magazine, said its steady growth should attract investors. Its shares fell a relatively modest 1.4 per cent to $53.50.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed below 800 points, giving up 3.5 per cent to 787.53 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.3 per cent to 7,522.02 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.8 per cent to 1,501.80 points.John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global, said the market’s response to the news from GM was overdone. “If anything, this is a reaction by the market to the fact that the government is replacing a chief executive of an automotive company. It shows the growing power of Washington in US business.“But we think this sell-off is a bit of an over-reaction as the GM restructuring had already been factored into its share price.”Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, fell 14.2 per cent to $6.69 after China’s Aluminium Corp reported a 99.9 per cent decline in 2008 profit and forecast a first quarter loss as the company felt the effect of lower prices.Other industrial companies fell, with Caterpillar losing 9.3 per cent to $27.53. General Electric dropped 7.9 per cent to $9.93 even though Nani Beccalli, chief executive of GE International, told the Financial Times he saw “signs of life” in the US and European economies.Bristol Myers Squibb was a rare gainer, its shares lifting 1.7 per cent to $21.02 after the US Food and Drug Administration said analyses of its experimental diabetes drug showed it met the agency’s guidelines.Oil prices fell below $50 for a barrel of US crude, and energy companies followed. Chevron dropped 3.1 per cent to $66.80 and Exxon Mobil fell 1.9 per cent to $68.63.CBS, the media company, fell sharply after UBS recommended that investors sell its shares as advertising revenues continue to weaken. Its stock lost 17.8 per cent to $3.79.
392;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-03-26T20:41:02Z;Wall Street rallies despite falling financials;;"US stocks rallied strongly on Thursday to put the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its biggest monthly gain since 1974.Strength in the cash-rich technology sector, meanwhile, meant the Nasdaq Composite index is now in positive territory for the year.The S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent to 832.86 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.3 per cent to 7,924.56. The Nasdaq Composite index surged 3.8 per cent to 1,587, putting it 0.6 per cent up for 2009.Technology stocks continued their good performance for the year. Apple gained 3.2 per cent to $109.87 and Hewlett Packard rose 7.1 per cent to $33.20.Paychex, the payroll services company, was the biggest gainer on the index, up 9.6 per cent to $25.88 after it reported better results than expected.This came despite weakness in the banking sector after Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said there would be “new rules of the game” for financial regulation.Confidence in the sector was already fragile after Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Bank of America’s debt and investors took the opportunity to take profits after a month’s strong gains.Bank of America fell 1.6 per cent to $7.58, Citigroup dropped 4.8 per cent to $2.81 and Wells Fargo lost 2.9 per cent to $15.95.“Any time there is any dose of uncertainty addedto the landscape, investors are going to take profits,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at
The Hartford.The market also continued to adjust to Mr Geithner’s plan to clear the banks of their toxic assets, with some analysts warning it might be bad for banks’ shareholders in the long run.“It might save the banks, but that doesn’t mean it will save their shareholders,” he said. “They might be left with something that’s not particularly profitable,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.The banking falls were exacerbated by figures showing that the US economy continues to deteriorate, with the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits hitting record highs.Gross domestic product, meanwhile, fell 6.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the last three months of 2008, although this was better than analysts expected.But banks failed to drag down the market as better- than-expected company results and rising commodity prices counteracted negative economic data.Shares also rallied strongly in the afternoon after a successful auction of seven-year Treasury notes raised hopes the government would be able to fund its stimulus plans.Strong commodities helped industrial companies perform better than any other sector. As metals prices rose, mining companies saw the benefit. Newmont Mining gained 2.3 per cent to $46.90 and Freeport McMoRan picked up 5.9 per cent to $43.05. Caterpillar, which makes mining machinery, rose 6.5 per cent to $30.78.Consumer companies also performed well after positive results showed consumer spending had not collapsed as badly as feared.In the food and drinks sector, Conagra and Dr Pepper Snapple exceeded expectations.Conagra, the frozen food maker, rose 9.2 per cent to $16.99 after it said it expected its consumer foods business, which accounts for the majority of its sales, to improve in the second half of the fiscal year.Dr Pepper Snapple gained 15.2 per cent to $17.87, having made 39 cents in earnings per share excluding certain items.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, provided further evidence that consumer spending remained more resilient than estimated as it reported better revenues and earnings than expected.The company forecast that it would beat analysts’ predictions for its 2010 profits. It was one of the highest risers in the S&P, jumping 12.6 per cent to $37.67.The figures helped lift other consumer companies including Wal-Mart, which rose 2.1 per cent to $52.76.General Motors surged after reports said the company had agreed plans
with 6,000 of its staff who belong to the United Auto Workers union to take buy-out offers. This was more than analysts had expected, and GM’s stock rose 14.1 per cent to $3.41."
393;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;JCB digs in to survive downturn;;A new £40m factory in the Midlands – full of high-tech machine tools and assembly equipment – appears in most respects to be a gleaming advertisement for UK manufacturing.But there is one thing wrong with the Uttoxeter plant belonging to JCB, the privately owned construction equipment maker. It is eerily quiet – a result of a dearth in orders that means the site is turning out only about six giant excavators a day instead of the planned 40.Asked when the plant is likely to be at full stretch, Sir Anthony Bamford, the 63-year-old chairman and company owner, looks a trifle exasperated. “No one can bloody know,” he says. “This is the worst recession I’ve seen. Normally in downturns, there are some parts of the world where demand is reasonably good. This time, there’s absolutely nowhere.”JCB – one of the few UK manufacturing companies to have a strong global role in a large sector – is among the biggest six producers of earth-moving equipment. Its main competitors include Caterpillar of the US and Japan’s Komatsu.Set up 54 years ago by Joe Bamford, it has been run by Sir Anthony, Joe‘s son, since 1975.Another key person at JCB is Matthew Taylor, its 48-year-old chief executive. Mr Taylor was recruited from the Ford automotive company in 2006 and given his current post last year.In 2007, JCB had sales of £2.2bn, with about 20 per cent coming from the UK. India is its biggest market, accounting for about a quarter of revenues, with the US responsible for 10 per cent.The company’s pre-tax profits in 2007 were £187m. Its 2007 sales figure was more than double its 1999 revenues, when JCB had just 3,000 workers, almost all of them in the UK.While the company has yet to report figures for 2008, sales are likely to have been 20 per cent lower than in 2007, with an expected decline this year of at least 30 per cent.Outside the UK, the company has wholly owned production operations in the US, India, Brazil, China and Germany – all of them opened since 2000.The Uttoxeter plant is on the outskirts of the town and just a short drive away from the Staffordshire village of Rocester, a rural enclave that serves as JCB’s global headquarters.The new factory is a smart, low-rise structure, painted – like all JCB’s global plants – a special “Moorlands green”, Joe Bamford’s favourite colour.A large pond for ducks and other wildfowl, another trademark of all JCB’s plants, is at the back of the factory. It employs 350 workers, although is set ultimately to have another 150, assuming that production can be pushed to full capacity.Even though Sir Anthony does not attempt to disguise the difficulty of business conditions, he insists that the decision to go ahead with the new plant – which was completed last August – was correct.“It was a long-term investment,” he says. “It’s a tremendous factory and it’s capable of buzzing – when the orders start to come in.”Sir Anthony brushes off any notion that he might be contemplating retiring or taking a back seat at the company, especially as the downturn bites. “Being in this business right now is not nice – nor is it easy,” he says. “But I am going to carry on.”
394;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-03-18T19:52:04Z;US stocks spike on Fed plan;;US stocks surged on Wednesday afternoon, taking the S&P briefly back over 800, as the Federal Reserve announced unprecedented measures to clear financial companies’ balance sheets and stimulate the economy.The unexpected move by the Federal Reserve to buy $300bn in long-term Treasury bonds and an additional $750bn in mortgage-backed securities delighted investors, with financial stocks feeling the most benefit.The benchmark S&P 500 index spiked after the announcement, and was 1.6 per cent up at 790.8 shortly before the close, having hit a high of 803.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7,642.6 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,486.16.Banks were the biggest risers, having also been boosted by reports from Bloomberg that the Treasury was ready to expand the term asset-backed relief program (Talf) also to help clear balance sheets. The troubled Citigroup lifted 22.7 per cent to $3.08.Bank of America, whose chief executive, Ken Lewis, earlier said would be able to repay $45bn in government money from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), picked up 17.2 per cent to $7.35.Fifth Third gained after it declared a dividend of $0.01 a share, helping to push its stock up 13.9 per cent to $2.22.Insurers also felt the benefit of the Fed’s boldness, with Metlife rising 25.8 per cent to 25.17 and Prudential gaining 19 per cent to $24.02.Morgan Stanley fell, however, after JPMorgan, as part of its new coverage of the company, said that it would need more capital. It dropped 0.6 per cent to $23.68.“The Fed needed to act with buying these assets and injecting money into the banks by printing money to capitalise the banks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But others were more sceptical about the effectiveness of the Fed’s plan. Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group, said it could actually be bad news for stocks. “I don’t think that many people would view that as a good thing, especially when China has said it is already concerned about US debt. There could be some serious consequences if we were to anger China.”The technology sector continued its recent good performance after it emerged IBM was in advanced talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for $10 per share, more than double Tuesday’s closing price. The news sent shares in Sun soaring 77.5 per cent to $8.82 while IBM slipped 2 per cent to $91.01.“The recent buying of tech stocks shows we have hit the bottom. You wouldn’t buy growth stocks if you didn’t think the economy was going to recover,” said Mr Pado.The Fed’s move came despite data released on Wednesday morning showing consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Corporate earnings from General Mills, the food producer which makes Cheerios, came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 11.4 per cent to $47.55.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 18.6 per cent to $35.47.Gains in industrial stocks were limited after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 1.7 per cent to $37.57, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, gained 1.9 per cent to $27.33.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, rose 5 per cent to $35.22. The shares had suffered earlier after JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per share.Energy stocks put a moderate drag on the market’s gains, rising only slightly after oil prices came off their recent lows. Chevron picked up 1.6 per cent to $66.36 and Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $69.16. The shares were hit in part by profit taking, with the sector having gained more than10 per cent between the beginning of last week and the end of Tuesday.

The news sent shares in Sun up 66 per cent to $8.25 while IBM slipped 3.1 per cent to $89.99 before the bell. The companies refused to comment.The increased activity in the tech sector helped futures for the Nasdaq Composite index outperform those for the benchmark S&P 500 index or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Less than an hour before the opening bell, futures for the Nasdaq were 3 points down at 1,187.2, while those for the S&P were 5.8 points lower at 769.5 while the Dow Jones lost 68 points to 7,286. On a fair value basis, however, which takes into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, both the S&P and Nasdaq were higher.Hopes for “quantitative easing” from the Federal Reserve were fading on Wednesday, but investors were still waiting to hear if it might buy long-term Treasury bills in an effort to stimulate the economy.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who mixed upbeat comments about the economy over the long-term with an understanding of what is needed to get from here to there in comments during a rare interview with CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ on Sunday.”The Fed may be less anxious to get into such asset purchase schemes after data released on Wednesday morning showed consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Mortgage applications were also higher, adding to the confidence given to financial and homebuilder stocks on Monday by data showing more new houses were started in February than had been predicted.Corporate earnings from General Mills on Wednesday came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 3.5 per cent to $51.81 in pre-market trade.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 10.4 per cent to $33.00 before the bell.Industrial stocks looked set for falls after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, fell 0.8 per cent before the open to $36.64, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, fell 1.8 per cent to $26.35.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, fell 1.8 per cent to $32.95 on the news from China. The company was also hit when JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per cent.Bad news from China also weighed on Coca-Cola before the bell, as the company said it was “disappointed” by the Chinese government’s rejection of a $2.3bn bid for China Huiyuan Juice Group. Its shares lost 1.1 per cent to $41.01.European stocks were down slightly ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.4 per cent lower at 712.96. Asian equity markets rallied for a fifth day, with the Nikkei 225 closing 0.3 per cent higher at 7,972.17.Bond yields were flat ahead of the Fed’s announcement.

Wells Fargo, which continues to drop on worries that it will cut its dividend, lost 15.9 per cent to $8.12.Citigroup also fell, with fears over its creditworth-iness reflected in record highs in the price of insuring against the bank defaulting on its debt. On Thursday it cost $525,000 to insure $10m of Citi’s debt. Citi shares dipped below $1 for the first time in the company’s history. By the close they were 9.7 per cent lower at $1.02. The banks were further hit by news that US mortgage delinquencies were up by 1 per cent, with one in every eight mortgage-holding households ending 2008 behind on their payments or in the foreclosure process.US Bancorp was one of the most heavily sold, despite offering to give back $6bn of Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. Its shares fell 18.2 per cent to $9.01.Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab said: “Financials will not stabilise until we see some good news, either by more banks paying back money from Tarp or by the big banks reporting reduced losses when the earnings season comes around.”Bill Knapp, investment strategist at New York Life, said the selling had reached similar levels to those seen last autumn. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw Washington bring in another temporary ban on short selling,” he commented.The S&P 500 fell 4.3 per cent to 682.55, its lowest since September 1996. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4.1 per cent to 6,594.44 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4 per cent to 1,299.59.Shares in material and industrial stocks retreated after rising on Wednesday following talk that the Chinese government was ready to introduce a fresh stimulus package to encourage spending.The announcement never came, and three of the previous session’s biggest winners dipped. However, the assertion from Chinese premier Wen Jiabao that the country would meet its 8 per cent growth target for the year meant they did not cede all of Wednesday’s gains. Nucor, the steelmaker, lost 7.7 per cent to $32.07 and Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $31.65. Caterpillar, which sells mining equipment in the US and China, dropped 7.7 per cent to $23.49.The news from China also brought the oil price down after its strong performance on Wednesday, hampering energy stocks. Chevronfell 4.8 per cent to $56.46 and Exxon Mobil gave up 5.3 per cent to $62.22.There was yet more bad news for the distressed car industry.Auditors for General Motors said there was “substantial doubt” that it could continue to function as a going concern for the next 30 days. Even though the assessment had been forecast, its confirmation sent GM shares down 15.5 per cent to $1.86.Meanwhile Ford said on Wednesday night that it would look to negotiate a debt-for-equity swap with its creditors. The prospect of equity dilution sent it 3.2 per cent lower at $1.81.General Electric managed to pare early losses after Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, reassured the markets that the company did not need new capital. Its shares closed 0.5 per cent down at $6.66.Budget retailers continue to perform well, and after Wednesday’s better-than-
expected profits from Big Lots, Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 5.1 per cent rise in February sales at stores open at least a year. Its stock rose 2.6 per cent to $49.75. But Wal-Mart’s figures disguised a wider slump in retail sales, which fell 4.8 per cent in February compared with the same time a year ago, once Wal-Mart had been excluded.Hewlett-Packard belied the recent outperformance by technology stocks after a report from research firm IDC said that PC sales would fall 4.5 per cent this year worldwide. HP shares fell 4.3 per cent to $20.25."
397;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-03-04T22:04:32Z;Wall Street lifted by Chinese stimulus plans;;General Electric, once the biggest company in the world by capitalisation, on Wednesday saw its share price dip to a low not seen since 1991 during an otherwise positive day on Wall Street.GE was forced to issue a statement tackling rumours it would have to raise fresh capital as the cost of insuring against the company’s finance arm defaulting on its debt spiked.After falling steeply in early trade it the company’s shares bounced slightly when the company said it had “acted aggressively” to adapt to the current recession and had ”no plans to raise additional equity”. They ended the day down 4.6 per cent at $6.69.That went against the general trend of the day, which saw all three major indices rising on hopes that China could shore up global demand, with a fresh stimulus package from Beijing widely expected.Metal producers were amongst the biggest gainers, with Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, picking up 13.4 per cent to $32.21. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, and Alcoa, the aluminium maker, also saw gains, rising 8.1 per cent to $34.73 and 12.8 per cent to $6.24 respectively.The news from Beijing also helped had an effect on oil prices, and US crude rose $3.51 to $45.16 per barrel. This was followed by energy companies, including Chevron, which rose 2.7 per cent to $59.28 and Exxon Mobil, which gained 2.1 per cent to $65.68.Caterpillar, which supplies machinery to domestic mining markets and to China directly, was a big gainer, rising 13.2 per cent to $25.44.A potential uptick in demand from Asia also helped technology stocks, which have been heavily sold during the first couple of months of 2009. Applepicked up 3.2 to $91.17 while Cisco rose 6 per cent to $15.25.“The sector got badly beaten up at the start of the year, but the news out of China has encouraged some buyers,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 712.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2 per cent to 6,875.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.5 per cent to 1,353.74.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, however, despite further details from Washington on the Obama administration’s $275bn plan to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages. Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary, said that mortgage providers could start reducing borrowers’ payments immediately.“The mortgage plan is a great idea,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “It will allow some homeowners to refinance and so should relieve pressure on financial stocks.”But others have warned that the administration is not being sufficiently friendly towards equity markets, in spite of President Obama’s reassurance on Tuesday that “buying stocks is a potentially good deal”.“The market will find selling pressure until Washington decides to address the market’s decline via policies which are friendly toward capital formation and investment,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Banks were down, with Citigroup falling 7.4 per cent to $1.13, and Bank of America dropping 1.4 per cent to $3.59. US Bancorp added significant pressure to the sector after becoming the latest large company to cut its dividend, reducing it from 42.5 cents to just 5 cents per share. Its shares fell 12.5 per cent to $11.01.This leaves Wells Fargo as the largest traditional commercial bank not to cut its dividend, and fears that it would soon do so sent the company’s stock down 9.5 per cent to $9.66.Insurers rallied after Tuesday’s falls on news that 12 life insurers have applied for capital injections from the Treasury in order to buy local lenders.MetLife rose 7.3 per cent to $14.72, while Lincoln National and Prudential gained 9.2 per cent to $7.16 and 7.1 per cent to $13.82 respectively.But the overall fall in the financial sector reflected fears in the credit markets about the security of those companies’ debts.The CDR Counterparty Risk Index, a measure of the counterparty risk in the sector, was at its highest level this morning since September last year, went Lehman Brothers went bust.
398;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-03-02T21:47:51Z;Dow falls below 6,800 as Wall Street tumbles;;US stocks nosedived in another grim Monday as shares were hit by bad news that brought equities to historic lows.The S&P and the Dow Jones both fell more than 4 per cent, bringing their losses for the year to more than 20 per cent, the measure for a bear market.The Dow traded below 6,800 points for the first time since October 1996 at 6,763.29, a fall of 4.2 per cent. The S&P briefly fell below 700 points and finished down 4.7 per cent at 700.82.Investors reacted to more bad news from some of the world’s biggest financial companies, with financial stocks and industrials leading the selling.AIG announced the biggest corporate loss in US history, while HSBC tapped the markets for the UK’s biggest corporate rights issue.AIG was one of the day’s best performing stocks, initially surging, but then falling back to finish unchanged at $0.42 after its results triggered a third government rescue plan in as many months. But the losses themselves stoked fears about the health of the financial system and the ongoing availability of liquidity.Joshua Raymond, market strategist at IG Index, said: “The stench of liquidity concerns remain entrenched in banking systems.”Fears about liquidity weighed heavily on Citigroup, which became one of the day’s biggest losers, down 20 per cent to $1.20.JPMorgan, which is underwriting HSBC’s cash call, fell 7.4 per cent to $21.16. Bank of America dropped 8.1 per cent to $3.63, while Wells Fargo lost 10.4 per cent to $10.84.Industrial stocks were significantly lower, hit by three rounds of bad news. New data showed construction had contracted by more than double analysts’ expectations for January. Consol Energy, one of the US’s biggest metallurgical coal producers, then announced it was to shut its Buchanan mine temporarily.Added to this, the oil price continued to slide, standing 10.6 per cent down at $40 a barrel by the close of the stock markets.Consol lost 4.7 per cent to $22.58, while Caterpillar fell 9.9 per cent to $22.17, and Deere & Co, the machinery maker, fell 9.7 per cent to $24.83.“The closure of the Buchanan mine is bad news for the entire industrials sector,” said Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.GE, which last week cut its dividend for the first time since 1938, continued to drop. It finished 10.7 per cent down at $7.60, the first time the stock has been below $8 since 1994.Healthcare stocks fared little better as the market continued to react to President Obama’s healthcare policies, unveiled last week.The sector was down 4.2 per cent. Johnson & Johnson lost 4.2 per cent to $47.92. Humana and Unitedhealth, the two companies to benefit most from private involvement in Medicare, continued to lose ground, down 15.5 per cent to $20 and 11 per cent to $17.48 respectively. Humana has now lost nearly half its value since news of the budget began to leak last weekend.Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global, said: “The market continues to worry that there are going to be policies taken that will be even worse for healthcare stocks.”Further bad news came from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway group turned in the worst performance in its history, underlining the battered state of nearly all equities.In a letter to investors, Mr Buffett sounded a gloomy note for the economy in general, saying that it would be “in shambles throughout 2009 – and, for that matter, probably well beyond”.He added that “that does not tell us whether the stock market will rise or fall”.Dell initially rose after Thursday’s results were followed by an upgrade of the stock by Argus research. Shares in the company eventually closed down 1.2 per cent at $8.43, although that still made it a relatively good performer.The outperforming technology sector has helped the Nasdaq Composite index outperform the other two leading indices, and it closed 4 per cent lower at 1,371.91 points.
399;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-03-02T15:21:21Z;Dow opens below 7,000;;US stocks tumbled again early on Monday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index entering a bear market for 2009 with only two months of the year gone.Both the S&P and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell heavily soon after the markets opened, bringing their losses for the year to date above 20 per cent. The Dow was trading below 7,000 for the first time since 1996 at 6,940.83, a fall of 1.7 per cent. Meanwhile the S&P fell 1.8 per cent to 721.91 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,364.93.Investors were reacting to yet more bad news from some of the world’s biggest financial companies, and it was financial stocks that once more led the selling on Wall Street.HSBC, one of the world’s largest banks, announced the UK’s largest ever rights issue, while fresh bail-out plans were unveiled for the stricken insurance giant AIG.JP Morgan, which is underwriting the bank’s cash call, fell 2.8 per cent to $22.21. Bank of America dropped 9.7 per cent to $3.56, while Wells Fargo lost 10.9 per cent to $11.09.Citigroup, however, managed to make some gains, paring back its losses after a day’s heavy selling on Friday. Its shares had gained 1.3 per cent to $1.54 by mid-morning.Meanwhile financial services group PNC announced it was to slash its dividend from 66 cents a share to just 10 cents in an effort to rebuild capital. Its shares promptly fell 4 per cent to $26.49.AIG meanwhile picked up 0.1 per cent to 49 cents in early trade after it announced a third government rescue plan in as many months. But more significantly for the market, the company reported the biggest ever corporate loss in history, stoking further fears about the health of the financial system and the ongoing availability of liquidity.“This means the stench of liquidity concerns remain entrenched in banking systems and as such, investors are losing out on reasons to buy banks right now,” said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at IG Index.Further bad news came from billionaire investor Warren Buffet, whose Berkshire Hathaway group turned in its worst performance in history, with net income down 96 per cent, underlining the battered state of nearly all equities.Mr Buffet sounded a gloomy note for the economy in general in a letter to investors, saying it will be “in shambles throughout 2009 – and, for that matter, probably well beyond”, but added, “that conclusion does not tell us whether the stock market will rise or fall”.Industrial stocks were significantly lower as data showed that manufacutring contracted, although at a slower rate than before. Caterpillar lost 3.3 per cent of its share price in the first half hour of trading to $23.55.Healthcare stocks fared little better as the market continued to react to President Barack Obama’s healthcare policies unveiled last week. The sector was down nearly 3 per cent. Johnson & Johnson lost 2.2 per cent to $48.99.“The market remains very nervous over government policy toward financial and health care firms. Analysts are lightly defending healthcare names today, but investors are selling first and asking questions later,” wrote Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global.Even a rise in income per US citizen of 0.4 per cent and in spending of 0.6 per cent, against expectations of a fall of 0.2 per cent and a 0.4 per cent rise respectively, was largely dismissed by economists as meaningless.“The January monthly changes in income and spending paint a completely misleading picture of economic activity at the start of the first quarter. The income data in this report is completely distorted by the lagged adjustment of government payments to prior price increases,” wrote RDQ Economics.Bond yields were down, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note 5 basis points lower at 0.923 per cent, while the10-year Treasury note, was off 5 basis points at 2.963 per cent.The dollar was down against major currencies early in New York, although picked up a small amount against the yen.Gold was trading 49 cents lower at $937.86 per troy ounce early in New York.

400;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;US stimulus throws lifeline to construction;Increased spending on infrastructure projects should help save jobs;When US president Barack Obama approves the government’s $787bn economic stimulus on Tuesday, Bob Bohn will be forgiven for breathing a sigh of relief.Mr Bohn is chief executive of Oshkosh, a company based in Wisconsin that makes speciality vehicles such as construction aerial work platforms, cement mixers and fire engines.The recession has delivered a beating to Oshkosh. In the last three months of last year, the company made a loss of $21m, compared with a profit of $37m in the same period a year earlier. Its share price dropped faster than most in the construction sector last year, losing more than 80 per cent of its value. Last month, the manufacturer abandoned its 2009 profit forecast, saying the deteriorating global economy made revenues impossible to predict.Like other executives at the company, Mr Bohn is taking a 10 per cent pay cut this year. He has cancelled his country-club membership and stopped using his company car. Amid all the gloom, the US government’s $787bn economic stimulus is a rare piece of welcome news.“Quite frankly, we’re excited,” says Mr Bohn. “Not only will this put people back to work pouring concrete – where we have a nice market share – but spending on infrastructure such as airports should also help some of our speciality products like snow removal and rescue vehicles.”That sentiment reflects the mood in many industrial companies that are struggling to cope with the global economic downturn. The Obama administration claims that the stimulus provides the biggest investment in US infrastructure since the 1950s. However, those in the industry had been hoping for more, and say that “hard construction” projects account for only about a fifth of the package.Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, assumed a central political role in pushing politicians in Washington to support the stimulus package. Jim Owens, chief executive, is joining a team of business people who will advise the US president on economic policy.Caterpillar – based in ­Peoria, in Mr Obama’s home state of Illinois – has cut more than 22,000 jobs in the past month and this week offered another 2,000 workers deals to take voluntary retirement early. Mr Obama visited Peoria last week, saying that Mr Owens had told him the stimulus would ­enable him to take back some of those employees. The Caterpillar chief, however, said the bill “doesn’t mean we can start hiring right away”.Analysts say the stimulus could help companies that derive much of their income from infrastructure projects. An example is Granite Construction, a northern California company that derives about 70 per cent of its revenues from large projects such as highways, tunnels, bridges, public transport systems and airports.One concern is that there could be a delay before spending gets under way as projects go through the process of winning approval. Most of the infrastructure projects in the package will be under contract within a year, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. However, some industrial companies that are struggling to survive may not be able to avoid bankruptcy before work begins.Another worry for the companies that hope to benefit is that in an economy with so little construction, stimulus projects could provoke furious competition between contractors, which could find themselves scrambling to under-bid each other, thereby reducing their margins.Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar’s director of investor relations, says the manufacturing sector is hoping the effect of the stimulus does not end with direct infrastructure spending. “What we need is a jump-start to get the overall economy going,” he says.“There’s infrastructure spending in there and that’s a good thing – it’ll add some sales for us. But what’s more important is that it gives confidence in the economy, the housing market.”
401;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-02-13T20:51:18Z;Hire American calls raise protectionist fears;;"The final stimulus bill that emerged on Capitol Hill on Friday may have been portrayed by Barack Obama, US president, as a success for the economy. But finance ministers from the Group of Seven meeting in Rome on Friday will remain concerned about the protectionist signals it may be sending.Apart from the Buy American provisions restricting government spending to US companies, other items in the bill could also give cause for alarm. An amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, a leftist independent senator for Vermont, and Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, would restrict the use of foreign worker visas by financial institutions being bailed out by the federal government.The provision prevents companies supported by the troubled asset relief programme (Tarp) from applying for H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers if they have recently laid off US employees.“The very least we can do is to make sure that banks receiving a taxpayer bail-out are not allowed to import cheaper labour from overseas while they are throwing American workers out on the street,” Mr Sanders said.“These banks may not be looking to hire lots of new workers any time soon,” said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It is the signal that it sends to the rest of the world that is troubling. We are enshrining the principle that in tough economic times it makes it harder to hire foreign workers.”The White House and Congress are being pulled in two directions: on one side, the political imperative to benefit US workers; on the other, lobbying from multinational companies and trading partners. Mr Obama appeared in Peoria, Illinois, with Jim Owens, CEO of Caterpillar – a staunch opponent of Buy American and a consistent, if sometimes minority, voice in favour of new trade agreements.But the final version of the bill contained a relatively strong version of the Buy American measures, with broad restrictions on buying foreign-made iron, steel and manufactured goods softened by a reminder that international trade agreements need to be respected.Robert Gibbs, White House spokesman, said: “Where we ended up . . . is the right compromise that respects the [Buy American] laws that we’ve had on our books for many, many years while also ensuring that the language doesn’t create unnecessary trade disagreements.”The stimulus bill and its Buy American provisions have also provoked accusations of hypocrisy. While the administration has resisted pointing the finger at its trading partners, lawmakers and activists have said Canada and the European Union, which have complained about the provisions, have their own restrictions on procurement.Public Citizen, a campaign group, cites a report from the US trade representative’s office from last year which says many European governments have de facto restrictions on buying US products, an accusation the European Commission says is unwarranted. “Even for procurement that is not covered by the GPA [the World Trade Organisation government procurement agreement], there is no equivalent ‘Buy European’ provision,” the Commission said.Business associations representing multinationals were disappointed. Harold McGraw, chairman and CEO ofMcGraw-Hill and chairman of the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs, said: “If we aren’t being a good global partner… we are going to pay a price.”"
402;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-01-29T18:43:15Z;US factories to cut spending;;US manufacturers said on Thursday that they plan to slash capital spending this year as they try to conserve cash in the face of the worsening global economy.3M, one of the US’s biggest diversified manufacturers, said it was cutting its capital spending budget for 2009 by 30 per cent and halting its share repurchase scheme, while Textron, the world’s biggest corporate jet maker, said it was reducing capital spending by 42 per cent this year.US industrial production declined at an annualised rate of about 15 per cent in the last three months of 2008, although regional surveys suggest manufacturing activity recovered a little in January.Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, announced 20,000 job cuts this week and warned that it could make a loss in the first half of this year. Boeing, the world’s second-largest aircraft manufacturer, also announced 10,000 job losses and cut its revenue forecast for this year.A string of smaller US manufacturers such as Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, Kennametal, an industrial toolmaker, and Timken, a bearings and speciality steelmaker, also issued poor quarterly earnings results and profit warnings. Oshkosh, the Wisconsin-based truck maker, withdrew its 2009 profit forecast completely.George Buckley, 3M chief executive, said the economic climate in the fourth quarter of last year “was different from any pattern we’ve ever seen before”. 3M’s profit in the fourth quarter was $536m or 77 cents a share, down from $851m or $1.17 per share in the same period a year earlier.Lewis Campbell, Textron’s chief executive, said 2009 was “setting up to be the most challenging year ever for most manufacturing companies”.Textron is braced for a sharp decline in demand for corporate jets, which have become a symbol of executive profligacy. Citigroup cancelled a jet order this week after widespread criticism, while Starbucks said it would sell two of its three jets.
403;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-01-27T09:21:24Z;Gloom deepens as 76,000 jobs go in a day;;Corporate bellwethers in the US and Europe on Monday slashed more than 76,000 jobs from their payrolls to confront the deepening economic downturn, marking one of the most brutal days yet for workers on both sides of the Atlantic.US corporate groups such as Caterpillar, General Motors, Sprint Nextel. Texas Instruments, and Home Depot led the retreat, as the domestic recession coupled with tough export markets continued to take a heavy toll on their businesses. Pfizer, the drugs group, added to the tally saying jobs would be lost in its takeover of Wyeth.Large European companies such as Philips, the Dutch electronics company, financial group ING and the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, which is owned by India’s Tata Group, struck the same downbeat tone as they unveiled plans to axe staff.In many cases, the cutbacks accompanied disappointing quarterly results or bleak outlooks for 2009, when many of the world’s largest economies are expected to be hit by severe downturns.Raymond Torres, head of the International Labour Organisation’s research institute, said employers were shedding workers far more quickly in this recession than in the early 1990s.“We have a vicious circle of depression, where job losses lead to falling consumption, which lowers industrial confidence, which leads to less investment, which results in more job losses, and so on,” he said.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, said it would cut 20,000 jobs as it reported fourth-quarter profits more than 32 per cent lower than a year ago and warned earnings would be under pressure in 2009. The news comes a month after the US group slashed executive salaries by up to half and cut jobs at large plants.Sprint Nextel, the US mobile-phone operator, is to cut 8,000 jobs, or 14 per cent of its workforce, while DIY retailer Home Depot is shedding 7,000 posts and freezing salaries as it battles a consumer slowdown in the US.Pfizer said 19,500 people would lose their jobs after its takeover of US rival Wyeth, while General Motors, the troubled carmaker, announced 2,000 job losses at two plants in Michigan. After the US markets closed, chipmaker Texas Instruments eliminated 3,400 positions. The news in the US came after ING said it would axe 7,000 of its 130,000 global staff and Philips announced the loss of 6,000 jobs as it accelerated restructuring plans.Corus, Britain’s largest steelmaker, announced cuts of 3,500 from its global workforce of 41,000, with more than 2,000 jobs to go in the UK where it employs 20,000.News of job cuts continued on Tuesday, with Clariant, the Swiss speciality chemicals maker, shedding 1,000 jobs in sales and administration. The group, which currently employs over 20,000 people, announced a 5 per cent decline in full-year sales.Reporting by Justin Baer and Francesco Guerrera in New York, Andrew Ward in Washington, Hal Weitzman in Chicago, Richard Milne in London and Frances Williams in Geneva
404;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-01-26T22:37:49Z;Pfizer deal offsets Wall St earnings gloom;;Hefty declines in financial shares weighed on Wall Street on Monday as the sector’s volatile run continued, although a rare piece of dealmaking propped up the wider market during more choppy trading.Financials rallied as much as 4.3 per cent overall to lead a bullish morning session as US investors took some comfort that European banks had reassured over the need for possible capital raisings.But the relief was short-lived. A sharp afternoon sell-off left the sector 2.1 per cent lower, as fears over more heavy writedowns and uncertainty over the new administration’s plans to rescue the stricken sector returned to the fore.Citigroup and Bank of America advanced as much as 8.1 per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively, only to stand 4 per cent and 3.9 per cent lower by the close. They finished at $3.33 and $6, respectively.“We’re going to continue to see that volatility,” said Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNYConvergEx.Regional banks were among the heaviest losers. A bearish note on Regions Financial from Richard Bove, influential analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, helped push the sector down 3.4 per cent overall.Shares in the southeast lender dropped 12 per cent to $4.10 after Mr Bove forecast it was likely to slash its dividend from 10 cents to a penny a share.American Express was another key loser among the bigger names, down 5 per cent to $15.20, but recovered 4.3 per cent in immediate after hours trade, when the credit card group disclosed a 79 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings.Heavy volatility has returned to Wall Street in recent sessions, due in large part to violent swings in financial stocks.Last week, the benchmark S&P 500 dived beneath a nadir reached last month, sparking concerns among technical analysts that another support level could be breached.The wider market finished off its highs on Monday, but still found positive territory as Pfizer’s deal to acquire Wyeth, a rival drugmaker, demonstrated that at least some deals could be struck during the recession and amid weak credit markets.The S&P finished up 0.6 per cent to 836.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5 per cent higher at 8,116.03 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8 per cent stronger at 1,489.46.The S&P had earlier rallied as much as 2.5 per cent.Although news of the Pfizer-Wyeth tie-up had leaked, its confirmation was reassuring for the wider market – especially given that Dow Chemical said it did not have the funds to complete the immediate takeover of Rohm and Haas, whose shares tumbled 13.3 per cent to $57.10.Shares in Dow, which cited the global financial crisis and the collapse of its joint venture with Kuwait, lost 7.6 per cent to $13.24 as its target launched a lawsuit.Pfizer dropped 10.3 per cent to $15.65 while Wyeth closed down 0.8 per cent to $43.39 after a strong run last week, when talk of the deal began to circulate.Elsewhere, homebuilders stood 2.9 per cent higher overall after National Association of Realtors data showed that sales of existing homes rose last month from a record low.Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said the jump in foreclosures – and subsequent drop in prices – had contributed in large part to the 6.5 per cent increase. Still, he noted after the figures were released: “The market wants to look on the bright side of risk…and this latest data will probably encourage the mild risk recovery seen so far.”The Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators also unexpectedly rose in December.The market’s gains came in spite of glum assessments of corporate prospects and a harsh round of job cuts. The most high-profile, Caterpillar, dropped 8.4 per cent to $32.67. Among the raft of other companies to unveil plans for hefty job losses, Home Depot climbed 4.7 per cent to $22.73 and Sprint Nextel added 1.2 per cent to $2.49. Both companies said the moves would bring sizeable cost savings.Elsewhere, McDonald’s – which along with Wal-Mart was one of only two stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to end 2008 in positive territory – added 0.7 per cent to $58.40 after the release of results that topped forecasts.
405;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-01-26T20:40:02Z;Caterpillar to cut 20,000 jobs as orders fall;;"Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, on Monday warned of a “seismic adjustment” in revenues as it moved to cut 11 per cent of its workforce amid the economic downturn.The severity of the manufacturer’s actions demonstrates how industrial production and infrastructure projects globally have slowed in recent months.Although Caterpillar is widely seen as a bellwether of the US economy, it depends on markets outside North America for about 60 per cent of its sales.The scale of the global crisis was made clear on Monday as a host of other companies announced large job cuts, including Sprint Nextel and Home Depot in the US, and Corus, ING and Philips in Europe. Ninety-two per cent of US companies are cutting costs, according to a survey released on Monday by Challenger, Gray and Christmas.Caterpillar’s move to cut 20,000 jobs comes a month after the Illinois-based group slashed executive salaries by up to half, citing a decline in orders and weaker demand for engines in Caterpillar machines.The company announced the latest round of job cuts as it reported that profits in the fourth quarter of last year fell by more than 32 per cent and warned that it would struggle to make a profit in the first half of
this year.“Through the first three quarters, we experienced booming demand from key global industries, notably mining and energy,” said Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar.“Then we were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices.”Caterpillar said profit in the last quarter was $661m or $1.08 a share, down from $975m or $1.50 a share in the same period a year earlier and well below analysts’ expectations of about $1.28 per share.“Fourth-quarter profit was disappointing,” said Mr Owens. “It is now clear that we need to sharply lower our production and costs.“These are very uncertain times and it’s imperative that we focus Team Caterpillar on dramatically reducing production schedules and costs in light of poor economic conditions throughout the world,” Mr Owens continued.“While it’s painful for our employees and suppliers, it’s absolutely necessary given economic circumstances,” he added.Caterpillar said that most of the job cuts would be completed by the end of March.Mr Owens said the company expected a “seismic adjustment in top-line sales and revenues” in 2009, with sales volumes of machines and engines dropping by 30 per cent.“Profit in the first half, and particularly the first quarter, will be under severe pressure,” the company warned. “A first-quarter loss is possible.”Caterpillar shares were down on Monday by 8.4 per cent at $32.67."
406;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2009-01-13T00:56:49Z;‘Green’ energy market to grow to £50bn;;A market worth more than £50bn will be created for new wind, wave and tidal power equipment in British waters by 2020, the head of the new government-backed energy research and development group has said.David Clarke, chief executive of the Energy Technologies Institute, will on Tuesday launch the first four projects backed by the group, which aims to encourage the commercial development of low-carbon energy sources including renewables, electric vehicles and power stations that capture and store carbon dioxide emissions.The ETI, based at Loughborough University, is still backed by just six companies instead of the 11 that the government hoped for. Each company has promised to contribute £50m over 10 years.Mr Clarke told the Financial Times it was “clearly challenging to find new partners in the present climate”.However, he added that the ETI was “in discussion with a number of groups” and it would be easier to persuade them to sign up now that there was so much emphasis on low-carbon industries as a source of future jobs and economic growth.Creating jobs and developing a UK manufacturing base in energy industries is not the principal objective of the ETI, which has been set up to develop new sources of energy supply for consumers.Four of its six members have foreign parents – Royal Dutch Shell, Eon of Germany, EDF of France and Caterpillar of the US – and the other two, BP and Rolls-Royce, are UK-based multinationals. Moreover, the companies that receive grants from the institute need not be British.However, Mr Clarke, who attended Gordon Brown’s jobs summit on Monday morning, said it would be “a great bonus” if the ETI could help create a thriving UK industry in both manufacturing and servicing products such as wind turbines.He estimated that to meet government targets, about 4,000 offshore wind turbines and 2,000 wave or tidal power devices would have to be installed by 2020, at a cost of £50bn or more.He added: “The sheer volume of the change that we are talking about in the UK energy system is so great that the number of jobs involved is bound to be very significant.”The first four projects to be unveiled today, three in offshore wind and one in wave or tidal power, will receive a total of £60m in funding from the ETI.Its target is to find ways to cut the cost of these relatively expensive sources of electricity so that they can better compete with coal and gas-fired power stations.
407;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-12-22T22:49:16Z;Caterpillar slashes top salaries by half;;Caterpillar is slashing its executives’ salaries by as much as half as part of a move by the world’s biggest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines to cut costs.The bellwether manufacturer is also scrapping merit-based pay increases, implementing a hiring freeze and offering employees compensation packages to leave the company.The sectors in which the Illinois-based manufacturer operates – trucking and construction – are widely seen as barometers of the US economy. Caterpillar was one of the first big US companies to warn that the economy was entering a recession.The company was able to ride out much of the economic turmoil this year, benefiting from its growth in international markets and the boost that strong commodity prices gave the energy and mining sectors in emerging economies. Sales outside the US account for more than half of its markets.The measures the company announced on Monday demonstrate how it is being squeezed by the global economic downturn, lower commodity prices and a stronger dollar. Worldwide sales for the company’s machinery through dealers fell by 6 per cent between September and November compared with the same period a year ago, Caterpillar said last week.The company said that executive pay in 2009 will decrease by up to 50 per cent, while compensation for senior managers will be reduced by 5-35 per cent, and other management and support staff will see a reduction of up to 15 per cent. Caterpillar said employees interested in its “incentive-based voluntary separation programme” would have until January 12 to participate.Caterpillar said last week it would cut 814 jobs from its engine assembly facility in Mossville, Illinois. In making those cuts, the company cited a decline in orders and weaker demand for engines in Caterpillar machines.“We are now intensifying our focus on cost reduction,” Jim Owens, chief executive, said on Monday. “During these uncertain times we will position the company for long-term growth.”“We understand these decisions will disrupt the lives of many of our employees and their families, and we regret the need to take these steps.”
408;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-12-22T21:50:29Z;Wall St closes lower on growing auto gloom;;"US stocks sold off on Monday as investors reacted to more bad news from the embattled automotive sector and digested new details of president-elect Barack Obama’s planned economic stimulus package.Trading volume was low as the holiday-shortened week got off to an uncertain start. Many analysts have been predicting a round of bargain-hunting to end the year but sentiment remains finely balanced.Toyota Motor said it expected to post its first operating loss in the fiscal year through March 2009 and would barely carve out a net profit, showing how severely the global economic downturn is hitting even the world’s most successful companies.Standard & Poor’s reiterated its sell opinion on Toyota’s American depository receipts, saying its financial outlook illustrated “the depths of the global automotive industry’s difficulties”.The credit ratings agency added that, in its view, relative to its peers, Toyota has a strong balance sheet that should help it weather this crisis. “We expect global automotive demand to decline in calendar year ’09,” the agency said.ADRs of Toyota fell 5.4 per cent to $60.88 on the New York Stock Exchange.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was 1.8 per cent lower at 871.63 while the Nasdaq composite fell 2 per cent to 1,532.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent lower at 8,519.69.Merrill Lynch analysts said there was a 50 per cent chance of a Christmas rally, noting that while December and January are typically the strongest months of the year, only 13 of the past 25 years have seen a rally. Merrill described the condition of the market as a “good overbought”, but that this suggested a near-term pull-back.In spite of seeing the pull-back, analysts said such a decline could be the catalyst for a rally “that has the potential to carry the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average through 1,200 and 10,000, respectively”.Mr Obama expanded the goals of his proposed economic stimulus, with a plan to create or save an additional 500,000 jobs.General Motors and Ford soared on Friday on Washington’s move to grant the industry a temporary lifeline under the troubled asset relief programme. But both lost ground on Monday with GM shares down 21.60 per cent at $3.52 and Ford 12.2 per cent down at $2.59.GM slid after Credit Suisse’s auto analyst, Chris Ceraso, downgraded the company to an “underperform” rating from “neutral”, saying that GM could yet wind up in bankruptcy and that shareholder value is likely to be eliminated no matter how the government’s recent efforts to prop up the auto industry pan out in the months ahead.Auto suppliers were led lower with Lear down 16.4 per cent to $1.33 and American Axle & Manufacturing down 1.7 per cent to $2.36.Caterpillar said it would cut executive compensation by up to 50 per cent next year because of weakening demand triggered by the wider global economic downturn. The world’s largest maker of mining and construction equipment also said it would reduce compensation for senior managers by 5 per cent to 35 per cent in 2009. Other staff would see a reduction of up to 15 per cent. Its shares were 2.1 per cent lower at $41.478.In deal news, the insurance giant AIG said it would sell Hartford Steam Boiler,
a subsidiary business, to Munich Re Group for $742m in cash and $76m in stock.AIG has been allocated more than $150bn in government financing and was effectively nationalised in September. AIG shares were 0.6 per cent higher at $1.61.JPMorgan Chase said it would acquire UBS’s Canadian energy operations and global agricultural business.JPMorgan will buy UBS Commodities Canada, based in Calgary, Alberta, which will allow the New York-based company to expand its presence in Canadian natural gas, power and crude oil physical and financial markets. The deal will also allow JPMorgan to expand its overall Canadian client base. Shares in JPMorgan rose 1.7 per cent to $29.82 on the news.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Merrill Lynch shares fell 4 per cent to $11.42, Goldman Sachs was down 4.6 per cent at $77 and Morgan Stanley lost 5.6 per cent to $14.58."
409;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-12-21T19:07:11Z;US corporate tax policy is in need of reform;;"It is unfortunate that the US, which has led the capitalist world for so long, is woefully uncompetitive in corporate tax policy. We have the second highest corporate tax rate among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and many other tax policies that make it difficult for US companies to compete. Studies such as one done by William C. Randolph of the CBO in 2006 have estimated that 70 per cent of corporate taxes are ultimately borne by the American workforce.Our tax system is particularly onerous for asset-intensive, industrial businesses such as manufacturers and transport companies. For example, Caterpillar, Boeing, FedEx, commercial airlines and carmakers produce goods and services and provide jobs for millions. But to maintain or increase jobs and compete globally, these companies must be able earn an acceptable return on capital expenditure.How can we make US companies more competitive and increase their ability to offer good jobs? Two things: accelerate the expensing of capital investment; and reduce the corporate income tax rate.Let us permit US companies to write off all their capital expenditures when they make them, as opposed to the current system of long-term depreciation. Why? Experts such as Ernie Christian and Gary Robbins have said that, over time, every dollar of tax cuts for expensing adds about nine dollars of gross domestic product growth. Even without counting the benefits to the economy of new jobs, it is a relatively cheap option for the US Treasury, since the only cost to the government is the time value of money.How does this affect American jobs? Let me use an example from FedEx. If we buy a 777 aircraft from Boeing, under the current tax code, we generally write that asset off over seven years for tax purposes. But buying a $150m aircraft is a big risk because you do not know what the market is going to be like when that aircraft is delivered some four years after the order. The best way to mitigate the risk is to allow the company to get that money back quicker. It reduces risk and encourages investment more quickly in equipment, facilities and jobs.While faster capital expensing is smart tax policy in any case, it is particularly so in times of economic downturn such as the present.The US also needs to lower its corporate income tax rate. At 39 per cent, it is the second highest in the OECD, behind Japan. The rates of some of our trading partners are much lower – Germany 30 per cent, China 25 per cent, the UK 28 per cent and the Netherlands 26 per cent.The benefits of multinational trade to the US are well known: more jobs, national wealth, consumer choice, all of which contribute to a better standard of living. Yet tax policy damages our economy. First, we are a less attractive place for foreign companies to do business. Second, we make it harder for US companies to compete with foreign companies outside the US.Some have questioned why it is important that US companies expand their global businesses. FedEx is a great example because our business is dependent on having a global network. A customer who needs to move inventory from India to Germany will not use FedEx for any of its business if our network does not include those countries. (It does!) More robust growth in our business portends, of course, greater growth in jobs, both in the US and around the world.But if we must pay 39 cents of every dollar of what we make in corporate income taxes while foreign competitors pay lower (often much lower) amounts, there is no question but that our competitors will have more earnings to invest in new capital projects and jobs.The US is seriously out of touch with the rest of the world in corporate income tax policy. We must reduce our federal rate by at least 10 percentage points and the states should follow suit. Until we do that, we will continue to fall behind simply because we are standing still.While the political debate has centred on Wall Street and Main Street or government infrastructure initiatives, I believe expensing capital and lowering corporate tax rates would quickly stimulate additional economic activity.The beneficial impact on our economy and longer-term federal tax receipts would far outweigh the relatively small near-term increase in the deficit, particularly when compared with other actions such as consumer rebates and/or increased government spending.The writer is chairman, president and chief executive of FedEx"
410;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-12-18T21:50:25Z;Wall St slips lower on struggling oil stocks;;General Electric sparked a sharp afternoon sell-off on Thursday as Standard & Poor’s negative credit rating outlook led investors to question which other companies could be vulnerable.Several big financial and industrial names came under heavy selling pressure in the wake of the move, which extended a commodities-led retreat.“If a titan like GE is susceptible in the current environment, it makes you wonder who else is,” said Steve Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investments.Shares in GE, one of the few companies in the world to retain a triple A credit rating, fell 8.2 per cent to $15.96.S&P, the credit rating agency, affirmed the rating but said there was a one in three chance it could cut it in the next two years.The move helped drag the benchmark S&P 500 index back beneath its 50 day moving average, a key technical level that was surpassed earlier in the week for the first time since shortly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.The S&P finished down 2.1 per cent to 885.34, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.5 per cent to 8,604.99 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.7 per cent to 1,552.37.The energy sector led the declines as crude oil fell below $36 a barrel for the first time since July 2004 in spite of the Opec oil cartel’s record 2.2m barrel-a-day production cut.Massey Energy and National Oilwell Varco were among the biggest losers, off 11.4 per cent to $13.83 and 12.4 per cent to $22.86, respectively.Materials also staged a retreat as base metals fell. ArcelorMittal shed 4.7 per cent to $25.04 after Barclays downgraded its view of the stock to “equal weight”.“In our bear case scenario, we note the possibility that ArcelorMittal violates its debt covenant,” said Dana Guido, Barcalys analyst. “We stress that we find it highly unlikely that ArcelorMittal would actually breach its debt covenants . . . but, in our opinion, balance sheet concerns are likely to prevent significant outperformance in the months ahead.”Industrials also came under pressure from the latest profit warnings in the sector, this time from Ingersoll-Rand and Pentair. The manufacturers lost 4.7 per cent to $15.59 and 4.6 per cent to $23.75, respectively.The latter disclosed plans to cut about 1,600 jobs and close facilities as it prepares for a 15 per cent drop in profit next year.FedEx fell 2.1 per cent to $62.60 even after the delivery group disclosed second-quarter earnings that were broadly in line with expectations lowered by a profit warning last week, when the shares tumbled 16.8 per cent. The shipping company said it would cut executive salaries and freeze hiring in 2009.Among the big names to come under pressure, Caterpillar lost 5.6 per cent to $42.16 after unveiling plans to cut hundreds of workers.Semiconductors also did badly. Intellost 6.6 per cent to $14.26 after Jefferies cut its recommendation on the stock to “underperform”.Elsewhere in technology, Take-Two Interactive Software disclosed an an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned profit next year would be lower than forecast. Shares in the Grand Theft Auto video game publisher sank 26.2 per cent to $8.91.Although the leading indices posted big declines, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – fell 5 per cent to 47.34, its lowest level since October.Despite the losses elsewhere, defensive stocks held out after more largely downbeat economic data on unemployment and manufacturing provided fresh insight into the depth of the recession.Investors dipped their toes into the healthcare, utility and consumer staple sectors, all of which found positive territory.Soft drink bottlers were among the best performing defensive names after Coca-Cola Enterprisesraised its earnings outlook and unveiled a well-received restructuring plan.Its shares rallied 8.3 per cent to $11.58 while peer Pepsi Bottling Group jumped 7.7 per cent $21.01.Conagra Foods advanced 1.9 per cent to $16.55 after Citigroup named the stock as its favourite in the large cap branded food sector, highlighting that it traded at a 23 per cent discount to peers on an earnings basis.

Ford, which has said it has enough cash to last into 2009, closed up 4.8 per cent at $3.04.“There’s a reluctance to be short the market going into the weekend, in the expectation that a deal could be done come Monday morning,” said Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Global.Lear, the car parts supplier, fell as much as 24.9 per cent but later stood 2.6 per cent higher at $1.88.After a choppy session, the benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent at 879.73 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent higher at 8,629.68.The arrest of Bernard Madoff, former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market, weighed on sentiment as investors assessed potential losses from an alleged $50bn fraud.Yet some sectors enjoyed spectacular gains. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished 2.2 per cent stronger at 1,540.72 after strong gains in technology. General Growth Properties soared 25 per cent to $1.80 and prompted a rally in real estate investment trusts after refinancing its debt. Consumer stocks found positive territory, helped by consumer confidence figures that showed an unexpected improvement this month from the lowest level in 28 years. For the week, Friday’s gains left the S&P up 0.4 per cent, the Dow down 0.1 per cent and the Nasdaq up 2.1 per cent.Commodity and infrastructure stocks provided the market with support, helped by plans from Barack Obama, US president-elect, for the biggest infrastructure investment in the US for half a century.Caterpillar and Alcoa rose 10 per cent to $42.08 and 23.7 per cent to $10.08 over the five-day period, respectively.The energy sector was the strongest performing of the week, up 8.5 per cent overall as oil prices staged a strong recovery from the previous week’s heavy losses.Meanwhile, fresh signs of stress in credit markets – investors paid for the privilege of owning US government debt for the first time in postwar history – helped drag financials lower.The sector tumbled 5.7 per cent overall as banks suffered heavy declines amid nervousness ahead of fourth-quarter earnings season.Comments on CNBC Television by Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, that the bank has endured a “terrible” November and December helped drag the shares down 7.2 per cent to $30.94.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs lost 11.9 per cent at $13.85 and 4.2 per cent to $67.74 ahead of their results expected next week.US Bancorp, whose shares have outperformed the financial sector this year as the bank appeared to have avoided serious difficulties that have afflicted peers, heightened concerns that forthcoming earnings would bring heavy writedowns.The shares lost 10.6 per cent over the week to $25.84 after the bank said it could incur $1bn in credit costs and writedowns in the fourth quarter.Credit card stocks were also sold off heavily as fears heightened over the financial health of US consumers. American Express shed 6.6 per cent to $20.34.Meanwhile, a fresh glut of downbeat corporate outlooks and analyst downgrades weighed on other sectors.In media, Gannett, owner of USA Today among other titles, sank 15.6 per cent to $7.53 after the Tribune Company, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Profit warnings from several companies, including FedEx and Eastman Kodak, raised concerns over the prospects for company earnings during the recession. Shares in the pair lost 16.8 per cent to $61.34 and 11.6 per cent to $6.41 over the week, respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just shy of the psychologically significant 9,000 level, up 3.5 per cent at 8,934.18 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.1 per cent to 1,571.74 points.“The sketchy plans were broad enough in scope to help send equity values skyrocketing,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers, of the market’s reaction to the stimulus proposals.The materials sector led the advance, up 7.7 per cent overall. Dow Chemical jumped 7.2 per cent to $20.37 after the group disclosed plans to cut 5,000 full-time jobs in a move expected to save $700m in annual operating costs by 2010.There was mixed news in the media sector. The Tribune Company, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But Gannett, publisher of USA Today among other titles, gained 2.7 per cent to $9.16.Energy stocks were other big winners as US crude prices rebounded from their sharpest weekly retreat since 1991.Leading the gains, Chesapeake Energy soared 24.4 per cent to $14.08 after Aubrey McClendon, chief executive, sought to quash rumours that it could have liquidity difficulties. Joseph Allman, JPMorgan analyst, welcomed the update and upgraded his recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “overweight”.Devon Energy was helped by a note from Jefferies, which upgraded its recommendation from “hold” to “buy” and set a $100 price target. “Devon is well positioned to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a tight credit and depressed commodity price environment,” the analysts said. The shares rose 6.6 per cent to $65.32.However, profit warnings from 3M and Illinois Tool Works limited gains among industrials.The former was one of the day’s key losers, down 4.1 per cent at $57.38 in spite of a move to shed 1,800 jobs. However, Illinois finished the session up 1.4 per cent at $32.84. Homebuilders extended some of last week’s spectacular gains, up 3.2 per cent overall.McDonald’s, off 2.9 per cent to $60.92, was among the main losers in the consumer sector, in spite of a reasonable like-for-like November sales performance. Oppenheimer cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast due to the earnings risks presented by the strengthening dollar.In financials, MetLife lost 2.4 per cent to $30.03 after the insurer forecast profit for the fourth-quarter and next year below analyst predictions.The decline came even after the company became the latest in the sector – after Prudential Financial and Hartford Financial last week – to state that it was well capitalised.NYSE Euronext was among the strong gains in exchanges, up 22.5 per cent to $26.21, after reports over the weekend that it had been in talks with Deutsche Börse about a potential tie-up.The talks ended without an agreement.The US economic stimulus package is likely to include additional spending on internet broadband infrastructure and the technology sector stood 5.2 per cent higher
overall.Yahoo gained 4.6 per cent to $12.20 on renewed hopes that the company could reach a long-awaited deal with Microsoft, which was up 5.7 per cent at $21.01.Apple gained 6.1 per cent to $99.72 on reports that Wal-Mart would sell its iPhone for as little as $99. Shares in the retailer, among several defensive stocks to come under pressure, lost 1.1 per cent to $57.56."
413;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Wall Street plunges on economic fears;;The health of the economy and financial institutions returned to haunt Wall Street on Monday as US stocks suffered their heaviest losses since October.The month began in a sour mood as traders, on their return from the Thanksgiving break, were greeted with official confirmation that the economy has been in recession for a year.Yet it was the financial sector – bludgeoned 17 per cent overall – that led the market declines, which wiped out most of last week’s spectacular gains and ended a five-session winning streak.JPMorgan, off 17.5 per cent to $26.12, was among the key losers after Meredith Whitney, analyst at Oppenheimer, forecast the credit card industry would cut lending by more than $2,000bn over the next 18 months.“We believe we are now entering a new era in the financial landscape that will be characterised by expanded forced consumer deleveraging, with a pronounced downshift in consumer spending,” she wrote in a note.Banks endured heavy losses on fears they could need more capital. Citigroup – whose bail out helped fuel last week’s rally – sank 22.2 per cent to $6.45.Morgan Stanley lost 23.1 per cent to $11.35 after Credit Suisse analysts forecast a net loss in the fourth quarter of $0.35 a share.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 8.9 per cent to 816.21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 7.7 per cent to 8,149.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 9 per cent to 1,398.07.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 24.1 per cent to 68.60, indicating high levels of distress.Industrials such as Caterpillar, off 10.8 per cent at $4.41, came under particular pressure after data from the Institute for Supply Management showed manufacturing activity last month contracted at its fastest pace in more than a quarter of a century.“Nothing like this has ever been seen before in post-second world war history,” said Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets.Retailers came under heavy selling pressure in spite of initial reports that sales on “Black Friday”, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season, were not as bad as some had feared.Stocks such as Macy’s and Abercrombie & Fitch tumbled 13.6 per cent to $6.41 and 14.8 per cent to $16.47, respectively, as traders remained concerned that, although discounting may have helped drive footfall, the heavy markdowns would hurt margins.“Even a great Black Friday…won’t be enough to save the month,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan, who visited stores across the Atlantic seaboard to monitor shoppers.Reports of widespread consumer bargain-hunting failed to lift Wal-Mart and Target, the discounters, which fell 5.1 per cent at $53.01 and 12.5 per cent at $29.54, respectively.The prospect of using the $700bn financial sector rescue package to help homeowners, mooted by Henry Paulson, treasury secretary, afforded the market scant relief and the sell-off worsened into the close.Stocks remained near session lows after Ben Bernanke warned that the Federal Reserve had “obviously limited” scope to lower interest rates, yet may buy Treasury securities to stimulate the economy.The retreat was wide ranging and even took in stocks such as Ford, down 5.2 per cent to $2.55 even after the motor group said it could sell its Volvo division. General Motors, which along with Ford and privately held Chrysler is due to present restructuring plans to Congress on Tuesday to make their case for $25bn in emergency aid, fell 12.4 per cent to $4.59.The energy sector was one of the biggest losers, down 10.3 per cent, as Opec delayed a production cut until mid-December.Chipmakers such as Intel, down 9 per cent to $12.56, were dragged lower by figures from the Semiconductor Industry Association that showed global sales fell 2.4 per cent in October.A report in The Sunday Times that Microsoft was in talks to buy Yahoo’s online search business for $20bn failed to give the search group a boost after AllThingsDigital quoted Ross Levinsohn, an internet executive said to be involved in the move, as saying the report was “total fiction”.The search group lost 6.7 per cent to $10.74 and Microsoft 8 per cent to $18.61.
414;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-11-17T22:01:41Z;Wall St falls on financial sector layoffs;;The biggest round of US job cuts for 15 years helped push Wall Street stocks lower on Monday as fears heightened over the scale of the difficulties facing financial institutions.Financials were among the biggest losers, down 6 per cent overall. Citigroup shed 6.6 per cent to $8.89 after unveiling plans to cut 52,000 jobs, which, according to consultants Challenger Gray & Christmas, was the biggest job cut announcement since the 60,000 by IBM in 1993.The bleak news, coupled with mounting signs of global recession, overshadowed any developments at the G20 meeting.Still, the market pared early losses as investors hunted for bargains in the energy, material and industrial sectors and briefly entered positive territory.Jeffrey Kleintop, strategist at LPL Financial, said there was a “tug of war” between poor economic developments and some signs of improvement in credit markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished down 2.6 per cent at 850.75 points after a sharp sell-off into the close, near the session’s lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 per cent at 8,273.58 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 2.3 per cent at 1,482.05.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, edged 4.2 per cent higher to 69.10, which continued to indicate elevated signs of distress.Elsewhere in financials, Bank of America slid 8.5 per cent to $15.03 after the group said it would increase its stake in China Construction Bank from 10.75 per cent to 19.1 per cent.Investors brushed aside a better-than-expected reading on industrial production – output rose 1.3 per cent last month, according to the Federal Reserve – as downward revisions to prior figures offset the rare positive news.RDQ Economics said the data were in any case primarily a result of “post-hurricane rebounds” and Bank of New York Mellon called the increase a “dead-cat bounce”.Official confirmation that the Japanese economy had entered recession increased concerns that the global downturn was spreading.Construction groups came under pressure after separate data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed manufacturing in New York contracted in November at the fastest pace since records began in 2001. Caterpillar lost 3.4 per cent to $35.70.General Motors jumped 5.7 per cent to $3.18 on mounting hopes Washington would grant aid to the car industry, although Ford eased 4.4 per cent to $1.72.In earnings news, Lowe’s and Target became the latest retailers to disclose sharp falls in third-quarter profit.Yet the figures were not quite as dire as analysts feared and shares in the former rose 4.2 per cent to $18.99.Target lost 4.1 per cent to $31.68 after management warned that the discounter’s gross margin performance might not be repeated in the fourth quarter.Also in the consumer sector, McDonald’s edged 0.9 per cent lower to $55.61 even after UBS upgraded its recommendation on the fast food group from “neutral” to “buy”. The bank said it was encouraged by the group’s “ongoing strong global trends amid a deteriorating global consumer environment”.In technology, Dell fell 3.4 per cent to $10.52 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the computer maker from “buy” to “neutral” ahead of results due this week, owing to lower than expected demand.Walt Disney lost 6.4 per cent to $19.74 after Soleil Securities cut its recommendation on the theme-park operator and media group from “buy” to “hold”.United Parcel Service was up 0.3 per cent at $53.28 even after the delivery group declined to forecast its peak day for holiday shipping, breaking with a long-standing practice in the industry. An uncertain economy made prediction too difficult, it said.Alcohol, tobacco and casino stocks received a boost after Merrill Lynch issued a bullish outlook on the so-called vice sectors.“Consumers do not kick their habits in tough economic times,” said Merrill.Still, brewer Molson Coors shed 2 per cent to $41.71.Energy was one of several sectors to find positive territory earlier in the session, but finished down 1.6 per cent overall as crude oil settled just above $55 a barrel.
415;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-11-11T23:38:30Z;Credit terms tied to companies’ risk;;"US and European companies renewing short-term credit facilities are being forced to accept terms that link interest payments to their creditworthiness.In recent months, AT&T, Wal-Mart, Caterpillar, Halliburton, Nokia and Novartis have all renewed their short-term financing arrangements, including revolving credit facilities, and found that “relationship pricing” is no longer available.Instead, companies are finding that banks – which had offered cheap loans to their best corporate clients – now price these facilities based on measures of credit risk.In most cases, credit default swaps – the derivatives that reflect the cost of insuring against the default of the company – are being used.“There is a paradigm shift in how revolving credit facilities are priced,” said Thomas Cassin, managing director at JPMorgan. “Banks are increasingly focused on earning a market-based return on their capital in the current environment.”The first deal for this new type of pricing for revolving loans, which add up to an estimated $6,000bn worldwide, was done in April.Since then, such terms have become widely used. Banks hope this will discourage companies from tapping these credit lines unless they absolutely need to.“This form of pricing is becoming more common in the market today,” said Halliburton.Already, at least 20 such deals for 364-day revolving credit facilities – used as a type of overdraft for companies to ensure access to funds in case markets shut down – have been completed and at least as many are in the pipeline.Concerns that companies would tap existing revolving credit facilities have weighed on the outlook for banks, as extending the loans under existing terms would be uneconomic.Most companies decline to comment on their borrowing terms. But Caterpillar said
it renewed its 364-day credit agreement on September 18 and also amended two five-year facilities, which totalled $6.85bn.“Like many companies, the terms have changed,” the company said.“If we borrow against our credit facility (we have never tapped it), we would pay Libor [London interbank offered rates] plus the then current credit default swap spread for Caterpillar.”Typically, the overall rates are capped at a maximum level."
416;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
417;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-10-29T23:32:54Z;Outlook is bleak, say US chief finance chiefs;;The unfolding credit crisis has taken its toll on corporate America’s finance chiefs, whose confidence in both the economy and their own companies’ outlook plunged in the past quarter, according to a survey.Wall Street’s woes have slowed the pace of economic growth in the US and abroad, forcing chief financial officers to contend with falling demand for goods and services, limited financing options and unprecedented turbulence in the world’s markets. The CFO Optimism Index for the US economy slipped 7.19 points, its steepest ever decline, to 41.73. The poll, conducted by Financial Executives International and Baruch College, also showed that chief financial officers’ outlook for their employers dropped to a record low of 61.74.“The severity of it took everyone by surprise,” said Cheryl de Mesa Graziano, vice-president of research and operations at FEI.Two-thirds of the 290 CFOs polled predict they will find it even more difficult to tap the credit markets in the next six months. Bracing for a prolonged slowdown, they now plan to slash spending in the next year on capital investments, inventory, technology and new hires.The survey’s findings mirror the sentiments of many US companies’ customers – consumer confidence also slumped to its lowest level on record this month – and may not come as a surprise to the many investors who dialled into earnings conference calls hosted by some of the nation’s economic bellwethers.“The developed economies of North America, Europe and Japan are already struggling in many of the industries we serve in these regions,” James Owens, chief executive of Caterpillar, a manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, said during a call with analysts. “In fact we expect that next year will be the third year of significant decline in the US market.”Kurt Kuehn, finance chief at United Parcel Service, has warned investors that “it will be several more quarters” before any turnround takes hold.“With consumer confidence approaching new lows, we are concerned that Santa’s sleigh may be a bit lighter than usual this year,” Mr Kuehn said during UPS’s call.Almost three-quarters of finance chiefs surveyed by FEI and Baruch agreed with the steps the US government has taken to bail out institutions such as American International Group and Bear Stearns, and restore confidence in the nation’s banking system.More than half gave Treasury secretary Hank Paulson at least a “B” grade for his performance.Eighty per cent agreed that the government should impose stiffer regulations and oversight of the financial services industry.
418;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-10-27T21:02:42Z;US stocks end down after turbulent day;;US stocks swung violently between losses and gains in another volatile session on Monday although heightened fears of global recession ultimately trumped relatively upbeat housing market data.After another sharp redemption driven sell-off in the final few minutes of trading, the S&P 500 closed down 3.2 per cent at 848.92 points. The Nasdaq Composite index was 3 per cent lower at 1,505.90 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.4 per cent at 8,175.77.Energy stocks were the biggest laggard, under pressure from oil’s fall to a fresh low for the year, down 5.7 per cent overall. ExxonMobil and Chevron, which report results later in the week, lost 4.3 per cent to $66.09 and 3.4 per cent to $61.71, respectively.Among the industrials, Caterpillar lost 1.6 per cent to $32.78, after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “hold”.General Motors shed another 8.4 per cent to $5.45 after Moody’s downgraded its rating on the motor group.Meanwhile, reports emerged that the government was considering providing financial assistance in a possible merger between GM and Chrysler. Separate reports, however, suggested aid could be limited in a McCain administration.Technology came under pressure on reports that tech financing defaults rose sharply this year, down 2.5 per cent overall. IBM and Oracle fell 3 per cent to $79.66 and 2.7 per cent to $15.77, respectively.The market’s decline came as interest rate futures priced in total certainty that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, edged up 0.6 per cent, indicating continued signs of extreme distress.Elsewhere, Lowe’s fell 2 per cent to $16.85 after the diversified conglomerate’s third-quarter earnings slid into the red, hit by losses at its CNA insurance division, in which Lowe’s said it would inject $1.25bn.The market had clung on to positive territory for much of the day and rose as much as 1.9 per cent after figures showed an unexpected rise in sales of new single-family homes, which were lifted as prices hit a four-year low. Housebuilders were buoyed by the news but later retreated along with the wider market, down 3.3 per cent overall. Morgan Stanley said the housing market was helped briefly in September by the Treasury’s move to provide mortgage finance assistance.Elsewhere in property, CB Richard Ellis – hard hit in recent sessions – rose 4.7 per cent to $4.64 after William Blair upgraded its recommendation on the real estate services group to “outperform”.Among more institutions that accepted government cash under its banking recapitalisation programme, Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financia jumped 5 per cent to $8.47 and 11.3 per cent to $9.95, respectively, and were among the biggest winners in the S&P. The regional banking index was 1.6 per cent higher.Earlier in the session, sentiment was helped as further details emerged of the vast series of measures to help the banking sector. The Federal Reserve began buying the debt under its plan to shore up the commercial paper market.“We are starting to see the initial signs of a thaw [in credit markets], but it is going to take some time,” said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at The Hartford.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs lost 7.5 per cent to $92.88 after the Financial Times reported that its chief executive last month sought tie-up talks with Citigroup. Citi fell 3.4 per cent to $11.73.Telecoms was the only sector to find positive territory, up 1.6 per cent overall. It was helped by well received third-quarter results from Verizon Communications, which soared 10.1 per cent to $27.61.Analysts were divided as to how much attention investors were paying to company results amid unprecedented market volatility.Merrill Lynch wrote in a note to clients: “Emotions remain the primary driver of recent stock market performance, in our opinion. As a result, we believe fundamentals are being cast aside by investors.”
419;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-10-21T22:14:49Z;Caterpillar wriggles;;A caterpillar hitting the ground running would be an impressive sight. But that is exactly what the biggest maker of bulldozers says it wants to do when global growth picks up again. That raises two questions. The first is exactly when Caterpillar’s management thinks a recovery will begin. Second is whether being primed for the first signs of growth means the company is late cutting costs if the downturn lasts longer than expected. The answers to both were revealed at Caterpillar’s third-quarter results yesterday. (Given the group’s sensitivity to everything from mining to construction, the presentation sounded more like a lecture by the International Monetary Fund.) Caterpillar expects world economic growth to fall to less than 2.5 per cent in 2009 from 3.8 per cent last year, with emerging countries contributing more and the developed world less. Still, demand is expected to pick up again towards the end of next year.Surely that rules out pushing the nuclear cost-cutting button now. In addition, Caterpillar believes the dramatic fall in commodity prices will not hurt sales to mining companies. It is true that there is an order backlog for large trucks, for example. But Caterpillar is wrong to be optimistic just because miners were investing at even lower commodity prices before. Sure, it pays for many producers to keep spending, but just as rising input costs caused Caterpillar’s own net profits to fall 6.4 per cent year on year, many miners are now operating at prices below their marginal costs. When that happens for long, capital expenditure plans are trashed. Caterpillar’s share price has halved since April, trading on 6.5 times forward earnings. That is a fair bet for investors who back management to deliver flat sales for next year. But if the recession lasts longer than hoped, or commodity prices continue to fall, Caterpillar may have dug itself into a hole.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

420;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-10-21T20:59:11Z;Poor earnings reports unsettle Wall Street;;A glut of poor corporate earnings and warnings of reduced profitability next year overshadowed a further improvement in money markets and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 closed down 3.1 per cent at 955.05 on what was nevertheless a relatively calm day following last week’s near-unprecedented volatility. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 4.1 per cent lower at 1,696.68, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5 per cent at 9,033.66.Downbeat figures from corporations in the industrial and technology as well as financial sectors demonstrated the toll that the credit crisis had already taken on profitability. Still, traders were more concerned by the generally downbeat mood among companies for the coming year.The technology sector was the biggest drag on the market, down 5.6 per cent overall. Texas Instruments fell 6.3 per cent to $16.85 after it disclosed worse-than-expected results after the bell on Monday.Sun Microsystems and Logitech sustained some of the heaviest losses, down 17.5 per cent to $4.77 and 15 per cent to $15.53, respectively, after updates indicated a downbeat outlook.Apple and Yahoolost 7.1 per cent to $91.49 and 6.1 per cent to $12.07 ahead of results due after the bell.Oracle was one of the few bright spots on plans for an $8bn share buyback but later fell back to stand 2.6 per cent lower at $17.69.A drop in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold profit, which lost 10.8 per cent at $32.74, also put downward pressure on materials, which stood 5.7 lower overall. AK Steel retreated 7.6 per cent to $13.96 after the group said prices would be down about 10 per cent towards the end of the year.DuPont lost 8 per cent to $33.28 after the chemicals company cut its full-year forecast.Lockheed Martin fell 9.7 per cent to $84.19 after the defence group reduced its guidance for next year on concerns of reduced military spending by the new administration.Caterpillar fell 5 per cent to $38.87 after the manufacturer reiterated its 2008 forecast but predicted no rise in revenues next year.However, some in the market downplayed the significance of earnings and argued developments in credit markets would remain centre stage“Earnings are going to be some what meaningless [this quarter],” said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial, who added that some signs in the credit markets were relatively reassuring.The Federal Reserve yesterday launched a new facility to restore liquidity for money market mutual funds and rates for inter-bank lending eased further.The regional banking sector, which stood 0.7 per cent higher, overcame a slew of grim results and was lifted into positive territory by plans to join the government’s $250bn recapitalisation scheme.For example, Regions Financial gained 6.1 per cent to $11.29 even though its earnings from continuing operations fell 76 per cent in the third quarter missing analyst forecasts.On the downside, Western Union sank 17.8 per cent to $16.75 after the group warned undershot Wall Street expectations and warned it could no longer forecast long-term profits.American Express, after the closing bell on Monday, reported a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings that nonetheless beat analyst forecasts. The shares rallied 8.4 per cent to $26.39 yesterday.Also bucking the downward trend, Pfizer was flat at $17.34 after the drug group’s results beat Wall Street’s expectations. 3M rose 4.4 per cent to $60.04, also on the back of well received figures.Energy stocks were also hit as crude fell on fears of a global recession. The sector overall stood 4.3 per cent lower.Meanwhile, Standard & Poor’s cut the expected 2008 dividend payment for the S&P 500 from $28.85 to $28.05, the lowest growth rate since 2001.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s ”fear gauge”, rose 1.1 per cent. At 53.253, it continued to indicate heightened distress.The fresh market decline came as it emerged that investor confidence plummeted last month, according to State Street research.
421;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-10-17T20:44:04Z;Wall Street ends in red in volatile session;;A wild week for Wall Street stocks that saw their biggest gain since the Depression and worst sell-off since 1987 drew to a close with another highly volatile session that ended in the red.Relatively upbeat earnings and a further easing of strain in money markets failed in the end to outweigh a fresh batch of gloomy economic data and renewed concerns over the health of some financial institutions.The market swung between gains of as much as 4 per cent and losses that hit 2.9 per cent as last month’s options and futures expired.Big name financials including Metlife and State Street endured heavy losses towards Friday’s close and finished down 9.2 per cent at $31.14 and 9.6 per cent at $40.76 respectively.Housebuilders, home furnishers and real estate services were among the key losers on Friday from grim construction and building permit data. DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. However, it finished the week down 1.2 per cent at 69.45.Technology stocks were down after three companies in the sector reported better than expected results after the bell on Thursday.Google rose 5.5 per cent to $372.54 after the internet search group’s profits surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis. Advanced Micro Devices and IBM added 2.2 per cent to $4.21 and lost 0.8 per cent at $90.78 after both surprised Wall Street with third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations.Aerospace and defence stocks fell after Honeywell trimmed its guidance for the rest of the year. The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.
422;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-10-01T20:40:32Z;Economic data add to Wall Street gloom;;Another volatile session for US stocks ended in the red as anxiety over paralysis in money markets and a Senate vote on the revised $700bn banking sector rescue package dwarfed even General Electric’s dramatic $15bn capital raising.GE led the declines on the Dow Jones Industrial Average early in the session as its credit default swaps widened. Yet the conglomerate later pared those losses to stand 5.2 per cent lower at $24.18 after it emerged that Warren Buffett would make a $3bn investment.Glum macroeconomic data underlined the parlous state of the US economy, although traders said that the prospect of a vast government intervention to stave off financial collapse took precedence over all other developments.“All these things normally the market would care about,” said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at Voyageur Asset Management. Now, he added, “we care [only] as much as it takes to read a headline”. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.2 per cent but later clawed back to close 0.5 per cent lower at 1,161.06, ahead of the Senate vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent at 10,831.07 while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.1 per cent at 2,069.40.Still, the moves were tame by recent eye-popping comparison. Stocks’ biggest rally for six years in the previous session followed their biggest sell-off for more than twenty.Industrials, down 2.6 per cent, led the market declines after a gauge of manufacturing activity – the economy’s silver lining this year – contracted further in September, falling to its lowest level since October 2001. The level is historically associated with a recession in the broader economy.Caterpillar and Honeywell lost 4.5 per cent at $56.95 and $39.68 respectively.A slew of other economic data – from job losses to mortgage applications – also hurt sentiment.Meanwhile, an oil price decline afforded the automotive sector scant comfort. Nor did news that President Bush had approved a $25bn package to help the sector. Ford sank 12.5 per cent to $4.55 after warning that US sales fell 34.6 per cent in September, to its weakest level of the year. It also said second-half profit at its European unit would be hit by falling demand and rising raw material costs.General Motors fell as much as 4.76 per cent but later recovered to stand 0.2 per cent higher at $9.47. Light vehicle sales fell 16 per cent in September.Financials and consumer staples, were the only sectors to enjoy rises of more than 1 per cent. Telecoms and utilities also inched into positive territory.Regional banks continued their recovery from Monday’s brutal sell-off. National City and Fifth Third leapt 65.1 per cent at $2.89 and 16.1 per cent at $13.82 respectively, the former helped by takeover speculation.Citigroup rose 12.1 per cent to $23.Energy stocks, which rallied in the previous session, lost 1.7 per cent as oil prices fell. Peabody Energy led the declines, down 8.8 per cent at $41.05.Airlines soared as crude-oil prices fell below $100. Delta Airlines, for example, added 14.8 per cent at $8.55.Among technology stocks, down 2.2 per cent, IBM was particularly hard hit. It fell 5.8 per cent at $110.13 on fears that the Dow component may have missed its third quarter profit targets.Elsewhere, Boston Scientific and Medtronic fell 7.6 per cent to $11.34 and inched down 0.2 per cent to $49.83 respectively after a court ruled that the pair had to pay $629m in interest to Johnson & Johnson down 2.2 per cent at $67.79. That took its total award in an 11-year patent case to $1.2bn.Ingersoll-Rand and Parker Hannifin fell 5.5 per cent to $29.46 and 3.6 per cent to $51.09 after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the two groups from “buy” to hold”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the fear gauge, inched up 0.5 per cent to 39.59, indicating extremely high levels of distress.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 1.5 per cent.

423;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-09-24T01:47:06Z;Caterpillar sells $1.3bn bonds;;The financial arm of Caterpillar on Tuesday raised $1.3bn in the first large corporate bond sale since the credit markets froze last week.Corporate financing was expected to pick up in September, but new issuance vanished as liquidity dried up with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the near-collapse of insurer AIG and concern about the future of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.The sale is a step toward reopening the market, but Caterpillar had to offer high yields to raise funding. While capital may be available again, it is expensive, even for healthy companies.“It says that companies with reasonably successful businesses can still access capital at a price,” said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management.The deal, which was oversubscribed, was purchased mostly by US investors. Caterpillar is well known in the debt markets and considered to be a safe, steady company which, along with high yields, contributed to the demand.“I would be surprised if we didn’t see a number of issuers following,” said a person familiar with the transaction. “A lot of people were nervous about being first.”Caterpillar sold $750m of five-year notes with a risk premium, or spread to comparable Treasury bonds, of 320 basis points and $550m of 10-year debt at 325bps over Treasuries. That translates to yields of more than 6 and 7 per cent, respectively.Just last month, the company, which makes construction and mining equipment, paid just 175bps over Treasuries to raise $300m of five year notes.At $1.3bn, the bond sale is Caterpillar’s largest ever, according to Dealogic. Barclays Capital, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were lead underwriters on the deal.Liquidity began to dry up in the corporate bond market this summer as banks, nursing huge credit-related losses, pulled back on holding inventories of bonds.

Lehman Brothers rose 6.8 per cent to $16.20.Amid the positive momentum, Bank of America overturned early losses. The shares rose 5.3 per cent to $32.23 even though the bank said it was ready to settle federal and state probes into the marketing of auction-rate securities.AIG also put on 5.3 per cent to $22.34 even after Morgan Stanley said the largest US insurer could need to raise $15bn to cushion further housing-related losses.On Friday, the spike in the jobless rate, which has reached 6.1 per cent, conspired with a rise in the home foreclosures to drag markets further into bear market territory.By the close, the S&P 500 was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,242.31. The Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent at 2,255.88, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent lower at 11,220.96.The modest recovery on Friday brought to an end a volatile holiday-shortened week during which the the S&P 500 fell 3.2 per cent as fears returned about the health of the global economy. That was the index’s third weekly drop and its biggest loss since February.Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at ChannelCapitalResearch.com, said the unpredictable events of the week had shown investors were “alternating between euphoria and depression”.Selling was widespread, though sectors and companies most exposed to the prospect of a global slowdown were particularly badly hit. Industrials, materials and technology fell 3.9 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively.Among industrials, Terex was a big faller after the maker of construction and mining equipment cut its sales and profits forecast for the year. Its shares fell 23.8 per cent to $38.31 over the week. Caterpillar fell 9.4 per cent to $64.07.In materials, steel stocks were shunned as Goldman Sachs issued a bearish outlook on the sector in a wide-ranging note. US Steel fell 14.6 per cent to $113.61. AK Steel declined 22.8 per cent to $40.63.The technology sector took more blows on Friday after Nokia warned on its market share outlook. Jabil Circuit and Adobe Systems lost 5.4 per cent to $13.31 and 3 per cent to $40.91 respectively.But the sector pared its losses as investors bought back into heavily sold semiconductor stocks, which rose 0.9 per cent.For the week, Dell was among the worst performers, down 6.1 per cent at $20.41, although it clawed back some ground after reports said it was looking to sell some or all of its PC manufacturing plants in a cost-cutting move.Companies in the energy sector also took hits after the oil price lost about 8 per cent over the week. BJ Services and Hess fell 15 per cent to $22.83 and 12.7 per cent to $91.44 respectively.However, that gave respite to battered airlines stocks, such as UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, which rose 10.7 per cent at $12.30.Retailers were shunned after several suffered sluggish sales over the crucial back-to-school period. Abercrombie & Fitch continued its slide yesterday after Citigroup downgraded its recommendation on the stock to “sell”. The shares lost 4.9 per cent to $48.47.Deal news provided one of the few positive developments. SanDisk climbed 29.1 per cent to $17.37 after Samsung Electronics said it was considering a purchase of the memory-card maker.However, Safeway fell 3.9 per cent to $26.15, after Morgan Stanley cut the supermarket chain to “underweight”.

American Express fell 5.3 per cent to $38.75 after Lehman Brothers forecast net charge-offs – a measure of uncollectable debts – on its cards would reach to 8.5 per cent of loans by next year.Capital One Financial fell 5.1 per cent to $43.33 after the investment bank cut its price target from $57 to $46.The decline took in the biggest names in corporate America, such as Lehman Brothers, which dropped 10.5 per cent to $15.17 as investors worried about its ability to raise capital ahead of expected poor earnings and writedowns at the end of the month.Bank of America slipped 7.2 per cent to $30.60 as options traders placed bets it would lose almost a quarter of its value by late autumn.Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch dropped 7.5 per cent to $26.21 after reports suggested talks to sell bad loans to Korea Asset Management Corp faced a deadlock.The wider market slumped, falling for the fourth straight session after an unexpected jump in initial jobless claims and sluggish back-to-school retail sales revived concerns about the health of the economy.By the close in New York, each of the 10 industry groups were down more than 1 per cent. The S&P 500, down 3 per cent at 1,236.83, had its biggest one-day fall since early June.The Nasdaq Composite was down 3.2 per cent at 2,2259.04, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3 per cent lower at 11,188.23.“It’s definitely ugly, that’s for sure,” said Matt King, chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors.The market decline was wide-ranging and took in stocks seen as traditionally defensive. Wal-Mart was one of the only exceptions as down-trading consumers allowed the discounter to escape a retail decline.Same-store sales beat expectations, helping the shares hold steady at $59.78.The retail decline was led by TJX Companies, down 7.4 per cent at $34.07, Abercrombie & Fitch, which lost 6.8 per cent to $50.99, Limited Brands down 6.2 per cent to $20.70, and Nordstrom, down 4 per cent at $31.99.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said: “Back-to-school selling was sluggish [during] the first three weeks of August and picked up some toward the end of the month as consumers are shopping closer to need.”The downward momentum swamped news of improved productivity in the second quarter.Industrials and materials each fell more than 3 per cent. Terex, the maker of construction and mining equipment, was one of the biggest casualties, after cutting its sales and profits forecast for the year. The shares tumbled 19.7 per cent to $38.02.Caterpillar was another key laggard, down 5.6 per cent at $63.94.Steel stocks were shunned after Goldman Sachs issued a more bearish outlook on the sector in a wide-ranging sector note. It said: “A rising US dollar, ‘China fear’ and sharply falling scrap prices have shaken investor confidence in [the] sustainability of [the] steel cycle.”AK Steel shed 11.1 per cent to $40.84, Allegheny Technologies dipped 4.5 per cent to $44.18 and US Steel fell 5.1 per cent to $112.67.Technology stocks – which led Wall Street lower the previous day – endured another decline.Ciena dropped 24.9 per cent to $13.09 after the network equipment maker warned that fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than expected.Oracle fell 6 per cent to $19.93 after a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that its chief executive had failed to turn over evidence that may have proved relevant in a shareholder lawsuit against the company.Microsoft eased 2 per cent to $26.35 after saying it would cut the price of its Xbox 360 console, in the face of competition from Nintendo’s Wii and Sony’s PlayStation 3.Housebuilders were also among the casualties.Hovnanian Enterprises reported its eighth consecutive quarterly loss after nine years of gains, pushing the shares down 17.4 per cent to $6.40.

Citigroup cut its full-year 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for JPMorgan, among others, while Merrill Lynch downgraded the shares of Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.JPMorgan shares fell 2.7 per cent to $36.91, Lehman dropped 4 per cent to $15.57, while Goldman gave up 1.4 per cent to $164.90 and Morgan dropped 5.5 per cent to $40.15.On Wednesday, the financial sector slid 3 per cent with Bank of America and Citigroup coming under selling pressure. The pair lost 7.2 per cent to $28.86 and 3.9 per cent to $17.81 respectively.“We continue to believe that investors are significantly underestimating both the scope and the extent of the credit bubble and the consequences of its subsequent deflation,” said Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch.“The problems in the financial sector appear to us to be far from over, and we are sceptical that trying to bottom-fish will prove to be profitable.”Observers suggested that the sector might remain under pressure in the short term after the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed a rule limiting certain types of short-selling in a handful of stocks to expire on Tuesday.In earnings news, Deere, the maker of farm equipment, said third-quarter profits rose 7.1 per cent to $575.2m thanks to strong demand for tractors and combines.But the results missed analysts estimates and the shares fell 3.2 per cent to $67.10. The news dragged on peers. Caterpillar dipped 2.8 per cent to $69.83, Boeing fell 2.5 per cent to $64.26 and the industrial sector as a whole declined 0.8 per cent.There was better news from the technology sector.Applied Materials, the maker of semiconductor machinery, projected that orders would increase between 5-10 per cent in the fourth quarter. That was better than expected and the shares rose 4.7 per cent to $19.33.Meanwhile, Nvidia, the maker of computer graphics chips, jumped 10.7 per cent to $12.26 after the company said it would buy back an additional $1bn of shares, bringing the projected total repurchase to about 44 per cent of all outstanding shares.Equity markets pared early losses but by the close, seven of the 10 leading industry groups were still in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent to 1,285.83. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.9 per cent to 11,532.96, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.1 per cent to 2,428.62.Consumer-facing stocks were in focus as oil prices ticked more than $3 a barrel higher, a number of retailers reported disappointing results and new data showed weak retail sales in July.Liz Claiborne, the women’s apparel retailer, was among the biggest fallers after it reported a substantial second-quarter loss and lowered its full year forecast. The shares slid 11.6 per cent to $13.18.Retailers and the broader consumer discretionary sector also took some direction from a Commerce Department report on July retail sales. The survey showed that sales fell 0.1 per cent last month. That is the first headline dip in five months and will be seen as evidence that the impact of the stimulus cheques is waning.McDonald’s fell 1.8 per cent to $62.78 and Wal-Mart Stores lost 1.9 per cent to $57.88 while the consumer discretionary and staples sectors gave up 1.6 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.Energy and material stocks were among the few consistent gainers throughout the day. Energy added 3.4 per cent, snapping a four-day losing streak, and materials climbed 2.4 per cent as heavily sold coal and metals stocks rebounded.Peabody Energy and Massey Energy rose 8.3 per cent to $58.85 and 7.8 per cent to $61 respectively while US Steel and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 6.2 per cent to $137.92 and 5.8 per cent to $88.50 respectively.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research, upgraded the energy sector to “overweight” arguing that “from a technical perspective, S&P believes the correction in oil prices from the recent high of $147 to below $115 is largely over.”
427;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Oh Deere;;It is not often that a company reports record results only to see its share price plummet. In spite of its management predicting sales will be up by a fifth in 2008, John Deere’s third quarter numbers were greeted with disdain on Wednesday. Its stock dropped 6 per cent and is now down by almost a third from its April peak, underperforming a falling capital equipment sector.The problem is not a failure to sell new combine harvesters. Their pockets full thanks to booming agricultural commodity prices, farmers around the world are splashing out on new equipment. Sales to South America are growing at a tremendous pace – up about 40 per cent on the year before. Expectations for strong harvests have prompted crop prices to fall recently, but agricultural incomes remain high.However, cost increases for raw materials such as steel, first highlighted back in May, are proving tough to absorb. John Deere hopes to push through price rises sufficient to restore profitability levels, but doing so without deterring buyers will be difficult, doubly so if the dollar continues to recover some poise. Dollar weakness has been worth about 5 percentage points worth of sales growth this year, or a quarter of expected overall growth.Meanwhile, Deere is the second-largest maker of construction equipment in the US, behind Caterpillar. The decline in revenues for this business is accelerating as property markets falter, crushing margins. With peers reporting downward pressure on prices for small and mid-size equipment, ambitions to push them higher in the new year seem optimistic. At the same time the group’s small financing business reported the now familiar refrain of higher provisions for credit losses.Analysts’ estimates, having climbed strongly for much of the last three years, have now plateaued. But with crop prices moderating, and US construction moribund, the expectation must be that those numbers are due for the chop.Post and read comments on this Lex
428;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Wall Street falls as GDP figures disappoint;;Wall Street stocks fell for the first time in three sessions on Thursday as investors digested disappointing macro-economic data that showed improved but weaker-than-expected growth and rising unemployment.According to the Department of Commerce, the US economy grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the second quarter – faster than earlier in the year but slower than economists were expecting.Heavy goods manufacturers Deere, Caterpillar and General Electric fell 4.5 per cent to $70.16, 3.5 per cent to $69.52, and 2.4 per cent to $28.29, respectively. The industrials sector as a whole dropped 2.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment benefit last week jumped by the most in five years. That bodes ill for the key payrolls report due on Friday.A $2 drop in the oil price helped contain losses for much of the session but stocks slid to their lowest levels of the day at the close.Nine of the ten leading industry groups lost ground, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.3 per cent to 1,267.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 11,378.02, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2 per cent to 2,325.39.Over a volatile month, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, paring early losses as government measures to backstop the mortgage groups, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped to restore confidence to the financial sector.“After coming in like a Lion, July went out like a lamb,” said Alec Young, equity strategist at S&P, pointing to rock-bottom sentiment, a drop in oil prices and second-quarter earnings that were not as bad as expected as additional reasons for the market recovery.The financials were the biggest monthly gainers, adding 6.8 per cent after a roller-coaster ride that saw them down as much as 15 per cent and up as much as 10 per cent.Consumer staples, healthcare and industrials also made solid gains of 3.3 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, as investors moved into defensive sectors and dropped from early-year winners. Energy stocks, for example, dropped 14 per cent.Nonetheless, Mr Young is cautious. “While these positives have helped the market find a short-term floor at 1,200 on the S&P 500, we think its ability to . . . build upward momentum will be driven by the second-half macro-economic outlook and its implications for corporate profit,” he said. “With so many wildcards still in play, we expect equity markets to remain choppy.”The macro-economic data overshadowed another handful of mixed earnings reports.In the technology sector, Symantec and Motorola made ground after posting a better-than-anticipated forecast and a surprise profit, respectively.Symantec added 7 per cent to $21.07 while Motorola jumped 12.5 per cent to $8.64.That news helped offset decent results from Visa and Mastercard, which nevertheless left investors underwhelmed. Visa shares, which have jumped about 65 per cent since the company went public in March, fell 6.9 per cent to $73.06. Mastercard shares slid 9.8 per cent to $244.15.In the consumer discretionary sector, Starbucks posted its first loss in 16 years though the shares advanced 0.1 per cent to $14.69 after it reaffirmed its 2009 full-year forecasts.Energy was the worst performer, dropping 3.4 per cent after some disappointing results from ExxonMobil and Consol Energy. Exxon fell 4.7 per cent to $80.43 while Consol Energy slid 15.9 per cent to $74.39.Financials were another weak spot, falling 1.3 per cent. Wells Fargo lost 3 per cent to $30.27, JPMorgan slipped 2.3 per cent to $40.63 and Bank of America dipped 2.1 per cent to $32.90.Healthcare was the only sector to make consistent progress throughout the day, climbing 0.3 per cent.Aetna, the health insurer, led the way after it said profit had risen 6.5 per cent to $480.5m as the company added members. Aetna stood by its full-year profit forecast and the shares rose 1.7 per cent to $41.01.ImClone Systems surged 37.7 per cent to $63.93 after Bristol-Myers Squibb offered to buy the part of the company that it does not yet own for $4.3bn. Bristol slipped 1.8 per cent to $21.12.
429;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
430;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Commodities boom lifts Caterpillar to record;;On track: Caterpillar has racked up record profits and is raising its outlook for revenues this year fuelled by the commodity boomCaterpillar, the largest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, brushed off the US downturn on Tuesday by announcing record profits for the second quarter and raising its outlook for revenues the year.Trucking and construction – the sectors in which the Illinois-based manufacturer operates – are widely seen as barometers of US economic health. Caterpillar was one of the first big US companies to warn last October that the economy was entering a recession.The global commodity boom continues to drive strong growth in the energy and mining sectors. The company’s ability to ride out turbulence in the US also indicates the strength of demand in emerging economies and demonstrates how the weak dollar is benefiting US exporters.Profit in the second quarter was $1.1bn, or $1.74 per share, up from $823m, or $1.24 per share, in the same period last year, largely because of improved price realisation and higher sales volumes.Revenue increased by 20 per cent to $13.6bn. Analysts had expected earnings per share of about $1.54 on revenues of $12.7bn.“Never in my 35-plus years with the company have I seen Caterpillar do so well in the face of such a difficult economic climate in the United States,” said Jim Owens, chief executive.“We are on track to deliver our fifth straight year of record profits despite very tough conditions in the US, declines in Europe and significantly higher material costs, particularly in the second half of the year.”For many of the company’s products, however, supply was “very tight”, he said. “We are producing as much as we can.”In June Caterpillar had announced capacity expansions in the US, China and India, Mr Owens said. “We need to bring additional capacity on line to support world demand for infrastructure, energy and mining, and to be prepared for the upturn [in the US] when it comes.”The results showed Caterpillar’s continuing transformation into a global company. Sales outside North America had risen 30 per cent in the quarter. International sales accounted for 60 per cent of total sales, up from 55 per cent in the quarter last year.US sales, in contrast, rose just 7 per cent as the construction sector continued to suffer.Caterpillar raised its estimate of revenues for this year to $50bn, up from $47.2bn-$49.5bn. It expected earnings per share for the full year to be about $6, up from $5.91, the mid-point of the forecast it gave in May.Its shares were up 2.4 per cent at $74.99 after trading as high as $75.87 earlier in the day in New York.
431;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-07-07T21:00:50Z;Pessimism in US over prospects for growth;;"Nearly 80 per cent of senior executives at small and medium-size US manufacturing companies are pessimistic about the prospects for economic growth, according to a survey to be published on Wednesday. Attitudes within the sector towards the benefits of globalisation have also deteriorated markedly since last year.The report by RSM McGladrey, the consultancy, suggests the outlook for the US economy may be even gloomier than expected. Manufacturing has so far held up better than the service sector: US manufacturers defied bearish forecasts last month by boosting production for the first time since January, the Institute for Supply Management said last week.Much of this was down to the resilience of companies that employ fewer than 2,000 workers. They account for about 40 per cent of US manufacturing production and make up 99 per cent of the country’s manu­facturers, according to the National Association of
Manufacturers.However, the McGladrey report suggests the sector is bracing for worsening conditions. Fewer than 40 per cent of respondents said their businesses were “thriving and growing” – down by 10 per cent from last year and 19 per cent from 2006. Meanwhile, the proportion who said their businesses were “declining” has tripled in the past two years.Worryingly, the report indicates that small and mid-size manufacturers are retreating from the global economy just as large manufacturers, such as General Electric, Caterpillar and Deere, have offset falling sales at home by increasing market share internationally on the back of growth in emerging economies and the weak dollar.More than half of the senior executives surveyed – up 10 per cent from 2007 – said globalisation had neither lowered their costs nor improved their margins, while the proportion of respondents moving production or services offshore had declined by 20 per cent during the past year.“The global playing field is different today than it was even a year ago,” said Tom Murphy, the report’s main author. “The savings you generate by producing products with lower labour costs are more than eaten up by the higher energy costs to transport it back to the US.”Nevertheless, those companies with a global strategy reported on average a 4 per cent higher gross margin.The report also indicates the mood towards mergers and acquisitions has soured, with only 15 per cent of respondents relying on mergers or acquisitions of another business as a growth strategy, down from 37 per cent last year."
432;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-07-02T18:48:46Z;Three killed in Jerusalem bus attack;;At least three Israelis were killed and several dozen injured when a Palestinian worker deliberately smashed a giant bulldozer into cars and buses on one of Jerusalem’s busiest streets on Wednesday, squashing both people and vehicles beneath him.The man, a worker on a nearby construction site, was shot dead by a police officer as he drove the machine towards Jerusalem’s main market. Israeli officials and a police spokesman described the man as a ”terrorist”, and three Palestinian militant groups claimed responsibility for the attack.However, the groups’ claims could not be verified, and Dudi Cohen, the police commissioner, described the attack as a ”spontaneous” act. The perpetrator was identified as a man from Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem. Palestinians living in the city’s eastern neighbourhoods are free to travel and work inside Israel, unlike their counterparts in the West Bank and Gaza.According to several eyewitnesses at the site, the bulldozer slammed into a public bus several times before overturning it with its passengers still trapped inside. The attacker then careered into a silver Toyota, killing the female driver inside, before running over another car and flattening it into a block of twisted metal. As the bulldozer came to rest on top of his last victim, a police officer scrambled aboard the driver’s cabin and fired his gun at point-blank range several times.”One car was able to get out of the way,” said Shai Rachmanov, who watched the scene from a coffee house a few metres from the site. ”But this one [the silver Toyota] was not able to get away and was crushed.”The attack took place on Jaffa Road, one of the main shopping streets in West Jerusalem, just a few hundred metres from the city’s main food market. It marked the second lethal attack by a Palestinian from East Jerusalem this year, following the deadly shooting inside a Jewish religious school in March that claimed the lives of eight students and the attacker himself.Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, said in a statement that it had nothing to do with Wednesday’s killings, but described the rampage as a ”natural reaction to the daily aggression and crimes committed against our people”.
433;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-06-12T18:54:36Z;Caterpillar to quit US engine market;;The shake-up in the global truck industry took another step forward on Thursday, as Caterpillar announced its withdrawal as a supplier of engines to US truck makers and said it would pursue a global joint venture with Navistar International.The two companies plan to produce medium and heavy-duty commercial trucks outside North America. But Caterpillar will in future focus its North American truck business on the joint development of a “severe service” off-highway vehicle used for road construction, large infrastructure projects and oil development.Questions have hung over Caterpillar’s North American truck-engine business for some time. Its market share has declined and one of its biggest customers, Paccar, builder of the Peterbilt and Kenworth brands, is currently building its own engine plant in Mississippi.The slowing US economy has severely dented demand for new trucks, and truck makers face heavy investments to comply with tighter US diesel emission regulations that take effect in 2010.Caterpillar does not disclose engine sales volumes. Sales to truck makers made up 9 per cent of its worldwide total last year, behind industrial, power-generation, oilfield and marine users. Caterpillar also produces engines for its own construction and mining equipment.Caterpillar’s planned withdrawal from the US on-highway truck market boosted shares of Cummins, one of its chief rivals, by 14 per cent in early trading on Thursday.Navistar said that the joint venture would combine its expertise in truck design, development and manufacturing, with Caterpillar’s 4,700 distributors around the world.Navistar has a significant presence in Mexico, Chile and South Africa, as well as a manufacturing joint venture with India’s Mahindra & Mahindra. But it has lacked resources to expand into other parts of the world.The latest deal “allows us to reach the entire world using Caterpillar’s distribution base”, Dan Ustian, Navistar’s chief executive, said on Thursday. “Maybe China will be the first place”, he added.The two companies have set up teams to assess truck and engine opportunities.Navistar said that the deal with Caterpillar would have no impact on its project with Germany’s MAN to build heavy-duty truck engines at a plant now under construction in Alabama.Volkswagen owns 30 per cent of MAN. Oliver Dixon, a truck-industry consultant, suggested that the German carmaker might at some point consider selling its stake to Caterpillar and Navistar.Caterpillar shares gained 2.7 per cent to $81.06 in early trading. Navistar was almost 4 per cent higher at $74.70.The consolidation of the truck industry is already well advanced in other parts of the world. A prolonged takeover battle for Sweden’s Scania, one of the industry’s most profitable players, ended in March, with Volkwagen buying a stake previously held by the Wallenberg family.
434;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-05-27T18:50:40Z;Pressure builds for green chief at ExxonMobil;;"Nineteen institutional investors, including some of ExxonMobil’s largest shareholders, have said they will support a resolution on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting to split the posts of chairman and chief executive.The shareholders want to appoint a chairman who will invest in technologies to combat climate change.In recent years, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have trumpeted their investments in wind, solar and biofuels. Exxon had remained relatively quiet about its investments until momentum on the proxy measure started to build.Now it is mounting a more spirited defence. Ken Cohen, vice-president of public affairs, told the FT that Exxon would spend more than $100m this year to develop low-emission and alternative-energy technology. The company hopes to make advances in fuel efficiency, carbon capture and biofuels. “We’re looking for the ‘ahas’,’’ Mr Cohen said. “We’re looking for the genius-type breakthroughs.”Over the past five years, according to Mr Cohen, Exxon has spent $2bn to improve its own energy efficiency and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. In the next three years it will commit a further $800m to that effort. It has also spent $200m in the past five years on developing alternative energy technology.Mr Cohen outlined inventions that the company has made in recent years that have benefited the environment. These include an improved inner liner that makes tyres lighter and retain air longer, so cars go farther on a gallon of petrol. Exxon has also developed light plastics for use in automobiles to enable them to use less fuel.The company does not want to invest in areas where government subsidies are required. Corn-based ethanol and current generation solar, for example, are not robust enough to go global and truly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Exxon says.That does not mean it is not hopeful for the future. It is investing in a plastic film that will protect a lithium-ion battery from short-circuiting and overheating when scaled up for use in hybrid and electric cars. The separator film will make such vehicles more efficient and economic when they are deployed in 2009-2010.If just 10 per cent of cars were traded in for hybrid or electric vehicles, that would take 5m cars off the road and save 28m tons of carbon dioxide, according to Pat Brant, chief polymer scientist at Exxon’s chemical company. “We’re going to help make it a reality.”In addition, Exxon is co-operating with Toyota, Caterpillar and others on improving fuel efficiency by 30 per cent; the area of hydrogen generation, which could lead to an 80 per cent improvement in fuel economy; and technology to make carbon capture and storage more affordable and therefore realistic.The company is also working with scientists at Stanford University and others on breakthrough solar and cellulosic technology.Exxon’s critics insist it could be doing more. Between 2007 and 2009, Chevron, which also does not have an independent chairman, plans to spend $2.5bn on alternative and renewable energy technologies and efficiency services.But, as Garfield Miller, chief executive of Aegis Energy Advisors, asks: “Should we be asking Exxon, or anyone, to be an inefficient mutual fund for alternative energy?”"

About 32 per cent of its $45bn (£22.7bn) sales last year came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Caterpillar sponsors a Nascar race team but has no other involvement in sport.Under the terms of the agreement, Caterpillar will become the club’s sole sponsor of the Leicester Tigers playing kit with dominant branding throughout the Welford Road stadium, including the naming rights to the north stand and the members’ lounge.
436;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-05-24T01:12:59Z;Orderly transition as JCB eyes US improvement;;"JCB on Friday signalled a broadening of its management responsibilities, announcing a new chief executive for the group while shifting the incumbent to take charge of its activities in the US.Matthew Taylor, chief operating officer at Britain’s largest maker of construction machines, is stepping up to take the chief executive’s job from John Patterson, who has been in this role since 1998.Mr Patterson – who at 58 is 10 years older than Mr Taylor, and joined JCB in 1971 as a service engineer – is to become chairman and chief executive of the company’s operations in the US, the world’s biggest market for construction machines.The announcements indicate the ambition of Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman and main owner of the company, to lay the foundation for a more sustained period of growth in the US, where JCB has struggled in recent years to compete against much bigger rivals such as Caterpillar and CNH, which is part of Fiat.Acknowledging that JCB is facing “some difficult challenges as we enter a period of economic uncertainty”, Sir Anthony said Mr Patterson would be focusing his attentions on a key market for JCB. The US was the company’s second-biggest after the UK in terms of sales last year, accounting for about a fifth of its revenues of £2.25bn.Mr Patterson said: “JCB has grown substantially in the past few years but we all agree we need to perform better in the US.”Mr Taylor, who joined JCB two years ago from the automotive industry, becomes only the fifth chief executive at the company since its was set up in 1945 by Joe Bamford, Sir Anthony’s father. Over this period, it has emerged as one of the few large UK engineering companies to be strong globally in a key industry, while at the same time remaining family-owned.Now among the world’s six biggest makers of construction equipment such as excavators, the company has 18 factories in six countries, with a particularly strong presence in India and a new plant in China.While Mr Taylor is expected to take over most aspects of the day-to-day running of JCB, the overall direction will continue to be set by Sir Anthony, who is 62 but has shown no sign of wanting to step down or reduce his presence.David Phillips, managing director of Off-Highway Research, a consultancy, said the reshuffle was a “well organised transition” and made “eminent strategic sense”.JCB recently warned of a ”flat” year ahead, reflecting weakening demand in the US and parts of Europe because of credit difficulties spreading from banking to industries such as housing and road construction.………………………………………Taylor builds on shared interestMatthew Taylor, the new chief executive of JCB, joined the company only two years ago but has since passed most tests required by new senior recruits at the business, the main one being the need to get on with Sir Anthony Bamford, JCB’s hard-driving chairman and owner.Mr Taylor started at JCB in a senior sales role and he quickly impressed Sir Anthony, so much so that he was appointed chief operating officer in January last year, essentially the role as number three in the company behind the chairman and John Patterson, chief executive, the man Mr Taylor is now replacing.After a spell in the Royal Navy, Mr Taylor joined Ford in 1985, working mainly in financial positions before becoming head of Ford’s operations in Spain and vice-president of sales and marketing in Australia.In 2000, he returned to the UK, taking up jobs in the parent company and at Land Rover and Jaguar, the leading UK motor industry brands sold recently by Ford to Tata Group of India.Mr Taylor’s last job at Ford was managing director of Land Rover.One of the reasons Sir Anthony gelled with Mr Taylor was a shared interest in the importance of sales and marketing for engineering products.JCB’s owner has also long admired Land Rover and Jaguar; on more than one occasion he has thought about trying to buy them."
437;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-05-01T19:22:21Z;Corporate US faces changing shopping habits;;Corporate America has been dealing with the damage done by the mortgage crisis and resulting credit crunch since last year, with the effects spreading gradually across consumer companies ranging from Tiffany, the jewellers, to Starbucks and General Motors.Yet the economic slowdown has not been bad news for everyone, reflecting both behavioural shifts among US consumers and the advantages enjoyed by those companies that are less reliant on the US domestic market than most of their rivals.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has a mass discount business that is focused on low-income consumers, who have been the hardest hit by rising fuel prices and tightening credit.But its sales have outperformed other mainstream retailers, including the department stores JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s, and Target, its more upmarket discount rival. Its shares have risen more than 30 per cent since October, to hit their highest levels for four years.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, this week offered investors data supporting the view that the retailer was benefiting as more affluent customers were “shopping down”. He said traffic at the hundreds of Wal-Mart stores classed as “affluent” – serving households with incomes in the $55,000-$75,000 range – had increased in March 2.3 percentage points above the average for the entire 3,500 store network.“We are capturing our customers from the more affluent segments,” he said.He noted that Wal-Mart’s customers overall were increasingly using cash, rather than credit. The trend continued even in the run-up to Christmas last year, when the share of credit would traditionally increase.Wal-Mart’s credit receipts in February and March, fell almost 6 per cent, compared with the same period in 2007.“People don’t have as much access to credit as they used to and clearly that is having an impact on how consumers behave,” he said.“This isn’t that people have decided that they can’t spend more, but they have gone beyond their ability to get any more credit . . . they’ve topped out,” he said.Frank Badillo, chief economist at consultants TNS Retail Forward, says there is increasing evidence in the US of shoppers responding differently to economic pressures in their shopping habits. The upper income shoppers are increasingly likely to go to a discounter such as Wal-Mart to buy their preferred brands, while low- and middle-income shoppers opt for store brands that cost less.“The upper income shopper is more likely to stick with brand buys but is more likely to shift shopping channel,” he says.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, suggests that is a factor in the continued strength of its leading brands such as Pampers and Tide.The only other bright spots on the corporate American landscape are those companies with large export markets, which are helped by the weak dollar, and those exposed to booming sectors, such as energy and mining, and emerging markets.In contrast to this week’s warning from Michelin, its European rival, Goodyear, the US tyremaker, reported strong first-quarter profits as the weak dollar boosted exports.Other strong quarterly performance came from Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of bulldozers, and Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, which were also buoyed by strong demand from overseas.Meanwhile, Kraft, the largest US food brand company, is trying to hold on to customers by producing smaller versions of its pizzas and deli meat packages at lower price points – traditionally a tactic used by consumer brands building market share in the developing world.
438;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Asia starts week on a brighter note;;Asia-Pacific shares started the week on a positive note, encouraged by a good end to the week on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 gained 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq rose 2.6 per cent.Sydney was the biggest gainer on Monday, rising over 3 per cent. Shanghai surged as much as 6.8 per cent in opening action after the Chinese authorities said they would slow the flow of previously untraded shares into the market. However, gains shrank rapidly as some investors sold into the sudden rise to lock in profits. The Composite Index closed with a gain of less than 1 per cent, after falling at one stage to a new low for the year, within 0.2 per cent of halving in value since its all-time high hit October 16.The MSCI Asia Pacific index was 2.6 per cent higher at 148.13 by late afternoon, near its highest level in seven weeks.Oil stayed close to its record of $117.05 a barrel in Asian trade, but jumped to a new all-time high of $117.40 in early European trading.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index rose 3.1 per cent to 5,600.30 – its biggest daily gain for nearly a month – with financial shares accounting for about half the rise on optimism that the worst of the subprime-related bad news may be past. Results from Citigroup last week suggested the financial services group had absorbed the worst of the blows from the crisis.National Australia Bank jumped 6.2 per cent to A$29.45, Australia & New Zealand Banking surged 7.2 per cent to A$21.50, and Westpac Banking gained 6.5 per cent to A$23.78.Most of the rest of Sydney’s rise came from the resources sector. Macarthur Coal, one of the world’s largest suppliers of pulverised coal, jumped 14.7 per cent to A$15.20 after saying it had received a takeover approach from an unnamed bidder.BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest miner, rose 3.7 per cent to A$43.99 and Rio Tinto added 3.3 per cent to A$144.55.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 advanced 1.6 per cent to 13,696.55 and the broader Topix index ended 2.1 per cent higher at 1,331.51. The yen was relatively steady but still on the weak side, trading around Y103.55 against the dollar by late afternoon.That helped exporters, as a softer yen boosts demand abroad for their products by making them cheaper. Honda Motor rose 8.8 per cent to Y3,330 and games maker Nintendo gained 6.7 per cent to Y58,700.Sumitomo Trust & Banking jumped 4.8 per cent to Y844 despite saying on Friday that annual profits would probably be 10 per cent lower than estimated. Investors seemed reassured by the bank’s openness in giving details of additional subprime-related losses, which many took to suggest that any further bad news could be limited.Japan Communications surged by 9.8 per cent, or Y4000 – the maximum allowed by exchange rules – to Y44,700 after a newspaper report that it would later this year launch mobile phones using internet-style technology to make calls.Komatsu, one of the world’s biggest makers of earthmoving equipment, gained 7.0 per cent to Y2,995 after US rival Caterpillar reported strong international sales last week, which boosted confidence in the sector.In China, the Shanghai composite index ended 0.7 per cent higher at 3,116.98. Confidence was initially boosted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission saying over the weekend that shareholders selling more than 1 per cent of a company’s shares within a month must do so in a single block trade.The new rule should make it less attractive for investors to release previously untraded shares from earlier flotations and privatisations onto the market when restrictions end later this year.“This will be quite positive for the market,” said Steven Sun, China strategist at HSBC in Hong Kong. Block trades would not be included in calculating the index, he said, but for the index to recover, “the market needs more conviction from the policy makers.”Shanghai has fallen by more than 40 per cent this year. The market is the second worst performer in the region after Vietnam, where shares have fallen 42 per cent since the start of 2008.Jinduicheng Molybdenum rose 2.6 per cent to Rmb20.83 to regain some of the losses made since it made its Shanghai debut last week, when its shares closed at Rmb22.55 – a premium of 36.1 per cent on their offer price.Jinduicheng was just the third company to have an initial public offering in Shanghai so far this year. Other recently floated companies also gained on Monday. China Railway Construction rose 2.8 per cent to Rmb10.57 and China Coal Energy gained 1.5 per cent to Rmb17.09.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed 2.2 per cent higher at 24,721.67. The sub-index of mainland Chinese companies listed in the territory rose 2.7 per cent to 13,015.25.Shares of China Southern Airlines soared as much as 8.9 per cent after the carrier announced it returned to profit in the first quarter of the year, but closed just 2.0 per cent higher at HK$4.59.Shares of two of the mainland’s biggest oil refiners, Sinopec and PetroChina, jumped in Hong Kong after saying the state would pay monthly subsidies to compensate for losses from price controls on fuel while the cost of crude has surged. Sinopec gained 1.8 per cent to HK$7.47 and PetroChina gained 3.3 per cent to HK$10.14.Mongolia Energy, a mineral company, was suspended from trading pending news about a “very substantial disposal transaction”, the company told the stock exchange.In Seoul, the Kospi broke through 1,800 for the first time since early January, rising 1.6 per cent to 1,800.48. That narrows its loss for the year so far to 5.1 per cent. Hynix Semiconductor rose 3.7 per cent to Won29,350 after its chief executive on Friday predicted that prices of memory chips would stabilise this quarter and perhaps rise in the second half of the year. Samsung Electronics, Hynix’s larger rival, rose 1.4 per cent to Won674,000.In India, the Sensex was 1.2 per cent higher at 16,682.98 by mid-afternoon in Mumbai.

Revenue fell by almost half, but that was better than a number of analysts had forecast.During the past year Citigroup shares have lost more than half their value amid a slew of writedowns, but on Friday they clawed back 4.5 per cent to $25.11 and were 7.5 per cent ahead for the week. Other financial stocks rallied on the news. Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent to $38.56 and Lehman Brothers added 4.3 per cent to $45.50. The S&P 500 financials index gained 1.8 per cent on the day and 5.2 per cent for the week.Google also made ground. Overnight, the internet search company delivered revenues and earnings well ahead of estimates for the first quarter thanks to overseas growth. Google surged 20 per cent to $539.41 as a number of analysts significantly raised target prices for the stock, citing the company’s ability to skip past signs of a US slowdown.Stocks eased off their highs towards the close but the benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.8 per cent at 1,390.34 on the day and 4.3 per cent ahead for the week – its best finish since February.The Nasdaq Composite added 2.6 per cent to 2,402.97 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 12,849.36.Positive earnings reports from a number of large US corporations this week helped soothe fears a US economic slowdown would hit profits, sparking a broad-based market rally and sending measures of volatility to their lowest levels this year.Technology companies have led the way. On Tuesday Intel, the semiconductor titan, offered a ray of hope to the beleaguered sector with solid results and upbeat forecasts for the full year.That news was followed by sturdy earnings reports from Ebay and IBM. Over the week Intel rose 6.2 per cent to $22.55, Ebay added 2.7 per cent to $31.71 and IBM rose 7.2 per cent to $124.40.Industrial stocks found momentum this week on the back of strong earnings
from conglomerates such as United Technologies, CSX, and Textron.Those results reassured investors that diversified international companies can find growth abroad to offset soft domestic markets, and they helped overturn losses in the sector triggered by disappointing results from industrial bellwether General Electric last Friday.Upbeat results from Honeywell International and Caterpillar on Friday bolstered that rally, pushing an index of industrial stocks up 4.7 per cent for the week.Honeywell added 6.3 per cent to $60.99 on Friday while Caterpillar shares rose 8.5 per cent to $85.28.During the week UTC, CSX and Textron climbed
4.3 per cent to $72.51, 8.8 per cent to $61.24 and 6.7 per cent to $60.97 respectively.In spite of a series of massive losses and writedowns begun by Wachovia on Monday and capped by Citigroup on Friday, financial stocks for the most part performed well this week.The run began on Tuesday after a handful of regional banks, including Regions Financial and M&T Bank, cheered investors with
better-than-expected results.Those results were followed by mostly inline earnings reports from JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch.Investors responded positively, sending JPMorgan shares up 7.6 per cent to $45.76 and Merrill shares up 8.4 per cent to $47.35 for the week. But analysts were wary, pointing to “problem” assets, a slowing economy and the rising costs of funding as potential headwinds.Analyst are also sceptical about equity market resilience in the face of macro- economic data showing weakening growth, rising inflation and continued distress in the capital markets.“To us, the Pollyanna-ish calm expressed by the equity market relative to the grim reality displayed in numerous credit-market indicators is a source of constant difficulty,” said Rob Carnell of INGMany believe expectations of about 7 per cent earnings growth from S&P 500 companies excluding financials remain far too optimistic.The sector for which forecasts remain highest however was the leading gainer during the week. Energy stocks rallied strongly, up 7.7 per cent, on the back of record high oil prices.BJ Services and Baker Hughes led the sector, climbing 16.3 per cent to $33.21 and 12.5 per cent to $80.80 over the week."
440;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-04-18T18:01:10Z;Caterpillar sees short-term gloom;;Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, on Friday lowered its forecast for construction in North America and warned that the US and European economies would slow further than its already gloomy projections.However, the company said it was “weathering a recessionary storm” as it posted record first-quarter earnings on a continued expansion into international markets.The sectors in which Caterpillar operates – trucking and construction – are seen as barometers of US economic health.The manufacturer was one of the first big US companies to warn last October that the economy was entering a recession.Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive, said the US economy “will continue down for another three to six months and then we’ll find a bottom and start moving up from there”.Caterpillar cut its forecast for US economic growth in 2008 from 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent and said it was expecting 1m housing starts in the US, down from its former guidance of 1.1m.It lowered its forecast for European economic growth from 2.3 per cent to 2 per cent and said the European Central Bank would cut rates by 25 basis points, as opposed to its previous expectation that rates would be held steady.Mr Owens said he was expecting the US economy to begin a comeback next year. “As we move out into 2009 to 2010, with the economic stimulus of fiscal monetary policy and the stabilisation of credit markets, I would think that, as long as we don’t do anything silly on the policy side . . . you’ll see a nice economic recovery.”Caterpillar’s reported quarterly profit of $922m, up 13 per cent from $816m in the first quarter of 2007.Earnings per share were $1.45, up from $1.23 per share in the same period last year and well ahead of Wall Street expectations of $1.34.The company maintained its previous outlook for 2008, with sales and revenues increasing 5-10 per cent and earnings per share increasing 5-15 per cent from 2007.The bullish sentiment in the face of a worsening US economy underlines the importance to Caterpillar of international markets.“We continue to see robust demand for products used in the global mining and energy industries and for machines used by our customers to build infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets,” Mr Owens said.Sales and revenues in the first quarter were up 30 per cent outside North America, while they rose just 4 per cent in North America.Its shares were up 8.4 per cent by midday at $85.18.
441;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-04-02T20:51:33Z;Wall St eases back in choppy session;;Wall Street stocks eased back in choppy session on Wednesday as investors took profits after Tuesday’s rally and digested a cautious view of the US economy from the Federal Reserve’s chairman.In testimony before congress Ben Bernanke alternately spooked and soothed, noting that the economy may contract in the first half but saying that it was unlikely that any other investment bank would require a Bear Stearns-like rescue. Still, traders and analysts noted that the market reaction was relatively muted after significant advances a day earlier and before crucial employment data due on Friday.Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, said: “We had a huge run Tuesday and I think it is a normal to retrace some of the gains we saw.” He added that surging oil prices late in the day had also dented equities.But fuel and commodity concerns were both the villain and the hero of the piece, knocking the broader markets but boosting energy and basic materials stocks.Exxon Mobil rose 1.7 per cent to $88.52 while ConocoPhillips climbed 1.4 per cent to $78.77.Gold producers Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining also rallied, adding 2.2 per cent to $99.73 and 3.3 per cent to $46.25 respectively.In New York the benchmark S&P 500 closed down for the first time in three days, dropping 0.2 per cent to 1,367.53 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,361.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 12,608.92.On Tuesday stock markets around the world bounced back from a dismal first quarter on news that several banks had taken further big writedowns on risky assets and were moving to recapitalise.That momentum stalled early on Wednesday during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to Congress on US economic growth and amid a welter of poor economic current and predictive data.The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecasts for growth in the US, adding that there was a 25 per cent chance of a global recession, while the Commerce Department released data showing further weakness in manufacturing.Financials ended down for the day. An index of investment banks fell 0.3 per cent while the broader S&P500 index of financial stocks lost 0.7 per cent. But there were pockets of resilience. Citigroup added 0.8 per cent to $24.02 while Morgan Stanley rose 0.5 per cent to $49.09.Consumer discretionary stocks also found some unexpected impetus, led by department store chain Dillards, after it made a deal with a group of shareholders that would allow it to avoid a proxy fight. Dillards shares, which have lost 38 per cent of their value over the last year, climbed 14.5 per cent, to $21.08. Family Dollar Stores, another retail chain, rose 2.3 per cent to $21.40 while JC Penney gained for a third day – 2 per cent to $40.91.Homebuilders were also boosted after top US Senators agreed on Tuesday to try to pass legislation that could help some homeowners avoid foreclosure. Centex added 0.8 per cent to $26.01, KB Home gained 4 per cent to $28 and DR Horton rose 0.5 per cent to $17.16.Mr Bernanke’s statements also overshadowed better than forecast results from Best Buy and news that private sector jobs increased unexpectedly in March.Best Buy, the consumer electronics and entertainment software retailer, said profits fell 3 per cent to $737m in the fourth quarter.However analysts had been expecting greater declines and revenues proved resilient, climbing 4 per cent to $13.42bn.Best Buy shares rose 1.8 per cent to $44.24, while smaller rival Circuit City, gained 5.7 per cent to $4.65.A report by ADP, the payroll services firm, also cushioned falls after it suggested private sector jobs had climbed in March .But the decline in factory orders hit consumer staple and industrial stocks in spite of some positive news.Caterpillar lost 1.8 per cent to $78.51 despite of announcing that it would increase prices for its machinery by up to 5 per cent, while General Electric dropped 1.1 per cent to $38.02.Walgreen, the retail drugstore chain, fell 2 per cent to $38.14 despite revealing that total sales rose 10.6 per cent to $5.11bn in March, compared to last year.
442;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

These are bear market rallies, which are exciting but ultimately disappointing.”Spanish property companies made strong gains as speculators shorting stock squeezed prices higher.Metrovacesa rose 40 per cent in the afternoon before paring gains to close 16.5 per cent higher at €96.95. Inmobiliaria Colonial added 5.4 per cent to €0.97.Meanwhile, Sacyr Vallehermoso added 5.2 per cent to €23.76 after a Paris court decided it did not have to make a $12.5bn takeover bid for Eiffage, making it easier to sell its stake in the French public works company. Eiffage dropped 3.1 per cent to €60.11.Also among the gainers was K&S, the German potash maker, rose 3.1 per cent to €220 after UniCredit raised its price target on the stock to €322 from €197, reflecting surging demand for the fertiliser as farms looked to boost output in the face of record agricultural commodity prices.Volvo got a lift after US rival Caterpillar said it was lifting its prices by 5 per cent because of surging demand for mining equipment. Volvo’s B shares rose 4.6 per cent to SKr96.25.Carmakers had mixed fortunes after the release of US sales data. BMW, the German car group, rose 1.4 per cent to €36.55 after its US sales rose 1.8 per cent in March.Daimler, however, fell 1.8 per cent to €54.34 after its Mercedes luxury brand lost market share as its unit sales fell 3.7 per cent.Porsche fell 5.2 per cent to €111.75 after its sales fell 24 per cent – driven by lower deliveries of the 911 and Boxster sports models, while Peugeot fell 2.3 per cent to €48.07 and Volkswagen dropped 1.4 per cent to €178.48.In France, PPR slid 2.3 per cent to €94.35 after Deutsche Bank downgraded the retail group’s stock from “buy” to “hold”, saying that upward momentum for retail earnings had stalled.The brokerage expected PPR to generate no profit at any of its subsidiaries except the Puma sports brand. Deutsche’s Jamie Isenwater said the stock was “cheap but could remain so for six months”.French catering management group Sodexo slipped 3.3 per cent to €38.06 on disappointment over fiscal first- half sales.

The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,243.87.“The overall sentiment picture suggests that although there is scope for a short-lived rally, equities are by no means out of the bear trend,” said analyst Sreekala Kochugovindan of Barclays Capital. “Sentiment is only marginally below crisis levels and there is a risk that once the euphoria of [the Federal Reserve’s liquidity action] subsides, investor focus could return to the continued problems of financial sector woes and the effect of a mild bout of stagflation.”Credit Suisse characterised said the Fed’s action – which sparked a massive rally in stocks on Monday – “does not address the fundamental problem of solvency, in our view. The two critical issues are that US housing still looks overvalued and that we think banks need to deleverage.”Until the Fed-induced rally, the market had retreated for three successive sessions as investors were unnerved by reports of margin calls at hedge funds and soaring home foreclosures.Financial stocks ended lower after a volatile day’s trade. The S&P financial index fell 2.1 per cent, while an index of investment banks fell 1.8 per cent.Among big bank stocks, Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $21.21, JPMorgan, fell 0.6 per cent at $38.61, while Bear Stearns fell 2.2 per cent at $61.58.Shares in the government sponsored mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae closed lower in active trade.Both Fannie and Freddie fell sharply this morning after media reports said they might have to issue more than $10bn in new stock this year as the lenders continue to serve as a backstop for the deteriorating housing market.Freddie Mac fell 0.6 per cent to $20.04 despite comments from the company’s chief executive that it had sufficient capital and had no plans to raise more capital through a share sale. Fannie Mae, Freddie’s larger rival, fell 4.4 per cent to $21.04.Countrywide, the mortgage lender which Bank of America has agreed to buy, fell 7.1 per cent to $4.75. Fitch, the ratings agency, cut the lender’s rating to BBB- from BBB+ after the market closed.American Eagle, the clothing retailer, said its fourth-quarter profit fell 6.4 per cent as it increased discounts to clear out unsold merchandise. The earnings were in line with expectations and the shares gained 4 per cent to $17.94. Healthcare company WellPoint fell 1.7 per cent to $46.45 after Fitch changed its outlook on the company from “stable” to “negative”. WellPoint warned early this week that 2008 earnings would not meet forecasts because of higher medical costs and fewer subscribers than expected.JPMorgan downgraded a number of airlines, including American, Northwest and Delta. Shares in American fell 12.8 per cent to $9.31. Northwest fell 16.2 per cent to $10.25 while Delta was down 16.4 per cent at $10.13.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained in afternoon trade, rising 1.1 per cent to $24.91, after the video game publisher raised its outlook for 2008. Take-Two reiterated that it had rejected a $2bn buy-out offer from rival Electronic Arts.Dow component Caterpillar said after the close of the previous session that 2008 sales and earnings would top earlier forecasts. The heavy equipment maker also raised its long-term sales goal. Shares rose 3.6 per cent to $75.25.The pharmaceuticals sector came under pressure after Wyeth and Progenics

445;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-02-27T21:46:46Z;Wall St stocks seesaw in volatile trading;;US stocks gyrated between positive and negative territory on Wednesday when traders weighed poor economic data and a plan to allow government-chartered mortgage lenders to buy more loans.The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said it would remove the cap on the value of mortgages they could buy, which could boost liquidity in the industry.The plan sparked a rally in financial stocks and homebuilders but fears about the health of the economy damped earlier enthusiasm.Quincy Krosby, chief in-vestment strategist at The Hartford, said: “Mortgages are at the heart of the credit problem. Anything you can do to staunch the deterioration in the housing market is going to be a positive for the markets and for the real economy.”But economic data re-leased earlier showed the housing market and economy worsened in January, and Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the US was experiencing a broad-based slowdown.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to close at 12,694.28, while the S&P 500 index slipped 0.1 per cent to 1,380.02. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.4 per cent to 2,353.78.Still, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pared early losses after the OFHEO news. Fannie, which re-ported a $3.6bn fourth-quarter loss before the opening bell, rose 1.1 per cent to $27.27. Smaller counterpart Freddie fell 0.5 per cent to $25.09. Analysts expect Freddie to show a fourth-quarter loss of about $2.54 a share when it reports on Thursday.Homebuilders were also supported by an upbeat note from Lehman Brothers, which initiated coverage of the industry with a “positive” recommendation.Megan Talbott McGrath, Lehman Brothers analyst, said she expected trends in the sector to improve by the latter half of this year.DR Horton rose 4.1 per cent to $17.10 while Toll Brothers, which earlier reported its biggest quarterly loss in 22 years, added 3.1 per cent to $23.83.Financial stocks held on to their gains: The S&P 500 financials sub-index firmed 0.8 per cent, while an index of investment banks rose 2.1 per cent.Fortunes in the technology, media and telecoms sector were mixed, however.Autodesk tumbled 15.6 per cent to $32.99 after the software maker reported a fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.In contrast, forecast-beating earnings sent electronic components maker Maxwell Technologies 9.7 per cent higher to $10.29.Shares in Microsoft fell 0.4 per cent to $28.26 after European regulators imposed a $1.4bn fine on the company. Analysts said the fine – the largest by the European Union against a single company – represented just a fraction of the software maker’s monthly cash flow.Intel fell 0.4 per cent to $20.77 after JPMorgan cut its 2008 and 2009 profit estimates for the world’s largest chipmaker.Christopher Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan, said his research suggested Intel’s first quarter was trending below expectations because of weaker orders for microprocessors. DreamWorks Animation rose 5 per cent to $25.65. The maker of the Shrek movies reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates on DVD sales from the third film about the ogre.Nortel fell 13.3 per cent to $9.93 after the largest telephone equipment maker in North America said it would cut 2,100 jobs after sales fell.Shares of Netflix jumped 11.8 per cent to $32.43 after the online video-rental service raised its first-quarter and full-year earnings guidance and forecasts for subscriber growth.Cisco Systems rose 3.7 per cent to $24.95 after Wells Fargo added the maker of computer-networking equipment to its “buy” list.Smaller rival Juniper Networks rose 6.5 per cent to $29.29.Apple and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, benefited from positive sentiment towards export-oriented stocks. The falling dollar makes US exports more attractive.Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $122.96, while RIM added 3.5 per cent to $111.50.Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, rose 1.3 per cent to $74.22. Aluminium producer Alcoa rose 1.4 per cent to $30.02. General Motors rose 1 per cent to $24.82.
446;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-02-27T00:01:48Z;US manufacturers restructure and survive;;Mark Schurman, who works for Herman Miller, an office furniture maker based in south-western Michigan, dreads to think what would have happened to the company had it not restructured since the last US recession.“We lost about 40 per cent of our business in the space of about 18 months between 2001 and 2003,” he says. “If we hadn’t made the changes we’ve made, I don’t believe we could have survived.”Those changes – chiefly, slashing costs and diversifying internationally – have made the manufacturer more productive than ever and, it hopes, better-placed to weather any economic downturn in the US.While it expects $2bn in sales this year – similar to the end of the 1990s – its workforce of 6,000 is almost half what it was then.Herman Miller’s story is typical. With fears of recession growing in the US, the manufacturing sector would traditionally have been gripped by morbid anxiety. But in Darwinian fashion, those companies that have survived are leaner and more plugged in to the global economy.There are obvious exceptions – most notably in the motor industry, which continues to suffer. But in general, it seems that that which has not killed US manufacturing has made it stronger, and many companies are confident in the face of a possible downturn.Midwest states, where manufacturing is concentrated, are among the most productive in the country.The top five US states in terms of manufacturing productivity are all in the region: Indiana, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio and Iowa.Much of this higher productivity has resulted from job cuts: Michigan also has the highest unemployment in the US, while Ohio has the fourth-highest.While some companies have simply reduced their headcount, others have outsourced jobs overseas.Some manufacturers have also lowered pay: for example, Caterpillar, the construction equipment-maker, has benefited from a two-tier wage system since the 1990s.The flipside of a smaller workforce is more mechanisation. That has been driven by several factors, says Harsh Chitale, vice-president for global business strategy at Honeywell Process Solutions, which advises companies on how to improve their production.Mr Chitale says the increasing need for energy efficiency, environmental regulations – such as those on greenhouse gas emissions – and the shortage of skilled labour have all prompted manufacturers to invest in new equipment.The introduction of leaner production techniques has enabled many manufacturers to cut costs and improve their efficiency. Mary An­dringa, president and chief executive of Vermeer Manufacturing, a directional drill manufacturer in Pella, Iowa, says the last recession taught her a harsh lesson about the need to reduce inventory. The company switched from “batch” to “continuous flow” production, with impressive results.“We’ve reduced all our lead times across the process,” says Ms Andringa. “In 2000, when we made wood chippers in batches, from raw steel to out-the-door took about 50 days. Now it’s two and a half days.”Cutting jobs, outsourcing, mechanisation and leaner production may have lowered costs, but many manufacturers have also learnt that their best chance of survival is not to depend on the North American market.Large manufacturers such as General Electric, Caterpillar and John Deere have offset falling sales at home by increasing their market share internationally, driven by growth in emerging economies and the weak dollar.Many smaller manufacturers have followed their lead. Erick Ajax, vice-president of EJ Ajax, a metal stampings supplier with 50 employees in Fridley, Minnesota, says his company’s international expansion makes him “cautiously optimistic” in spite of the prevailing gloom.“Our single largest order ever came last year from Saudi Arabia,” he says. “And we’re selling a lot to China, Mexico and Canada. Those export markets help smooth some of the bumps out of the road.”Nonetheless, a report by the National Association of Manufacturers found that one-third of small and medium-sized US manufacturers had no sales outside the US and did not purchase materials or components internationally.Chris McMahon of Baird, the financial services company, says such companies could find themselves hit by a US downturn, which may herald a wave of consolidation. He notes that, unlike previous recessions, many industrial manufacturers have clean balance sheets.“Their financial flexibility and purchasing power is much greater than in previous downturns,” he says. “You’ve got a lot of very healthy companies out there who could well look at this market as an opportunity to play offence instead of defence.”
447;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-02-12T17:17:15Z;Indonesia mine dispute escalates;;Indonesia on Tuesday threatened to terminate the multi-billion-dollar mining contract of a local subsidiary of Newmont Mining, claiming that the US company and its Japanese partner had reneged on a plan to hand over shares to local organisations.Simon Sembiring, Indonesia’s director-general of mineral resources, said Newmont and Sumitomo Mining had until February 22 to divest 10 per cent of their shares in the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine on Sumbawa island in West Nusa Tenggara province.Muhammad Lutfi, head of the investment co-ordinating agency, also suggested that the two foreign companies, along with Trakindo, the Indonesian agent for Caterpillar, the heavy industry equipment supplier, may have violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices act with their approach to the divestment process. However, no details were put forward.The move is the latest blow in a long-running dispute between Newmont and the Indonesian government over the ownership of the Batu Hijau mine, which is managed by Newmont Nusa Tenggara, a joint venture between the US company and Sumitomo Mining.Under the contract of work signed in 1986, Newmont and Sumitomo were required to divest 51 per cent of Newmont Nusa Tenggara to local entities within 10 years of production, in agreed instalments. Production began in 2000.The companies sold 20 per cent immediately to Pukuasu Indah, controlled by businessman Yusuf Meruk. And in 2006 the company offered 3 per cent, valued at $109m, followed by another 7 per cent, valued at $282m, to local investors last year.These stakes were not taken up and an affiliate of Trakindo has since been in talks with Newmont over the 3 per cent stake. Newmont on Tuesday said it had sold 2 per cent of the shares to the Sumbawa district government for $72.67m, a figure agreed via an independent valuation in 2006, adding that this demonstrated its commitment to divestment.The sale price valued the mine at $3.6bn in 2006. Newmont was unwilling to say how much the mine is worth now. However, the price of gold has risen some 45 per cent in price since the end of 2006. The mine’s proven and probable reserves were estimated at 493m tonnes of gold and 1.9m tonnes of copper at the end of 2007.Mr Sembiring told the Financial Times that Newmont and Sumitomo had violated the contract of work by not divesting 3 per cent of their shares in 2006 and 7 per cent in 2007.“They’ve been hesitating, wasting time and not acting in good faith,” he said. “So I’ve given them until February 22 to complete the divestment or else I will exercise Indonesia’s right to cancel the contract.”Newmont, speaking on behalf of itself and Sumitomo, insisted neither had done anything wrong. Newmont said it would take whatever steps necessary to protect its shareholders’ interests, including going to international arbitration.Mr Lutfi, who has to approve the divestment, accused Newmont of “pursuing its own agenda” to retain ownership of the shares even though that would violate the contract of work.“There are indications that several foreign companies have undertaken activities that violate the good corporate governance guidelines issued by the American government,” he said. “May I remind and warn Newmont, Sumitomo and Caterpillar’s Indonesian agent, namely Trakindo, to obey the articles of [America’s] Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.”Trakindo on Tuesday said neither Caterpillar nor Trakindo were involved in attempting to purchase a stake in the mine, adding that it was an affiliate of the Indonesian company that had been in discussions.Russell Ball, Newmont’s chief financial officer, said the company was committed to the divestment programme, even though it had taken longer than expected. He said he was “disappointed” by the default letter because “the government knew [the Sumbawa district deal] was in the works and imminent to be released”.“It seems to be counter to the good faith of the negotiations that have been ongoing,” he said.He added that if Jakarta cancelled the contract, Newmont would almost certainly pursue international arbitration.Mr Ball rejected the suggestion that Newmont had violated the foreign corrupt practices act.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat
448;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-01-29T21:44:47Z;Wall Street edges up on earnings;;"US stocks advanced again on Tuesday as some better-than-expected corporate earnings and a surprising jump in durable goods orders helped boost fragile sentiment on Wall Street.Equities ploughed a narrower trading range than in recent days as investors awaited Wednesday’s Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decision on interest rates.Traders found strength in telecommunications, homebuilders and financial companies, while transport stocks became one of the few sectors to move into positive territory for the year. However the technology again lagged the market as concerns about growth prospects continued.The S&P500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,362.30. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 12,480.30 while the Nasdaq Composite gained only 0.4 per cent to 2,358.06.Many analysts are cautious on the near-term outlook for stocks amid fears of a US recession, further writedowns in the financial sector and continued uncertainty surrounding bond insurers.“We are still to be convinced that the strategic case for equities has improved sufficiently,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. In order to make a stronger case, Mr Shairp said the market needed to see “central banks ease, the banking system recapitalises itself, equity valuations are compelling and technical indicators are supportive”.But others have pointed to signs of improvement, with the S&P avoiding late-
session sell-offs in four of the past five trading days.“The market has shown a little bit of stability over the last few sessions,” Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said. “The Fed holds a big wild card – they have the power to make or break the market.”In spite of delivering a 75 basis point cut last week, the Fed is expected to continue easing rates on Wednesday with the futures market pricing in a 72 per cent likelihood of a 50bp cut. Traders have warned that any deviation from this line could spark another sell-off in equity markets.Tuesday’s economic news was dominated by a larger-than-expected rise in durable goods orders, which provided solace to investors fearing a manufacturing slump. Orders for big ticket items rose 5.2 per cent in December against a forecast gain of 2.1 per cent.Among Dow components benefiting from the improved outlook were Boeing, up 4.3 per cent at $80.96, and Caterpillar, up 1.1 per cent at $68.99.“There is no doubting the strength of the December data but there is plenty of doubting how sustainable this is and what this says about future trends,” Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said.Other analysts were more upbeat. TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets said: ”We are witnessing the positive impact of the cheap US dollar on the economy, and the reason we only believe the economy will flirt with recession rather than falling into a full fledged one.”There was little sign of optimism for US consumers after the S&P/Case-Shiller 10-city home price index fell a record 8.4 per cent in the year during November, an 11th straight monthly decline. Meanwhile the latest reading of the Conference Board’s US consumer confidence index fell from an upwardly revised 90.6 to 87.9 in January, slightly better than expected.Earnings news was more upbeat, with 20 of 26 S&P500 companies reporting results before the close beating estimates.An exception was Countrywide Financial, which posted a wider-than-expected $422m loss after the mortgage lender set aside $924m to cover rising loan losses. In spite of the loss, the shares rose 6.1 per cent to $6.31 after Bank of America’s chief executive said its takeover was a “go”.Also in the financial sector, American Express, up 0.8 per cent to $47.80, posted a 10 per cent decline in net income as it set aside a $438m charge to cover bad loans.Meanwhile bond insurers including Ambac Financial, up 16.2 per cent at $12.93 rallied on hopes they may keep their triple-A ratings.In industrials Dow Chemical said fourth quarter earnings fell by more than half to $472m as agricultural and energy costs rose sharply. However, the results beat estimates and the shares rose 0.9 per cent to $37.94. .Technology was among the weakest sectors after VMware, the virtualisation software firm, missed Wall Street’s revenue target and its growth outlook disappointed. The shares plunged 33.9 per cent to $54.87."
449;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Corporate America braced for recession;;Leading US companies are shifting into recession mode and preparing to cut costs, freeze hiring and reduce capital spending as they brace for an economic slowdown, senior executives and industry experts said.Their concerns are likely to be reinforced by the International Monetary Fund, which slashed its forecast for US growth and warned that no country would be completely immune from what it termed a “global slowdown”.Separately, a US study due out today shows that chief financial officers’ views of the economy are the most pessimistic in nearly four years.Business leaders say rising oil prices, sagging consumer confidence and the on-going credit crunch are prompting them to put in place contingency plans to protect against the expected economic downturn.“We have a number of levers we can pull in terms of capital and costs,” said Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical, which reported a halving in fourth-quarter earnings. “We have been buttoned down since July with a total clampdown on costs and capital expenditure.”Jim Owens, chief executive of Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment and a company regarded as a gauge of national economic health, last week warned of “anaemic growth in the US”.Multinationals are counting on growth in overseas demand and the weak dollar to offset domestic weakness.A leading US management consultant said that over the past few months, his firm had been “deluged” with calls from smaller, domestically-focused companies asking for advice on how to deal with a recession.“They all want to know what to cut and what to hold back if the economy hits the buffers,” he said.Chief financial officers polled by Financial Executives International, an association of financial executives, and The City University of New York’s Baruch College, reflected this negative mood about US economic prospects.In the last quarter of 2007, CFOs’ economic optimism touched its lowest level since June 2004, when the survey was first carried out, and recorded a 10 per cent fall over the previous three months.
450;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-01-29T19:13:20Z;Back to ‘the economy, stupid’: How a slowdown will influence America’s presidential contest;;The issue of economics is not something I have understood as well as I should – John McCain, Republican presidential hopefulIn many electoral cycles, Senator McCain’s recent remark may have passed unnoticed. But in an election year when most Americans believe they are already in recession , he was advised promptly to read the book by Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, that he said he was carrying around.For a long while it was assumed the 2008 presidential election would be dominated by Iraq, fear of terrorism, restoring America’s position in the world and other foreign policy issues. But then the subprime mortgage crisis began to unfold. With a majority of economists now forecasting a recession this year, economic worries have shot to the top of the list of voter concerns. In turn, that has strengthened the already robust conventional wisdom that 2008 will be the year of the Democrats.So is it just a question of settling who is to be the Democratic nominee and then awaiting either Hillary Clinton’s or Barack Obama’s inevitable capture of the White House? Probably, says Ray C. Fair, a Yale economist whose widely cited forecasting model predicts a 52 per cent to 48 per cent Democratic presidential victory in November, even with a mild slowdown in growth.But Mr Fair’s model, which has a 2.5 per cent margin of error, predicts a whopping 55 per cent to 45 per cent Democratic victory in November if that slowdown indeed turns into a recession. “Almost everything, including all the non-economic factors, suggests a Democratic win this year,” he says.Should Mr Fair’s forecast prove anywhere near accurate, it would constitute something of a revolution in American political history. The last time a Democratic presidential nominee won the presidency with more than half the vote was in 1976 when Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford. But that came little more than a year after the Watergate crisis had unseated Richard Nixon and cast a toxic pall over the Republicans.The only other time since 1964 that a Democrat has won more than half the vote was in 2000 when Al Gore garnered a shade more than George W. Bush in an election eventually settled by the Supreme Court. It also came at the end of one of the longest periods of growth in American history, almost all of it under a Democratic administration.“Al Gore lost the 2000 election in spite of the economy,” says Michael Feldman, who was a senior adviser to the then vice-president. “Because it was a time of economic contentment, the 2000 election was dominated by softer issues.”Perhaps the most often cited recession election is 1992 when Bill Clinton deftly exploited George H.W. Bush’s allegedly inept handling of the downturn with the campaign motto, “It’s the economy, stupid”. But the recession had already ended by the time voters went to the polls – and Mr Clinton won only 43 per cent of the vote.Many believe Mr Bush senior would have won re-election were it not for the 19 per cent vote garnered by Ross Perot’s isolationist third-party candidacy. Mr Clinton took 49 per cent of the vote in 1996 in a year when the economy was much stronger (Mr Perot again ran, taking just eight per cent of the vote). Thus recent history suggests it would be heroic to assume a thumping Democratic victory in November.“The widespread notion that a downturn or a recession gives a clear advantage to the Democratic presidential challenger is not always supported by the facts,” says Michael Lind, a political historian at the New America Foundation in Washington. “The past offers just as much evidence that we could get a Republican president with a Democratic Congress in November as a Democratic control of both.”History points to a slightly greater correlation between congressional election outcomes and the prevailing economic orthodoxy – if not necessarily the precise stage in the economic cycle. For example, the Democratic party controlled both branches of Congress for virtually all of the period between the late 1940s and late 1960s when Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal commanded a broad consensus among voters. But the Republicans still won the White House 50 per cent of the time.Likewise, many political analysts believe the Democratic victory in the 2006 mid-term congressional elections, which brought an end to 12 years of continuous Republican majorities in the House of Representatives, heralded a rejection of a generation’s worth of conservative economics – in addition to the anti-war sentiment on Iraq that clearly motivated many voters.Most forecasters predict the Democrats will increase their majorities in the Senate and the House this November regardless of which party takes the White House. “An economic downturn would probably reinforce what is almost certainly going to be another good year for congressional Democrats,” says Charlie Cook, a Washington political analyst. “Voters already associate their economic anxieties and their other complaints – about corruption and inept foreign policy – with the Republican party.”Indeed, the sentiment of the American voter suggests something much worse for the Republican party as a whole than the prospect simply of taking the blame for a short-term economic downturn. The 2006 election took place after five years of robust economic growth from which many – if not most – Americans derived scant improvement in income.The stagnation of median household incomes since 2001 poses a far tougher structural problem for defenders of the status quo than the latest quarterly economic numbers. “What is so depressing about the Republican party right now is that it is not acknowledging the economic pain most middle-class Americans are experiencing,” says David Frum, a former speechwriter to George W. Bush, whose recent book, Comeback, warns that the Republicans face electoral banishment if they do not reform. “It is a party that has become so beholden to special interests that it cannot honestly address issues like healthcare reform even though the Republican voter is suffering from healthcare inflation as much as any other.”Frank Luntz, a leading Republican pollster, agrees. He points to the “intellectual stagnation” of Republican ideas, which have dominated American politics for a generation. “The 2006 congressional election was just the beginning of the bad news for the Republican party,” he says. “This year it gets worse.”Yet whoever becomes the Republican presidential nominee will have a reasonable opportunity to escape the likely fate of his colleagues on Capitol Hill. Whether it is Mitt Romney, Rudolph Giuliani or Mr McCain, all three can plausibly dissociate themselves from Mr Bush.Had it been a more typical election when the Republican nominee was either the sitting president or the vice-president that would not have been possible. As it is, Mr Bush’s deep unpopularity need not rub off on whoever hopes to succeed him. “Presidential politics is largely about the individual characters of the nominees,” says Mr Cook. “And none of the leading Republican contenders is closely associated with Mr Bush.”But the Republican nominee would have to go a stage further than simply dissociating himself from Mr Bush to produce an economic narrative that strikes voters both as convincing and empathetic. More than 70 per cent of voters believe the country is on the “wrong track” – a historically high measure of public dissatisfaction. That number could well deteriorate with up to 2m home foreclosures anticipated over the next 12 months.So far, most analysts are unimpressed by the economic policies the Republican presidential hopefuls are offering. While their Democratic counterparts have been swift to produce their own fiscal stimulus plans in the last three weeks, the Republicans were slow off the mark, in some cases embarrassingly so. For example, Mr McCain’s initial remedy for the downturn was to suggest spending cuts – a measure that would deepen rather than counter any recession.Mr Giuliani’s plan was little better. Having denied until this month that there were any clouds on the economic horizon, the former mayor of New York recently proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rate and incentives to boost investment. Economists pointed out that the counter-cyclical effect of Mr Giuliani’s tax cuts would begin to be felt only after the end of any recession.Mr Romney, who is the most fluent on economics of the Republican candidates, was also criticised for proposing measures such as the extension of Mr Bush’s tax cuts (which expire in 2010) that would have little or no short-term effect on the economy. “In this general election, the Republicans probably cannot get away with their usual diet of optimism and tax cuts,” says Jared Bernstein at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-centre Washington think-tank. “They will have to come up with something more original.”Tom Gallagher, managing director of International Strategy and Investment, a broker-dealer specialising in economic research, is even blunter. “Normally when Washington gets round to passing a fiscal stimulus plan, that is a signal that the recession is already over,” he says. “But the plans put forward by the Republican nominees would only begin to take effect by the time of the next recession.”The two leading Democratic candidates have been awarded much higher grades for the content of their fiscal stimulus plans and for having reflected in their policy platforms the public’s sense of economic dissatisfaction since campaigning began a year ago.Given her detailed expositions on economic policy, many assume that Mrs Clinton is better placed to exploit a recession than Mr Obama, whose campaign deals in larger generalities (even though his stimulus plan received more plaudits than Mrs Clinton’s).But both are well positioned to move into a general election with a set of economic policies tailored to the mood of the electorate – including plans for universal healthcare, higher spending on infrastructure and a dose of populist scepticism about the downsides of globalisation.Yet presidential elections, even during recession years, are never confined purely to the economy. Nor is it yet clear that the US is heading into recession. History also shows that American voters have a partiality for divided government. “If the Democrats believe they have sewn up the presidential election because the economy is turning down, they may be in for an unpleasant surprise,” says Mr Lind.As a chill sets in, it pays to check what plays in PeoriaWith its grey-and-yellow brick Italianate façade dotted with bored, reclining cherubs, the Madison Theater in downtown Peoria speaks to another age, writes Hal Weitzman. In the 1920s, the largely blue-collar audiences at venues such as the Madison were seen as the truest test of a vaudeville show. If it played in Peoria, the saying went, it could not fail in the rest of the US.These days, the doors of the Madison are closed, its awnings in tatters. But Peoria, a city of about 110,000 in central Illinois, retains its reputation as a typical US town, an indicator of trends in both the Midwest and the broader American heartland.If Peoria is the quintessential American city, it sits in a state that can also be seen as mirroring the wider US. Measured by a host of demographic factors – race, age, income, education, industry, immigration and rural-urban mix – Illinois is the most representative state in the union, according to data from the Census Bureau.Illinois is also typical in that the economy has shot to the top of voters’ concerns in the run-up to Super Tuesday next week, when the state joins 21 others – four of them in the Midwest – in primary elections for a presidential candidate.In Peoria, concerns about the economy have been expressed very publicly. Caterpillar, the maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines, is based in the city and is its biggest employer. Last October the company – often seen as a bellwether for the wider economy – warned that the US was either in a recession or near to one. Buoyed by strong international sales, Caterpillar released healthy results last week but reiterated that it expected “anaemic growth” in the US economy.Peoria itself is not yet suffering much. The city’s productivity is among the highest in the Midwest and it has largely been spared the foreclosures associated with the subprime mortgage crisis. While manufacturing remains the backbone of its economy, a healthcare boom has diversified employment. Nevertheless, Bernard Goiteen of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Bradley University in Peoria says local leading economic indicators suggest growth is slowing: in the third quarter of last year, job openings fell 6 per cent from the previous quarter, building permits were down by 25 per cent and new unemployment claims rose by 23 per cent.These data may be a worrying signal for the Midwest and the broader US. The region represents about 25-30 per cent of the national economy, says Bill Testa, senior economist at the Chicago Federal Reserve. In spite of years of job cuts and international outsourcing, it is still manufacturing-intensive. Much of that manufacturing is of durable goods, a sector sensitive to downturns.Across the street from the Madison, in the elegant ballroom of the Père Marquette hotel, the Peoria County Republican party held its annual Lincoln Day Dinner on Sunday night. Over chicken cordon bleu and Black Forest gateau, the talk was of volatile stock markets. “Sure, I’m worried about it – I’ve lost a couple of hundred thousand dollars in the past few weeks,” said Merle Widmer, vice-chairman of the Peoria county board.On the other side of the Illinois river, in Caterpillar’s tractor plant in East Peoria, the issues are somewhat different. Steve Sanneman, who instals engines on the production line, says higher petrol and food prices mean he and his family are struggling to get by. “My biggest expense is just keeping a roof over our heads,” he says. “I’m working from pay cheque to pay cheque.” Mr Sanneman says the economy will determine his vote but has no great confidence in any of the candidates. “They talk a mean battle about the lower middle class but I don’t think they have a clue about what it’s like.”Jim McConnoughey, head of the Peoria Chamber of Commerce and one of three candidates competing for the Republican nomination in Illinois’ 18th Congressional district, says economic issues are on the minds of most Peorians. “Rural voters are worried about higher revenues falling, young people are moving to take up jobs elsewhere and the growth of smaller manufacturers has elevated the issue of economic security.”That view is echoed by Billy Halstead, chairman of the Peoria County Democratic party. “The economy is one of the top issues we’re hearing on the doorstep – what with the housing market the way it is – and we’re using it as a campaign tool. Unemployment isn’t high yet but a lot of our blue-collar manufacturing jobs that used to be in the city have gone.”In Illinois, it is hard to see the economy changing the outcome of the Democratic primary. Barack Obama, who represents the state in the US Senate, has an insurmountable lead. But it could help Mitt Romney – who has pledged to fight for jobs in the industrial heartland – in the Republican primary.At Northwoods mall in central Peoria, Brianna Brignall, a student, is working her shift at a concession selling calendars featuring John McCain, Rudolph Giuliani, Hillary Clinton and Mr Obama. When asked which has sold the most, she giggles and points to one featuring a confused-looking President George W. Bush. Called “I can’t wait”, it counts down the days until Mr Bush leaves office. “I guess a lot of people will just be glad to see him go,” she says.
451;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-01-25T22:06:13Z;Wall St stocks return to negative territory;;Wall Street endured one of its most volatile weeks in recent memory, and closed out the period having just escaped a brief encounter with a bear market.Although the broad benchmarks closed in negative territory on Friday, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to record their first weekly gain in 2008, and break a string of four weekly declines.The S&P fell 1.6 per cent to close at 1,330.61 points, a gain of 0.4 per cent on the week, clipping its overall loss this month to 9.4 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.5 per cent to 2,326.20, for a loss of 0.6 per cent since Tuesday, pulling it down by 12.3 per cent this month. The Dow slid 1.4 per cent to 12,3207.17, that left bluechips up 0.9 per cent this week, a loss of 8 per cent in 2008.At the worst moment for stocks early on Tuesday, the S&P futures contract was 21 per cent below its October peak, meeting the definition of a bear market. The Nasdaq Composite also briefly traded more than 20 per cent below its 2007 high and on Friday was down just over 18 per cent.All this came after the Federal Reserve had sliced its Fed funds rate to 3.50 per cent, a 75 basis point cut nearly a week before its scheduled January meeting. Another cut of at least 25bp is expected.Market volatility surged to levels seen last August as stocks continued to slide, and sectors exposed to the global economy, such as energy, industrials and technology, were hit hard.The Vix index, which measures S&P 500 option volatility surged past last August’s intra-day peak of 37.50 on Wednesday, before it sharply subsided below 30. Late on Friday, Vix was at 29.08.On a closing price level, the Vix has now settled above 30 three times since August. This type of pattern suggests that the market has established a strong ceiling that should hold unless there is a major shock traders say.Then, came the news of a move to help monoline bond insurers that, in conjunction with what traders said, was an extremely over-sold market, helped stem the waves of selling. A proposal to inject capital into the insurers, and thus potentially avert further writedowns among financials, who had purchased insurance, propelled the market sharply into positive territory late on Wednesday.The mood then improved as details of a $150bn fiscal stimulus package from Washington to stave off a recession emerged. The cream on the rebound came in the form of an upbeat earnings report and outlook from Microsoft on Thursday. The tech giant beat fiscal second quarter earnings estimates and raised guidance. The stock, however faded after making a high of $35 in early trade and closed down 0.9 per cent at $32.94.As the mood turned bearish on Frieday, traders said the market may not have escaped the clutches of a classic bear market. “The next two weeks are very critical and will set the tone for the rest of the quarter and a good part of the second quarter,” William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said.He said short covering rather than solid buying had pushed the market higher this week. The cautious tone on Friday also suggested that investors were reserving judgment until next week’s meeting of the Fed and the release of January’s employment report.Mr Strazzullo said that, if the major benchmarks fail to sustain their recent gains, it would mean the market was in the process of moving to much lower levels.He identified 1,150 to 1,350 on the S&P, 10,500 to 12,500 for the Dow and a floor of 1,950 for the Nasdaq as likely new ranges. “If we do not hold in here, there is a risk we see another 10 to 15 per cent washout in the major averages,” he said. This week, Citi lowered its year end target for the S&P to 1,550 from 1,675, and trimmed its outlook for the Dow to 13,950 from 15,100.Among the main S&P sectors, financials led with a rise of 7 per cent this week, and in spite of a 2.5 per cent fall on Friday. The Fed rate cut, with another looming next week, boosted JPMorgan 10.2 per cent to $43.64, while Citi rose 9 per cent to $26.64.Bear Stearns jumped 20 per cent to $87.03. Bank of America said fourth-quarter net income fell to $268m as it reported trading losses of $5.44bn due in part to writedowns of collateralised debt obligations. The stock rose 10.8 per cent to $39.48 this week.Among the bond insurers, MBIA rose 66 per cent to $14.20. Ambac reported a loss of $3.26bn after taking a $5.21bn writedown, but the stock jumped 86 per cent to $11.54, boosted on Friday by talk that investor Wilbur Ross may buy the company.Friday saw the debut of RiskMetrics Group. The provider of risk management and corporate governance products priced at $17.50 and after trading at a high of $24.45, closed at $23.75.In contrast with Microsoft, results from eBay and Apple disappointed investors. Shares in eBay fell 5.3 per cent to $26.83 this week as its 53 per cent rise in profits was accompanied by a 2008 forecast below some estimates.Apple reported a 57 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, but lowered its outlook and fell 19.4 per cent to $130.01.Caterpillar rose 5 per cent this week to $65.93 On Friday the heavy equipment maker said quarterly income rose 11 per cent, buoyed by international growth. But the company expects “recessionary conditions” in parts of the US to persist.Honeywell reported 18 per cent growth in net income, and warned that the global economy would soften. The stock rose 5.3 per cent to $58.25 on the week.In other earnings this week, Hershey said quarterly profit fell almost 65 per cent and the confectionary maker predicted a drop in earnings in 2008. The stock tumbled 7.3 per cent to $34.04.Lockheed Martin said quarterly profits rose 10 per cent and the defence contractor raised its forecast for 2008 earnings. The stock rose 3.5 per cent to $105.49.Ford Motor announced a fourth quarter loss of $2.7bn and a loss of $2.8bn for 2007, as weak US operations overwhelmed stronger international growth. The stock rallied 11.1 per cent to $6.58.Xerox reported a rise in quarterly profit of 79 per cent. While its outlook for the first quarter was partly below Wall Street estimates and the stock rose 9 per cent to $14.46 this week.
452;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-01-25T17:31:57Z;Caterpillar sees ‘anaemic’ US growth;;Caterpillar on Friday gave some sense of the scale of the slowdown in the US economy, saying machinery sales in North America had fallen by 11 per cent last year and warning of “anaemic growth” to come.The world’s largest maker of construction equipment and heavy-duty engines was one of the first big US companies to warn in October 2007 that the US economy was entering a recession. The sectors in which Caterpillar operates – trucking and construction – are widely seen as barometers of US economic health.Reporting its fourth-quarter results, the company said machinery and engine sales in North America had fallen by more than $2.6bn. Excluding Progress Rail, an engineering company Caterpillar acquired in 2006, sales volumes in North America fell more than $3.5bn.In spite of the drop, Caterpillar was buoyed by international revenues, which brought its fourth-quarter earnings into line with analysts’ expectations. Net income rose to $975m, or $1.50 a share, from $882m, or $1.32, a year earlier, on record quarterly sales and revenues of $12.1bn, 10 per cent higher than the fourth quarter of 2006.Analysts had been expecting earnings per share of $1.49.For 2007 overall, net profit rose very slightly to $3.54bn – just $4m up from 2006 – although earnings per share rose 4 per cent to $5.37, on an 8 per cent increase in sales to nearly $45bn.“I’m very pleased with our overall 8 per cent growth in sales and revenues in a year when end markets in the United States were so weak,” Jim Owens, Caterpillar’s chief executive, said in a statement.“When you consider that North American dealers took machine inventories down $1.1bn in 2007, our sales story is even more impressive.”The group’s sanguine view of international conditions prompted it to maintain its outlook for 2008, with sales and revenues expected to increase by 5-10 per cent and earnings per share increasing 5-15 per cent from 2007.“It’s gratifying to be able to maintain an outlook for 2008 that reflects continued growth and all-time records for sales and revenues and profit at a time when we’re expecting recessionary conditions to persist in key markets we serve in the United States,” Mr Owens said.“While we expect anaemic growth in the US economy, we continue to see positive conditions for our sales in most of the rest of the world.”Machinery sales in the US this year fell 11 per cent against a jump in revenues in Europe and the Middle East, where sales increased by 38 per cent from 2006 on the back of construction and drilling in oil-rich states. Sales rose 31 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region and 24 per cent in Latin America.In the US, “reduced profitability and tighter credit likely caused some users to delay replacement purchases” in housing and mining industries, Caterpillar said.In non-residential construction, Caterpillar said contracts for new building declined about 2 per cent in 2007, and employment weakened in the second half of the year as projects were hit by tighter standards for commercial and industrial loans, and higher corporate bond spreads.The group expects 1 per cent economic growth in the US this year and sees housing starts falling by a further 19 per cent, to 1.1m. It also foresees a decline in non-residential building.Caterpillar shares were 1.4 per cent higher at $66.15 by midday in New York.
453;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-01-20T16:56:01Z;Business drives funds’ investment strategy;;When it comes to M&A, the Americans seem to have a misconception that the Arabs and Chinese are about to start acting like the Japanese during the 1980s.Back then, Japanese companies descended into the US, spending lavish amounts of cash on trophy assets such as Columbia Pictures, the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores and the Rockefeller Center.The hue and cry from US legislators was almost identical to the one they are experiencing today about the possibility of sovereign wealth funds controlling their assets.But this is where the similarity ends.Unlike the Japanese companies, which wanted full control, the Arabs and Chinese are content to hand over their cash and let the Americans keep running the show.So, whereas in the 1980s the Americans feared that the Japanese semiconductor makers were plotting some sinister takeover of the memory chip business, they didn’t even blink when Mubadala, the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, took an 8.1 per cent passive stake in Advanced Micro Devices in December.The Japanese did eventually work out the best strategy for buying into America and, during the 1990s, they returned to the US to form alliances, such as the one struck between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Caterpillar.Their new-found circumspection paid off.In 2006, Toshiba managed to buy Westinghouse, the US power plant company – without so much as a squeak from politicians or shareholders – and even promised to keep it as a separate business for a few years, making only minimal changes among employees and senior executives.The Arab and Chinese funds are not in the midst of a stealthy takeover of Wall Street or America Inc.It is less a political move and more of a shrewd business move by the Arab and Chinese state investment funds to deploy their wealth of reserves by buying passive stakes on the cheap.Also, although they are highly sophisticated investors, they are not in a position to transfer large numbers of staff to a new acquisition, monitor the performance, regulate its activities, sign off the annual reports and do all the day-to-day micro managing required.Apart from anything else, when an investment goes wrong, they can blame the Americans.
454;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2008-01-04T22:49:16Z;US stocks fall sharply on recession fears;;Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Friday after weak employment data raised fears that the US economy could tip into recession, capping a torrid start to 2008 for US equities.Traders expecting a New Year bounce were sorely disappointed and instead investors this week geared up for an economic downturn by selling stocks exposed to the US consumer.A spike in commodity prices encouraged traders to seek refuge in energy and some mining stocks but industrial and transport companies were punished amid the threat of higher costs. Technology firms, financials and homebuilders were also pummelled as confidence in the outlook for the US economy subsided.The S&P 500 fell 2.5 per cent to 1,411.63 on Friday, marking a decline of 3.9 per cent for the first three days of the trading year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.5 per cent to 12,800.18 for the first three trading days of January. US blue-chips on Wednesday posted their worst start to the year since 1983.The Nasdaq Composite fared particularly poorly, sliding 3.8 per cent to 2,504.65 on Friday and down 5.6 per cent since the New Year. Hardware companies were sold amid concerns about corporate tech spending and chipmakers fell following brokerage downgrades.The Nasdaq has fallen more than 10 per cent from its October high, a “market correction” in trader parlance. Small-cap stocks also had a poor run with the Russell 2000 falling 5.8 per cent since the New Year to hit a 15-month low.Stocks ended the the week on a sour note after unemployment jumped to 5 per cent, its highest since November 2005. Meanwhile non-farm payrolls rose much less than expected.Traders were wary of a weak jobs number as many analysts consider falling employment a leading indicator of an economic downturn.“If you start to have an uptick in unemployment it can cause a domino effect and the Fed has to deal with that aggressively,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said.However, the prospect of more rate cuts failed to stem the sell-off as fears of a recession caused stocks sensitive to the US consumer to plunge.Consumer discretionary stocks, which include leading US retailers, hoteliers, homebuilders and restaurant chains, have suffered a miserable start to 2008.The sector officially entered a “bear market” this week having fallen more than 20 per cent below its previous market peak. Leading the rout were retailers including Macy’s and JC Penney, the department store operators, which fell 13.4 per cent to $22.40 and 14 per cent to $37.64 respectively. Fastfood chains were hit after Wendy’s, the burger chain said December same-store sales declined. Its shares have fallen 9.7 per cent to $23.34 in 2008.Transport stocks, another bellwether of economic sentiment, were sold as crude oil prices surged, threatening to hamper profitability.YRC Worldwide, a trucking company, fell 26.2 per cent to $12.62 over the period after Fitch Ratings cut its debt to junk. Goodyear Tire & Rubber, a company reliant on the transport sector, fell 12.9 per cent to $24.58.Industrials came under pressure after an index of December manufacturing activity contracted unexpectedly this week. Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, has fallen 5.6 per cent to $68.53 since the New Year.Ford hit a 22-year low, falling 8.9 per cent to $6.13, after Toyota overtook the vehicle manufacturer to claim the number two spot in the US market amid some disappointing December sales from US carmakers.Technology stocks were another disappointment with chipmakers particularly weak. Intel fell 15 per cent to $22.67 over the period after JPMorgan downgraded the stock on concerns about slowing orders. Investors seeking respite from the downward trend looked to large-cap multinationals with a high proportion of international sales. Coca-Cola has risen 0.8 per cent to $61.85 since the new year.Traders also bought shares in the agribusiness sector. Monsanto has put on 7.1 per cent to $119.63 for 2008 after it almost trebled first quarter net income and raised its full-year earnings guidance.Energy companies also outperformed as oil prices boosted earnings expectations. Superior Energy Services won a $750 contract to decommission rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and it rose 24.8 per cent to $42.95.Record gold prices helped mining stocks. Newmont Mining rose 7.4 per cent to $52.42, while Yamana Gold added 14.4 per cent to $14.80.
455;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-12-18T23:22:36Z;US manufacturers warned on insularity;;The beleaguered US manufacturing sector is in danger of suffering another blow, with nearly one in three companies at risk of going out of business unless they engage more with the global economy, the sector’s trade body will warn on Wednesday.A survey of small and medium-sized US manufacturers – co-sponsored by the National Association of Manufacturers and RSM McGladrey, the consultants – found that about 30 per cent reported no sales outside the US and do not purchase any materials or components internationally.More than 60 per cent said less than 10 per cent of their sales or their components came from abroad.“These manufacturers are at risk,” said John Engler, president of Nam. “If they don’t get into the international marketplace, they’ll find it increasingly difficult to survive.”Small and medium-sized com­panies, those employing fewer than 2,000 workers, account for 40 per cent of all US manufacturing production and make up 99 per cent of US manufacturing com­panies, according to Nam.Over the past 15 years, US manufacturers have lost thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in sales to rivals from low-cost developing countries. Large manufacturers such as General Electric, Caterpillar and Deere have offset falling sales at home by increasing their market share internationally, driven by growth in emerging economies and the weak dollar. The report suggests smaller companies are failing to keep up.“Small and medium-sized manufacturers in Europe are much more export-oriented than American firms,” said Frank Vargo, Nam’s vice-president for international economic affairs.The organisation will also urge manufacturers to take advantage of recent concerns about Chinese products to stress the quality of their goods and processes.The report will suggest immediate action to exploit this sentiment. “As regulators take harder looks at imports, particularly from China, SMMs [small and medium manufacturers] need to strike now – and offer competitively priced products with the service and support levels that ­customers can’t get from manufacturers in low-cost regions,” it says.Tony Raimondo, who turned Behlen Manufacturing, an agricultural equipment-maker in Nebraska that employs 1,100 people, from a loss-making company into a profitable venture by refocusing on global opportunities, said he wasnot surprised at the sector’s lack of global engagement.“If you’re a small manufacturer your day-to-day challenges tend to be overwhelming,” he said. “That makes it hard to say: ‘On top of all this, I need to go overseas and do things that I don’t have any idea how to do.’ ”
456;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-12-18T04:00:59Z;Dealmaking does little to dispel gloom;;A spate of deal-making failed to dispel the gloom on Wall Street on Monday as fears of an economic slowdown and rising prices sapped confidence from investors.The US Federal Reserve began a $20bn term loan auction in an attempt to ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets, but stocks extended last week’s losses amid concerns it may not be enough to end the credit squeeze.The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent lower at 1,445.91 points, for a fall of 4.6 per cent in the past week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 13,167.20. The Nasdaq Composite index declined 2.3 per cent to 2,574.46, a three-week low, after Internet and software stocks felt heavy selling pressure. Baidu.com, the Chinese search engine, fell 9.4 per cent to $356.Roger Volz, chief technical strategist at Swiss American Securities, said that as the end of the year approached hedge funds were “looking to push the button and lock in profits”.Shares in energy and mining groups fell after commodity prices waned but transport stocks outperformed as crude oil prices slipped. “We have been in a trading range market for five months – a tug of war between ‘recession’ and ‘no recession’,” Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said.Mergers and acquisitions returned to the agenda, led by Ingersoll-Rand, the diversified manufacturer, which agreed to acquire Trane, the heating and air conditioning systems company in a deal valued at $10.1bn. Ingersoll’s shares fell 11.4 per cent to $43.60 and Trane’s stock soared 21.6 per cent to $45.24.National Oilwell Varco agreed to buy Grant Prideco, the drill pipe supplier, for about $7.4bn in cash and stock. Grant’s shares rose 13.6 per cent to $53.91 but its buyer fell 8.6 per cent to $70.69.Bristol-Myers Squibb, down 1 per cent at $27.81, said it would sell a medical imaging unit to Avista Capital Partners, a private equity group, while Plains Exploration & Production, up 1.6 per cent at $55.17, said it would sell some oil and gas properties for $1.75bn.Loews, the US conglomerate, approved a spin-off of its interest in Lorillard, owner of the Newport and Kent brands, to form a separate publicly traded company.Loews’ shares rose 2.4 per cent to $47.94.A slowdown in merger and acquisition activity, particularly in private equity, has helped to depress the share prices of smaller companies by slashing takeover premiums. The Russell 2000 small-cap index, down 2 per cent at 745.11, has fallen 6.2 per cent this year.Although buyout firms have been hit by the tightening in credit markets, many companies remain flush with cash, as the popularity of share buybacks illustrates.Shares in Harley Davidson rose 1.5 per cent to $45.62, after the motorcycle group approved the repurchase of up to 20m shares.Investors were keeping an eye on the leading investment banks amid fears of further writedowns.Goldman Sachs, down 1 per cent at $208.63, reports quarterly results on Tuesday while Morgan Stanley, down 1.5 per cent at $49.53, releases fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow with Bear Stearns, 1.3 per cent weaker at $94.07, set to follow on Thursday.Citigroup on Monday downgraded a range of consumer finance companies, including Capital One Financial, the credit card provider. The shares fell 3.3 per cent to $45.66.“We expect consumer lenders/insurers to face further credit challenges as home prices decline 3 per cent to 5 per cent in each of the next two years, mortgage rates reset and the macro-economy slows,” said Bradley Ball, a Citi analyst.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, rebounded 16.9 per cent to $26.66 after Moody’s affirmed its AAA rating.In the industrial sector, Caterpillar fell 3 per cent to $71.16 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the heavy equipment maker. llinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, fell 6.1 per cent to $52.49 after it lowered its fourth quarter earnings guidance.Mr Volz said markets could expect further big price moves prior to Friday’s so-called quadruple witching, the quarterly expiration of contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures: “It bodes for a lot more volatility than normal.”
457;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-11-07T22:00:38Z;Fears rise of ‘earnings recession’;;Wall Street analysts are rapidly losing faith in US companies’ ability to rekindle profit growth before the end of the year, raising the prospect of the first “earnings recession” – two consecutive quarters of falling profits – in more than five years.Mounting troubles in the financial sector have led analysts to reduce sharply their forecasts for earnings growth in the final quarter of the year.In the past month, fourth-quarter earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 have fallen by nearly half, according to Thomson Financial. Wall Street now expects earnings in the fourth quarter to increase 6.1 per cent over a year earlier, down from 11.9 per cent at the start of October.The downgraded expectations have confounded hopes that, after a disappointing third quarter, companies would exploit a weak dollar and solid global growth to record strong earnings in the last three months of 2007.Analysts warn that prolonged earnings weakness could undermine the confidence of the stock market, whose current resilience has largely been attributed to expectations of strong profits.“If the debt crisis is contained, then investors can accept a lower expected growth rate in earnings as they cast the blame on the financials,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “But if it spreads, then the market has a problem.”The deterioration in the profit outlook is mainly due to the bigger-than-expected write-downs by large financial groups such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch as a result of the turmoil in the credit markets.The energy and consumer discretionary sectors have also experienced a sharp decline in third-quarter earnings. Analysts, however, still expect a rebound in the fourth quarter.In contrast, the financial sector, which comprises 20 per cent of the S&P 500, saw a decline of 16 per cent in year-on-year profits during the third quarter, and now faces a slide of 9 per cent for the last three months of the year. At the start of the fourth quarter, analysts expected a rise of 1 per cent in earnings for financials.More than a third of the 87 financial companies that have reported third-quarter earnings missed Wall Street expectations, according to Reuters Estimates.The disappointing results have dispelled the notion that banks would absorb all the pain of the credit squeeze during the current quarter and prompted analysts to expect more bad news over the next three months.Lower earnings in the energy sector, fragile consumer confidence ahead of the retail holiday season and profit warnings from industrial groups like Caterpillar, which last month rattled the market with its prediction that the US is “near to, or even in, recession”, contributed to Wall Street’s sour mood.Third-quarter blended earnings, which include actual and estimated results for the S&P 500, are down 2.7 per cent year-on-year, Thomson said. A fall in profits in the fourth quarter would represent the first earnings recession since the period between the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.“Caterpillar was the tipping point,” said Joseph Quinlan, chief investment strategist at Bank of America. “Weaker-than-expected US profits are dragging down earnings. Without the strength in the global economy we would already be in an earnings recession.”
458;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;P&G chief plays down recession talk;;AG Lafley, chief executive of Procter & Gamble, on Tuesday played down the threat of an imminent US recession, saying that while there had been some slowing of US sales growth, demand for P&G’s branded products remained resilient.“We do relatively better in a recession, and no one is predicting recession right now …it is not clear that there is going to be one,” he said in a discussion of P&G’s first-quarter results.“What we are seeing is a little bit of softness in some of the markets, but they’re still growing.”This month, Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, said it put the chance of a US recession next year at 50-50.P&G, the world’s largest consumer goods company, said that more than 75 per cent of its products gained market share in the US during its recently completed first quarter, indicating that consumers are not opting for lower cost generic alternatives to products such as Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Ivory soap. “The private label [market] shares are as weak as they’ve been this decade,” Mr Lafley said.Gillette’s top-line Fusion razor, for example, increased its US market share 4 percentage points during the quarter. Olay facial moisturisers gained 1 per cent.P&G said it was confident that it would be able to pass on planned price increases due to higher commodity prices on products ranging from Pampers nappies to fabric softener over coming months. P&G said that any slowing in the US was being offset by growth in international sales, which accounted for 54 per cent of its revenues last year.The weak dollar also contributed to an 8 per cent increase in sales during its first quarter to $20.2bn, while net earnings grew 14 per cent to $3.1bn, or 92 cents per diluted share.Organic sales, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, rose 5 per cent, in line with the company’s target growth range of 4-6 per cent.P&G’s shares fell more than 3 per cent to $69 after the results and outlook failed to beat Wall Street’s forecasts.
459;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US results point to weaker economy;;US companies on Tuesday underlined the resilience of their international operations but failed to dispel fears that the slowing domestic economy would weigh on future earnings.Third quarter results released by a raft of large US groups showed that the weaker dollar and global economic growth are helping parts of corporate America to cushion the blow of the housing downturn and liquidity squeeze.The chemical maker DuPont became the latest company with large overseas sales to report strong profit growth and a bullish outlook for next year.The company said that, although it expected the US housing market to remain depressed in 2008, profit growth would come from rising international demand, particularly for its agricultural products.The stock market took heart from DuPont’s comments, as well as strong results released by Apple and American Express on Monday after the closing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.16 per cent higher in midday New York trading, while the S&P 500 was also in positive territory.However, Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, saw its shares slip five per cent after missing analysts’ estimates on weak US sales and issuing bearish predictions for the near-term future of its domestic business.Meanwhile, UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, predicted that domestic retail sales would rise at its slowest pace in four years.Scott Davis, UPS chief financial officer, who is to become chief executive on January 1, told the FT that high energy prices and falling housing prices are “bound to put pressure on the consumer”.However, UPS said a gradual rebound in industrial production would quicken the pace of US economic expansion to around 2.5 per cent in 2008.Other companies, such as the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, have been less sanguine, warning the economy was heading for a recession.Unlike its arch-rival FedEx, which cut its earnings forecasts for the rest of the year due to the slowing US economy, UPS expects to earn $4.13 to $4.19 a share in 2007, within the range of estimates provided to investors at the start of the year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.64 per cent to 13,522.Fears about the creditworthiness of US companies also grew.The difference in yields between high-yield bonds and government debt rose 39 basis points during the week to 420bp, the biggest weekly jump since late July. Investors sought the safety of government bonds, pushing the yield on the two-year Treasury note down 13bp to 3.78 per cent. The futures market put the chances of a quarter percentage point cut by the Federal Reserve at the end of this month at 92 per cent – up from 30 per cent at the start of the week.“Concerns about bank earnings and credit have got the bond market thinking the Fed will make another insurance ease,” said Rick Klingman, interest rate trader at BNP Paribas.The spectre of rate cuts also pushed the dollar to record lows against the euro.

The index was down 3.9 per cent on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.7 per cent on Friday and 4.1 per cent for the week, at 13,521.29.The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.7 per cent on Friday and 2.9 per cent for the week at 2,725.16.Small cap stocks suffered some of the biggest falls. The Russell 2000 index was 5 per cent lower this week at 798.78. All the leading 10 sectors of the S&P 500 were lower this week.Technology groups continued to outperform the market, while financials and consumer discretionary sectors fared worst. Consumer staples performed best – a traditional bellwether of negative economic sentiment. Traders expect continued volatility in share prices. The Chicago Board Options Exchange VIX index rose 28.5 per cent this week to 22.79. “Earnings have been mixed,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said. “The worry is that the US economy has declined more than anticipated.”Bluechip companies led the heavy falls on Friday amid continuing concerns about the outlook for corporate earnings.Caterpillar fell 8.4 per cent at $73.57 on the week after it cut its full-year outlook and warned that a number of industries it serves were in recession.The company added to fears that housing market problems are spreading to other parts of the economy after blaming the weak construction market for a fall in US machinery and engine sales. However, it posted a 21 per cent rise in quarterly profits.3M fell 8.1 per cent on the week at $86.62 on concerns about falling margins on the optical films it sells for LCD television screens. The shares fell even as 3M reported a 7.4 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings and raised its profit outlook for the full year. But revenues missed expectations.Honeywell’s results narrowly missed expectations. The blue chip’s shares were down 5.5 per cent on the week at $58.32.Wachovia capped a bad week for financial stocks as the bank reported a 10 per cent dip in third quarter profit, with results hit by writedowns amid the credit markets turbulence. Shares fell 8.4 per cent this week at $46.40. Citigroup fell 11.5 per cent on the week at $42.36 after it reported a 57 per cent fall in quarterly profit as writedowns linked to subprime mortgages, leveraged loans and fixed-income trading topped $3bn.Bank of America, off 8.6 per cent at $47.57, added to sector woes when it revealed a 32 per cent fall in third-quarter earnings and set aside $2.03bn in credit-loss provisions. Washington Mutual was down 17.4 per cent at $29.09 after its earnings fell 72 per cent in the third quarter. E*Trade Financial, down 21.4 per cent at $10.71, and KeyCorp, 13.1 per cent lower at $28.69, both disappointed investors this week.The S&P financial index declined 7.6 per cent this week at 439.57, while the investment bank index fell 8.7 per cent at 195.86. Technology stocks had mixed fortunes. Google hit a record high but Ebay fell. Credit Suisse raised its price target on Google to $800 after it increased profit 46 per cent and revenues grew 57 per cent in the third quarter. The shares were up 1.1 per cent on the week at $644.71.Intel was up 2.9 per cent at $26.30 after third-quarter profit rose 43 per cent. Revenues rose 15 per cent. Yahoo, up 1.9 per cent at $29.03, also cheered investors after reporting a smaller than anticipated earnings fall.But Ebay was 8 per cent lower at $36.72 on the week after it reported a big third quarter loss because of the writedown of Skype, its web-based phone service and amid worries about fee cuts.Fast food restaurants also experienced divergent fortunes. McDonald’s, was only 1 per cent weaker at $56.42 after it increased third-quarter profit 27 per cent.

462;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-10-16T23:43:16Z;Paulson warns of damage to come;;Hank Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, warned on Tuesday that the downturn in the nation’s mortgage market would burden the economy “for some time” as several big banks, the largest homebuilder and a major construction equipment maker all highlighted the growing impact of the housing decline.Mr Paulson’s grim remarks came as James Owens, CEO of Caterpillar, the equipment maker, called the current housing decline the worst since the second world war. DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder, said nearly half its orders were cancelled in the last quarter.Taken together with discouraging bank earnings, the housing news helped push stocks lower and bond prices higher as investors worried about the possibility of a US economic slowdown.The yield on the policy-sensitive two-year Treasury note fell 9 basis points to 4.125 per cent – the biggest drop since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points on September 18. As leading bank stocks tumbled, the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.5 per cent to 13,912.94.Wells Fargo, the second-biggest US mortgage lender, reported rising losses on home equity and credit card loans and saw its shares fall 4 per cent. The bank said it would cut back on the amount it allows consumers to borrow against the value of their homes, threatening a key pillar of US consumer spending and economic growth. Wells Fargo said net credit losses increased 35 per cent from last year to $892m.Shares in KeyCorp fell 6 per cent after the big Cleveland-based bank reported a 27 per cent earnings drop owing to higher loss provisions and falling value of the mortgages it holds. Citigroup shares fell 3 per cent and Bank of America lost 2 per cent.Mr Paulson said the housing downturn would “continue to adversely impact our economy, our capital markets, and many homeowners for some time yet.” He added that the “ongoing housing correction is not ending as quickly as it might have appeared late last year”.Mr Paulson said he believed the US economy remained healthy and would continue to grow, but added that housing could still produce surprises.“Despite strong fundamentals, the housing decline is still unfolding and I view it as the most significant current risk to our economy. The longer housing prices remain stagnant or fall, the greater the penalty to our future economic growth.”Mr Paulson’s comments echoed remarks on Monday from Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman.A monthly survey from the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo indicated that confidence among homebuilders had hit its lowest point in more than 20 years.The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, which gauges perceptions of current single-family home sales and sales expectations, fell to 18, the lowest point since the survey began in 1985. Figures below 50 mean more builders are reporting “poor” sales than “good” sales.Sales of houses and condominiums in southern California, where the market had been booming, fell 30 per cent in September from the previous month and nearly 50 per cent from last year, DataQuick Information Systems, which monitors house sales, reported on Tuesday. Sales in six big southern California counties fell to 12,455 last month, the lowest number since it began compiling data in 1988.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie and Daniel Pimlott in New York

The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent at 2,708.12 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 13,911.80, within 0.6 per cent of its all-time high.Stocks were earlier depressed by a fresh blow to the housing market as new home sales dropped to their lowest level in seven years.New-build sales fell 8.3 per cent in August to 795,000. Analysts had anticipated a
5 per cent decline. New home sales have fallen 21 per cent in the last year.The median home sale value fell 7.5 per cent from $246,200 to $225,000, its lowest since January 2005. There were 1.5 per cent fewer homes on the market, but they are taking longer to sell. The inventory of unsold new homes would take 8.2 months to clear at the current pace of sales, the longest since March.“Homebuilders have engaged in some aggressive price cuts to try to move their bloated inventories, and this showed up in a plunge in average prices,” economists at Morgan Stanley noted. “Inventories will need to be brought down into the five- to six-month range to restore some balance to the market.”The S&P homebuilders index rallied in afternoon trade to close 2.2 per cent higher at 410.64 but is down around 10 per cent over the past week.KB Home underscored problems in the housing market after it swung to a third-quarter loss. In the three months to August 31, KB fell to a $35.6m loss, compared with a profit of $153.2m in the same period last year. The shares also rallied to close 2.6 per cent higher at $24.71.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill, owner of S&P, saw big gains , up 6.3 at $50.37 and 4.8 per cent at $52.09 respectively, after the credit rating agencies convincingly answered questions before the Senate banking committee about their role in the sub-prime mortgage crisis.Elsewhere stocks remained buoyant, reflecting investors’ expectations of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.On Thursday the futures market was predicting an 88 per cent likelihood of a 25 basis point cut at the end of next month. That has placed a floor under the market, say traders. The rebound in stocks in the past week has caught some bearish investors offguard, and as the end of the month and the quarter looms, money managers are boosting their exposure to equities. “Some funds that were behind are now putting money to work,” said Anthony Conroy, managing director at BNYConvergex Group.In other economic news weekly jobless claims fell 15,000 to 298,0000, the lowest level since May 12 and much better than the 315,000 reading expected by economists.The latest estimate of gross domestic product for the second quarter showed the economy grew at a 3.8 per cent annual rate. That was weaker than the previously reported 4 per cent rise in growth, although the downward revision was expected by investors.Inflation measures were a touch higher, with the price index for personal consumption up 4.3 per cent versus the prior estimate of a 4.2 per cent rise and a gain of 3.5 per cent during the first quarter. The core PCE, a gauge that excludes food and energy, rose 1.4 per cent, higher than a prior reading of 1.3 per cent.Insurance stocks saw gains on Thursday after an analyst at Goldman Sachs raised his third-quarter profit estimates on the sector citing a mild hurricane season.Among the leading 10 sectors on the S&P 500, energy, materials, technology and industrials once again dominated advances.Equity investors are pursuing stocks with international exposure, traders say, as the dollar again fell to a record low against a basket of currencies.The S&P materials index climbed 1 per cent to 261.79. It has gained around 17 per cent since the credit squeeze hit in August. Energy stocks also saw late gains after crude oil jumped $2.58 to $82.88.Caterpillar, up 1.1 per cent at $77.47, and Alcoa, 1.4 per cent higher at $39.00, led gains on the Dow.

The province is the focus of the group’s efforts to double revenues in China by 2010 from about $1bn last year. It already has a joint venture in Guangdong province to make larger engines for the marine market, as well as excavators, pavers and related components. “We are adding capacity to meet increased global demand,” Caterpillar said.The first phase of the new project, in a joint venture with IHI Shibaura Machinery, will focus on small Perkins-branded engines for use in tractors and construction vehicles produced by manufacturers in the region.The US group will hold 70 per cent of the new project in a partnership stemming from its 1997 acquisition of Perkins, the UK-based engine maker, which also manufactures equipment with IHI Shibaura in Europe and the US.Perkins Shibaura Engines has a non-binding agreement with the Wuxi National High-Tech Development Zone, and hopes to start building the plant next year, delivering the first engines in late 2009. Output is expected to increase to more than 100,000 a year with the addition of larger engines for use in Caterpillar’s own product range.Western manufacturers have struggled over the past year to secure regulatory approval for deals with Chinese machinery makers but Tuesday’s announcement marks the latest in a recent flurry of joint ventures and acquisitions in the sector.Caterpillar, like rival John Deere, secures half its revenues from outside the US and has been one of the loudest advocates for trade liberalisation at a time when the trade deficit has strengthened calls in Congress for more restrictive deals.
465;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-07-24T20:53:56Z;Foreign earnings save US blue chips;;"Foreign earnings came to the rescue of a slew of US multinationals on Tuesday, offsetting weakness in the domestic economy and highlighting their growing reliance on the rest of the world.Several blue chips that reported second-quarter earnings said their international business had outshone their US operations. They included UPS, the logistics group; DuPont, the chemical maker; PepsiCo, the soft-drinks maker; and United Airlines.The one sector that bucked the trend was defence, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, among the biggest suppliers of aircraft, missiles and information systems to the Pentagon, beating Wall Street estimates.But the results season has been characterised by the increased importance of US companies’ international operations, which have been helped by the weakness in the dollar and rapid growth in emerging markets.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate, derives about half its sales from overseas and Caterpillar and IBM have both shown strong growth in international sales.UPS, often cited as a bellwether for the US economy, reported better-than-expected profits, lifted by strong performance in its international business. The 4.6 per cent rise in the daily number of packages it delivered internationally helped compensate for a decline of 0.2 per cent in the US.Rival FedEx has also been buoyed by growth abroad.DuPont cited weakness in the US housing and car markets as factors in second-quarter earnings missing analysts’ expectations.

466;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar results deepen fears of slowdown;;Caterpillar deepened fears of a US economic slowdown on Friday when it reported a sharp fall in profits, missing Wall Street estimates, due to weakness at its North American operations.The heavy equipment and truck engine maker, a bellwether for the US economy, saw its shares fall nearly 10 per cent during the day, despite recording record sales for the quarter and issuing an upbeat assessment of its international operations.The stock, which had reached an all-time high on Thursday, ended 4.4 per cent down at $83.20, contributing to a 1 per cent slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index.The unexpectedly weak performance of Caterpillar’s US operations come amid growing worries that the problems in the domestic housing market could spill over to the rest of the economy.The company admitted the 21 per cent fall in profits was “disappointing” and blamed it on problems in the diesel truck market, weakness in US sales of heavy machinery, higher material costs and continued disruptions to its supply chain.However, the Illinois-based group boosted its forecast for full-year sales, saying that its international operations, which account for about half of its turnover, would grow 25 per cent this year.It reaffirmed its target for full-year profit but said it had “more work to do on costs” and hinted that it might rein back capital expenditure.Caterpillar’s mixed outlook reflects the increasing discrepancy between a slowing US economy and booming international markets.A number of large US manufactures such as General Electric, Honeywell and Whirlpool, the white goods maker that also reported results on Friday, have been relying on exports to offset a slowdown in the domestic market.The US manufacturing sector has been weighed down by a 20 per cent reduction in house building, partly offset by rising non-residential activity, and weak demand in the auto sector.However, analysts said the higher-than- expected June report of the ISM index of manufacturing activity suggested that domestic business conditions were improving, while overseas sales remained strong.In the three months to June, Caterpillar reported net profits of $823m, compared to $1.04bn in the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.24, well below analysts’ expectations of $1.49 per share. Sales rose 7 per cent to a record $11.36bn in the June quarter, with full-year guidance of $44bn at the top end of its existing range.
467;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-07-20T21:18:10Z;Wall St down as financials suffer;;"Wall Street endured a volatile week as a march into record territory was abruptly terminated by disappointing earnings results from bellwether stocks.Late on Thursday, the S&P 500 set a record close of 1,553.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 points for the first time.The champagne corks had barely popped when Google and Microsoft delivered quarterly results that punctured the bullish mood.Further gloom was cast on Friday when Caterpillar, a leading Dow stock this year, said net profit fell 21 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2006. The stock fell 4.4 per cent to $83.20 on Friday, after hitting an earlier low of $789.26.Caterpillar weighed on the Dow, which closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,850.67, a fall of 0.4 per cent this week.On Friday, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,687.60, a decline of 0.7 per cent this week. The Nasdaq is up 11.3 per cent for 2007.Google slid 5.2 per cent to $520.12 and Microsoft fell 1.1 per cent to $31.16 on Friday, after it had made a 52-week high of $31.84 on Thursday.The S&P closed 1.2 per cent lower at 1,534.08, and also declined 1.2 per cent for the week.Among the benchmark’s broad sectors, healthcare, telecoms and consumer stocks fell, but the worst performing group was financials, down 3.5 per cent.Sharp underperformance by financial stocks cast a shadow over the overall market throughout the week.The S&P investment bank and brokerage sub-index slumped 7.2 per cent this week and was at its lowest level since early April.Fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market remained a main talking point among investors this week.Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that losses from mortgages could total between $50bn and $100bn.That came after Bear Stearns said late on Tuesday that subprime mortgage-
related assets held by two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless. Bear fell 5.7 per cent to $134.72 this week and is down 17.2 per cent for the year.While the earnings results of several banks beat estimates this week, JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America all increased their provision for bad loans in the future. “If [subprime mortgage] problems linger and are a gnawing source of uncertainty, that will be a worry for equity investors,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“Markets hate uncertainty,” Mr Ruskin said, “[but] arguably the credit correction continues to be remarkably well absorbed by other markets.”However, the rising cost of issuing corporate bonds does not bode well for deal activity argue analysts.“Although the boom in private equity may not be over, it is certainly taking a rest,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.They noted that PowerShares Listed Private Equity Portfolio, an exchange-traded fund, that invests in publicly traded companies that act like private equity firms, has fallen sharply since peaking in early June at $29.33. The ETF fell 3.65 per cent to $26.69 this week.Another signal of equity risk appetite diminishing this week was the poor after-market performance of two initial public offerings.Shares in Orbitz traded lower at $14.50 on their debut on Friday. The online travel booker sold 34m shares at $15 a share, lower than the expected price range of $16-$18.A similar fate befell the listing of MF Global, a derivatives brokerage spun off by Man Group, the hedge-fund titan.MF Global listed at $30 a share, below an expected $36-$39 range, and never rose above $30 in trading once it debuted on Thursday. On Friday the stock was trading at $26.55.Among this week’s array of earnings, Juniper Networks lit up investor’s eyes when it swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs also upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, and it rose 9.2 per cent to $30.40 this week.Sentiment for technology stocks was buffeted by a mix of disappointing earnings and guidance from Intel, down 5.5 per cent at $24.55, Yahoo, off 4.6 per cent at $25.35, and eBay, lower by 1.2 per cent at $33.53.By contrast, IBM’s quarterly results beat estimates and big blue set a five-year high of $116.88, up 5.7 per cent at $114.81 this week.Deal news lifted Plains Exploration, which is to buy Pogo, a rival oil and gas company, for $3.6bn in cash and stock. Pogo rallied 11.4 per cent to $57.95, while Plains fell 5.7 per cent to $48.55.IHOP, the restaurant chain operator, said it would buy Applebee’s for about $1.9bn, or $25.50 a share. Applebee’s rose 1.6 per cent to $24.77, while IHOP surged 14.6 per cent to $64.46 this week.Buy-backs were in focus after Rohm & Hass, a speciality chemicals and plastics company, was upgraded by brokers after it announced a $2bn share repurchase plan. The stock rose 6.8 per cent to $59.69."
468;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
469;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-07-19T21:24:52Z;S&P 500, Dow close at all-time high;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday as positive sentiment in the technology sector helped investors shrug off fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market.The bullish mood propelled the S&P 500 to a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 for the first time.Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, told US lawmakers that losses from the subprime mortgage market could range between $50bn and $100bn.Leading the major benchmarks was the Nasdaq Composite, with a gain of 0.8 per cent to 2,720.04. One boost for the tech sector was a 12.5 per cent surge to $30.06 in Juniper Networks shares after the networking equipment maker swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, in the expectation that strong sales growth would boost operating margins.Cisco rose 1.7 per cent to $29.94 and had set a 52-week high of $30.So far this year, the Nasdaq’s gain of 12.6 per cent has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the Nasdaq 100 has rallied 16.8 per cent. In a bull market, the more volatile technology stocks led the way as they enable investors to reap higher returns.“It’s no surprise that high beta stocks are doing well in this current rally,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “People who have missed some of the rally, and are forced to chase returns, can get back in the race by buying high beta names.”Another factor in favour of the tech sector is that international sales form a larger proportion of total sales, say analysts. A faster growing global economy in conjunction with a sharply weaker dollar is a fillip for the sector and multinational blue chip companies.But a sour note for techs was struck by Ebay, which fell 1.6 per cent to $33.50, after the online auctioneer posted a 50 per cent rise in quarterly profit, but left its outlook for 2007 unchanged. Investors had hoped for a rise in guidance and also focused on lower global listings.After the closing bell Google reported a 28 per cent rise in second quarter profits that missed estimates as higher costs eroded better-than-expected revenue growth. Google slumped more than 6 per cent in post-market trade.Also after the close, Microsoft met earnings estimates and raised guidance. Microsoft initially rallied in after-hours action, following a gain of 1.9 per cent to $31.51 in regular trade.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices reported a loss in the second quarter as a rise in sales for the chip maker was offset by lower microprocessor prices and costs associated with the $5.6bn purchase of ATI Technologies, a graphics chip maker. In after-hours trade, the stock rallied further after a rise of 2.1 per cent to $15.87 at the closing bell.The enthusiasm for tech stocks lifted the broad market into record territory. The S&P rose 0.45 per cent to 1,553.07 a new record high. Among the major sectors, utilities, technology and energy led gains, while health care and financials declined.Among the financials, Bank of America said quarterly earnings rose 5 per cent with an increase in the provision for credit losses. BofA has now set aside $1.81bn to cover these losses, up from $1.01bn in the second quarter of 2006. Shares in BofA fell 0.2 per cent to $49.27.PNC Financial, a mid-Atlantic regional bank, said quarterly earnings expanded 11 per cent and was also buying Sterling Financial for $565m, or $19 per share. The stock slipped 2.5 per cent to $71.37.Shares in MF Global fell on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MF closed at $27.55, after the financial firm had listed at $30 a share – lower than the expected range of $36 to $39, traders said.The American Stock Exchange Broker-Dealer index fell 0.75 per cent.Another financial stock in the news was American Home Mortgage Investment. The stock plunged 20.8 per cent to $10.76 as subprime worries among investors intensified and the company did not comment on the sharp decline.Blue chips rallied, led by IBM, and the DJIA rose 0.6 per cent to close at 14,000.41.In earnings news, IBM reported a 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit, and raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock gained 4.3 per cent to $115.86 and had set a new five-year high of $116.48.Another Dow stock, Honeywell, posted a 24 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating estimates. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $60.98 and also reached a seven-year high of $61.90 earlier in the day. The company raised guidance for 2007 and also authorised the buyback of an additional $3bn in stock.Shares in Foot Locker surged 8.6 per cent to $22.71, after the company said it would consider putting itself up for sale. The shoe retailer recently failed to buy rival Genesco.In other earnings, Motorola recorded a quarterly loss amid lower revenue from weak phone sales. Shares rose 1.2 per cent to $18.22.Union Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The railroad slid 0.1 per cent to $125.74.Hershey reported a 96 per cent drop in profits for the past quarter, as the confectionary maker invested in transforming its production lines. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $48.45.Harley Davidson reported a 19 per cent rise in profit and reaffirmed guidance for 2007. But domestic sales of motorcycles fell and the stock slid 2.9 per cent to $59.37.Investors will focus on earnings from two DJIA stocks, Citigroup and Caterpillar on Friday. Citi fell 0.9 per cent to $51.14, while Cat rose 0.9 per cent to $86.42 on Thursday.In economic news on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed survey reported a drop to 9.2 in July from a reading of 18 in June. The six-month outlook index rose 30.4 in July from a reading of 16.7 in June.Economists at Bear Stearns said: “This is a stronger report than suggested by the headline sentiment index.”Later this afternoon the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting in June are released.Earlier in the day, leading indicators for June fell 0.3 per cent, more than a forecast decline of 0.1 per cent.“Housing continues to weigh, a theme that ties in with the concerns Bernanke stated yesterday [Wednesday],” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “However, despite the decline, the trend in the overall index appears to have stabilised after declining early 2006 to a cyclical low in early 2007.”Stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but did pare the worst of their earlier losses.
470;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-07-16T21:09:31Z;Dow rallies, S&P and Nasdaq down;;Wall Street was mixed on Monday as investors trimmed the market’s early gains and adopted a cautious outlook before this week’s earnings reports.With the exception of blue-chips, stocks turned lower by mid-afternoon. Further weakness in the subprime mortgage derivatives market hurt financial, homebuilding and real estate stocks.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,549.52.Earlier in the day, the broad barometer had set a new intra-day record of 1,555.90 before the rally lapsed. Among the main S&P sectors, telecoms and industrial stocks were firmer, while energy, materials and utilities were in negative territory.The slide in the S&P on Monday was accompanied by a rise in equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index, up 2.9 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.4 per cent at 2,697.33 after the benchmark had risen on Monday morning to its highest level since February 2001.Leading the bullish charge on Monday were bluechips. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained in record territory, up 0.3 per cent at 13,950.98. The Dow also set an intra-day record high of 13,989.11. The Dow’s gain for the year of 11.9 per cent now outpaces the Nasdaq’s climb of 11.7 per cent in 2007.Many of the Dow’s 30 components have a strong international presence and the buoyant global economy and weak dollar are expected to boost their quarterly bottom lines.“Companies with higher international exposure are likely to show better earnings growth, which will result in better performance for their stocks,” analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said.The second-quarter reporting season kicks into higher gear on Tuesday, and this week many high-profile companies in the banking, pharmaceuticals and technology sectors will report.Companies whose quarterly results are due on Tuesday include Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Yahoo, Intel and Merrill Lynch.Among groups reporting on Wednesday are Dow constituents United Technologies, which hit a record high of $76.98 on Monday, JPMorgan and Pfizer. Wells Fargo and Ebay are also due on Wednesday.Google, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, Dow Jones, Bank of New York and Bank of America are due to report on Thursday, along with two Dow stocks, IBM – which reached a five- year high of $110.04 on Monday – and Honeywell.Citigroup and Caterpillar, which set a record high of $86.49 on Monday, complete this week’s blue-chip earnings line-up on Friday.With many banks reporting this week, investors are likely to focus on any evidence that problems in the mortgage market are hurting profits.“Continued weakness in mortgage banking, deteriorating credit quality, and a challenging yield curve for most of the quarter make negative earnings surprises more likely than results materially above expectations,” strategists at Barclays Capital said.The S&P financials sector reversed an early rally on Monday and moved back into negative territory for the year to date as mortgage worries flared again.As earnings beckon, technology stocks could extend their strong gains this year. Earlier on Monday, both Apple and Google set record highs on Monday of $139.98 and $558.58 respectively. Analysts at Bespoke noted that technology led other sectors in terms of international sales as a percentage of total sales.“It could be a good quarter for large-cap tech, which explains the performance recently in stocks like Intel and Cisco,” said Bespoke.Citigroup said 2008 consensus earnings estimates for Intel were low and that the chipmaker will “accelerate its current low level of stock buy-back activity”.The bank raised its price target for Intel from $27 to $31. The stock closed 0.1 per cent lower at $25.95 and is up over 28 per cent so far this year.Cisco closed steady at $29.89 on Monday, after setting a 52-week high of $30 in early trade.In deal news on Monday, IHOP, the restaurant chain operator, said it would buy Applebee’s for about $1.9bn, or $25.50 a share. Applebee’s rose 2.2 per cent to $24.91, while IHOP surged 8.9 per cent to $61.24.Verizon rose 2.4 per cent at $42.76 after the Financial Times’ Alphaville blog reported that Vodafone of the UK had considered a $160bn takeover of the US telecoms group.Vodafone said it had no plans for such a deal.In earnings news, Eaton, the diversified manufacturer, rose 2.8 per cent to $100.87.

Mr Bernanke speaks before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and then the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.“We expect a rather dull discussion of the economy and policy outlook,” said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Bernanke will likely face tough questioning on regulation of the mortgage industry and may give an update on the Fed’s communication strategy.”The Fed chairman may also seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained, traders said.“Subprime and wider concerns over credit will not go away, however,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, head of fixed income strategy at Societe Generale. “The Jekyll and Hyde approach of the market to risk persists with emerging market, equities and FX carry trades doing very well, while credit has yet to recover much.“Economic reports due this week include the June producer price index and industrial production on Tuesday. Housing starts and consumer prices for June are due on Wednesday. Leading indicators and the Philadelphia Fed survey arrive on Thursday, followed by the Fed meeting minutes from last month.

Traders believe some investors have been hurt by the recent rally in stocks and that the pain of losses could push prices higher.Late on Friday, data on short positions, sales of stock by speculators, from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicated the largest holding of bearish positions on the S&P since March 2004.The Nasdaq rose 0.2 per cent to close at 2,707 on Friday, its highest level since February 2001.Also this week, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, and then the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.“We expect a rather dull discussion of the economy and policy outlook,” said economists at Lehman Brothers. “Bernanke will likely face tough questioning on regulation of the mortgage industry and may give an update on the Fed’s communication strategy.”The Fed chairman may also seek to reassure the markets that problems in the subprime mortgage market are likely to remain contained, traders said.“Subprime and wider concerns over credit will not go away, however,” said Ciaran O’Hagan, head of fixed income strategy at Societe Generale. “The Jekyll and Hyde approach of the market to risk persists with emerging market, equities and FX carry trades doing very well, while credit has yet to recover much.“Economic reports due next week include the June producer price index and industrial production on Tuesday.

472;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-07-11T22:10:24Z;Wall St rallies but subprime fears remain;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday, but worries over the subprime mortgage market remained the main talking point among investors.“We’re locked in a tight range and subprime is probably going to dominate the news as we have nothing to trade off until Friday’s retail sales report,” said Scott Wren, senior equity analyst at AG Edwards.On Tuesday, Moody’s downgraded a swathe of subprime mortgage-backed bonds, while Standard & Poor’s placed $12bn of such debt on notice of downgrades, sparking further selling of US corporate bonds and widening premiums, or spreads, for derivatives that protect against corporate default.With government bonds continuing to attract safe-haven buying, credit spreads in the US and Europe remained under pressure on Wednesday while the dollar fell to a record low against the euro for the second day in a row.After a cautious start, stocks rose as safe haven buying in Treasury bond lost steam and reversed.At the close, the S&P 500 index was up 0.6 per cent at 1,518.76. Among major sectors, materials, telecoms and industrials led gains.Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, fell 4.8 per cent on Wednesday after a surge of 15.9 per cent on Tuesday.Financials experienced choppy trading.

Goldman Sachs fell 0.2 per cent to $216.72.Investors across a range of markets were watching equities for any sign that credit woes were spreading.“The lack of transparency in the credit market has left many emerging market participants focusing on equities as a better clue to risk aversion and risk liquidation,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich.Meanwhile, investors were also concerned that the US economy might face softer consumer spending if high petrol prices and the weak housing sector were to affect sentiment.“As US economic data show a moderation from the second-quarter rebound, that will add to fears that the economy is moving into a sustained downtrend,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Same store sales for June are due on Thursday and Thomson Financial estimates they will rise 1.8 per cent year-over-year, down from a 2.9 per cent rise in May. In June 2006, sales rose 3 per cent.American Eagle Outfitters said June same-store sales rose 8 per cent after the closing bell on Wednesday and its stock was up 6.5 per cent at $27.73 in after-hours trade.The prospect of weaker consumer growth has heightened the importance of the second-quarter earnings that are due over the next few weeks.The S&P’s decline of 1.4 per cent on Tuesday was the worst one-day slide in the index in more than a month and marked an inauspicious start to the second-quarter earnings season.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said it was the worst start to a quarterly reporting period “since the bull market began in October 2002”.They noted, however, that “a negative first day has had no bearing on the performance of the market for the rest of earnings season”.On Wednesday, tech stocks and blue chips rallied. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,651.79 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.6 per cent to close at 13,577.87.Alcoa was among the Dow leaders with a rise of 1.9 per cent to $42.43 while Intel, down 1.6 per cent at $24.57, was a laggard.Among other notable bluechip gainers, Honeywell rose 1.6 per cent to $58.74, and Caterpillar gained 1.2 per cent to $82.17.Among stocks in the news yesterday, NYSE Group rose 5.5 per cent to $82.11 after Lehman upgraded the exchange from “market weight” to “overweight”.Alcan rose 4 per cent to $89.60 The aluminium maker that is being stalked by Alcoa, said it had secured a ”white-knight” bidder to stall the hostile $28.7bn - around $76 a share bid - from its rival aluminium producer.Another stock in the news was Liz Claiborne.

473;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-07-09T21:51:13Z;Wall St higher as earnings season starts;;Wall Street closed higher on Monday, with blue chips setting the pace ahead of the start of the second-quarter earnings season.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to close at 13,649.97.The S&P 500 index gained 0.1 per cent to finish at 1,531.86. Among the S&P’s 10 major sectors, energy led gains. Consumer discretionary and financials were lower.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,670.02.A boost for bluechips was Boeing, up 1 per cent at $99.90, as its Dreamliner aircraft was officially launched over the weekend and the company received further orders from various airlines.Johnson & Johnson rose 1 per cent to $62.72, after its board approved a stock repurchase of up to $10bn.In earnings news, Alcoa, another Dow component, posted a 3.9 per cent decline in quarterly profit compared with a year ago after the closing bell.

Expectations for the quarter have risen from 3.9 per cent at the start of April, said John Butters, analyst at Thomson.Earnings growth estimates for energy companies in the second quarter have swung from a fall of 9 per cent to a rise of 3 per cent since April, according to Thomson.That swing has helped offset downward revisions in a number of other sectors. Since the start of April, expectations for consumer discretionary earnings have been lowered to a fall of 10 per cent from a decline of 4 per cent.Earnings estimates for companies in the consumer staples sector have eased from a gain of 9 per cent down to 4 per cent. Technology sector earnings areseen 9 per cent higher, down from a gain of 12 per cent forecast at the start of April.While consumer stocks have lagged behind the broad market’s recent gains, some analysts said concern over the sector might be misplaced. “Recent employment gains support the notion that the US consumer is alive and well and spending habits are unlikely to shift dramatically lower as is being presumed by many investors,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“Investors continue to worry most about consumer stocks, preferring global infrastructure beneficiaries in the mining, industrial and energy areas instead, but expectations are low and valuations are very attractive.”Many US companies are exposed to the global economy, which has been growing at a faster rate than the US. With a weaker dollar, analysts expect US companies with foreign operations to receive an earnings boost.This was highlighted by a survey by Standard & Poor’s of 238 companies in the S&P 500. The agency said these companies had made 44.2 per cent of their fiscal year 2006 sales from outside of the US. That represents a rise of 37 per cent since 2001.Analysts say stocks such as Caterpillar, the equipment manufacturer, and Terex, a construction equipment supplier, are both examples of companies that are benefiting from global growth. Caterpillar rose 1.3 per cent to $79.83 while Terex was 9.5 per cent higher at $92.70.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals‘s shares surged 52.1 per cent to $23.12, after the biotechnology company licensed some of its therapeutic research to Roche, the Swiss drug maker.On Monday, Lexmark, the computer printer maker, cut its second-quarter earnings outlook range and its stock fell 6.4 per cent to $46.25.In deals, the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, said it was taking Sequa, a diversified manufacturer, private for $2.7bn or $175 per share. The stock rose 52.6 per cent to $173.24.Huntsman, the chemical manufacturer, received a higher offer of $28 a share from Apollo Management, which previously offered $27.25 a share. The new price values the company at about $6.5bn and follows a $5.6bn bid last month from Basell, the Dutch chemicals group. Huntsman rose 0.3 per cent to $28.07.Lear gained 2.8 per cent at $36.85, after the car parts maker accepted a higher takeover offer of $3bn, valued at $37.25 a share, up from an original bid of $36, from Carl Icahn’s American Real Estate Partners.Late on Monday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and CBOT Holdings announced that preliminary results indicated the shareholders of both companies had approved the proposed merger of the two derivatives exchanges. Shares in both exchanges were higher by around 0.5 per cent in after-hours trade. In regular trade on Monday, CME fell 0.7 per cent to close at $570.58, and the CBOT lost 0.5 per cent to $222.82.Meanwhile, Cummins, a maker of diesel engines for heavy trucks, surged 10.5 per cent to $117.64 and set a new 52-week of $120.18. Bear Stearns upgraded the company to ‘Outperform’ from ‘Peer Perform’ and said new emissions rules will boost demand for its products.LaBranche, rose 4.8 per cent to $7.87. The NYSE floor equity specialist announced a strategic review.
474;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-07-03T20:26:31Z;Deal activity boosts Wall Street;;Further deal activity boosted Wall Street on Tuesday and the strong start to the third quarter propelled technology stocks towards a milestone for 2007.At an early close in trading on Tuesday ahead of Independence Day, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,644.95, a 6½-year high. That pushed the benchmark’s gain so far this year to 9.5 per cent, matching 2006’s total rise.The Nasdaq 100 index is higher by 11.9 per cent in 2007 and leads the major US benchmarks.While the Nasdaq was at fresh highs for 2007 on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain below their record closes made in early June.Against the backdrop of higher interest rates in recent months, growth stocks have started to outperform value stocks and that has been a plus for technology shares, traders say.A number of technology stocks were in news on Tuesday ahead of the July 4 holiday. UBS upgraded Business Objects to “buy” from “neutral” and shares in the business software maker rose 2.2 per cent to $40.32.Marvell Technology was up 1.9 per cent at $18.42, on news that it makes the Wi-Fi chip that enables the iPhone to connect wirelessly to the internet.Apple rose 4.9 per cent to $127.17 and Goldman Sachs said the company had sold at least 700,000 iPhones.

SAP, the German software company, said a division that provides support for business software applications made “inappropriate” downloads from Oracle’s web site.On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,524.87. Among leading sectors, energy, technology and financials led gains. Utilities were lower as the yield on the 10-year bond rose back above 5 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were also lower after pending home sales fell 3.5 per cent in May, their lowest level since September 2001. Consumer staples stocks also languished as analysts expect lower retail sales in general.Dividends were in the news after Standard & Poor’s reported a 7.2 per cent decline in the number of companies increasing their payments to shareholders during the second quarter of 2007, versus the second quarter of 2006.“The decline in dividend increases is disturbing, especially in light of continued, moderate earnings growth and the abundance of corporate cash,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. “We believe the present wave of corporate buy-backs is contributing to the slower pace of dividend growth in 2007.”In deal news on Tuesday, Kraft made a $7.2bn bid for the global biscuit business of France’s Danone. Kraft lost 2.5 per cent to $34.66.Shares in Wendy’s rose 2.7 per cent to $38.39. Activist investor Nelson Peltz said in a regulatory filing that Triarc, his investment firm, is a “natural strategic buyer” for the burger chain. Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund owns 9.8 per cent of Wendy’s.

The maker of construction equipment was downgraded from “neutral” to “reduce” at UBS. The bank also cut its price target from $78 to $70 amid concern that Caterpillar faces decelerating revenues in its core businesses. So far this year, Caterpillar has risen 27.2 per cent and been one of the leading stocks in the Dow. An upgrade for Avon Products sent its stock up 2.8 per cent to $37.79.Dendreon, a biotech company, rallied 6.5 per cent to $7.70, amid recent hefty call buying in its July $7.50 and July $10 options. Traders expect a positive announcement about its prostate cancer drug.Carmakers were in the news with General Motors down 0.1 per cent at $37.98. GM was set to release its June sales figures later in the day.Shares in Ford slid 2.3 per cent to $9.42. The company said it would pay a premium to holders of its five-year bonds, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $1.47bn.The plan will result in a third-quarter pretax charge of $1.47bn. Ford also reported a 8.1 per cent decline in June sales.
475;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-06-13T20:43:56Z;Wall Street rallies as bond yields steady;;Wall Street rallied sharply on Wednesday, boosted by a surge in retail sales during May and a respite from the relentless rise in government bond yields seen in recent days.The S&P 500 index surged 1.5 per cent higher to close at 1,515.68. Among the big industry groups, materials and utilities both rose more than 2 per cent.Stocks received an additional boost when the Federal Reserve released its latest Beige Book at mid-afternoon, which revealed “economic activity continued to expand from mid-April through May.”Other rate-sensitive stocks that have been buffeted by higher yields in recent days, such as real estate investment trusts, homebuilders and financials, rebounded on Wednesday.Technology and blue-chip equities also rose sharply after incurring sharp losses on Tuesday.The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.3 per cent higher at 2,582.31 while semiconductor stocks rallied 1.4 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.4 per cent at 13,482.35.Stocks opened firmer and rose further when bond yields pulled back sharply from highs set in early trade.The yield on the 10-year bond rose back above 5.3 per cent after a stronger–than- forecast retail sales number for May. But at that level, bonds attracted buyers and the subsequent decline in yields soothed concerns among stock investors. Late on Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was six basis points lower at 5.20 per cent.Bond traders said pension and insurance funds entered the market attracted by the level of yields, which have risen from about 4.60 per cent since March.“There is some confidence that bond yields have made a top,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The retail sales report shows the economy is growing better than ex-pected, and equities can handle higher bond yields.”With consumer price inflation figures for May due on Friday, however, equity prices could come under renewed pressure before that, Mr Pado said. “The market wants growth, not inflation to be the driver of higher yields.”Although the retail sales report sparked interest rate futures to price in a small chance of a rate rise by the Federal Reserve later this year, analysts said the recent rise in bond yields already represented a tightening in policy as many sectors of the economy were sensitive to long-term rates.Kevin Flanagan, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said 30-year mortgage rates had risen by nearly 50 basis points in the past four weeks. “This will only serve to make any stabilisation in the housing market that much harder,” he said.Meanwhile, analysts expect higher rates are likely to clip the pace of deal activity, an explosion of which has boosted stocks this year.Among stocks in the news was Boeing, up 2.1 per cent at $98.47 as the aircraft maker confirmed a forecast of a $2,800bn market for new commercial aircraft over the next 20 years.Other leading blue-chip stocks included Caterpillar, up 2.4 per cent at $79.93, after boosting its dividend by 20 per cent. Shares in 3M rose 2.5 per cent to $87.19, after the Beige Book release. Alcoa, gained 2.9 per cent to $40.48.Shares in Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs rose on Wednesday ahead of their second quarter results on Thursday. Bear gained 2.4 per cent to $149.49, while Goldman rose 2.5 per cent to $233.63. Lehman was up 2.4 per cent at $77.87, after posting record results on Tuesday.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the latest twist in the battle for CBOT Holdings, the parent of the Chicago Board of Trade, the derivatives ex-change. IntercontinentalExchange sweetened its hostile $11bn bid for CBOT with an offer to shareholders of cash in lieu of shares, up to a maximum of $2.5bn. ICE’s previous offer was all stock. ICE fell 0.8 per cent to $147.78, CBOT rose 0.2 per cent to $201.50, while CME was 0.5 per cent higher at $551.25.Earlier this week, regulators agreed that Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings could buy CBOT.

476;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-05-30T20:50:28Z;S&P 500 hits record high after Fed minutes;;The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Wednesday, as investors looked on the bright side of the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting minutes.While stocks are set to record their third straight positive monthly gain on Thursday, investors face a cocktail of potentially potent economic data due on Friday.On Wednesday, fears that a sharp slide in Chinese stocks overnight would spark a similar reaction on Wall Street faded early. Stocks opened lower but losses were quickly contained. “Any link between Shanghai and the S&P 500 is tenuous at best,” said Jack Ablin, portfolio manager at Harris Private Bank.For some investors, the lack of a major pullback in US stocks was disappointing.“We were ready for some opportunities in equities if there was a large sell-off,” said Michael Kastner, port-folio manager at Sterling-Stamos.After the Fed minutes were released, the leading benchmarks made fresh highs and the S&P 500 index finished up 0.8 per cent at 1,530.23, above its March 2000 close of 1,527.46. The June S&P futures contract rebounded from a low of 1,512.60 earlier in the day and closed at a new contract high of 1,532.50. Within the S&P, the energy and telecoms sectors led gains, while health care lingered in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite shrugged off early losses and closed up 0.8 per cent at 2,592.59, a fresh six year high. A decline of 0.4 per cent in semiconductor stocks dented the technology sector, led by Intel, down 1 per cent at $22.08 and Applied Materials, off 1.5 per cent at $18.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 13,633.08, its 25th record close this year. Caterpillar, up 3.6 per cent at $78.48, led gainers in the Dow.Healthcare stocks Merck, down 1.3 per cent at $52.71, and Pfizer, off 0.5 per cent at $27.41, both weighed on the blue-chip benchmark.A bright spot in the healthcare sector was Biogen Idec, up 5.9 per cent at $52.13 after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.With attention focused on employment, inflation and manufacturing reports due on Friday, stocks generally traded in a narrow range.“All eyes are on the employment report,” said Mr Ablin. “The labour market has been sustaining the consumer in the face of higher gas prices and weak housing.”On Wednesday, ADP said it expects 97,000 new private sector jobs were created in May. The ADP report which excludes government workers suggests payrolls will be around 117,000 this month, below the current consensus call of 135,000.Traders believe a payroll gain of at least 100,000 jobs will be enough to soothe concerns that the labour market is faltering.Mr Kastner said investors were hoping that capital investment spending would take over from consumer spending in pulling up economic growth and take over from consumer spending in the months ahead. He also believed corporate earnings were likely to fall this year, pressuring stock valuations.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the news that CDW the technology retailer had agreed to a $7.3bn private equity buy-out.InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the hope of boosting the chances of its hostile bid for CBOT Holdings.At this juncture, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ICE hopes its deal with CBOE will resolve a legal dispute between the options exchange and CBOT, which argues that some of its members are entitled to an equity stake in CBOE.Shares in ICE rose 0.65 per cent to $148.71, CBOT shares gained 2.4 per cent to $197.62, while CME was up 0.4 per cent at $527.85.In other deal news, eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald, said it would buy BGC Partners, Cantor’s privately held brokerage unit, in a $1.3bn deal.

Citigroup upgraded the beverage maker to a “buy” with a $59 price target.NiSource fell 7.8 per cent to $22.07 after the utility said it had concluded talks without selling its Indiana electricity assets, but would still consider spinning off that unit. Utility stocks have recently pared solid gains this year – the S&P utility sector is up 12.8 per cent in 2007 – as investors have become concerned at the sector’s low dividend yield as compared with rising bond yields.“Utilities have run a little further beyond reasonable valuations,” said Mr Ablin.Verisign was 5.3 per cent higher at $29.43 after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned. The internet infrastructure company’s stock is up 22.1 per cent this year on the back of expansion and diversification of its operations.
477;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-05-23T20:42:18Z;Wall St retreats on Greenspan remarks;;US stocks retreated in late trading on Wednesday, closing lower, after former Federal Reserve chairman said he feared a ‘massive contraction’ in Chinese stocks and a slowdown in global growth.Meanwhile, technology was weighed down by further weakness among chip makers.The S&P 500 had been on course to close at a record high as deals and earnings led to early gains. But Mr Greenspan’s comments, in which he said recent growth in Chinese stocks was ‘unsustainable,’ led to the late downturn.A possible battle for control of Alcan was a major talking point. The Canadian aluminium producer’s board said shareholders should reject an unsolicited $27.6bn bid from US rival Alcoa.A Canadian newspaper report said Alcan was in talks with BHP Billiton regarding a possible merger with the Australian miner. At the close,shares in Alcan were up 6 per cent at $85.89 and Alcoa was 3.7 per cent higher at $40.38.Materials stocks were one of the best-performing sectors in the S&P. Other rising sectors included energy, while utilities were lower and technology was weighed down by further weakness among chipmakers.The S&P was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,522.17, having reached 1532.43 earlier in the session, above its record closing price of 1,527.46 set on March 24 2000.The June S&P futures contract has set a new high of 1535.70 and traders said it was poised to test 1,540.20.But the S&P has not yet threatened its intra-day record high of 1,552.87 – set on the same day as the all-time closing high seven years ago. Some analysts believe the recent consolidation in the S&P just below its record level has primed the index for a decisive move higher.“The longer we sit here, the more likely the S&P will move higher towards 1,600,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.One possible reason behind the S&P’s sideways trading earlier this week may have been investors selling the index as it initially tested record levels.“The record close is a good level to set a short position for a quick trade but, as the market starts to move higher, any shorts left may be forced to cover,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, speaking before the S&P’s afternoon swoon.“I get the feeling that, if the S&P stretches higher, it will force a lot of people to buy in,” he added.Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange said short trades on stocks, which make money if prices fall, had risen to a new record level.Technology shares were in focus as Amazon rose 5 per cent to $72.30 in early trading, a seven-year high after the online retailer said it was buying Brilliant Audio, the largest independent publisher of audio books in the US for an undisclosed amount. But Amazon gave back most of the gains to close up 0.17 per cent at $69.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.4 per cent at 2,577.1.Semiconductor stocks were in negative territory, as Analog Devices slumped 10.1 per cent to $36.33. The chipmaker said fiscal third-quarter earnings would fall short of the prior year’s third quarter results.Blue-chips, which had earlier marched further into record territory, also closed down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 13,525.4 and set a new intra-day high of 13,609.76. Caterpillar, a Dow component, was up 0.7 per cent at $76.03.Boeing‘s shares fell 0.9 per cent to $95.57 after the aircraft maker reaffirmed earnings guidance for this year.Ihere was a merger in the shoe sector as Payless ShoeSource said on Tuesday that it was buying Stride Rite for around $800m.

478;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-05-17T21:17:45Z;Wall Street retreats after recent bullish run;;Wall Street stocks weakened on Thursday, as investors consolidated the market’s recent run of gains.The S&P 500 dipped 0.1 per cent to close at 1,512.75, putting an attempt at breaking its 2000 record high of 1,527.46 on hold.Energy stocks led the market as oil prices rallied sharply. By contrast, utility stocks languished as Treasury yields continued their recent rise.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were also weaker. Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank did not expect the present problems in the subprime mortgage market to harm the broader economy or the financial system.Standard & Poor’s said yesterday that first-quarter 2007 operating earnings for the S&P 500 increased 8.2 per cent over the first quarter 2006, boosted in part by the weaker dollar.“The stronger-than-expected earnings can be traced back to international sales, that now account for a significant portion of the S&P 500 revenue,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P.Among S&P sectors, materials led with a 16.9 per cent jump in earnings, and financials posted a better-than-expected rise of 12.7 per cent. In contrast, consumer discretionary companies recorded a 5 per cent drop in earnings, mostly due to lower profits from homebuilders and the automobile sector and lower margins from retailers.Against the backdrop of slowing economic growth, weaker housing activity and high petrol prices, the better-than-expected pace of quarterly earnings growth is “about as close to a perfect landing as we could have hoped for”, said Mr Silverblatt.Still, traders have noted recent buying of put options, which provide insurance against the risk of a sharp decline in the S&P in the coming months. The Chicago Board of Trade’s Vix index, a measure of S&P 500 index volatility known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” was a touch firmer yesterday and remains above recent lows.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,539.38. Semiconductor stocks were again lower and the 1 per cent drop in the Philadelphia semiconductor index took its decline so far this week to 2.4 per cent. Micron Technology fell 5.3 per cent to $11.50 after the group said it plans to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to close at 13,476.72, but the blue-chip barometer did rise above the 13,500 threshold for the first time earlier in the day.Blue-chips were boosted in part by Exxon Mobil, which rose to an all-time high of $82.44, before it closed up 0.4 per cent at $81.80. A downgrade for Caterpillar, off 1.5 per cent at $74.84, weighed on the Dow.The S&P railroad index rallied 2.1 per cent, for a gain of 4.5 per cent so far this week following more news that high profile investors had recently purchased stakes in railroad companies.Merger and acquisition activity yesterday was led by Alliance Data Systems. The issuer of private-label credit cards agreed to be acquired in a $7.8bn deal by Blackstone Group. ADS jumped 24.6 per cent to $78.46 and set a 52-week high of $80.30 earlier in the day.AirTran, the discount airline, said it would extend its tender offer for shares in Midwest Airuntil June 8.

Citigroup said the company’s upgraded search engine will boost revenue and the bank reiterated its buy rating on the stock and has a price target of $600 a share.“By our math, Google generates approximately $0.08 for every search on its network. A better search experience = more searches = more revenue,” said Mark Mahaney, US internet analyst at Citigroup. “Google’s successful product innovation is likely to increase its mind share, its market share, and its market cap,” said Mr Mahaney.
479;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-05-09T21:38:13Z;Wall St rises as no change in Fed policy;;Wall Street rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signalled no change in its policy stance and outlook.The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave interest rates steady yet still flag up concerns over inflation, sparked a brief bout of selling in stocks. But the market quickly recovered and closed significantly stronger than where they had been before the Fed’s announcement.“The Fed did not scare the market by sounding hawkish on inflation,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “Based on current expectations, a rate cut is still likely by the end of the year, and that’s positive for stocks.”Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, said: “A rate cut is coming, but the Fed is biding its time and waiting for a clear peak in inflation.”At late afternoon, the S&P 500 index had closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,5012.58, led by gains in telecom, industrial and financial stocks. The index is nearing its March 2000 record close of 1,527.46.A big talking point among investors on Wednesday was Cisco as it shares slid 6.5 per cent to $26.51. The computer network operator’s fiscal third-quarter profits rose 34 per cent from the same period last year, but investors were hoping for more robust revenue guidance.“Of the 12 times the stock has opened lower on earnings since 2002, it has gone up from the open just once,” according to the Bespoke Investment Group.Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq Composite for much of on Wednesday, but the tech heavy benchmark pared losses after the FOMC meeting and closed up 0.2 per cent at at 2,576.34.Texas Instruments rose 4.7 per cent to $36.83, after the maker of phone chips raised its profit margin targets on expectations for strong revenue growth.Blue-chips benefited from the FOMC outcome and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to a new record close of 13,362.87. Honeywell, up 1.8 per cent at $56.81, and Caterpillar, up 1.8 per cent at $74.75, boosted the Dow.IBM also boosted blue chips after Goldman Sachs upgraded “Big Blue” to a “buy” from “neutral” amid the company’s plans to repurchase stock and cut costs.That reversed Goldmans’ downgrade made last week. IBM shares closed up 1.1 per cent at $104.38, after setting a 52-week high of $104.75 earlier in the morning.A drag on the Dow was Walt Disney after it reported second quarter profit rose 27 per cent, but quarterly revenue was less than expected. Shares fell 1.2 per cent to $36.12, after the stock set a six-year high of $36.57 on Tuesday.Beyond the FOMC meeting, analysts said the outlook for stocks remained positive.Mr Skrainka said “the market is still at a fair level relative to earnings,” and investors were encouraged that corporate earnings had advanced near a double-digit pace in spite of a much slower economy during the first quarter.Mr Ablin said other factors continued to support stock prices. “More than 200 companies in the S&P 500 sport a free cash flow yield in excess of the 10-year Treasury note, suggesting that the environment remains ripe for more buyouts and buybacks.”The housing market remains one of the economy’s weak spots, highlighted on Wednesday when Toll Brothers, a builder of luxury homes, warned that it would not meet recent quarterly and annual guidance. Its shares fell 0.55 per cent to $29.05.In other earnings news, News Corp reported a 6.2 per cent rise in profits for its fiscal third quarter, meeting analysts’ estimates. The media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch launched a $5bn bid for Dow Jones last week, but has been rebuffed by the Bancroft family which controls the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. News Corp was 1.65 per cent lower at $23.26 at mid-afternoon.One of the biggest movers on Wednesday was drugmaker Dendreon. The stock plunged 64.3 per cent to $6.33 after the Food and Drug Administration sought more information about its prostate cancer vaccine.Somaxon Pharmaceuticals, a speciality drugmaker, slid 11.3 per cent to $15.97, after the FDA sought details about its experimental drug to treat smoking and gambling addiction.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 3.3 per cent to $10.24 after the drugmaker agreed to develop and market a cholesterol drug with Bristol-Myers Squibb.Shares in Electronic Arts fell 4.3 per cent to $50.65 after the video game maker reported a larger-than-forecast fiscal fourth-quarter loss.
480;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-04-20T22:19:51Z;Dollar comes to rescue of Corporate America;;The weak dollar and strong overseas markets came to corporate America’s rescue on Friday with blue-chip companies such as industrial giants Honeywell and Caterpillar and the drugmaker Pfizer reaping the benefits of international exposure.Several companies, including the fast food chain McDonald’s and the recruitment agency Manpower, beat Wall Street analysts expectations as the strength of foreign markets more than offset the weakness of the US economy.Jim Owens, chief executive of the heavy construction equipment maker Caterpillar, summed up the past few months for many US companies when he said: “Exceptional growth outside North America helped us deliver good results in a tough quarter.”The string of strong earnings and positive predictions helped the stock market to move higher. The Dow Jones Industrial index, which hit a record high twice already this week, closed in on the landmark 13,000 level, ending the day at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The first quarter results highlighted US companies’ need to drive growth to counter the slowdown in the domestic economy.That task has been made easier by a sharp slide in the dollar over the past few months, which benefits US groups with earnings in foreign currencies but penalises companies, especially smaller ones, that rely on imports.The threat posed by a weak dollar, which this week briefly touched a 26-year low against the British pound, to America’s small- and medium-sized companies could fuel calls from protectionist measures by some of the 2008 presidential hopefuls.By contrast, Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, said it expected international sales to come in higher by nearly $1bn over the next two years due to ”primarily a strengthening of the euro relative to the dollar since our previous forecast in January.”The company predicted that the stronger euro would boost this year’s sales by $450m more than expected.Although the increase is small compared with Pfizer’s $47bn-$48bn forecast annual revenues, it will help offset the sudden loss of $1.2bn due to generic competition after a key patent expiry on a blockbuster hypertension drug.Meanwhile, Honeywell raised its sales forecast for the year by $700m to $33.5bn. David Anderson, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times some $300m of the improved sales would come from favourable currency movements. He said $150m of that had already been achieved in the first quarter of the year, helping Honeywell to beat analysts’ expectations. The company reported a 21 per cent rise in net income to $526m in the three months to March.At Caterpillar, a downturn in North America was partly countered by strong sales in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Overall, first quarter profits quarter fell $24m to $816m.
481;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-04-20T13:02:38Z;Wall St advances to new highs;;Solid earnings and speculation about buy-outs of financial groups pushed US stocks into record territory this week as the leading indices recouped all the losses from the slump that began in late February.Boosted by bullish earnings updates from Caterpillar and Honeywell on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The S&P 500 index broke through its high for the year reached before the plunge in equities two months ago, rising 0.9 per cent to 1,484.35 on Friday to stand 2.2 per cent up this week.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent this week to 2,526.39.While the advance gathered pace on Friday, the rally earlier in the week was driven by a relatively narrow base of stocks. Blue chips had the best of the gains: the Dow Jones advanced 2.8 per cent this week while the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose just 1.2 per cent.“The big driver has been earnings, which have been much better than anticipated – we set the bar so low,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.“It is a ‘Chicken Little’ recovery – the market rises yet never seems able to generate confidence.”Google led the way up after beating analysts’ expectations with a sharp rise in profits on the back of strong search engine revenues. Its shares rose 2.3 per cent to $482.48.This rise was in stark contrast to Yahoo, which slid 12.6 per cent to $27.46 this week after the introduction of Panama, its new online advertising system, failed to stem the deterioration in profits and sales. Caterpillar, a Dow component, surged 4.7 per cent to $71.82 on Friday after the heavy machinery maker reported profits in excess of analysts’ estimates and raised its earnings forecasts.Shares in Honeywell International rose 4.8 per cent to $51.40 on Friday after the industrial conglomerate raised its earnings forecasts for the year and beat Wall Street profit estimates.The financial sector came in from the cold this week, with the S&P Financial index up 3.9 per cent to break past its 50-day moving average and stand in positive territory for the year.The rise came amid a burst of takeover speculation after a $25bn agreed buy-out of Sallie Mae, the student loan group, by a JC Flowers-led consortium that sent shares in Sallie Mae up 15.5 per cent to $54 this week.The groundbreaking deal, which is structured to make it unnecessary for Sallie Mae to hold its own capital, turned attention to financial groups that were previously considered improbable buy-out targets. Foremost among those was Countrywide Financial, the biggest home lender, which jumped 11.1 per cent to $37.36.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Merrill Lynch, which has made bullish comments about the subprime mortgage market.Merrill rose 6.7 per cent to $92.02 this week after reporting a four-fold rise in profits.In the latest example of the growing appetite for financial deals, H&R Block agreed to sell Option One Mortgage, its subprime mortgage unit, to a company affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity group. Shares in H&R Block rose 3.3 per cent to $22.56 on Friday.Intel made big gains this week, rising 8.3 per cent to $21.16, as the chipmaker raised its revenue forecasts after a successful overhaul of its product line.Rival AMD fared less well, easing 0.8 per cent to $14.16 on Friday after what Robert Rivet, chief executive, described as a “disappointing and unacceptable” first quarter, with lower sales and deteriorating margins.The rally in railway stocks gathered steam as TCI, the activist hedge fund, built a stake in CSX, highlighting the potential for takeovers and asset sales in this cash-generative sector.Shares in CSX jumped 6.1 per cent to $4504.Atticus, a hedge fund that has worked with TCI in the past, already holds big stakes in railway groups, including Union Pacific, which rose 6.8 per cent this week to $117.21.Homebuilders bounced off their lows for the year as fears eased about the severity of the housing market downturn. The S&P Homebuilders index jumped 8.6 per cent while DR Horton rose 8.9 per cent to $23.39.
482;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-02-28T21:55:33Z;Bernanke remarks lift US stocks;;Reassuring comments from Ben Bernanke soothed investors’ nerves on Wall Street on Wednesday and helped stocks edge upwards following one of the biggest one-day falls since 2001.After a tentative start the market began to rally with some conviction as the Federal Reserve chairman said in testimony to Congress that there had been no material change in his outlook on the economy.Defensive stocks that are less sensitive to a downturn in the economy fared well, while the homebuilding sector continued to decline after weak new home sales data.“Calm heads prevailed,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist, Cantor Fitzgerald. “There was no overwhelming reason to continue the decline and the market took the opportunity to bounce back. Bernanke’s statements had a calming effect.”The S&P 500 index closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,406.82, slightly off its peak earlier in the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.4 per cent higher at 12,268.63.But, in spite of Wednesday’s gains, the Dow and the S&P closed the month lower for the first time since June and May respectively.In a sign of that nervousness was beginning to ease, the Vix index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 15.5 per cent to 15.47. It jumped more than 60 per cent on Tuesday.Procter & Gamble was one of the best performing stocks with a rise of 3.6 per cent to $63.49. There was little to explain the sharp rise except for investors seeking a safe haven. Shares in the tobacco group Altria rose 2 per cent to $84.28.Sprint Nextel jumped 4.6 per cent to $19.30 after the mobile phone operator reported higher quarterly profits and said it expected the number of its subscribers to rise.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,416.13, buoyed by Apple stock, which gained 0.8 per cent to $84.61 after bullish comments about expected sales of its new mobile phone.The sharpest fall in new home sales in 13 years somewhat tempered the more positive mood, however, and sent shares in homebuilders lower.The S&P Homebuilders index was down 1.2 per cent while shares in Toll Brothers were 2.4 per cent softer at $29.86.Investors in Alcoa remained on the defensive as doubts over Chinese demand raised concerns about the aluminium maker. It fell 1.1 per cent to $33.41. Meanwhile shares in Caterpillar were 0.6 per cent lower at $64.43 after recouping some early losses driven by worries about its Chinese sales.Merck’s stock advanced after the drugmaker raised its earnings forecast for the year. Its shares were 2.3 per cent higher at $44.15.Home Depot said it expected sales to slow because of the weak housing market. Shares in the retailer were 0.6 per cent lower at $39.59.
483;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-02-15T22:10:07Z;Wall Street up despite mixed data;;Wall Street stocks edged up on Thursday and set new highs after rebounding from a choppy early session in spite of a mixed set of economic data releases.Takeover speculation in brewers and rallies in blue-chip stocks such as Boeing and Caterpillar were offset by a disappointing earnings update from Baker Hughes.Ben Bernanke’s second day of testimony to Congress also somewhat damped the bullish market sentiment that followed the Federal Reserve chairman’s comments on Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,765.01, a new record. The S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent higher at 1456.81, its highest level in more than six years. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent at 2,497.10.“This morning’s economic data was sort of a mixed bag,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. “But the market put together another decent but unspectacular up day.”The economic data showed a rise in the number of jobless and a fall in January’s industrial output because of reduced car production.Baker Hughes was one of the biggest fallers after it failed to meet analysts’ quarterly profit forecasts.The group’s earnings rose by 27 per cent to $326.2m but its shares plunged 9.4 per cent to $65.19 on investor concerns over weakness in its North American market.In mergers and acquisitions news, shares in Anheuser-Busch were up 3 per cent to $51.75 after Brazil’s Valor Economico reported that the brewer was holding merger talks with InBev of Belgium.The report cited a source close to Marcel Hermann Telles, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Jorge Paulo Lemann – the big investors in InBev who were behind the 2004 merger between Brazilian brewer AmBev and Interbrew that created InBev.Shares in rival brewer Molson Coors also climbed 5.5 per cent to $87.03 on the back of a better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Boeing’s stock rose 2 per cent to $91.71 after the aircraft-maker confirmed that it had received an order from United Parcel Service, the delivery group.Caterpillar, the maker of farm and construction equipment, said it plans to buy back $7.5bn worth of shares over the next five years and made an upbeat statement about its future performance. Its shares rose 2.2 percent to $67.62.Goldman Sachs analysts changed their rating on AMR and JetBlue, sending shares in the two airline groups in opposite directions.Citing its valuation, the analysts reduced their recommendation on AMR, the owner of American Airlines, which sent its shares down 1.2 per cent to $38.05.Meanwhile, shares in Jet-Blue were trading 4.7 per cent higher at $13.85 after the analysts upgraded their rating to “buy” because of its strong margins.
484;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-02-14T19:37:43Z;Wall Street rallies on Bernanke testimony;;US stocks climbed to new highs on Wednesday after Ben Bernanke said that inflationary pressures on the economy were beginning to wane.The comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve boosted investor confidence and lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average into record territory, climbing 0.7 per cent to 12,741.86.Meanwhile, the Vix Index, a measure of market volatility, flirted with its lowest closing level in more than 20 years before rising in the afternoon to stand at 10.23, 1.1 per cent down on the day. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 2,488.38.“It is yet another Bernanke-driven rally,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “He said the economy was doing well and refuted recent concerns that interest rates may rise.”The economy would experience moderate growth this year, Mr Bernanke said, adding that he saw signs of stabilisation in the housing market. That helped shares in homebuilders climb, with DR Horton’s stock up 1.2 per cent to $28.18. New Century Financial, the high-risk mortgage lender, also gained 6.2 per cent to $19.75.Mr Bernanke’s testimony came after the release of weaker-than-expected retail sales data earlier in the day.Sluggish demand for cars and electronic goods in January left retail sales unchanged from December.In corporate news, shares in DaimlerChrysler were up 8.3 per cent to $69.78 after the carmaker dropped its long-term commitment to its US division and announced higher-than-expected job cuts at the unprofitable unit.Daimler said it was cutting 13,000 jobs at its Chrysler unit as it revealed losses of €124m ($163m) for the fourth quarter.The S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 1,455.30, led by strong gains by shares in Deere.The price of shares in the maker of farm and building equipment jumped 9 per cent to $111.91 on strong quarterly profits and upbeat guidance.

485;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2007-01-26T21:40:10Z;Wall Street down on higher rates, volatile oil;;"US stocks were not for the faint-hearted this week. Sentiment swung wildly as investors got to grips with mixed results and guidance from several companies, volatile oil prices and rising bond yields.The Vix index, a market measure of volatility, reflected this. It swung from a low of 9.87 to a peak of 11.60 on Friday, and rose 7 per cent for the week.After setting a six-year high during the week, the S&P 500 retreated on Friday to close at 1,422.18, down 0.1 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent over the five days as Treasury yields reached their highest levels in five months.“Rising rates are an expression of economic strength,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. But he said such strength ran counter to the Federal Reserve’s “soft landing” scenario and had “upset” investors.A clear trend this month has been the desire of investors to snap up recent underperformers if their earnings exceeded expectations.Jack Caffrey, senior equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “People are afraid of missing out, and when they hear good news they want to boost their portfolios with stocks that promise out-performance.”The situation was illustrated this week when Ebay beat earnings and raised guidance for 2007. The online auctioneer rose 6.8 per cent to $31.65, having fallen
30 per cent during the previous 12 months.Better than expected earnings from Yahoo boosted its shares by 1.4 per cent to $28.04 this week.

Microsoft beat earnings estimates but fell 1.6 per cent to $30.60 after setting a multi-year high of $31.48 on Thursday.Advanced Micro Devices, slid 8.5 per cent to $16.22 after the chipmaker missed its earnings estimates. Sun also said it would use chips from Intel in its servers, a move that could erode maket share for AMD said analysts.In contrast, Texas Instruments rose 9.3 per cent to $31.02 as the chipmaker produced stellar earnings.

history. The shares rose 1.4 per cent to $8.42.Analysts at Gimme Credit said Ford had managed investor expectations well: “We all know this is just the first quarter in what will be a gruelling, physical game.”"
486;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Caterpillar on track for record 2007;;Caterpillar on Friday forecast that US interest rates would be cut by mid-year, tempering the domestic economic slowdown and helping the heavy equipment maker to maintain its forecast of achieving record sales in 2007.However, Caterpillar expects the bulk of growth to come from overseas, with domestic sales of its eponymous heavy trucks and construction equipment curtailed by the housing downturn and new engine emission rules.Caterpillar’s sales are split evenly between the US and international markets, and revenue growth has been spurred by the global construction and mining markets, driving demand for its earthmovers and other heavy machinery.Jim Owens, chairman and chief executive, has already called on policy makers to ease interest rates to address the domestic downturn, though Caterpillar expects rates in Europe, Japan and some developing nations to be raised during 2007.The company cut its 2007 guidance last October, but reaffirmed its expectation of sales rising between zero and 5 per cent this year to as much as $43.6bn. Caterpillar said it remained on track to reach $50bn by the end of the decade.Domestic sales are set to fall 8 per cent, dragged lower by the housing slowdown and lower sales of its truck engines after business boomed last year ahead of the new emission rules.Asia-Pacific is expected to be its fastest-growing region, with sales forecast to rise by 17 per cent, helped by the continuing expansion of mining and energy exploration. European sales are expected to rise by 13 per cent.Caterpillar’s closely-watched forecast came as it reported record fourth-quarter sales and earnings. Net profits climbed 10 per cent to $882m, though earnings per share of $1.32 were just shy of analysts’ consensus.
487;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-12-15T16:25:14Z;Housing slowdown hits Black & Decker;;Black & Decker warned on Friday that the weakening US housing market would cut sales of its power tools in the current quarter, and said it faced “significant challenges” in the first half of next year which were likely to be felt by rivals.The US group is the global market leader and sells a third of its power tools and accessories through Home Depot and Lowe’s, which have both warned that falling new and existing home sales would hit revenues.Retailers have responded by reducing inventories, while Black & Decker said it had also lost sales by not matching the deep discounting of some rivals in favour of maintaining its premium pricing, and continuing increases to pass on rising raw material costs.Black & Decker’s warning – which saw it cut its earnings forecast for the third time this year – is the latest evidence of how the housing slowdown is affecting corporate America.Companies such as Caterpillar, which also have substantial exposure to the US residential construction market, have cautioned that the boom in sales seen over the past three years is likely to end in 2007.The eponymous B&W brand is aimed mainly at retail customers and accounts for a third of power tool sales, but the bulk of the slowdown since October was in its larger industrial business through marques such as Dewalt.“The one silver lining in this dark quarter…is that we continue to generate substantial cash flow,” Nolan Archibald, chairman and chief executive, told analysts.Mr Archibald said the company would continue to explore further share repurchases and bolt-on acquisitions, having bought Vector earlier this year to add to Porter-Cable/Delta and Baldwin/Weiser deals completed over the past two years.Black & Decker declined to provide guidance for 2007, but cut its earnings forecast for the December quarter from $1.85-$1.90 a share to $1.30-$1.35.The shares fell more than 8 per cent to $79.11 in early New York trading, though rivals such as Masco were broadly unchanged.Mr Archibald said sales of power tools and accessories – which account for a quarter of group revenues – would be down by double-digit percentage levels in the current quarter, with other divisions such as hardware and fasteners expected to report slower drops in sales.
488;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-11-06T21:38:57Z;US stocks rally on bargain-hunting;;Wall Street stocks settled near their peaks in New York on Monday after bargain-hunting sparked by merger and buyout deals.The improved tone came after the robust October jobs report last week that partly eased concerns about the extent of a US economic slowdown and from hopes of a benign outcome to the US mid-term elections.The prospect of a shift in power after the US mid-term elections on Tuesday, that results in gridlock is not unnerving investors.“With power in the House potentially turning over to the Democrats, thereby creating the potential for legislative gridlock situation,” Deutsche Bank noted “our analysis finds the standard wisdom that `gridlock is good for the market’ appears true. In gridlock years, the Dow returned an average of 19.5 per cent versus an average return of 11.2 per cent in non-gridlock years.”Leading deal activity was a $3.7bn bid for Four Seasons Hotels. The $82-a-share cash offer reflected a 28 per cent premium over its closing price from last week. Shares in Four Seasons were up $18.63, or 29 per cent, at $82.50.The bid consortium includes Microsoft founder Bill Gates, billionaire Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz, and Four Seasons chairman and chief executive Isadore Sharp.Abbott Laboratories also announced plans to acquire drugmaker Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7bn in cash, or $78 a share. That is about 56 per cent above where Kos closed on Friday.Shares in Abbott were down 0.4 per cent, at $47.47, while shares in Kos surged $26.97, or 53.8 per cent, to $77.06.OSI Restaurants received a $3.2bn offer from a private equity group. Its shares were up $7.32, or 22.6 per cent, at $39.75.Swift Transportation rose $5.79, or 24 per cent, to $29.84 after it received a buyout bid from its largest shareholder, former chief executive Jerry Moyes. The bid was made at $29 a share.McKesson said it would buy Per-Se Technologies in a $1.8bn deal. Per-Se shares were up 12.7 per cent at $27.55 while McKesson’s shares were 2.4 per cent firmer at $49.69.The S&P 500 closed up 15.48 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 1,379.78. Technology stocks such as Cisco, up 3.8 per cent at $24.68, helped boost the Nasdaq Composite 35.16 points, or 1.5 per cent, at 2,365.95.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled up 119.51 points, or 1 per cent, at 12,105.55, reversing last week’s close below 12,000. The Transports index was up 1.78 per cent.Of the Dow’s 30 members, 28 were higher, led by United Technologies, up 1.8 per cent at $65.15, and IBM, up 1.3 per cent at $92.60. The laggard was Caterpillar, off 0.9 per cent at $59.86. After a UBS downgrade, Home Depot reversed much of its earlier weakness, but Lowes, was off 0.8 per cent at $28.82.Shares in biopharmaceutical group Adolor plunged 44.8 per cent to $7.69 after it told investors that the Food and Drug Administration required further testing of a product called Entereg, a bowel surgery drug.Analysts were expecting FDA approval of Entereg this week.El Paso was down 1.4 per cent at $13.72 after the company returned to profitability for the third quarter.XM Satellite Radio rose 15.6 per cent, to $13.17 after reporting a narrower loss for the third quarter.Standard and Poor’s Index Services said on Monday, earnings released by 85 per cent of the S&P 500 companies were running at “a 19.9 per cent gain over that of the third quarter 2005” and “operating earnings are estimated at $22.59 per share, surpassing the old record set last quarter at $21.95.” Companies in the Materials sector lead the earnings charge, up 50.12 per cent, with those in the Consumer Discretionary group second at 43.99 per cent.
489;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-10-23T04:45:38Z;Nikkei closes at five-month high;;The Nikkei climbed to a fresh five-month closing high on Monday, buoyed by a strong rise in property stocks.The Nikkei 225 finished up 0.8 per cent to 16,788.82. The broader Topix rose 0.9 per cent to 1,659.39.The Nikkei’s rise came after an early fall in morning trade on nerves over Japan’s results season, which gets into full swing this week.The Mothers market of smaller growth stocks resumed its recent climb on Monday, on investor views that small-caps have now fallen to the point where many are good bargains. It leapt 2.6 per cent to 1,239.76.But the real estate sector jumped 3 per cent. Continued signs of the end of property price deflation in Japan have boosted prices in recent months. The sector has also gained from the extra boost late last week of a target price upgrade by Goldman Sachs of the sector’s three biggest companies.Mitsui Fudosan, Japan’s largest property company, rose 3.3 per cent to Y3,020. Mitsubishi Estate, its biggest rival, climbed 3 per cent to Y2,955. Sumitomo Realty & Development, the third largest, increased 4.2 per cent to Y3,990.But Komatsu, the construction machinery maker, plunged 4.3 per cent to Y2,120, after its US rival Caterpillar failed to meet its earnings expectations and trimmed its forecasts for 2006 and 2007, citing slower demand. The news also depressed the share price of Hitachi Construction Machinery by 2.1 per cent to Y2,855.Shares in Softbank, the internet and telecoms conglomerate that is a favourite with retail investors, made a last-minute jump ahead of Tuesday’s introduction of number portability – which allows consumers to change their carrier without changing their phone number. The company leapt 3.5 per cent to Y2,685, after saying it planned to make an announcement Monday evening about its mobile phone unit. Softbank is seen as the mobile carrier most likely to make a dramatic step, such as beginning a price war, to respond to number portability.KDDI, the carrier which customers are most likely switch to after number portability according to surveys, was down 0.9 per cent to Y784,000. But NTT DoCoMo, which as the dominant provider has potentially the most to lose from number portability, edged up 0.5 per cent to Y188,000.The banking sector climbed 1.6 per cent, benefiting from temporary safe haven status since bank results are almost the last in the earnings season to be published. Investors anxious to avoid nasty surprises over the next week helped push up Mitsubishi UFJ, the world’s biggest bank by assets, by 1.3 per cent to Y1,510,000.
490;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Caterpillar’s rapid expansion tapers off;;Caterpillar warned on Friday that the slowing US economy could leave its sales flat next year, ending the rapid expansion which has seen annual revenues double to more than $40bn over the past four years.The heavy construction and mining equipment maker described its outlook as a “pause” which would enable it to deal with rising input costs and manufacturing issues.However, it also called on the US Federal Reserve to “act quickly” to address a domestic downturn spurred by the cooling housing market. The drop in residential housing activity has hit sales of Caterpillar’s smaller construction equipment, though the commercial real-estate market remains buoyant.The company’s assessment followed more upbeat reports about the US capital-goods sector, where rising orders, shipments and backlogs in the third quarter are expected to counter the impact of housing on the broader economy.The lower guidance for 2007 and an admission that rising raw material costs and production problems led to a “disappointing” third-quarter performance added to concerns that the current business cycle may have peaked. Its share price slid 14.5 per cent to close at $59, wiping out almost half the gains so far this year.The company’s sales are split evenly between the US and international markets, and revenue growth has been spurred by the global construction and mining markets, driving demand for its earthmovers and other equipment.However, the rapid growth revealed supply-chain problems in the company’s manufacturing operations which it has sought to address over the past year to meet full order books for many of its products. Caterpillar also forecast lower volumes next year for diesel engines, its other main business segment, because of new emission rules in the US and a cut in dealer inventories.The company stressed that it remained positive in its outlook for the rest of the year and 2007 “particularly when you consider the uncertainty we face”, said Mike DeWalt, director of investor relations.Sales and revenues are expected to be 0-5 per cent higher in 2007, with earnings per share growth of 0-10 per cent. Both were lower than analysts’ expectations.Caterpillar reported a 17 per cent rise in sales to a third-quarter record of $10.52bn, with net profits rising from $667m to $769m.Separately, diversified US manufacturing and technology group 3M said sales of flat-screen televisions re-bounded in the third quarter. Net profits rose from $840m to $894m in the quarter. The auto sector was the one weakness identified by the company, which produces components for the sector.
491;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-10-20T21:37:16Z;Caterpillar;;"Stock market bulls have been cheered by the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching one record high after the other. After Friday’s 14 per cent drop in the shares of Caterpillar, which enjoys a quirkily large weighting in the Dow, expect the bulls to remind everyone just how flawed a measure the average is.But that does not make Caterpillar’s profit warning irrelevant. As the world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment, Caterpillar is more exposed than most to the global business cycle. Its top line reflects corporate spending in areas such as mining, oil and trucks; US consumers’ bets on the housing market; and government construction plans.This has proved painful in the past. Between 1997 and 2001, for example, underlying profits declined 46 per cent. Admittedly, Caterpillar has since worked hard to enhance flexibility in its manufacturing and distribution, which it claims should reduce earnings volatility. But like so many new paradigms, this remains unproved, putting its current rating of 11.5 times 2006 earnings based on its latest forecast in perspective.For now, the key remains its lucrative US home market, which accounts for 47 per cent of revenues. Charmingly, Caterpillar’s own 2007 forecast pencils in price rises for itself, but restraint by everyone else, allowing for swift cuts in US interest rates. It says a lot about the broader market, when such rosy assumptions are enough to trigger a sell-off."
492;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-10-20T20:33:00Z;Cat drags Dow lower;;Caterpillar provided the biggest disappointment of the current US earnings season as the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to stay above the 12,000 barrier which it had passed for the first time earlier in the week.The Dow had first breached the 12,000 on Thursday, thanks to a week of strong third-quarter earnings from the likes of Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical and health products group, and soft drinks company Coca-Cola.But news of lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings from the world’s largest maker of earth-moving equipment, and a cut in its guidance for the fourth quarter, dragged Caterpillar shares 14.2 per cent lower to $59.20.Caterpillar has resonance in the market as a bellwether for construction and housebuilding, which have been under pressure.By the close in New York, the Dow was 8.4 points, or 0.1 per cent, lower at 12,003.33, while the broader S&P 500 was up slightly gaining 0.1 per cent, or 1.51 points, at 1,368.65. This was a new five-year high.The Nasdaq Composite was almost flat, gaining 1.36 points at 2,349.36, in spite of a strong performance from Google.Over the week, the Nasdaq lost 0.8 per cent, the S&P was broadly flat and the Dow firmed up 0.2 per cent.While some commentators have downplayed the importance of the Dow as an index, its record close of 12,011.81 on Thursday bore testament to the strength of the earnings season.Marc Pado, US market strategist with Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “Earnings have been the driving force behind the market for the last few weeks.“Apart from Alcoa [the aluminium group that failed to meet earnings expectations last week] on day one, Caterpillar is the biggest miss so far in terms of the Dow companies.”Of the other leading stocks to report figures this week, Johnson & Johnson was the biggest gainer over the five days, up 6.2 per cent to $68.63, as aggressive cost-cutting helped it report a 9 per cent rise in third-quarter net profits. Net earnings rose to $2.76bn, or 94 cents per share, from $2.54bn, or 85 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.Katherine Owen, analyst at Merrill Lynch, reiterated her “buy” rating on the stock and said the acquisition of the consumer healthcare business of Pfizer would bolster earnings.Strong third-quarter figures helped Coca-Cola gain about 6.1 per cent to $46.70 over the week.Leading the blue-chip fallers over the five days was Motorola, the mobile phone company, down 10 per cent to $23.57 as its third-quarter earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations.S&P 500 for-profit education company Apollo Group was down 27 per cent to $36.28 on the week.As well as posting lower third-quarter earnings, its shares were further hit by news that an investigation into stock option grants had uncovered deficiencies.Yahoo fell 5 per cent to $23.21 in the week as the search engine group missed earnings expectations and was downgraded by Piper Jaffrey.In the market on Friday, the news from Caterpillar overshadowed a stellar performance from Google, the internet search engine. It jumped 7.6 per cent to $459.67 after it posted a 70 per cent rise in revenues.Google, the new owner of video-sharing website YouTube reported third-quarter revenues of $2.69bn, ahead of the $2.62bn expected by analysts.Merrill Lynch raised its price target on the stock from $500 to $530.Analyst Justin Post said: “Google reported an impressive third quarter, beating consensus expectations, and we expect the stock to continue to outperform.“We think the stock can go higher during the fourth quarter [and] should have one of the best 2007 growth outlooks in the S&P.”Merck, the pharmaceuticals group, rose 5.5 per cent to $45.59 in spite of a drop in third-quarter earnings as its figures were in line with analysts’ expectations.Industrial concern 3M, the maker of Scotch tape and Post-It notes, rose 4 per cent to $78.40 as it recorded better-then-expected quarterly profit.Sandisk slumped 16.9 per cent to $49.14 as the maker of memory cards cautioned on falling prices for its products. Analysts at Citigroup cut their rating on the stock from “buy” to “hold”.

On Tuesday, it said it would begin shipping microprocessors containing four cores in November. The chipmaker also won a legal victory with the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by rival Advanced Micro Devices.PMC-Sierra, however, lost 8.2 per cent to $5.94 after it lowered its revenue forecasts for the third quarter due to weak demand for communications chips.The slowdown in the
communications sector fed through to Ciena, maker of networking equipment for the telecommunications industry, which sank 9.3 per cent to $27.25.General Motors jumped
8.6 per cent over the week to $33.26, as GM’s chief executive Rick Wagoner met in Paris with Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and Renault to discuss a possible alliance. The stock was further boosted when Kirk Kerkorian said his Tracinda investment group, which already owns nearly 10 per cent of GM’s stock, might increase its holding by 10m shares.At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent, or 39.38 points, for the day at 11,679.07, up 1.5 per cent on the week.The Dow reached its second-highest intra-day level on Friday, and also had its second highest close ever on Thursday. However, the blue-chip index was still about 70 points short of its all-time high.The S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent, or 3.30 points, for the day at 1,335.85, a gain for the week of 1.6 per cent. It too rose to a multi-year high on the week, at one stage reaching its highest level since February 2001.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent, or 11.59 points lower, for the day at 2,258.43, a 1.8 per cent rise for the week.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 had their best quarters since 2004, rising 4.7 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively. The Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks still gained over the quarter but by less, rising 4 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.The Dow and S&P 500 also outperformed the Nasdaq and Russell in the previous quarter.“It’s been an extremely strong quarter and it’s certainly been a surprisingly strong September,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who believes equities will advance at a slower pace in the final three months of the year. “I expect another positive quarter, but I don’t think it can be as strong as last quarter,” he said.Since the beginning of the year, the Dow has risen 9 per cent, followed closely by the Russell, which added 7.9 per cent. The S&P 500 has returned 7 per cent, while the Nasdaq remains a laggard, gaining 2.4 per cent.Heavy machinery makers made strong gains on the week. Caterpillar fuelled much of the Dow’s advances as it added 4.8 per cent to $65.80. Deere, which makes farm equipment, gained 8.1 per cent to $83.91 following bullish comments on the stock in investor magazine Barron’s.After falling for the past four weeks, crude oil closed higher this week.

494;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Yahoo slumped 13 per cent over the five days to $25.52, wiping out the previous eight weeks of gains. The company said third-quarter results would be at the bottom end of their previously forecast range due to slowing advertising revenue.Oracle provided a counterweight to Yahoo’s slump, climbing 7.4 per cent to $17.54. On Wednesday, the software maker reported a 29 per cent increase in first quarter profits, as its chief executive said the company was gaining market share from German rival SAP.Hewlett-Packard shed 3 per cent to $35.11 over the week as its controversial investigation into boardroom leaks to the media began to unnerve investors. News reports said that chief executive Mark Hurd may have had a greater role in the investigation than had previously been thought.Microsoft dipped 0.7 per cent to $26.66. However, the stock has now gained 25 per cent since the middle of June and is back in positive territory for the year.Media group Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times, surged 9.8 per cent to $33.99, its best week in more than two years, after it appointed a special committee to oversee a business review that might lead to a sale of some assets or a leveraged buyout of the group.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent for the week at 1,314.78, a loss on the day of 0.3 per cent, or 3.25 points.

However, on Thursday the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index fell sharply, increasing investor unease that economic growth was slowing faster than had been thought.“The run-up to this point has been driven by an expectation that the Fed will stop raising rates and get the cooling in the economy they’re looking for,” said Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck.“The price you’re paying for that is uncertainty about how much softening there will be in the economy. A soft landing is something that the Fed cannot engineer. It’s out of their hands.”Fears of a slowdown in manufacturing affected Caterpillar, which sank 4.1 per cent to $62.77 – the week’s worst performance in the Dow. United Technologies, also suffered, losing 3.6 per cent to $62.30.General Motors tumbled 3.3 per cent to $30.62 on reports that talks on a possible alliance with Nissan and Renault had made little progress.Symbol Technologies, a maker of barcode scanners and mobile computers, surged 15.2 per cent to $14.64 after Motorola agreed to buy the company for $3.9bn.Darden Restaurants leapt 9.3 per cent to $42.38 after its first quarter profits beat analyst estimates and it raised earnings guidance for 2006 on bullish forecasts for revenue from its Olive Garden chain of Italian-themed restaurants.Home improvement retailer Home Depot suffered from the slowing housing market, sinking 3.4 per cent to $35.96.

Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock from “overweight” to “underweight”, and the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $14.85.First Data, provider of electronic payment systems, sank 9.3 per cent to $40.49. Early in the week, its Western Union subsidiary – which the company plans to spin off – said income growth would be sluggish in coming years, as immigrants who use the service to send money to relatives grow concerned about government scrutiny of wire transfers.
496;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-09-08T19:47:39Z;OFT ‘superficial’ probe rapped;;"The Office of Fair Trading’s investigative process was on Friday judged “superficial and flawed” by the Competition Appeals Tribunal.The CAT, which oversees the anti-monopoly watchdog, was commenting on the OFT’s decision in March to delay the London Metal Exchange from extending its electronic trading hours.The OFT has been dogged by periodic criticisms from the CAT over its procedures since the new competition regime came into force – although the CAT itself has also been criticised by the Court of Appeal for interpreting its role too expansively.The CAT awarded the LME appeal costs, reported to be about £250,000, after the OFT used its interim measures decision (IMD) for the first time.Within a month the OFT withdrew its IMD, which prevented the world’s largest base metals exchange from extending its trading hours into Asian time zones.The LME appealed to the CAT, resulting in Friday’s judgment and compensation award. The CAT said: “In all circumstances, we have come to the conclusion that the OFT’s investigative process was superficial and flawed and the IMD consequently ill-founded.”The IMD followed a complaint from Spectron, a metals broker, which has a competing electronic trading system. The 76-page judgment showed the OFT admitted “it had limited understanding of the significance of Spectron’s metals voice broking service.”The CAT said: “We are concerned that armed with only a ‘limited’ understanding of Spectron’s relevant business, and by extension the market in general, the OFT felt able to adopt an IMD based solely on information provided to it by Spectron without seeking information from ‘the market’, in particular from affected third parties.”In a second tribunal judgment on Friday, the OFT also lost its own application for £95,000 of legal costs incurred in the Celesio/Boots/UniChem matter.Celesio tried to have an OFT decision not to refer the Boots/UniChem merger set aside, but failed. Even so, the CAT said yesterday it was only a later witness statement which elucidated the OFT's reasoning and denied the watchdog the costs of defending against that challenge.Lawyers said the CAT’s remarks in both judgments were likely to give the watchdog pause for thought, and could make it more circumspect in the future.“It’s quite a serious rap on the knuckles for the OFT. It will have to think quite carefully about its internal processes,"" said Mark Friend, competition partner at Allen & Overy, in response to the LME decision."

Durable goods orders in the month also fell more than forecast, adding to gloom over prospects for economic growth.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said the market had made the switch from welcoming poor economic news – because it lessened the chance of rate hikes – to fearing such news because it heralded a slowdown.“We’ve gotten to the inflexion point where bad news is back to being bad news,” he said.The home sales fall was felt acutely by home improvement retailer Lowe’s, which tumbled after it reported second-quarter profits that fell short of expectations, and lowered its full-year sales guidance.

It is down over 40 per cent this year.Even discount retailer Dollar General suffered, losing 12.8 per cent to $12.28 after it lowered guidance for the coming quarter, blaming slow back-to-school sales.Mr Hogan said oil prices were finally beginning to take their toll on the consumer. “This is the first time we’re seeing a pullback in consumer prices because of higher energy prices.”The slump in durable goods orders depressed heavy industry stocks. Boeing was the heaviest drag on the Dow, slumping 4.8 per cent to $73.93. Caterpillar, maker of earth-moving and construction equipment, dropped 3.4 per cent to $65.99.The prospect of cooling economic growth also made investors nervous about the outlook for recruitment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent, or 6.56 points, at 11,304.46.Sales of existing homes fell by more than expected in July, bolstering the picture of a cooling US housing market and presaging further economic slowing. Durable goods orders data for July were mixed, although the headline number dropped by 2.4 per cent, more than had been forecast.The sluggish durable goods figures precipitated a sell-off in heavy-industry stocks. Caterpillar tumbled 2.5 per cent to $65.50, while Joy Global, maker of farm and mining machinery, fell 2.6 per cent to $38.00.Consumer stocks were the worst hit by the news of slowing home sales and the attendant risks they posed to consumer spending.

Marc Pado at Cantor Fitzgerald said the sell-off in Caterpillar was reflective of a wider held view that the economy will slow. He also pointed out that the oil price spike added to the uncertainty. “People are more concerned about every piece of inflation data.”Another Dow component American International Group fell 1.99 per cent to $58.49 after a group of AIG officers and employees was sued by CV Starr & Company’s four managing general agencies, saying they engaged in a scheme to “systematically destroy” Starr’s business.Walt Disney said its fiscal third quarter profit had risen 39 per cent to $1.13bn from $811m for the same period last year, but still finished down 0.52 per cent at $28.83.Federated Department Stores reported better-than-expected second-quarter results before the opening bell and raised its forecast for the second half of the year.

502;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-07-21T20:15:48Z;Caterpillar indicates ‘old economy’ resurgence;;The contrast between the US’s resurgent “old economy” industries and its troubled technology sector came to the fore on Friday when heavy machinery maker Caterpillar reported its best-yet quarterly earnings while personal computer maker Dell capped a bad week for technology companies with a profit warning.The divergent fortunes of two of corporate America’s most important sectors, coupled with concerns about a slowing domestic economy and tensions in the Middle East, are fuelling investor uncertainty over the direction of the stock market.All the main US share indices were down as the woes of the technology sector, with the exception of Microsoft and Google, outweighed the good news from US manufacturers with exposure to booming markets such as mining and energy.Industry experts say that some of the US’s traditional industries, aside from the ailing automotive and airline sectors, are outpacing the “new economy”, thanks to a weaker dollar, high commodity prices and a wave of consolidation and cost-cutting that has weeded out weaker players.The prediction by Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, that it is on course to record its highest annual profits and revenues in 40 years follows upbeat pronouncements by other global manufacturers such as General Electric and Honeywell.“We had a spectacular second quarter [and] we don’t see 2006 as the peak,” said Jim Owens, Caterpillar’s chairman and chief executive, after announcing a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to $1.5bn in the three months to June 30.The good performance, in spite of higher operating costs, prompted Caterpillar, which is seen as a bellwether for blue-chip manufacturing stocks, to lift its outlook for earnings and sales for the whole of this year. By contrast, sectors such as personal computers are resembling old maturing industries.Growth is slowing and companies have become involved in cut-throat price competition to try to increase their market share.Shares in Dell, the world’s biggest maker of PCs, fell to a five-year low during morning trading after warning that profits would not meet expectations because of heavy discounting in a softening market for PCs.Earlier this week Intel, the chipmaker, admitted that revenues would not meet its forecasts this year and were likely to be 10 per cent down after three years of double-digit growth.Shares in its rival AMD were down 10 per cent on Friday after its second-quarter sales suffered from the chip price war with Intel and slowing demand for PCs, while the search engine Yahoo disappointed Wall Street by losing further ground to Google.
503;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-06-29T13:27:22Z;China limits overseas industrial deals;;China on Thursday said foreign investment in the industrial machinery sector must be approved by the government, which could raise new complications for two planned acquisitions by US companies.Carlyle, the private equity group, and Caterpillar, the construction equipment company, have both made bids for Chinese makers of construction machinery and both have been held up by regulatory delays.The announcement follows a period of heavy criticism in Beijing of growing incursions by foreign companies into areas of the economy considered strategic.In October, Carlyle agreed to pay $375m for a 85 per cent stake in Xugong Construction Machinery, part of the Xuzhou Machinery Group, though the deal has yet to be approved by the Ministry of Commerce. Caterpillar’s bid for Xiamen Engineering Machinery has been held up by disagreements over control of the state-owned company.Although the implications of the new policy are unclear, the two deals may now face a new regulatory hurdle.“Large and key equipment manufacturing companies must seek opinions from the relevant departments of the state council [China’s cabinet] when selling shares to foreign companies,” a Beijing official said.The announcement is part of a broader initiative to encourage strong home-grown companies in the machinery industry.The state council highlighted 12 segments it wanted to develop, including high-efficiency power generators, digital control systems for aircraft, more efficient tractors and combine harvesters, and boring machines used in construction.The main products of the Chinese companies – which include mobile cranes in the case of Xugong and loading machinery for Xiamen Engineering – are not on the list of segments highlighted by the state council.Carlyle refused to comment on the announcement, though a person close to the talks said large takeovers were usually monitored by the state council so the new policy did not alter the situation significantly.The Carlyle bid, which would be the largest private equity deal in China, came under attack after Sany Heavy Industry said it would offer a premium for Xugong to keep the company in Chinese hands.Xiang Wenbo, Sany’s chief executive, said on Thursday: “The policy is very positive for the country and the industry. Carlyle’s acquisition of Xugong will definitely be influenced. The approval will become more difficult.”However, one banker said the new policy could make things easier for Caterpillar and Carlyle as officials could permit foreign acquisitions in segments of the sector not highlighted.

And the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below 11,000.Chipmakers trailed the market, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping 6.4 per cent. On Wednesday, Citigroup re-vised down its sales forecasts for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices citing the possibility of a price war be-tween the chipmakers.Intel subsequently raised the possibility of just such a price war when it announced late on Thursday that it would cut prices by 60 per cent to gain market share. Intel fell 5.9 per cent to $17.16 and AMD dropped 11.1 per cent to $26.75.Broadcom plunged 14.5 per cent to $29.33 as its top salesman quit.Copper for July delivery fell more than 8 per cent and gold prices eased, impacting on the S&P Materials Index, which had its worst week since April 2005. Freeport McMoran fell 13.6 per cent to $49.03, and Phelps Dodge dropped 8.9 per cent to $79.01. Newmont Mining shed 7.5 per cent to $49.31.Homebuilders continued to decline. Pulte was down 9.8 per cent to $28.27, and KB Homes dropped 12.4 per cent to $44.74. Standard Pacific dropped 13.3 per cent to $26.02. The S&P Homebuilders Index dropped 7.4 per cent, its worst weekly fall since November.Tribune Group was the best performer in the S&P 500, boosted by reports that it might spin off its broadcasting unit, and confirmation that it would proceed with a $2bn share buyback. The stock gained 6.7 per cent to $31.96. Also bucking the trend in the S&P 500 was BMC Software, which rose after reporting increased profits for the fourth quarter, aided by higher sales and cost-cutting. The shares received a further fillip from upgrades from Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs. BMC was up 6.3 per cent for the week at $22.02.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent, or 5.63 points, for the day at 1,252.30, a loss of 2.8 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent, or 10.26 points, for the day at 2,135.06, a weekly decline of 3.8 per cent. The Dow was down 0.4 per cent, or 46.90 points, for the day to 10,891.92, a loss for the week of 3.2 per cent, its worst week in a year. “We had a choir of Fed members singing to the same tune, that basically interest rates needed to go higher because of oil prices beginning to impact on inflation,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.“That weighed on stocks and the correction continued. I suspect that the market was discounting higher rates of inflation and higher interest rates.”As the sell-off gathered pace, fears about inflation and interest rate rises – for a long time the dominant concern on Wall Street – were joined by broader fears about the health of the economy. This pushed up traditionally defensive consumer staple stocks such as Procter & Gamble and Molson Coors, while cyclical stocks suffered. Consumer staples groups Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson were rare gainers in the Dow.P&G added 0.9 per cent to $54.45, posting its biggest one day gain in over a year on Thursday. J&J was up 1.1 per cent to $61.38.Also attractive to skittish investors was brewer Molson Coors, which jumped 2.6 per cent to $67.96. Molson has gained 7 per cent in the past two weeks. “Defensive issues have become more fashion-able,” said Mr Cardillo.Slowdown fears meant investors shied away from cyclical and durable goods stocks. Monster Worldwide, the advertising and recruitment company, fell 11.7 per cent to $42.00, while construction equipment maker Caterpillar fell 7.3 per cent to $67.52.General Motors fell 4.3 per cent to $25.35.Exchange consolidation remained in focus as the NYSE Group’s agreed tie-up with Euronext ran into political opposition. Jacques Chirac, the French president, said he preferred a Deutsche Börse-Euronext combination, sending NYSE Group down 12.7 per cent to $57.15. Nasdaq fell 8.7 per cent to $27.41.
507;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-06-09T17:31:50Z;On Wall Street: Worrying signs for the economy;;As you were. Astute readers may remember that the Financial Times and many other newspapers provided a lot of coverage when the Dow Jones Industrial Average went through 11,000 in January. It was the first time it had done so in years, and there was talk that the Dow had at last broken out of a range.It subsequently set a series of six-year highs, and reached an intra-day high of 11,670 on May 10, perilously close to its all-time high of 11,750 set on January 14 2000. But then came the May correction, which continued this week, and on Wednesday the world’s most venerable stock index fell back through 11,000. It had not broken out into new territory. The Dow is still stuck in a trading range in what continues to look like a secular bear market.Why should we care about the Dow? It was the first stock index, established 110 years ago, and offers greater opportunities to view historical market trends than any other index. But its methodological flaws are severe. It is based on share price, rather than market capitalisation. And it covers only 30 companies.The Dow does have some insights to offer, however. Since its all-time high in 2000, it has been led by old-line industrial names, such as Caterpillar and 3M. The laggards weighing it down have included General Motors, which is no surprise, and the big technology names, which are no longer able to lead the market as they did in the late 1990s. The market’s judgment on the tech sector has been so severe that at one point on Thursday the Nasdaq Composite was down 10 per cent since its high in May – fitting the standard definition for a correction.What were the triggers for this week’s selling? As might be expected, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, provided one with a speech on Monday in which he warned that inflation was at the top of the range that he would regard as consistent with price stability.His measured comments were deliberately hawkish, and were backed up by several speeches from other Fed governors getting across the same message – inflation was already too high, and must be stopped.High inflation does not mix well with low growth, and the previous week had brought disappointing employment numbers. That was bad news for stocks, but it at least encouraged the bond market that the Fed might desist from a further tightening of the Fed Funds rate at the end of this month. According to the futures market, the odds on this happening dropped to below 50 per cent once the employment numbers came out.Since Mr Bernanke made his comments, the futures market has gone back to the belief that another rate rise this month is a virtual certainty.As for the bond market, the yield curve briefly inverted this week, and subsequently stayed flat. In other words, short-dated bonds, maturing soon, yielded more than longer-dated bonds. This is unusual, as investors normally require greater return to compensate them for the greater risk involved in betting on conditions many years in the future.Historically, a yield curve inversion has often presaged an economic recession. This makes sense, as it signals that markets expect inflation to be higher in the short-term than in the long-term, and this is usually because they are also expecting a fall-off in growth.The anatomy of the stock market also gives cause for concern. Judging by the sectors that have been worst affected during the recent correction, this is not a scare about interest rates or inflation. The sell-off in the Nasdaq and of smaller companies indicates concern about sectors that would benefit from economic growth.Meanwhile, the best-performing sectors have been utilities and consumer products – classic defensive sectors used as a refuge when economic times are bad. On Thursday, Procter & Gamble had its best day in more than a year. When investors are taking heart from the notion that whatever happens, Americans will still have to clean their teeth and do their laundry, it is generally a sign of worries about the economy.Markets are often wrong, of course. But they tend to be a good leading indicator. Judged in their entirety, the US capital markets, not just the Dow Jones Industrial Average, are signalling trouble ahead for the economy.
508;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-06-05T19:23:37Z;Wall St slumps as Bernanke warns on inflation;;US stocks moved sharply lower on Monday as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned of the need to remain vigilant on inflation in spite of signs of slowing economic growth.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index had their worst days since January, also weighed down by concerns over Iran that pushed oil prices higher.“I think the market is digesting the after-effects of Friday’s payroll numbers and has concerns about a weaker economy,” said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.Blue-chips, housebuilders, and materials producers all turned lower. Boeing fell 2 per cent to $82.13, while Caterpillar dropped 4.8 per cent to $69.33.Homebuilders were among the worst performers in the S&P 500. Pulte fell for a second day after its announcement on Friday that it was cutting its profit forecast for 2006. The shares dropped 5 per cent to $29.75. Standard Pacific was also lower, shedding 8.6 per cent to $27.43 after it too announced late on Friday that it would cut its 2006 earnings forecast.Speaking at the International Monetary Conference in Washington, Mr Bernanke said the Fed would be “vigilant” on inflation – raising the odds of further interest rate rises – in spite of moderating economic growth.Earlier in the day, the Institute for Supply Management’s services index for May foreshadowed Mr Bernanke’s remarks, with a modest overall decline suggesting economic deceleration, but a jump in the prices paid component hinted at inflationary pressures.Real estate investment trusts was the only sector that posted gains in the S&P 500. The announcement that Brookfield Properties would buy Trizec sent its shares up 16.6 per cent to $28.68.Equity Office Properties also gained on the news, adding 4 per cent to $36.41.At the close, the S&P 500 index was down 1.8 per cent, or 22.93 points, at 1,265.29, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.2 per cent, or 49.79 points, at 2,169.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.8 per cent, or 199.15 points, at 11,048.72, its lowest level in 12 weeks.Steelmakers suffered with Nucor losing 6.5 per cent to $50.41 and US Steel down 6.5 per cent to $65.02.Freeport McMoran sank 8.5 per cent to $51.91 after the company said copper production at one of its mines in Indonesia would be lower in the second quarter due to high levels of clay found in the section currently being mined.SanDisk was dragged lower in spite of a broker upgrade. The flash memory maker lost 1.8 per cent to $54.12, a 10 week low.Internet telephony provider Vonage gained 2.8 per cent to $12.32. On Friday, investors who bought shares in the company’s initial public offering filed a class-action lawsuit. Shares have fallen almost 30 per cent since the IPO less than two weeks ago.
509;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-05-22T08:16:12Z;CAT takes its final bow in the black;;Cambridge Antibody Technology reported an interim profit of £4.6m in what was likely to be the UK biotechnology group's last set of results before being absorbed by AstraZeneca in a friendly £702m takeover.Rising royalty fees from Humira, CAT's flagship monoclonal antibody for arthritis developed with Abbott of the US, helped boost revenue to £172.5m in the six months to 31 March, up from £9.8m the year before.Pre-tax losses totalled £16.5m in the comparable period last year.The figures were released after the company came to a final settlement in litigation with Abbott in October 2005, ending two years of legal battles that culminated in CAT receiving a 2.688 per cent royalty on Humira sales from the start of last year, up from 2 per cent previously.CAT also retained net royalties of £7.6m up until that date and reimbursed £9.2m in subsequent fees, while Abbott paid a further $255m (£135m) to CAT for on-payment to licensees and $9.4m in five annual payments.Monday's report showed that Deloitte & Touche, CAT's auditor, had changed its interpretation of how to account for the settlement under the new international financial reporting standards, now treating $255m in settlement as a non-adjusting post balance sheet event for 2006. Previously the sum was included in 2005 revenues.Abbott expects approval later this year for Humira's additional use to treat chronic inflammation of the spine, and continues to examine its scope for Crohn's disease, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.AstraZeneca, which had held a 19 per cent stake in CAT for the past two years and made a full bid at the start of this month, hopes to take advantage of the company's development skills across a broad range of products.Peter Chambré, CAT's chief executive, will leave as part of the deal, but AstraZeneca has introduced unspecified financial incentives designed to retain other senior employees.
510;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-05-16T17:06:31Z;Caterpillar plans $1bn acquisition of rail business;;Caterpillar announced plans on Tuesday to pay $1bn for a rail-services business in the latest move by a manufacturer to boost its exposure to higher-margin aftermarket sales.The US heavy-equipment maker is offering $800m in cash and stock for Alabama-based Progress Rail, which reconditions railcars and provides a range of railroad maintenance and repair services, generating sales of $1.2bn last year.Caterpillar said Progress Rail – whose management team will be retained - offered higher sales and earnings’ growth at a time when US rail operators are boosting investment to deal with the chronic bottlenecks which have hampered supply chains across the US, notably in the coal sector.“We’re acquiring it because we believe it has above-average growth potential, and feel its profitability is less cyclical than our machine and engine business,” said a Caterpillar official, noting the strategic fit with its existing marine and highway services unit.Companies with large installed-equipment bases are increasingly attracted to the aftermarket business, which typically offer higher margins and counter the cyclicality of core manufacturing operations.Boeing this month agreed to pay $2.05bn for Aviall, a provider of aviation parts and services, while a mix of acquisitions and organic growth has seen the aftermarket business expand to account for annual sales of $20bn last year at General Electric’s core infrastructure business.Caterpillar will also assume $200m in debt from its latest purchase, which is majority owned by the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. The investment group and had previously planned an initial public offering after leading the $438m buyout of the business in February 2005 from Progress Energy.The deal comes ahead of the announcement on Thursday of Caterpillar’s long-awaited expansion in China, where it aims to double its annual sales of $1bn by 2010. The company has held talks with both Xiamen Engineering and Shanghai Diesel.Caterpillar was advised by Monroe Securities and Lehman Brothers, while Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley advised Progress Rail.
511;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Lombard: Short-termism not exclusive investor right;;One of the more dangerous over-simplifications that regularly does the rounds in Whitehall is that the failings of British industry can be blamed on the City. Though few will rush to acknowledge it, the argument took another blow on Monday in one industry where it at least had a grain or two of truth to start with.Biotechnology companies have been among the most vociferous campaigners for greater freedom to raise new finance without going through the laborious process of giving existing shareholders the right to stump up first. They broadly got what they wanted on Monday with the publication of new guidance detailing what circumstances should allow fast-growing companies to suspend this traditional requirement for a rights issue.It is a shame therefore that the publication also coincided with news that Cambridge Antibody Technologies – the representative of the biotech industry on the report’s working panel – had decided to end its independence and agree its sale to AstraZeneca for £702m.You might think this was a tragic sign the changes had come just a moment too late for one of the brightest hopes in British bioscience. In fact, CAT had already successfully convinced institutional shareholders to allow a suspension of their right to a rights issue under the existing rules when AstraZeneca first took a 20 per cent stake in the company.Despite no shortage of cash, CAT described Monday’s deal as a “successful culmination” and the “next logical step”. It is also right to point out there are some benefits to being part of a larger drugs group.But the ironic coincidence of the two announcements reminds us that there are lots of non-financial reasons why small British technology companies do not always grow up to become big technology companies.It also shows that much of this debate has to do with perception rather than reality. Investors were perceived as inflexible and so companies rarely even asked them to consider suspending their pre-emption rights. Investors complained of a lack of consultation. The sensible compromise agreed on Monday reminds both sides to be flexible and chatty.Fortunately, this time government avoided the temptation to abandon the important principle of pre-emption rights entirely. Next time we may not be so lucky.Plenty of people have made fools of themselves trying to make sense of the irrational exuberance in today’s commodity markets and this column does not yet intend to join them. One less dangerous observation is that the incredible volatility in the price of metals such as copper makes it extremely difficult to value the companies tasked with digging the stuff out of the ground.That much was obvious on Monday when Xstrata, home to one of the shrewder management teams in the mining industry, saw its shares fall 8.4 per cent after several days of turmoil in the metals market.This may well be the beginning of the end – though many speculators have lost a lot of money waiting for this moment to come – but the complication for Xstrata is that it is also busy weighing up a decision whether to bid for Canadian rival Falconbridge. Unlike commodity investors, miners have the luxury of basing their business models on long- term price assumptions far below today’s rather less conservative spot price. Xstrata is also forced to avoid the temptation to fund a takeover with over-rated shares because North American investors do not want London paper.Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons why turmoil is not the best backdrop in which to plan complex mergers and acquisitions. An alternative offer for Falconbridge leaves investors the delightful conundrum of comparing today’s frothy share price with a mixture of cash and shares in a bidder whose share price is itself inflated by takeover froth.Xstrata has bravely called this market right before, by buying assets that rivals were in too much of a hurry to sell. Others may prefer to wait for a falling knife to hit the floor before attempting to pick it up.The 144 pages of dense type produced by the Civil Aviation Authority on Monday contain rather more compelling reasons for scepticism about the Spanish bid for BAA than the 29 pages of large type in the airport operator’s defence document.Just in case Ferrovial did not get the message last time, the CAA again reminded the Spanish group it would not come to the rescue if it sums were wrong. The increasingly loud warnings may be sensible preparatory work should a showdown ensue. It could also be a sign of panic – recognising there is little the regulator can do to stop an over-leveraged bid succeeding. Either way, the CAA is navigating uncharted airspace and needs to be careful not to appear to be taking sides.
512;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-04-24T17:08:33Z;US stocks fall despite strong earnings;;US stocks fell at the start of another heavy week of first-quarter earnings news as investors digested mixed results from companies including American Express, Xerox and Caterpillar.At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Index was 15.93 points or 0.1 per cent lower at 11331.52, and the S&P 500 Index was down 0.4 per cent or 5.15 points to 1306.13. The Nasdaq was also down 0.5 per cent or 11.8 points to 2331.13.This week marks the peak of earnings season, with 171 companies in the S&P 500 reporting results.“It has been a pretty strong season for earnings,” said John Butters from Thomson Financial. He said that about 69 per cent of companies that announced first quarter results had reported earnings above estimates. Nineteen per cent were in line in forecasts with only 13 per cent were below estimates.“Those numbers are better than the long term averages when 59 per cent of companies report above expectations, 21 per cent report in line with expectations and 20 per cent fall below analyst expectations,” he said. Several companies have also offered positive guidance for the future.The S&P constituents are now forecast to deliver a better-than-expected 12.6 per cent earnings growth for the first quarter. That would mark the 11th straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.Consumer services company Cendant was an early gainer on Wall Street, rising 4.1 per cent to $17.54. The company said it was considering selling its two travel divisions, Orbitz and Cheaptickets.com, to pay down debt. Cendant is spinning off Realogy Corp, its real estate services division, and Wyndham Worldwide, its hotels unit.Deal news was also in focus after Washington Mutual said on Sunday that it had reached an agreement to buy Commercial Capital for $983m in a deal that aims to extend WaMu’s presence in California.Shares in Commercial Capital jumped 10.7 per cent to $15.67, while Washington Mutual traded slightly lower at $44.31, down 1.6 per cent.Caterpillar gained on Monday after the company reported a 48 per cent increase in first quarter earnings, beating analysts’ expectations.The maker of diggers and construction equipment lifted net income to $840m, up from $581m the previous year. Its shares rose 1.6 per cent to $79.12 in early trading.Stocks that came under pressure included Xerox after it reported first quarter earnings short of analysts’ expectations. The maker of printers and photocopiers said first quarter profits fell 4.8 per cent due to sluggish sales. Its shares dropped 5.5 per cent to $13.99.American Express slipped 1.2 per cent to $51.60 in spite of reporting an 18 per cent rise in first quarter profits, and 1.5m new cardholders.
513;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-04-24T13:18:34Z;Upbeat Caterpillar lifts earnings guidance;;Caterpillar said on Monday that higher selling prices for its trademark heavy construction and earth-moving machinery could boost full-year earnings by almost a third in 2006.The enhanced outlook was accompanied by optimism that the current upswing in its cyclical markets would last longer than usual, driven by demand from the energy and mining sectors and buoyant worldwide infrastructure needs.“Strong underlying fundamentals are in place, and we believe this is a business cycle that has staying power,” said Jim Owens, chief executive, in a statement accompanying the US group’s first-quarter results.Caterpillar had struggled in recent quarters to keep up with the pace of demand as supply-chain problems and higher raw material costs hit margins. However, Mr Owens has expressed confidence in recent weeks that manufacturing issues were being resolved as it adapted relationships with key suppliers and took on new staff.The company boosted its 2006 guidance for earnings’ per share from $4.65-$5.00 to $4.85-$5.20 after reporting profits of $4.04 a share last year. The outlook for sales was left unchanged at $40bn, with most of the earnings’ lift coming from improved selling prices as higher input costs swallowed much of the expected advance in revenues this year.Caterpillar’s new guidance mirrors recent upgrades across much of the export-orientated US manufacturing sector, including higher guidance last week from 3M and Illinois Tool Works.However, some analysts caution that the current buoyancy is typical of a mid-cyclical bounce and expect the first half of 2006 to be more profitable than the second.The impact of price increases over the past 18 months and flat raw material costs helped Caterpillar to lift net profits in the three months to March 31 from $581m to $840m, while sales rose 13 per cent to a record $9.4bn. Earnings’ per share rose 13 per cent to $1.20, well above the $1.05 consensus among analysts.

0.2 per cent to 2,314.68.Boeing led industrial stocks higher, rising 3.3 per cent to $83.21 after the aircraft maker closed a deal to sell 80 of its 737 jets to China. The gain was Boeing’s largest percentage move in two months and was responsible for more than half of the Dow’s 40-point advance.Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock from $80 to $110, saying shares had the potential to reach $140 in three years “if the aerospace mid-cycle persists”.Other blue-chip gainers included Caterpillar, up 1.5 per cent to $77.84, and Honeywell, up 1.4 per cent to $42.46.Carmarkers were in focus as the Global Automotive Conference got underway in New York. General Motors, which said sales of its Chevrolet-brand cars were expected to grow by at least 50 per cent this year in China, saw its shares traded 4.2 per cent higher to $20.03. Ford Motor rose 1.5 per cent to $7.28 as it reassured investors that the rate of decline in its US market share was slowing.Circuit City was the top performer on the S&P, soaring 8.3 per cent to $26.65 as shoppers’ Christmas appetite for digital music players and flat-panel televisions boosted the consumer electronics retailer’s fourth-quarter profits by 65 per cent.Disappointing earnings results dragged shares in Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle maker, and Gannett, the newspaper publisher, lower. Harley dropped 5.9 per cent to $49.83, while Gannett lost 1.8 per cent to $57.76. Genentech, the biotechnology group, delivered a 48 per cent increase in first-quarter profit but the stock fell 1.8 per cent to $80.71 as sales of its blockbuster drug Rituzan fell short of analysts’ estimates.Danaher, the hand tool maker, agreed to acquire Sybron Dental Specialties, the dental-equipment maker in a deal valued at about $2bn, including debt. Danaher shares rose 0.9 per cent to $65.95, while Sybron surged 12.2 per cent to $46.81.Shares in Bausch & Lomb slumped for a second day, dropping 7 per cent to $45.61 as more stores removed its contact lens solution from shelves following reports of fungal infections among some users.Motorola gained 1.7 per cent to $23.98 following a rating upgrade from Bear Stearns.Callaway Golf slid 8 per cent to $15.55 after the golf equipment maker issued a pre-earnings warning."

The move, which gives Citigroup the green light to hit the acquisition trail, combined with easing concerns over interest rates to lift the sector.The S&P Financials index was the top performing industry group, with Bank of America up 1.4 per cent at $46.29, JPMorgan up 1.6 per cent at $42.27 and Wells Fargo up 0.8 per cent to $64.87.The gains were enough to help shake the market out of its early torpor. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session 0.5 per cent higher at 11,203.85, the S&P 500 gained 0.6 per cent to 1,305.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent to 2,345.36.“A lot of the what the market was nervous about on Monday – higher oil prices, interest rates and its effect on corporate earnings – has subsided,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The focus is now on earnings. The numbers are expected to be good and so people are buying today to get in position before these numbers come out.”The retreat in crude oil prices gave airline and transportation stocks a boost, but communications equipment makers fell after analysts at Banc of America downgraded the sector from “positive” to “neutral”.The broker cited valuation concerns for the downgrade, adding that it expected profit growth to be more limited following a strong performance in the first quarter. Ciena fell 5.9 per cent to $4.91, while JDS Uniphase, which rose 3.5 last week, dropped 4.2 per cent to $3.91.The upbeat outlook on first-quarterly results was reinforced by Merck, which edged up 0.2 per cent to $35.48 after the drug maker raised its quarterly guidance.The Dow also found support from 3M and Caterpillar. 3M, maker of Scotch tapes and Post-it Notes, rose more than 1.5 per cent to $77 after it said it was considering selling its branded pharmaceuticals business.Reports that Caterpillar might receive as much as $5bn in new orders from Canadian oil and mining companies helped shares in the machinery maker climb 2.5 per cent to $75.30.Elsewhere, Computer Sciences jumped 4.4 per cent to $59.80 after the computer service provider announced plans to reduce its headcount by 5,000.Google, up 3.8 per cent at $404.34, saw its shares trade above $400 for the first time since early February as index funds continued to buy the stock following its inclusion last week in the S&P 500.

Caterpillar rose 2.5 per cent to $76.21 and Honeywell gained 0.9 per cent to $42.66.The gains took the Dow 0.7 per cent higher at 11,317.43, while the broader S&P 500, buoyed by gains in energy stock climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,305.04. The Nasdaq Composite turned around earlier losses to trade 0.4 per cent higher at 2,303.35.Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as financials and homebuilders rose. Morgan Stanley, which topped analyst expectations with its 17 per cent increase in first-quarter profit, jumped 2.5 per cent to $61.94, while JPMorgan added 1.9 per cent to $41.99.Pharmaceutical stocks also moved broadly higher after drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb settled a key patent dispute with Canadian generic drugmaker Apotex.The deal, which would allow Bristol to retain patent protection on its blockbuster Plavix blood thinning treatment until 2011, prompted rating upgrades from UBS, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan.Bristol shares shot up 10.6 per cent to $25.24, while Eli Lilly ended the session 2.1 per cent higher at $58.49.Overall, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology index rose 1.2 per cent to become the second-best performing industry group on the S&P.By contrast, technology stocks were under pressure, with Microsoft sliding 2.1 per cent to $27.15 after it announced late on Tuesday that the finished consumer version of its Vista operating system would not be available until next year.Although the latest hold-up represents only a small setback after two years of delays, the move dealt a potentially damaging blow to sales of PC makers during the crucial holiday shopping
season.Shares in Hewlett-Packard slid 0.5 per cent to $33.36 while Gateway slumped 2.8 per cent to $2.36. Apple Computer, which does not use the Windows operating system, also got caught in the the falling trend, easing 0.2 per cent to $61.67 after having risen by as much as 1.5 per cent earlier in the day.Losses on the Nasdaq were pared by Chaparral Steel, which surged 16.5 per cent to $57.50 following a strong quarterly earnings report. The robust figures set off a buying spree on metal makers. US Steel jumped 4.4 per cent to $59.86 while Alcoa gained 0.8 per cent to $29.36.On the earnings front, Nike and FedEx both exceeded analysts’ expectations with their earnings. Nike rose 2.2 per cent to $86.82 while FedEx gained 1.1 per cnet to $114.44."
517;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-03-15T22:05:28Z;Wall Street powers ahead to 5-year highs;;The S&P 500 broke the 1,300 mark on Wednesday as fading concerns about US interest rates helped propel the index above the psychologically important resistance barrier. It prompted hopes that stocks have broken out of their recent trading range.The rally started in afternoon trade after the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report said the US economy was growing at a steady, moderate pace with inflationary pressures contained. The report was widely taken as evidence that the central bank would soon be done with its cycle of monetary tightening.The news triggered a rally among industrial blue chips. Caterpillar surged 3.3 per cent to $74.29, while Honeywell gained 1.2 per cent to $42.85. The blue chip index also found support in DuPont, which rose 2.7 per cent to $42.81 after the chemicals manufacturer increased its first-quarter profit forecast and announced a restructuring plan.This, along with a dip in crude prices, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.52 per cent higher to 11,209.77, while the S&P 500 gained 0.43 per cent to 1,303.02 – its highest close in almost five years – and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.69 per cent to 2,311.84.“This is the first time in recent memory we have had a two-day rally,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The follow-through is important because it gets a lot of people to wake to the fact that this market is getting some life.”The railways sector was in focus after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit estimates by 20 per cent.The revised guidance prompted Merrill Lynch to raise its price estimates for Union and four other rail companies. “We believe this is a clear signal that the rail industry continues to benefit from record pricing gains and subsequent earnings leverage,” Merrill said.The S&P transportation index jumped 1.8 per cent, boosted by shares of Union, up 5.9 per cent at $90.25, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, up 6.3 per cent at $81.30 and Norfolk Southern, up 4.7 per cent at $53.92.Investors also had their eyes on the banking sector after Lehman Brothers became the second major investment bank to report record quarterly profits and revenue. First-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent but Lehman shares fell 0.8 per cent to $144.15 as investors took profits after the previous session’s gains.Bear Stearns, due to report its results today, was down 0.2 per cent to $134.21 while Morgan Stanley, which will release its figures next week, fell 0.7 per cent to $59.64.Elsewhere, Sears Holdingssurged 12.8 per cent to $132.29 after it delivered first-quarter profits that beat market expectations.Shares in CVS fell 2.8 per cent to $29.71 after the pharmacy chain said the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an informal investigation into its accounting practices.Shares in H&R Block dropped 6.2 per cent to $20.63 as the biggest tax preparer in the US became the latest company to draw the attention of the New York state attorney, Eliot Spitzer. Mr Spitzer said his office has charged the company with fraud, alleging that H&R Block duped clients into investing their tax refunds in retirement accounts that cost more in fees than they generated in interest.
518;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-02-15T21:46:38Z;Wall St higher as Bernanke upbeat on economy;;Wall Street moved higher on Wednesday as investors mulled over Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s first congressional testimony and weighed risks of higher interest rates and continued economic expansion.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 11,058.97, the S&P 500 added 0.4 per cent to 1,280, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,276.43.Merrill Lynch moved higher after it said it had agreed to merge its investment management division with BlackRock to form a company with about $1,000bn in assets under management.Shares in Merrill added 0.2 per cent to $75.30 while BlackRock, the name under which the new company will trade, rose 3.6 per cent to $151.25.Merrill recommended other financial stocks to investors, with upgrades to Bank of New York and Bear Stearns.Bank of New York was an attractive target because of its processing and banking businesses, Merrill said. The stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” and gained 1.1 per cent to $33.86.Bear Stearns rose 1.6 per cent to $131.61 after Merrill raised its rating from “neutral” to “buy”. The broker said potential earnings’ growth was not reflected fully in Bear Stearns’ share price.Applied Materials, the world’s largest chip equipment maker, gained 1 per cent to $20.46 in advance of the release of its results after the close.Michael O’Brien at Bear Stearns said: “We want to remind investors that we expect the company to easily beat all guidance, and expect further share price appreciation as investors increasingly realise that the cycle has sustainability.”Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, reported a 58 per cent rise in fourth quarter profit, but the shares fell 2.1 per cent to $67.33 after the company warned full-year earnings expectations were unlikely to be met.Myers Industries, the plastics manufacturer, said currency effects hit fourth-quarter net profit, but shares leapt 7.1 per cent to $15.42 after it said it might sell non-core assets.Legg Mason Capital Management revealed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had built up a 25 per cent stake in Eastman Kodak, making it the photographic company’s biggest shareholder. Shares in Kodak gained 6.6 per cent to $26.54.Helping lift the Dow, was a 2 per cent rise to $71.60 for Caterpillar after Canada’s Finning International, the world’s biggest dealer of Caterpillar-brand equipment, reported quarterly net income jumped 80 per cent.And Merck rose 1.8 per cent to $35.29 after it said regulators had accepted its application for review of its experimental oral diabetes treatment.Although weekly US data showed stockpiles growing, some oil stocks staged a rally, with Marathon Oil adding 1.5 per cent to $67.53 and Valero Energy gaining 1.6 per cent to $50.57.
519;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-01-27T21:58:09Z;Corporate earnings flow helps Wall Street higher;;"Wall Street shrugged off concerns about the pace of economic growth on Friday as the improved flow of corporate earnings drove US equity markets sharply higher.The week had produced robust quarterly figures from Caterpillar, the heavy machinery group, United Technologies, the aerospace and industrial concern, and jet maker Lockheed Martin, which helped ease concerns about profit growth at US companies. Shares in Caterpillar rose nearly 12 per cent over the five days.This was followed by strong earnings on Friday from Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods group that last year bought Gillette, and computer software group Microsoftthe previous evening.The combination helped the markets shrug off news that the US economy grew much less than expected in the fourth quarter.In fact, indications that economic expansion may have started to flag raised hopes that Alan Greenspan, outgoing Federal Reserve chairman, would use the Fed’s next meeting on Tuesday to signal an end to the prolonged period of interest rate tightening.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.9 per cent higher at 10,907.21, the fourth day out of five that blue-chip stocks had gained. The positive run helped erase the memory of a sharp sell-off in equities the previous Friday.The broader S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 1,283.72 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,304.23.This took the weekly gain in the Dow to 2.3 per cent; in the S&P to 1.8 per cent; and in Nasdaq to 2.5 per cent.Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co, said the week had seen a change in sentiment.“Last week there were lots of negatives with earnings guidance. But right now there is more good news than bad news out there.“European and Asian markets are strong and with these numbers from Microsoft and Procter & Gamble we have the foundations for a good market.”However, wider concerns were never far from the surface, as the week gave more evidence of a slowdown in the US housing market. The market also remained wary of fluctuations in the oil price, ahead of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna, which begins on Tuesday.The week brought an upswing in merger and acquisition activity and an end to the two-month battle for Guidant, the heart devices maker.It opted for a $27bn deal with Boston Scientific, which meant defeat for rival healthcare group Johnson & Johnson. However, news of weak quarterly earnings from Guidant on Friday weighed on the deal, and Boston shares ended the week down 9 per cent.Walt Disney, the entertainment house, also sealed the $7bn acquisition of Pixar, the animation house that made the Toy Story cartoons, a deal that was well received.“We view the Disney-Pixar combination as a near-perfect strategic fit,” said Jessica Reif Cohen, at Morgan Stanley. Disney shares ended the week down 2.6 per cent.Steel consolidation was also on the agenda, particularly after news that Mittal Steel had made a $22.8bn approach for European rival Arcelor. Shares in US Steel were up more than 17 per cent on the week on hope it too could receive a takeover.The auto industry continued to make the wrong sort of headlines, as General Motors unveiled its biggest loss since 1992, hurt by a $4.8bn fourth-quarter deficit, and Ford Motor announced plans to axe 25,000 jobs and close seven plants in an effort to scale back capacity. That said, General Motors remained the best performing Dow stock last week, up more than 17 per cent.Om Friday, tech stocks came to the fore after Microsoft, up 4.9 per cent to $27.79, reported solid quarterly figures.Chipmaker Broadcom surged 19 per cent to $69.87 as its profits tripled and came in well ahead of Wall Street expectations.Procter & Gamble gained 1.6 per cent to $59.74 on higher-than-expected earnings.Oil giant Chevron rose 0.3 per cent to $60.38 as the continued high oil price pushed its earnings well ahead of the year before.However, a downgrade from “overweight” to “neutral” from JPMorgan pulled Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer, down 1 per cent to $45.84."
520;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
521;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-01-27T00:20:00Z;Caterpillar sales rise in midst of supply troubles;;Caterpillar on Thursday admitted it was cherry-picking some customers to boost sales margins as supplier bottlenecks constrained its ability to meet surging demand for the US group’s construction and mining equipment.Sales have climbed 60 per cent over the past two years and are forecast to rise another 10 per cent in 2006, but the company said it had maintained its overall market share despite favouring a “very small” element of higher-margin contracts.Jim Owens, chief executive, said Caterpillar could have met the increased global demand for its trademark heavy trucks and earth-moving equipment if components were more readily available.However, while it is continuing to improve its supply chain and manufacturing efficiency, the company has been cautious about creating overcapacity.“We’re preparing to have substantially improved profitability during the [next] downcycle,” Mr Owens said. “We’re painfully aware of the long-term volatility of the industry.”Net profits and sales reached highs in the fourth quarter to December 31, with earnings rising from $551m to $846m and sales up 13 per cent to $9.67bn.Caterpillar was able to push up average selling prices by 7 per cent in the final quarter, taking the full-year gain to 5 per cent. It expects to secure a further 3 per cent advance in 2006, with volumes expected to climb by 7 per cent.Some products such as mining equipment are sold out through 2007, and Mr Owens is bullish about growth.“This cycle has legs,” he added, and “looks stronger” than upturns in the 1980s and 1990s.Questions over Caterpillar’s ability to meet demand had weighed on its stock price in the second half of last year. The company formed a new management team to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce inventories, while providing incentives for suppliers.Sales in 2005 rose 40 per cent to a record $36.34bn. Full-year net profits rose 40 per cent to $2.85bn, or $4.04 a share, and the company raised its 2006 outlook from prior guidance to $4.65-$5.

Caterpillar shares gained 5 per cent to $65.17.Also raising guidance for the year, after reporting a surge in quarterly earnings, was Lockheed Martin, the defence group. Its shares rose 3 per cent to $66.99.More sobering was news of a large quarterly loss at General Motors. The ailing carmaker lost 3.4 per cent to $23.05 after reporting fourth-quarter losses of $4.8bn, which contributed to its largest annual deficit since 1992. GM remains the best-performing Dow stock this year, up almost 19 per cent, albeit from a low base.Overall, it was a strong day for equity markets, helped by a robust performance from the financial services sector. The S&P 500 financial services index rose almost 2 per cent.The Dow ended 0.9 per cent higher at 10,809.47, which took the index back above the level at which it began the year. The S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,273.82 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1 per cent to 2,283.00.The rally was helped by the latest batch of economic data that revealed durable goods orders rose more than expected in December and the number of unemployment claimants remained low.Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards & Sons, said: “The market had to digest a lot and that reached a climax on Friday [when US stocks fell sharply]. But I think we are now back into the dominant trend, which is up.”He also said signs of weakness in the US housing market could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates sooner rather than later, which would please investors.In other earnings news, engineering group Honeywell International gained 3.7 per cent to $37.41 thanks to strong demand for its aircraft parts and services.Telecommunications group AT&T rose 1.2 per cent to $25.51 after solid quarterly earnings. Tellabs surged 19.6 per cent to $12.57 after the telecoms equipment maker forecast a rise in first-quarter earnings.However, Apple Computer lost 2.5 per cent to $72.33 as Bear Stearns said search engine Google was working on a rival to Apple’s iTunes download service.Brunswick slumped 13 per cent to $36.04 in spite of higher quarterly earnings as the pleasure-boat maker gave disappointing guidance.There was a sparkling debut for Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain in which McDonald’s has a large stake. Priced at $22, the share doubled in value to end at $44.
523;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2006-01-09T21:57:21Z;Dow closes above 11,000 to hit 4 ½ year high;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the talk of Wall Street yesterday after the blue chip index broke through the 11,000 mark for the first time in four and a half years.The Dow ended the session 0.5 per cent higher at 11,011.90, powered by a sharp rally for General Motors. The other indices also extended their gains from last week. The S&P 500 added 0.4 per cent to 1,290.15 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,318.69.Analysts agreed that the importance of the milestone was chiefly psychological. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said continued profit growth would be the main catalyst for the market this month.“What is important is that earnings continue coming through above expectations,” he said.The Dow would not have broken through the 11,000 mark without GM, whose 7.7 per cent advance accounted for nearly 13 points of the index’s 53 points advance.Shares in the ailing carmaker surged $1.60 to $22.41 after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.Noting that GM lost more than half of its market value last year, analyst Robert Barry said his “long-term view of GM fundamentals remained squarely negative”.However, he added that “a Chapter 11 filing [was] very unlikely anytime soon, upcoming catalysts could improve sentiment and allay bankruptcy fears” and he said that GM shares could rebound to the mid-$20 range in the first half of this year.American Express, up 2.5 per cent at $53.99, and Caterpillar, up 1.5 per cent at $61.34, also lent support to the Dow.Alcoa, which kicked off the earnings season yesterday, provided the rally with extra steam, rising 1.6 per cent to $30.68.Meanwhile, positive sentiment surrounding the Detroit motor show gave the wider auto sector a lift, with Ford gaining 2.6 per cent to $8.74.GM’s rally helped offset losses in fellow Dow component IBM, which slipped 1.8 per cent to $83.46 after JPMorgan cut its rating on the computer maker and lowered its price target for the stock.JPMorgan also downgraded Amazon, driving the online retailer 2.7 per cent lower to $46.59.Elsewhere, reports that Tyco International was considering a break up of its $60bn business sent the conglomerate up 3.3 per cent to $30.96.On the deal front, Guidant rose 2.4 per cent to $68.99 as Boston Scientific made a formal bid to acquire its rival medical device maker for $25bn, or $72 a share. Shares in Boston Scientific lost 1.7 per cent to $25.79.Elsewhere, financial heavyweights JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch rose 1.2 per cent to $40.50 and 1.4 per cent to $69.68, respectively, after an upgrade from Prudential. The broker said that merger and acquisition activity in 2005 should lift earnings.
524;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-12-22T22:51:52Z;Confidence filters through to Wall St indices;;Wall Street sprinted ahead yesterday after a string of generally positive economic figures renewed the view among investors that the Federal Reserve would soon end its cycle of monetary tightening.In addition to news of higher consumer spending and stronger US economic activity, investors were cheered by a soft PCE measure – the inflation gauge favoured by the Federal Reserve – which rose 0.1 per cent in the month rather than the 0.2 per cent expected by analysts.“The tame inflation data reinforced expectations that the US economy will accelerate, with inflation under control entering 2006,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach.The upbeat outlook on the US economy propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5 per cent higher to 10,889.44 on an otherwise thin pre-Christmas trading session.The broader S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent to 1,268.12, while the Nasdaq Composite, powered by a 1.3 per cent rally in the semiconductor sector, rose 0.7 per cent to 2,246.49.However, Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co, cautioned that the gains were nothing to write home about.“The gains follows the natural ebb and flow of market movement,” he said.Dow components Caterpillar and American International Group both advanced after being named sector favourites by brokerage firms. Caterpillar rallied 2.4 per cent to $58.45, while AIG firmed up 2.2 per cent to $58.45.Technology stocks were in focus after Research in Motion surged 10.6 per cent to $68.30. The Blackberry maker rose after reporting solid third-quarter profit.Investors were less enthused by Micron Technology however. Shares in the chipmaker slipped 3.5 per cent to $13.64 after it missed earnings estimates for its fiscal first quarter.On the deals front, General Electric rose 1 per cent to $35.42 after the conglomerate’s real estate unit agreed to buy commercial real-estate investment trust Arden Realty for about $3.2bn in cash. Shares in Arden fell 3.9 per cent to $45.18.Meanwhile, Barrick Gold looked set to become the world’s biggest gold digger after it agreed to buy rival Placer Dome for $10.4bn, or $22.50 a share. Shares for both companies fell, with Barrick easing back 0.4 per cent to $27.12 and Placer Dome dropping 1.4 per cent to $22.34.Shares of CVS, SuperValu and Kimco Realty all retreated after grocery chain Albertsons reportedly rejected the consortium’s $9.6bn takeover bid. CVS fell 1.6 per cent to $27.13, SuperValu dipped 0.1 per cent to $32.34 and Kimco edged down 0.3 per cent to $32.77, while Albertson traded 3.4 per cent lower at $23.28.Elsewhere, Google put on another 1.3 per cent to reach $432.04 after JMP Securities raised its 12-month target price for the stock to a staggering $575.Microsoft pulled back 0.5 per cent to $26.59 after the European Union threatened to fine the software giant $2.37m a day for anti-competitive practices.
525;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-12-19T22:22:05Z;Wall St skids as nervous investors take profits;;Stocks fell for a third consecutive day on Monday as traders took profit at the expense of technology stocks and industrial blue chips.The Nasdaq Composite index closed down 29.74 points, or 1.2 per cent – its biggest one-day loss in almost 2 months.The decline was led by semiconductor stocks, which fell after brokerage Stifel Nicolaus cut its rating on six stocks in the sector, saying the market had already taken into account most of the industry’s strengths.Overall the Amex semiconductor index shed 2.3 per cent with chip giants Intel down 2.3 per cent at $25.78 and Texas Instruments down 3.1 per cent at $32.03.Meanwhile, sharp gains in the pharmaceutical sector failed to keep the other two indices afloat. A 4.7 per cent drop in Caterpillar and a 3.8 per cent pullback in General Motors forced the Dow Jones Industrial Average to reverse earlier gains and end the session 0.4 per cent, or 39.22 points, lower at 10,836.37.The broader S&P 500 dropped 0.6 per cent, or 7.40 points, to 1,259.92.Some analysts said the poor trading session was an indication that the year-end rally had run its course. However, there were others who argued that the market was still in the consolidating phrase following its huge rally in November.“You have to put the declines in perspective,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards & Sons. “This bull market has been going on for 38 months and it can’t continue to rock and roll day in and day out like it used to when the it was young and had lots of energy.”“This does not mean it’s going to die, but it justifies the indices having a longer period of R&R,” he added. “That said, a day or two more days like this, then that’s going to seriously affect my sleeping pattern.”Among the gainers, Pfizer surged 7.7 per cent to $24.32 after it won a key court ruling blocking generic competition for its Lipitor cholesterol treatment. Under the ruling, generic versions of Pfizer’s drug are blocked until 2011, giving the company time to develop new moneymaking products.The news sent shares in fellow drugmaker Merck 7.5 per cent higher to $32.25 while Johnson & Johnson gained 2.1 per cent to $61.19.Bristol Myers and Forest Labs, companies that are also involved in patent disputes, traded higher too. Bristol climbed 2.3 per cent to $22.53 and Forest Labs rose 1.7 per cent to $41.81.On the Nasdaq, not even Google could buck the falling trend.Shares in the internet search engine skidded 1.3 per cent to $426.60 after having risen 1.4 per cent on reports that it was in talks with Time Warner to buy a 5 per cent stake in the company’s AOL division for $1bn.The deal would widen the existing advertising tie-up between the two companies while preventing Microsoft from getting a lift in the search advertisements market.Both Time Warner and Microsoft dipped 0.3 per cent, to $17.95 and $26.83 respectively.News that Cablevision Systems was cancelling last week’s $1bn bond sale sent shares in the multimedia service provider tumbling 3.5 per cent to $23.15. The new bonds would have breached covenants in its existing borrowings.The money from the sale was to have been used to pay a special $3bn dividend to stockholders.On the retail front, Circuit City, the consumer electronics retailer, surged 5.9 per cent to $22.51 after it swung into a third-quarter profit.Its rival Radioshack fell 4.6 per cent to $21.17 after Bank of America slashed its rating.Elsewhere, FPL Group confirmed plans to buy Constellation Energy in a deal valued at $11bn.

526;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-12-08T13:35:20Z;Nato ministers welcome US shift on interrogation;;Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato’s secretary general, on Thursday said that Condoleezza Rice, US secretary of state, had “cleared the air” over claims of secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons and alleged torture.His comments came after Ms Rice and fellow Nato foreign ministers held discussions at a gathering in Brussels and followed a statement signalling a major policy shift.The statement, released on Wednesday, stated explicitly that US personnel were prohibited from using “cruel, inhumane and degrading” treatment of detainees as she weathered protests in Europe over secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons and alleged torture.The “secret prisons” issue was a central topic at a joint EU-Nato ministers’ dinner on Wednesday night, with Ms Rice coming under considerable pressure – particularly from Nordic states, Luxembourg and France – to explain Washington’s position.Though the dinner was ‘closed’ Frank-Walter Steinmeier, German foreign minister, said the secretary of state had assured ministers that the US did not interpret international law differently from governments in Europe, whilst Ben Bot, foreign minister of the Netherlands, said that he had been “very satisfied” with Ms Rice’s comments.Members of the US Congress, who had pressed for the change, and human rights activists also welcomed the statement as a policy U-turn.Bush administration officials, including Alberto Gonzales, attorney-general, had argued that important sections of the United Nations international convention against torture (CAT) did not apply outside US territory. But Scott McClellan, White House spokesman, insisted that Ms Rice’s comments were a restatement of existing policy.“As a matter of US policy, the US obligations under the CAT, which prohibits cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment – those obligations extend to US personnel wherever they are,” Ms Rice said in Ukraine.Her comments appeared to contradict the views of Mr Gonzales, who earlier this year wrote in responses to questions from Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat senator, that “the department of justice has concluded that …there is no legal prohibition under the CAT on cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment with respect to aliens overseas”.A justice department spokesman on Wednesday said Mr Gonzales had been expressing the legal opinion of the department and not US policy. He said the department of justice has not altered that determination.Carl Levin, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, said Ms Rice’s remarks were “almost a total reversal” on the administration’s previous detention and interrogation policies.The shift marks a major victory for John McCain, the Arizona Republican senator who has sponsored legislation banning the “cruel, inhumane, and degrading” treatment of prisoners by US personnel anywhere in the world. Senate and House members are currently meeting to iron out differences in the 2006 defence spending bill, which include whether the bill will include the McCain amendment.The White House originally threatened to veto any legislation that included the McCain measure. More recently it had lessened its opposition, saying it would accept the amendment if it included an exception for Central Intelligence Agency personnel. But Mr McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has remained adamant that the legislation cannot include any loopholes.One congressional aide said the policy change followed a series of discussions between Mr McCain and Stephen Hadley, national security adviser. The shift also represents a significant defeat for Mr Cheney, who has spearheaded efforts within the administration to block the McCain measure.“What Rice has effectively done is to accept the McCain amendment,” said Tom Malinowski, Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “It appears to be a significant shift and a welcome one. I hope somebody remembers to tell [CIA director] Porter Goss to throw away his water board.”Marking Human Rights Day at the United Nations, Louise Arbour, the high commissioner for human rights, said the US was losing its “moral leadership” because of a perception that its commitment to civil liberties was slipping. A former war crimes prosecutor, Ms Arbour said secret prisons amounted to “disappearances” and was a form of torture.John Bolton, US ambassador to the UN, rejected her comments as “inappropriate and illegitimate” based on second-guessing US behaviour through reading newspapers.s Rice’s visit to Europe this week has been dogged by questions over alleged abuses of detainees in secret CIA facilities in Europe. It had been aimed at building on recent progress in repairing transatlantic relations, particularly with Germany.
527;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-11-03T21:43:33Z;Wall Street higher on robust retail data;;Strong monthly sales data from retailers and a sanguine assessment of the US economy by the Federal Reserve chairman pushed Wall Street broadly higher on Thursday.Retailers accounted for the majority of the top 25 best performers on the New York Stock Exchange. Clothing and shoe retailers saw tidy gains but general stores also advanced.Aeropostale, up 10.12 per cent at $22.19, led the charge. Guess was not far behind, up 12.9 per cent to $31.60.Other retailers propelled higher by the broad sector rally included DSW, up 8.6 per cent to $22.75, and Men’s Wearhouse, up 10.65 per cent advance to $28.77.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, fell 0.23 per cent to $47.69 after it reiterated its forecast for same-store sales. Rival Target, a rival, declined 0.3 per cent to $56.80, while Saks fell 0.6 per cent to $18.22.Stocks received a further boost from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who told Congress that the world’s largest economy was still sound, in spite of hurricanes and energy price increases.Against this background, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent, or 49.86 points, to 10,522.59 by the close, while the broader S&P 500 put on 0.4 per cent, or 5.18 points, to 1,219.94. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.74 per cent, or 15.91 points, to 2,160.22.Leading the gains on the Dow was Merck, up 3.8 per cent at $29.48 after a jury found the drugmaker not guilty in a trial related to the side effects of its Vioxx painkiller.Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker and also a Dow component, was up 1.25 per cent to $21.87.Boeing, up 1.2 per cent to $65.50, and McDonald’s, 3 per cent stronger at $33.23, were also among the main gainers on the Dow industrials.Among the companies announcing earnings yesterday, Sara Lee shares increased 2 per cent to $17.87 after the panties-to-pastries group topped analyst forecasts.On the downside, Montpelier Re Holdings shares plunged 13.64 per cent to $18.55 after the reinsurer posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.Comcast, the largest cable TV systems operator in the US, fell 5 per cent to $27.36 after it reported that third quarter profit growth was essentially flat.The news came even as revenue from digital cable and high-speed internet services was showing improvement.Guidant traded down 4.7 per cent to $57.57 after Banc of America slashed the medical device maker’s price target to reflect the uncertainty surrounding Johnson & Johnson’s $25.4bn bid for the company.
528;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-10-31T18:47:55Z;Caterpillar sees strong worldwide growth;;Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, forecast strong global growth on Monday but warned it would not over-invest in capacity for fear of being exposed to the next downturn.The US manufacturer, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the worldwide commodities boom, was punished by investors last month as supply bottlenecks and rising production costs held back its otherwise rapid growth. It also expects certain products to sell out in 2006 as demand, particularly from Asia, continues to outstrip supply.But Jim Owens, the former economist turned chief executive, cautioned analysts in New York on Monday that trying to meet all demands at this stage in the cycle could prove counter-productive over the longer term.“We would rather shave earnings off the peak to have better earnings in the trough,” he said in an interview. “If we put in all the capacity we needed overnight we would not have profitability in the next cycle.”He gave the example of welding, where Caterpillar has chosen to outsource some work to expensive outside contractors rather than invest in internal capacity which may not be needed over the long term.Rising costs for such work played a part in third-quarter earnings that disappointed some investors and drove Caterpillar shares down by nearly a fifth in October.“Performance in the trough is really important, too – it’s going to be a big factor in our [share price] multiple,” said Mr Owens.Nevertheless, the company also on Monday announced aggressive targets for the next few years. Caterpillar expects compounded average earnings growth of 15-20 per cent until 2010 when sales are expected to reach $50bn.Juggling the conflicting demands of booming global markets is particularly tricky for Caterpillar, which employs 84,000 people and has not seen sales grow this fast since 1947.“It’s a balancing act for the whole industry,” said Mr Owens. Many suppliers are working round the clock, he said, but it took a while for big tyre manufacturers such as Goodyear and Bridgestone to believe in the sustainability of the recovery and invest in new capacity.Caterpillar will continue to reduce the number of its global suppliers, but increasingly aims to have one for each currency zone rather than rely on single suppliers across the world.Mr Owens was nonetheless upbeat about the sustainability of economic growth. “The global economy looks pretty healthy to us …the only pocket of weakness is in western Europe,” he said. “Long declines [in investment] have led to long recoveries in the past.”The company also hopes to reduce inventory levels among dealers, which have often exacerbated swings in demand during past cycles. Instead it hopes to extend the build-to-order model it uses for larger engines and mining equipment.Mr Owens said he saw no reason why it could not extend this “Dell-like precision” to more mass-market machines such as the small “skid steer” loaders used to dig or move building materials.
529;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-07-15T15:42:51Z;Kevin Goldstein-Jackson: Cash rolls;;My self-invested personal pension scheme (Sipp) has recently increased its already large cash pile – and yet more cash is due to arrive soon.In April, when Allied Domecq announced it was in “early stage” discussions regarding a takeover bid by Pernod Ricard, I hoped that rival bidders would emerge to drive the share price higher.Unfortunately, the only rival to appear was a consortium led by US drinks firm Constellation Brands which made an “indicative proposal” regarding a potential offer. On June 17 the consortium announced it would not proceed with a bid.This left me with having to decide whether to sell Allied shares in the market or accept Pernod’s offer of 545p in cash and 0.0158 of a new Pernod Ricard share for each Allied share held. Or, according to the offer document, I could attempt a “mix and match election” to vary the proportions of cash and Pernod shares received. It was estimated that cash and “statements of entitlements” to new Pernod shares would be issued “by 9 August”.I thought taking cash from selling in the market was the quickest, safest and easiest option so sold my Sipp’s Allied holding on June 20 for 676.1p per share. This month I also received Allied’s interim dividend of 6.5p per share.My Allied shareholding has therefore been quite profitable since the shares had cost 292p each in January 2000.Also on June 20 I sold my Sipp’s holding in Falkland Oil and Gas (FOG) for 120p each. The shares had been acquired as a result of FOG’s offer of shares at 40p each when it floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in October last year.The temptation to take such a good profit was too great to resist. My Sipp still has a holding in Falkland Islands Holdings which has a large shareholding in FOG so I should still benefit if oil and gas are eventually commercially extracted by FOG’s activities.More cash will flow into my Sipp if shareholders in Radamec approve its plans for a members’ voluntary liquidation (MVL) at an extraordinary general meeting on July 28. After selling land and various high-tech subsidiaries, Radamec accrued a pile of cash and the MVL has been proposed as a way of distributing that cash to shareholders.According to the company’s June 30 circular to shareholders, it is proposed that, “in the absence of any unforeseen circumstances”, the first of a number of capital distributions in cash will be made “between six and eight weeks after the commencement of the MVL”.While my Sipp will show a profit from its Radamec holding, the same cannot be said of its dreadful investment in Xenova which is currently the target of a bid by Celtic Pharma Development UK.In July 1999 my Sipp invested in two Cambridge-based companies: Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) and Cantab Pharmaceuticals, paying 186p and 196p per share respectively.I sold part of the CAT holding in January 2000 for £12.40 per share and the remainder in July that year when the shares were £29.25.Early in March 2000 Cantab’s shares were over 700p. But I did not take profits. I held on in the hope of greater gains. Instead, the share price began to slide and when the failure of one of its vaccines was announced in October 2000 the shares plummeted to 76.5p.In March 2001 Cantab merged with Xenova. Both firms were loss making. For every seven Cantab shares held, a replacement of 11 new Xenova shares was given.In August 2003 Xenova took over another loss-making firm, KS Biomedix. Although I disapproved of the deal I retained my shares. In December that year Xenova underwent a further share restructuring.In its circular of June 24 this year to Xenova shareholders, Celtic is offering a choice of secured loan notes, or cash and secured loan notes or just cash. The pure cash offer is worth just 4.5p per Xenova share. It means, effectively, that after all the various share restructurings over the years I will have lost around 94 per cent of the original 1999 value of my Cantab/Xenova investment.It is experiences like this that have helped shaped my views in now trying to cut losses sooner. I should also have taken some profits on Cantab by selling part of my holding when I had a chance to make a fat profit rather than being too greedy and hoping that its performance would match that of Cambridge Antibody.
530;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-04-20T20:45:40Z;Market Overview: Focus turns to corporate earnings as tech bellwether leads the way;;Data showing higher-than-expected US inflation were enough to drive the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 to new lows for the year on Wednesday as traders chose to overlook some solid corporate earnings news.Results from US technology bellwether Intel and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar pleased investors, and the leading indices notched modest gains in early trade.But sentiment took a turn for the worse in late trade, and the Dow finished with a loss of 1.1 per cent at 10,012.36. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,137.50 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 1,913.76.The strife spread to European stocks, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index falling 0.6 per cent to 1,064.63.Asian markets fared slightly better after a rally on Tuesday. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.2 per cent, while Taiwan stocks held their losses to 1 per cent.The day’s main economic news came from the US. Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose by 0.4 per cent in March, twice the expected increase. The data provided a marked contrast to Tuesday’s benign producer price figures. “Today’s core [Consumer Price Index] figure will help to shift interest rate expectations higher once again following a couple of softer activity numbers,” said James Knightley, global economist at ING Financial Markets.“The pick-up in core CPI follows an acceleration in the core PCE deflator [the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation], which has risen from 0.9 per cent on a three-monthly annualised basis in September to 1.8 per cent currently,” he noted.“Core inflation is likely to push higher in the next few months, which suggests that there may need to be a longer series of rate hikes than currently expected by the markets.”Tim Drayson at ABN Amro said he believed the Fed was faced with a dilemma. “Hawks will be concerned that oil prices have been passed on to consumers, while doves will point to the damping effect on growth,” he said.ABN’s central view is that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates by 25 basis points per meeting, “but a faster pace is possible”.However, Diane Swonk, chief economist at US brokerage Mesirow Financial, said a closer look suggested that the numbers were not as bad as they might have seemed at first.“Hotel and apparel prices contributed to the increase, and these aren’t going to stick,” she said. “It just doesn’t have the feel of a self-feeding increase.”The dollar rallied initially after the CPI’s release as the possibility of widening interest rate differentials between the US and Europe and Japan returned to the fore.But the gains proved fleeting, and the US currency soon returned to its pre-data levels against the euro and the yen.Similarly, the bond market was initially spooked by the CPI numbers. But the yield on 10-year paper quickly eased back to 4.26 per cent from the 4.3 per cent seen immediately after the data’s release.Sterling also staged a turnround. It eased back initially after the minutes of the Bank of England’s last policy meeting helped to quieten expectations of another UK interest rate rise. But the pound subsequently rallied and briefly pushed above $1.92.Oil futures saw declines after US government inventory data showed an unexpected drop in crude and gasoline stocks last week.
531;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2005-04-20T20:28:07Z;Inflation fears dominate on Wall Street;;Inflation fears got the better of investors on Wall Street on Wednesday after a report on rising consumer prices sent shares lower in spite of a steady stream of positive earnings surprises from Intel, Caterpillar and a handful of other heavyweights.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 hit new lows for the year. Blue chips and technology stocks carved out early gains, but by mid-afternoon the mood had soured, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.1 per at 10,012.36 by the closing bell. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,137.50 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 1,913.76.The slide came on the heels of official data showing a 0.6 per cent jump in the consumer price index in March. The increase was more than analysts had expected, but some said that higher core prices – due mostly to higher hotel rates and clothing costs – were unlikely to stick.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co, said the negative reaction to the CPI numbers was unfounded. “You’ve got multibillion-dollar companies reporting good news and good guidance,” he said. “Concerns about the CPI data are at best overdone.”Mike Malone, trading analyst at SG Cowen, said technical selling was driving declines on the S&P, with prices meeting upward resistance after they sank past critical support levels last week.Technology stocks led gainers throughout much of the day after Intel, the world’s biggest maker of computer chips, reported first-quarter profits up 25 per cent on strong global demand. But Intel’s shares finished up just 0.1 per cent to $22.66 after an afternoon sell-off.Yahoo, the internet search engine company, rose 4.3 per cent to $34.65 after its quarterly earnings beat expectations. Google, which reports today, rose 3.5 per cent to $198.10.Ford Motor, the second-biggest US automaker, rose 0.7 per cent to $9.34 in spite of a sharp drop in quarterly profits. The company’s shares fell sharply after it issued a profit warning earlier this month. General Motors, which reported a $1.1bn quarterly loss on Tuesday, fell 1 per cent to $25.82.Caterpillar, the maker of construction equipment, led Dow gainers after it reported higher profits and raised its full-year guidance. Its shares rose 3.6 per cent to $80.04.America West dropped 6.4 per cent to $4.50 on reports that the airline was in talks to acquire US Airways, the bankrupt east-coast carrier, in a deal to create the country’s fourth-biggest airline. The fall came as America West reported a swing into profit in the first quarter.Financial stocks were mostly lower. JPMorgan Chase fell 0.5 per cent in spite of better-than-expected earnings. Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $50.19 after eight traders defected to Deutsche Bank.
532;CAT;Caterpillar Inc;2020-04-24T17:59:57+0000;Why global groups like to keep it local;;"Steve Ellis is purchasing manager at Perkins Engines, one of the world's biggest makers of diesel engines and part of Caterpillar, the US giant that is itself the world's largest producer of construction machinery.This year, Mr Ellis is expecting to authorise the spending of £250m ($473m)on parts supplied by UK manufacturers. Most of these are assembled in Perkins' large factory in Peterborough in the UK.This spending - just under half of Perkins' total outlay on components for its engines - has not changed significantly in the past few years, even though UK suppliers have faced mounting competition from manufacturers based in low-cost countries.""Having local companies producing parts for us means that they can be much more responsive to our needs than if they are long distances away - such as in China,"" says Mr Ellis. ""While there are many opportunities [for a UK-based company] from increasing parts-purchasing from China, there are also risks. These concern not just quality and logistics, but also the fact that a business in the UK may feel it has less control over intellectual property [governing such areas as design and materials engineering] if it outsources its parts-production to China rather than the UK.""Richard Soper, the managing director of a factory in Worcester that makes central-heating boilers, buys about £60m of parts a year. Of these, about 60 per cent are manufactured by UK-based companies.The factory is run by Bosch, the German industrial group, and Mr Soper says that, as part of a large multinational company, he has investigated ways to reduce the costs of its components by using factories in countries where the labour costs are low. But still, he comes back to the higher-cost UK-based suppliers.""We feel we can establish an audit trail [tracking how parts are made] much more easily if the components are produced in Britain,"" he says.It is a similar story at Leicester-based Guidance Control Systems, which is one of the two largest businesses in the world in the specialised industry of laser-based sensors. The sensors allow unmanned vehicles to find their way around warehouses and factories. With just 30 workers, Guidance Control Systems has sales of truck sensors worth about £1m a year - one-seventh of the global market.As a core part of its philosophy, Guidance Control Systems outsources all the essential machining of the parts for its sensors, which can sell for up to £2,800 each. But rather than give this job to a company in China or eastern Europe, it has given almost all the work to a tiny business just a short drive away from Leicester.David Burnett, director of Rand, which is based in Atherstone near Coventry, has just two employees. He says the relationship with Guidance Control Systems has evolved over several years and relies on his company providing small aluminium parts for the larger company on a highly flexible basis.""We use high-precision machinery to make the parts and can alter our production runs extremely quickly to fit in with what the company wants,"" says Mr Burnett.Last year Rand sold equipment worth £185,000 - mostly to Guidance Control Systems.Keith Phillips, business development manager at Guidance Control Systems, says that it suits his company to outsource to a local company rather than to another business that might have lower wage costs but is hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away.""Keeping in touch over such aspects as design changes is a lot easier with a local business,"" says Mr Phillips."
