0;DOV;Dover Corp;2013-03-21T20:50:38Z;Wall Street lower on eurozone fears;;"US equities resumed declines on Thursday after the S&P 500 traded near a record high in the previous session, with sentiment hit by weak earnings and guidance from Oracle and as attention focused on uncertainty in the eurozone.The broad measure of US stocks closed 0.8 per cent lower to 1,545.80 with all main industry sectors in the red, led by technology and materials.The pullback came after the S&P 500 settled within seven points of its 2007 record closing high of 1,565.15 on Wednesday, with investors buoyed by the US Federal Reserve affirming aggressive monetary easing until unemployment is significantly lower. Weekly jobless claims data on Thursday suggested March payrolls would expand by more than 200,000.“These data suggest improvement in underlying labour market conditions and corroborate the stronger payroll gains seen recently, plus 205,000 on average over the past four months,” economists at RBS Securities said.But investors also watched events in Cyprus, after the European Central Bank said emergency funding for the country’s banks would be suspended on Monday if no agreement was reached on a bailout plan. European shares headed lower, weighing on US equities.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session down 0.6 per cent at 14,421.34, while the Nasdaq Composite led the benchmarks with a loss of nearly 1 per cent to 3,222.60 as technology shares took a hit.After markets closed, shares in Nike jumped 8 per cent to $57.92 in extended trading after reporting earnings per shares that were slightly higher than analysts’ estimates. The company said fiscal 2013 third-quarter saw revenues from continuing operations rise 9 per cent to $6.2bn, or 10 per cent excluding currency changes.Earlier in the session, Oracle fell 9.7 per cent to $32.31, after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts. The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.“We are always sceptical of Oracle having execution issues as we consider execution a core competency, with rigorous sales processes and multiple levels of deal inspection,” analysts at Macquarie said. “This time we believe it is more plausible given the many changes brought about by co-
president Mark Hurd.”Jabil Circuit reported a 9 per cent slide in fiscal second-quarter earnings, on the back of higher costs associated with its purchase of Nypro in February. Shares in the electronics maker, whose biggest customer is Apple, slid 4.5 per cent to $18.60 as it also downgraded its third-quarter outlook. Shares in Apple see-sawed throughout the session but closed 0.2 per cent higher to $452.90.Guidance from Guess saw its shares slide 7.1 per cent to $25.03.

But they later pared gains to end the session 1.3 per cent lower at $72.39.Oppenheimer raised Yahoo to “outperform” and the stock rose 3.5 per cent to $22.87.Other stocks on the move included Newmont Mining, the gold miner, which gained up 2.8 per cent to $41.51, while Red Hat fell 0.4 per cent to $50.99."

In the 2008 election, in which Barack Obama defeated John McCain, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent on the eve of the election.As stocks see-sawed, traders weighed different outcomes from the presidential and congressional elections on “fiscal cliff” negotiations which, if unresolved, would have significant economic consequences.“The markets are in a cautious and indecisive mode,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Investors will not want to make any asset allocation decisions until after the elections. They will wait to see the composition of the Congress and what is the future of the monetary policy,” she added.Randy Frederick, managing director of Active Trading & Derivatives at Charles Schwab, agreed that markets would trade sideways amid light volume until the results of the presidential and congressional elections are known.“Markets are more concerned about uncertainty than anything else. But once we have the results and regardless of who wins, we believe markets will rise in the last two months of the year,” Mr Frederick said.On Monday the ISM services index in October came in at 54.2 – indicating growth, albeit slightly slower than in September.The CBOE Vix index of implied volatility rose 3.8 per cent to 18.2, highlighting nervousness among traders.

2;DOV;Dover Corp;2011-09-19T21:02:23Z;SEC seeks offshore cash disclosure;;The US securities regulator is pushing more companies to disclose how much cash they hold offshore, as attention focuses on the impact of tax rules that encourage US companies to keep earnings overseas.The Securities and Exchanges Commission has asked companies, including Dow Chemical, Fortune Brands, Caterpillar and CIT to increase the information they provide to investors about overseas earnings and cash.Currently there is no firm rule about whether companies must disclose details of how much they hold overseas. However, the SEC typically raises questions through its public comment letters when it believes further information may be relevant and material to understanding a company’s liquidity. The letters are part of routine disclosure reviews of companies’ filings and are separate from the regulator’s enforcement activities.People familiar with the matter said the SEC had decided to focus on the issue of overseas cash more broadly after new disclosures at Microsoft and Google earlier this year prompted interest in the issue.The regulator’s move comes amid concerns that tax issues may be distorting business decisions, potentially leading companies to favour overseas investment over opportunities at home. President Barack Obama on Monday outlined a series of tax reforms as part of the US deficit reduction programme.US rules require companies to pay tax of up to 35 per cent on income generated overseas and brought home. The current administration has so far resisted lobbying by businesses for a repatriation tax break, similar to the tax holiday granted in 2004, saying it would only consider the idea in the context of broader tax reform.The increased disclosure highlights how companies across a wide range of sectors are sitting on large piles of so-called “trapped cash”.Attention has previously focused on technology and healthcare companies, which house intellectual property in low-tax jurisdictions and often have 80 per cent or more of their cash overseas.Analysts at JPMorgan noted that companies such as Avon Products, the maker of beauty products, and Dover, the manufacturing and engineering company, hold “substantially all” of their cash outside of the US.In a sample of 258 companies, the bank estimated that more than 50 per cent of cash balances were held abroad. JPMorgan said the industrials, materials, consumer and energy sectors all exhibited above-average levels of overseas cash. As recently as a year ago, barely a couple of dozen companies provided disclosure on this issue.Bankers say that US companies are also increasingly seeking ways to put overseas cash to work in a tax-efficient manner, including through mergers and acquisitions.Hewlett-Packard, which says “substantially all” of its cash is overseas, plans to use offshore funds in its $11bn purchase of Autonomy, the UK software company. Microsoft earlier this year said it would use offshore cash to buy Skype for $8.5bn.

Late on Friday, Anadarko’s debt rating was cut to “junk” status by Moody’s.Time Warner, owner of cable networks including CNN, was down 1.3 per cent to $32.54 after reports that it was buying London-listed Shed Media, a UK television producer responsible for shows such as Super-nanny, in a transaction expected to be worth about £75m ($111m).

The deal will add at least 50 cents per share to Ralcorp’s full-year earnings, the company said.Synaptics, a leading provider of touchpad technology, rallied 4.4 per cent to $29.27 as the stock was upgraded to “buy” at Collins Stewart, with a target share price of $36.The broker cited a meaningful recovery in touchscreen smartphone market share as the trigger for the move.US-listed shares in BASF, the world’s largest chemicals maker, added 0.2 per cent to $57.15 on reports that it is close to announcing a deal to purchase Cognis, a maker of chemicals used in cosmetics, for about $3.9bn.
