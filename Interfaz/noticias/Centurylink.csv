The deal made it one of the largest enterprise telephony providers in the US and transformed it into a global internet player as it took over Level 3’s international network. Its shares have more than halved since.In February, it said that revenue for the year fell to $23.4bn from $24.1bn while it recorded a net loss of $1.7bn compared with a $1.5bn net profit in the year before. It reduced its net debt to $35.4bn from $37.1bn.
1;CTL;Centurylink;2017-11-28T05:00:46Z;Private equity funds find strength in numbers;Club deals are back in fashion but not all investors are happy;Private equity groups are again teaming up to buy high-priced businesses in so-called club deals as global investors seek to share the mounting costs as well as the risk of acquiring assets at an uncertain part of the economic cycle in some regions.But while the strategy may make sense for investment managers, clients among the large institutions are becoming concerned. These private equity partnerships can increase exposure to a single deal through different managers, they say, and leave the private equity firms less able to influence the business directly if something goes wrong.“[We make] majority control private equity investments in North America and Europe,” says Mark Redman, global head of private equity at the Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System (OMERS).“Why specifically majority control? As an investor you need to retain the ability to make meaningful changes effectively, efficiently and quickly. If you invest as part of a club deal it can be significantly harder to do that.”Club deals were popular during the frenetic years that preceded the financial crisis but fell out of favour when investors — stung by losses incurred in the crash — pushed back to minimise the risk when they were invested in more than one fund. Falling prices helped make one-fund deals more manageable.People are happier working together. You can diversify the deals you do and can do bigger dealsBut some advantages have always been clear for the industry, and in particular at a point in time whe n prices are again at a level equalling the previous boom. Multiples paid for assets are on average as high as those in the lead up to the financial crisis, according to Preqin, the data provider.This has led to a resurgence in recent years of deals involving two or more private equity groups. According to Preqin, deals made by two or more private equity firms grew from 247 in 2015 to 270 last year and there have been 160 so far this year.“Some of the deals are much bigger now and the equity cheques to do this can’t be too concentrated on one single transaction,” says Marco Compagnoni, a senior partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges.“People are happier working together,” adds Mr Compagnoni. “You can diversify the deals you do and can do bigger deals.”Executives point to the success of recent auctions, including the sale of Stada, the German maker of generic Viagra, which was acquired by Cinven and Bain Capital, two buyout funds.After a difficult takeover process, the consortium completed their €4.1bn takeover over the summer, with the deal becoming Europe’s largest buyout in four years.Earlier this year, Advent International and Bain Capital signed a deal to buy Concardis, a German payment processing firm, valuing the company at €700m.Some auctions draw multi-fund consortiums, vying with each other in broad groups. GTCR, Charlesbank Capital Partners, Berkshire Partners and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners teamed up to bid on a data business unit of CenturyLink, which was eventually sold to a group led by Medica Capital and BC Partners for about $2.8bn.As private equity groups grow comfortable with club deals again, some are even predicting further bids from three or more groups in the next year. Any loosening of antitrust rules in the US — notwithstanding the specific difficulties experienced by AT&T and Time Warner— could lead to another round of mega deals.“You had three or four groups partnering in the crisis,” said a London-based banker who has worked on multiple auctions advising private equity firms. “I can see this going forward because of all the capital that has been raised and the need to deploy it.”Executives at buyout funds say that their chances in forthcoming high-profile, high price auctions could be improved, even as they seek to spread their bets.Sanofi, the French drugmaker, is seeking to sell its European generic drug business for about €3bn, drawing interest from a consortium formed by Cinven and Bain Capital. A decision on the buyer is expected in the next few months.Akzo Nobel’s specialty chemicals unit is also for sale, with a price expected at about €9bn. Given its size, buyout funds KKR and CVC have teamed up to bid for the asset, people familiar with the move said. The company said it hoped to sell the unit by April next year.Rival consortiums have formed to bid for Unilever’s spreads business.Consortium building is not always easy, however. Private equity owners need to show a united front from the onset or they risk losing out on deals. “If you look like a strange group of people that got together and cracks start to appear, a seller may decide the bidder is flaky”, says Mr Compagnoni.Club deals have also, in the past, drawn regulatory scrutiny, with accusations that groups have teamed up to bring down asset prices. In 2006, the US Department of Justice, concerned with bid rigging, launched an investigation of private equity firms in relation to their participation in consortiums. Carlyle, Blackstone, TPG collectively paid more than $300m to settled claims without admitting these were true.Of greater immediate concern is that some club deals have recently gone sour, including the recent collapse of Toys R US, a 69-year old toy retailer owned by a consortium that included KKR and Bain Capital.When filing for bankruptcy, the company attributed its demise partly to “expensive debt service” and “unrelenting competition” from online and brick-and-mortar retailers.You have to choose your partners very well. Otherwise you can risk falling out in the future when it comes to strategic questionsThe collapse led to both private equity groups and Vornado Realty Trust to lose out on the $1.3bn of equity they sank into the retailer. However, the losses were offset by the more than $360m in fees.The investors had disagreed over the timing to sell of the toy seller, according to one person familiar with the situation. KKR and Bain Capital declined to comment.In light of these risks, large institutional investors are speaking out against club deals, worried that co-owner structures make it less easy to influence a business strategy or the investment exit timetable.Private equity firms need to chose partners wisely and make sure there is alignment both when they buy and sell, say advisers.“You have to choose your partners very well. Otherwise you can risk falling out in the future when it comes to strategic questions and growth plans,” says a veteran adviser to buyout funds.“Groups can disagree on when to sell a business because of the different times at which they raise money from investors, for example. Interests need to be aligned.”

But suddenly it has become a moment for junk bond whisperers. Key US high-yield bond indices have fallen the most this month since January 2016, accompanied by sharp outflows from US mutual and exchange traded funds. There is no macroeconomic shock. But weak earnings or other company-specific hiccups, particularly in the telecoms sector, have forced fixed income investors to reckon with the massive rally in high yield debt. And it is a warning about complacency in equity markets.Conceptually, stockholders stomach the first loss at struggling companies. Still, credit investors tend to note the subtle shifts in the prospects of a business. In recent weeks, sentiment has soured on the heavily-indebted telco sector, particularly at Sprint, CenturyLink, and Frontier Communications. These companies have heavy capital spending burdens funded by a junk bond binge.Since late October, the Bank of America high-yield index spread has widened by nearly 50 basis points, signalling the increased risk premium bond investors demand. It is a sharp rise. But this measure has only risen to 384 basis points, only slightly above the average spread for 2017. During the high-yield panic in early 2016 that spread jumped to nearly 900 basis points.By any reasonable measure, junk bonds remain pricey. Companies that least deserve the benefit of the doubt in the long-running risk asset rally are now being reappraised. Even among those companies, the risk of impending default is mild. Moody’s expects that the default rate, currently at a modest 3.3 per cent, will fall another percentage point over the next year.It may seem, therefore, that the mild correction in junk bond prices is a trivial event. But US equities have rallied in recent days, creating an odd divergence in two asset classes that should be positively correlated. When junk bond investors pay more attention to company-specific factors, expect equity investors to follow suit.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Is the junk bond correction just the beginning?

4;CTL;Centurylink;2016-10-31T18:21:06Z;Level 3 brings the global internet to CenturyLink;Planned $34bn deal brings 23,000-mile network of cables crucial for web services;During the first dotcom boom, CenturyLink was a barely considered long-distance telephone company serving about 2m customers in the deep south of America.A little more than a decade later, the company stands to be transformed through the $34bn acquisition of Level 3 — a former darling of that tech boom and now one of the largest global internet providers critical to data-intensive businesses such as Netflix and Google.CenturyLink has grown rapidly in recent years to become the third-largest fixed-line telecoms player in the US behind AT&T and Verizon, as well as a major competitor in the market selling telecoms services to companies.But the acquisition of Level 3, announced on Monday, will give the group global significance for the first time, propelling it above Verizon in the US enterprise market and greatly expanding its internet services business as data use rapidly increases.Glen Post, chief executive of CenturyLink, who will remain in charge after the deal, says: “Customers are global today. They are no longer local or regional. We need to meet their needs whatever market they are in and with whatever products and services they need.”CenturyLink, valued at about $16bn and with $19bn of debt, is smaller than Level 3, which has a $20bn market capitalisation and about $10bn in debt.CenturyLink will fund the deal through about $24bn in shares and cash, as well as take on Level 3’s existing debt. The deal is worth about $66.50 per share, and represents a premium of 42 per cent to Level 3’s closing price on Wednesday ahead of reports of the deal.CenturyLink’s shares dropped more than 10 per cent to $26.6 on Monday as analysts worried about the use of a large proportion of stock to acquire Level 3. Shares in Level 3 rose about 5 per cent to $56.5.Mr Post said he expected to reduce the company’s debt-to-earnings ratio from 3.8 times to 3 times within four years using nearly $1bn of annual cost savings that had been identified. “On virtually every level, this deal makes a lot of sense,” he said.The combined CenturyLink-Level 3 will derive three-quarters of its revenue from business customers. Mr Post said it could spin out its consumer broadband and telephony operations although it had no plan to do so yet.It is the second blockbuster telecoms deal in as many weeks following AT&T’s $85bn swoop on Time Warner. Both acquisitions are rooted in a similar vision of the future of the internet-based global economy: namely that telecoms and media are converging and that the “pipes” needed to carry all the world’s information will become ever more important to carry these services. CenturyLink and Level 3’s merger lies in the latter part of that formula.Such success for Level 3’s strategy was at one stage looking unlikely. Level 3 had spent billions of dollars building a 23,000-mile network of fibre optic cables across North America and Europe in the 1990s, which transformed it first into a tech boom darling but then into one of the more prominent victims of the crash.The bursting of the tech bubble sent its stock into freefall, dropping from $130 to $3 within two years as the expected demand for internet services failed to materialise. It narrowly avoided bankruptcy, as others including Global Crossing and MCI WorldCom imploded, and positioned itself to deliver on its original promise to provide the pipes for burgeoning data demand.By 2016, those pipes are critical to the world’s largest internet businesses such as Google, which routes huge amounts of traffic over Level 3 fibre.The depth of Level 3’s global network became apparent in the summer of 2015 when a problem with routing traffic in Malaysia had a knock-on effect in Europe, Africa and the US where internet speeds started to slow.However, there are more prosaic reasons for the deal given worries about a lack of growth at CenturyLink. Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst with Wells Fargo, noted that third-quarter results issued by CenturyLink alongside the details of the Level 3 takeover were “underwhelming”, and showed the need for the company to bulk up in fibre. The deal also provides access to up to $10bn in tax credits.“We think this is a very positive transaction as it solves its lack of growth and need for more fibre issue as well as helps them with its looming tax issue,” she said, noting that other fibre network providers such as Zayo could now come into focus in a consolidating market.Mr Post, a duck hunting chief executive who joined CenturyLink in 1976, has engineered the takeover of larger telecoms companies by using stock and debt. Key to its rapid transformation was the 2008 acquisition of Embarq, Sprint’s former landline business, for $5.8bn to create one of the largest regional players in the US.Two years later, CenturyLink completed the $22.4bn takeover of Qwest, making it the third-largest telecoms group in the US, and followed up with the $2.5bn takeover of datacentre business Savvis in 2011.Given this record, analysts are already asking if CenturyLink’s ambitions are over. Mr Post said the company would focus on integrating Level 3 in the coming years but admitted there would be opportunities for further expansion “especially internationally” on the horizon.
5;CTL;Centurylink;2016-10-31T17:45:25Z;CenturyLink/Level 3: Pipe-fitting;Telecoms are dull, until the dealmakers show up;With its miles of wires and lines of computer code, telecoms is basically a technical sector — even if management of these plumbing businesses gets boring.After the razzmatazz of AT&T storming Manhattan and Hollywood to buy Time Warner, a more humdrum variety of dealmaking returned on Monday. CenturyLink announced a takeover of Level 3 Communications, paying $34bn including debt.Normally, a reversion to a boring industry deal should be reassuring to telco investors. CenturyLink shareholders have not heard the message. Its shares shed a tenth on the news it would be taking on Level 3, a heavy debt for a company of questionable fit.CenturyLink’s core business is supplying telephone and broadband to business customers — its two biggest competitors are Verizon and AT&T. Cable operators such as Comcast and Charter are also lurking. It reached its current size by consolidating smaller telcos.Level 3 is best known as a “backbone”, providing the lines down which internet traffic passes. However, it has been pushing towards selling more phone and internet services after having, oddly enough, bought Time Warner Telecom for $6bn in 2014.Besides these operations — which, overall, operate in a flat to declining market — Level 3’s key asset is $10bn of operating losses that can be used to offset future taxes. The rules on acquirers appropriating these are strict, but CenturyLink will still be able to utilise them.Nominally, Level 3 shareholders are being paid a 49 per cent premium. But 60 per cent of the consideration is in stock. And unlike the AT&T/Time Warner deal, there is no protection from a “collar” on those shares.As such, Level 3 shareholders are also feeling the slide in CenturyLink shares. Even with a promised $1bn in annual cost savings (by 2019), the leverage of the new company is approaching four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Telecoms may be a staid business. But dealmakers can always spice things up.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
6;CTL;Centurylink;2016-10-31T13:47:19Z;October dealmaking volumes hit $500bn after GE acquisition ;Three takeovers join surge of blockbuster M&A despite US political uncertainty;"General Electric led a trio of companies penning big takeovers on Monday to lift the total value of transactions attempted in October to above $500bn, in what has unexpectedly become one of the busiest months for global dealmaking on record.The surge in blockbuster mergers and acquisitions in recent weeks signalled renewed corporate confidence in the outlook for the US economy, dealmakers said, even as the country’s highly-charged presidential race concludes in about a week.Operating conditions at many corporations have not changed drastically in recent years: companies are still struggling to increase sales, and historically low borrowing rates have made acquisitions an attractive way to boost revenue growth.That combination has provided the impetus for a multiyear boom in dealmaking led by industries where companies are seeking greater consolidation to gain scale over competitors and leverage over customers.“I’ve never tried to think about politics in terms of when I time deals,” GE chief executive Jeff Immelt said of his $25bn deal to acquire oil and gas services provider Baker Hughes. “The time do these things are right now . . . when there is a level of uncertainty, not whenever things are known.”The new company formed by combining GE’s oil and gas equipment manufacturing business with Baker Hughes will create a powerful competitor to oil services giant Schlumberger, with $32bn in annual revenues and operations in 120 countries.————————-October’s megadeals1.

5. Oct 31 CenturyLink to buy Level 3 in $34bn tie-up————————October has been one of the busiest for global deal making on record, with the total value of deals topping $500bn. Matthew Vincent asks Arash Massoudi, FT M&A correspondent, what’s behind the trend and whether it’s likely to continueElsewhere, US telecoms group CenturyLink said it would buy the larger Level 3, which provides infrastructure that allows business to connect to the internet safely, for $34bn including debt. Private equity group Blackstone also said it would acquire TeamHealth, a US provider of physician services, for $6.1bn including debt.The transactions capped the seventh most-active month for global M&A with $502.8bn worth of deals, according to data from Dealogic. Attempts for US-based companies accounted for $329.1bn of that amount, just shy of a monthly record set in July of 2015.The remarkable comeback of M&A activity in October comes after a sluggish 2016 for dealmakers. Until recently, chief executives have been reluctant to make big bets in the US because of the turmoil associated with the presidential race and an Obama administration that has acted to block several megadeals.Some argue that October’s burst of activity was partly thanks to the growing poll lead of Hillary Clinton, Democratic presidential nominee, over Republican rival Donald Trump. However, the FBI’s decision to release new details about its investigation into Mrs Clinton’s use of a private email server could choke off the trend, as the presidential race has tightened again.Scott Barshay, a senior dealmaker at law firm Paul Weiss, said the recent spree, which includes AT&T’s agreement to buy Time Warner for about $108bn including debt, featured deals that had strong long-term rationales as well as few regulatory hurdles.“They were not just synergy or financial plays, rather they were highly strategic, landscape-changing business combinations in their respective industries,” Mr Barshay said. “While the transactions are large in size, we don’t expect any of them to have great difficulty in obtaining regulatory approvals around the world.”CenturyLink/Level 3: pipe-fitting

Shareholders in GE will own the remaining 62.5 per cent of the “new” Baker Hughes. CenturyLink said it would pay $26.50 per share in cash and 1.4286 for each Level 3 share to control 51 per cent of the new entity. The deal implies a valuation of $66.50 a share for Level 3, valuing the company’s shares at about $25bn.Blackstone is paying $43.50 a share, or $3.2bn of equity value, to acquire TeamHealth.———Further reading● Analysis: Level 3 brings global internet to CenturyLink● Analysis: GE to combine oil and gas unit with Baker Hughes"

They traded at about $47 before reports over the deal began to surface earlier this month. CenturyLink was little changed in early trading, but has risen 10.8 per cent this month.The merger comes shortly after AT&T, one of the biggest US telecoms, announced plans to acquire Time Warner, in a deal that will give it access to media brands like HBO and CNN.CenturyLink said on Monday it plans to close the deal by the third quarter of 2017.
8;CTL;Centurylink;2012-06-19T21:34:56Z;Savvis to double data centre capacity;;Savvis, the US data centre operator, is to double its global capacity as its struggles to meet soaring demand from banks and investors wanting to outsource more trading infrastructure.The group, owned by New York Stock Exchange-listed CenturyLink, will open new sites in London and Singapore and add further capacity at five other sites in London and the US in coming months.Savvis’s rapid expansion illustrates how becalmed equity markets, fierce competition from new entrants and lowered bank profitability are leading many trading firms and brokers to outsource more of their trading infrastructure.Data centres, often unremarkable buildings from the outside, have become key battlegrounds for the industry as it seeks to create digital trading hubs. By transmitting and receiving thousands of messages and quotes in one location, they seek to replicate the physical trading floor, although trades are conducted in microseconds.The industry has divided between exchanges such as CME Group, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, and NYSE Euronext which own their own data centres and those which outsource to companies like Savvis and Equinix. Those which own their own sites can charge rent, opening up a lucrative market servicing investors who want to place their equipment next to exchange servers.The new Savvis sites at London Docklands and Singapore will open on June 30 and August 1 respectively. Bill Fathers, president of Savvis, said, “We’re still not expanding at the rate of market growth.” Financial services accounts for around 20-25 per cent of the group’s total revenues.Savvis’s expansion also illustrates that the trends in trading and technology which have swept through equity markets in recent years are beginning to seep into other asset classes. Executing deals are frequently conducted in fractions of seconds, often by algorithms. Banks also face pressure on IT costs amid lower profitability and tougher liquidity requirements.Neil Cresswell, managing director of Savvis Europe, Middle East and Africa, said there was increasing demand in Europe. “The demand profile is changing,” he told FT Trading Room. “Trading in different asset classes is coming. FX has taken off in the last year, while there’s interest in rates and fixed income, commodities.”

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;CTL;Centurylink;2011-09-27T23:01:47Z;Virgin Media to launch cloud for businesses;;Virgin Media, the telecoms and media group, is launching its first cloud-based services to business customers as part of a drive to double revenues from its enterprise division in the next five years.Virgin said it would “shake up” the cloud computing market with easy-to-use technology and clear advice. The cloud itself is often a cause for confusion for consumers and companies, although it is in effect a service that can provide IT systems such as storage, software and processing from a remote place over a network.Virgin will offer its business customers cloud computing through a virtual private data centre (VPDC), which can be set up and rolled out within two hours. The technology behind the Virgin launch will be provided by Savvis, a US web hosting and service provider that was has been acquired by CenturyLink, the US telecoms group.Businesses can use the service to develop and launch ecommerce facilities, giving the flexibility to increase virtual servers as customer demand builds. Customers will not be tied to minimum length contracts and will be billed by the hour depending on the power used. Virgin expects customers to use the flexible tariff structure to test and develop applications without having to pay for hardware or give up office space.There are similar cloud services being offered by rivals such as BT and Cable & Wireless. Virgin said this would be a challenge to competitors “that have brought unnecessary confusion to the cloud”.Mark Heraghty, managing director of Virgin Media Business, said: “Organisations are craving some clarity and no-nonsense advice. Providing easy-to-use, simple cloud services that do exactly what they say they’ll do is a breath of fresh air. Most are already signed up to the benefits of the cloud, but constant jargon and complicated advice have created a real barrier to entry.”Mr Heraghty said that business growth had only recently become a focus for Virgin, although it has a significant customer base in local authority and the media industries. “In order to profitably grow, we want to provide managed services. The launch of our first proper cloud service is the next step in the evolution of the business.”David Molony, analyst at Ovum, said that its research had highlighted demand for cloud services among business users. A poll conducted by Ovum this year showed that about 45 per cent of businesses had used cloud services at some point.He said: “It is a significant strategic move for Virgin. While it is the company’s first cloud service for the UK, Virgin has chosen to launch it with a large global partner. It is a challenge for BT and Cable & Wireless in the business space.”
11;CTL;Centurylink;2011-05-04T02:50:17Z;Battlelines in cloud services market;;When CenturyLink announced an agreed $2.5bn cash and stock bid for Savvis last week it signalled an accelerating push by US telecommunications groups into the rapidly emerging market for ‘cloud-based’ business computing services.These services, which range from delivering software as a service (SaaS) on a pay-as-you-go basis to providing instant access to IT infrastructure and computing power, are likely to become a key element in many corporate IT strategies over the next five years.A new global survey conducted by Axios Systems, a US-based IT Service Management software provider, revealed that 68 per cent of global companies plan to adopt a cloud strategy in the near term.In the Axis survey, 28 per cent of respondents said their organisations have already adopted a cloud strategy in one or more areas. Regarding future plans for cloud-based services, five per cent of respondents have plans to implement cloud services in the next three months and another 16 per have short-term plans to adopt cloud strategies in three-to-six months.“The market shows very clear signs of widespread cloud adoption,” said Axios noting that only 32 per cent of respondents had no current plans to adopt a cloud strategy. Similarly, Gartner, the IT research firm, has predicted that cloud computing will be adopted at an accelerated pace by business users and that, “in less than five years, there will be major shifts and higher adoption ratios.”Overall, Gartner believes the value of cloud computing market could reach almost $150bn worldwide by 2014. This accelerated adoption of cloud computing, in spite of continuing concerns about security and reliability, is one of the main driving forces behind the recent wave of mergers and acquisition activity in the web hosting and cloud computing industry which began with Verizon Communications’ recently completing $1.4bn purchase of Terremark Worldwide.The Verizon-Terremark transaction, first announced in January, focused bankers’ attention on the mergers and acquisition opportunities in cloud services market and the potential for telecommunications groups to add a new revenues offsetting the steady decline in the number of fixed lines they serve.Explaining the Terremark purchase, Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s chief operating officer and designated successor to Ivan Seidenberg when he retires as chief executive later this year, noted: “Every time we see a paradigm shift in computing, we see the number of users go up by a factor of 10. The global presence positions us to be a big player in the next generation of computing, as well. And where everything we do — media, communications, personal data, network intelligence, security protocols and many more — will be stored in the cloud and then delivered around the globe.”Verizon’s Terremark acquisition triggered speculation that AT&T and others would soon follow suit with its own purchase in the cloud computing space. Instead AT&T has focused on growing its internal business services business while announcing plans to acquire Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit for $39bn.Some bankers suggest the T-Mobile USA bid, which now faces regulatory scrutiny, would make it difficult for AT&T to follow Verizon’s lead and make its own cloud computing purchase. “I think they have their hands full at the moment,” one banker said.But such constraints clearly did not apply to either CenturyLink or to Time Warner Cable which paid $230m at the start of February to acquire NaviSite, another provider of enterprise-class hosting, managed application, messaging and cloud services.“NaviSite provides us with a successful managed services business and a new, innovative managed cloud platform representing significant new growth opportunities,” said Glenn Britt, Time Warner Cable’s chief executive. “We expect to build upon NaviSite’s successful enterprise-class offerings, and their operational capabilities, infrastructure and expertise to more rapidly create a robust managed services offering for small and medium sized businesses.”Similarly, CenturyLink proposed purchase of Savvis will enable CenturyLink to deliver managed hosting and cloud capabilities to its business customers on a global basis. Together the two companies will operate 48 data centers across the globe, provide access to extensive national and global telecommunications networks and feature a customer list that includes many of the largest multinational companies.Global reach is expected to be increasingly important in the cloud computing market as multinational customers begin to seek out service providers who can meet their requirements across geographies.“The transaction creates a premier managed hosting and co-location provider with global scale in a high growth sector, and is expected to be accretive to revenue growth and cash flow per share,” said Glen Post, CenturyLink’s chief executive. “Today, businesses are shifting the way they manage their information technology services and infrastructure, and this transaction helps us meet these needs.”James Ousley, Savvis chief executive, added: “As migration to cloud-based services continues to accelerate rapidly, a strategic combination was a natural choice to create significant scale and become part of a large global network for the benefit of our customers, stockholders and employees.” Those Savvis customers currently include nearly 2,500 unique clients and 32 of the top 100 companies in the Fortune 500.From the corporate users’ perspective, the Savvis, Terremark and NavSite deals demonstrate is that the cloud services market is maturing quickly and is likely to be the next battleground between traditional IT services companies such as IBM and Accenture, and relatively new entrants such as Verizon and CenturyLink.
12;CTL;Centurylink;2011-04-27T17:08:50Z;CenturyLink set to buy Savvis in $2.5bn deal;;CenturyLink agreed to acquire Savvis, a leading web hosting and service provider, for $2.5bn in cash and stock in a deal that highlights the accelerating push by US telecommunications groups into the emerging market for ‘cloud-based’ business computing services.The deal also represents a further significant diversification for CenturyLink away from its rural US telecom roots. Earlier this month, CenturyLink became the third-largest US telecommunications group after AT&T and Verizon Communications when it completed the purchase of Qwest Communications.Verizon recently completed its $1.4bn purchase of Terremark Worldwide, another leading cloud computing service provider, in a deal that focused bankers’ attention on the mergers and acquisition opportunities in cloud services market and the potential for telecommunications groups to add a new revenue offsetting the steady decline in the number of fixed lines they serve.CenturyLink reported in February that its fourth-quarter earnings fell 2.2 per cent reflecting lower revenue as the impact of access line losses more than offset gains at its high-speed internet business.In contrast, Savvis reported a much narrower first-quarter loss on Wednesday boosted by revenues which grew by 19 per cent.Once completed, the deal will enable CenturyLink to deliver managed hosting and cloud capabilities to its business customers on a global basis.Together the two companies will operate 48 data centres across the globe, provide access to extensive national and global telecommunications networks and feature a customer list that includes many of the largest multinational companies.“The transaction creates a premier managed hosting and co-location provider with global scale in a high growth sector, and is expected to be accretive to revenue growth and cash flow per share,” said Glen Post, CenturyLink’s chief executive officer.“Today, businesses are shifting the way they manage their information technology services and infrastructure, and this transaction helps us meet these needs.”James Ousley, Savvis chief executive, added: “As migration to cloud-based services continues to accelerate rapidly, a strategic combination was a natural choice to create significant scale and become part of a large global network for the benefit of our customers, stockholders and employees.“We believe that combining our proven capabilities in cloud infrastructure and managed hosting with CenturyLink’s hosting assets and large base of business customers will create powerful opportunities to accelerate growth.“We also look forward to making the full resources of a much larger network infrastructure available to our customers.”Under the terms of the transaction, Savvis stockholders will receive $30 per share in cash and $10 in shares of CenturyLink common stock, subject to certain adjustment. The consideration represents an 11 per cent premium over Savvis’ closing stock price on Friday and a premium of 53 per cent over Savvis’ stock price at the beginning of the year.CenturyLink expects the acquisition, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, to improve its revenue, operating earnings and free cash flow growth and added that it expects to realise approximately $70m in annual operating cost and capital expenditure savings once the deal is completed.The transaction is expected to be accretive to CenturyLink’s free cash flow per share, excluding integration costs, in the first full year following the close.Barclays Capital and Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial advisers and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrère & Denegre acted as legal advisers to CenturyLink.Morgan Stanley acted as financial adviser and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation acted as legal adviser to Savvis.
13;CTL;Centurylink;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;M&A activity set to recover momentum;Morgan Stanley’s Rob Kindler wary but optimistic;US dealmakers can hardly be blamed for having a spring in their step.With the economy improving, equity markets rallying, and corporate America finding debt financing readily available, Rob Kindler, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, is among those looking ahead without the sense of trepidation that pervaded sentiment in the past two years.“There is no better predictor of overall M&A activity than equity markets,” argues Mr Kindler, from Morgan Stanley’s New York offices.“It is pretty straightforward.“If there is volatility, people don’t do deals and in down markets people don’t do deals.”So far, so good – US equities are up almost 8 per cent since the beginning of December, helping the M&A world turn its back on a year in which, in spite of a 23 per cent rise in dealmaking, the recovery in activity lacked momentum.Predicting that activity is set to rise again in 2011, Mr Kindler notes that one aspect of a robust deals market was absent last year. “There were surprisingly few big deals in 2010,” he says. “If those return, then 2011 could prove a bigger year still.”Indeed, the largest deal last year was the US Treasury’s $48bn swap of its bail-out investment in insurer AIG for a large equity stake – triggering a debate among bankers and data providers as to whether it constituted “real” M&A.Regardless, helped by that transaction, Morgan Stanley edged out Goldman Sachs to finish top of the M&A league tables, according to Mergermarket’s data.With only a few billion separating Wall Street’s leading deals shops, the battle begins anew to climb to the top of M&A’s greasy pole.“What we’ve seen in the last three to five years is that M&A is really driven by horizontal integration,” says Mr Kindler. “We’re not creating any more conglomerates.“People are focused on their core businesses.”Instead, he expects more large stock-based deals where companies within an industry get together and cut costs as they assess an ailing outlook for organic growth.Such deals last year included CenturyLink’s $22bn combination with Qwest Communications in April and the tie-up between United Airlines and Continental.“Companies really need M&A as a strategic tool in a low-growth environment,” he says. “But acquisitions are becoming harder, more competitive and therefore arguably more expensive to do.”Among the challenges is an increasingly independent-minded stance by shareholders.“Institutions aren’t just following proxy advisers’ recommendations anymore,” says Mr Kindler, referring to the US businesses which, as well as opining on corporate governance, suggest how shareholders vote in deal situations.“They used to be determinant to the outcome.But institutions have recognised that they really need to make their own investment decisions.”Last year, shareholders went against some recommendations, opting not to back Blackstone’s $4.7bn offer to buy Dynegy or Hertz’s $1.5bn deal with Dollar Thrifty.Meanwhile, 2010 also demonstrated the perils of adopting a hostile tack where friendly entreaties fail.“If you look at a number of the big hostile deals, shareholders have done better because the deal didn’t happen,” says Mr Kindler – another factor that could embolden shareholders to hold out for more.With other hostile deals failed or ailing, such as Alimentation Couche-Tarde of Canada’s aborted attempt to buy convenience-store owner Casey’s, companies could be more cautious than ever in taking an aggressive tack.“For the stars to be aligned for a hostile bid is very unusual,” he says. “I don’t think there will be a big upswing in hostile activity this year.”
14;CTL;Centurylink;2010-06-29T21:34:27Z;Volatility dulls appetite for big M&A activity;;The world’s biggest rainmakers have been waiting a long time to make their move.Senior bankers had hoped to see a ray of sunshine during the second quarter of the year but sentiment turned in May, since when global equities have tumbled more than 10 per cent and credit markets have seized up again.The market uncertainty sent chief executives back into hiding and few have had the courage to revive the deals they had been considering.Jeff Kaplan, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says: “When there’s excessive market volatility, it becomes harder for a buyer and seller to assess value and premium”.And he predicts that the latest bout of volatility will keep the pace of deals measured for now.Mark Shafir, Citigroup’s global head of M&A, says: “There is a dearth of mega-deals”.He says the virtual absence of deals over $10bn has made the past three months among the worst for large scale dealmaking in seven years.CenturyLink’s $22.2bn all-stock tie-up with US telecoms rival Qwest was the only large deal announced in the second quarter, according to Mergermarket.Mr Shafir says: “We have to be realistic.“We were projecting 15 to 20 per cent growth this year and it is hard to see that without some form of catalyst. At the moment, I can’t point to anything.”Bankers were disappointed by the collapse of several large deals in the first half. Even before worries about Europe’s sovereign debt crisis unsettled markets, investors took issue with UK insurer Prudential’s $35.5bn putative bid for AIA, the Asian assets of US government-owned AIG, making clear their doubts about such an ambitious expansion – as well as balking at the rich price tag of the deal.Several are hoping that companies seeking growth outside their home markets will continue to push up the values of cross-border deals, which accounted for 25 per cent of all M&A worldwide.“We would anticipate that corporates within the euro area will increasingly become targets for US and emerging market acquirers. This especially applies to those targets with a global footprint or those whose core operations are concentrated in the stronger euro area economies,” said Wilhelm Schulz, head of European M&A at Citigroup.Ambitions by private equity groups to do large buy-outs were also thwarted in the first half, when Blackstone, THL and TPG, which had teamed up for a $15bn leveraged buy-out of Fidelity National Information Services, fell apart as a result of price disagreements.This was in spite of the consortium’s managing to secure a financing package of about $10bn for the deal from at least six banks, as the economic recovery gathered steam.“In private equity, the size of the deal matters,” Mr Kaplan points out. “For the return of the $10bn-plus mega-deal, the depth of the market is an issue – which banks are going to step up with what amounts in an environment where syndication is uncertain.”But with buy-out groups sitting on about $490bn of unspent capital, bankers expect the pace of smaller deals to continue during the second half of the year as they deploy the cash in order to raise new funds.This in part explains the increase in secondary buy-outs during the first half, as private equity groups sold investments to each other in order to realise their investments. Exits via trade sales and secondary buyouts rose 216 per cent from the same period last year.“My sense is that the second half will surprise folks and be stronger. It is only a matter time before bigger LBOs, between $8bn and $10bn, get done”, says Boon Sim, global head of M&A at Credit Suisse.Valuations placed on businesses by private equity rose. The average multiple of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation paid by private equity groups was 10.8 times in the first half of the year, compared with 14.2 times for global deals overall. That was up from 9.3 in 2009, but well below the 2007 peak of 14.1 times.The dearth of activity has done little to boost revenues of investment banks. According to estimates from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting, global investment banking advisory fees for the second quarter of the year totalled US$16.5bn.While deal volumes are only modestly up, M&A and equity capital markets fees represented 39 per cent and 27 per cent respectively of the investment banking fee pool in the second quarter.This is the highest market share that M&A has held since Q4 2008 and is the first time in three quarters that M&A has generated the highest percentage of investment banking fees.
15;CTL;Centurylink;2010-04-23T00:55:49Z;CenturyLink and Qwest unveil merger;;CenturyLink and Qwest on Thursday revitalised consolidation in the telecoms sector by agreeing to merge their businesses in an all-stock deal which values Qwest at $22.4bn, including debt.The deal will create the third-largest fixed-line carrier in the US after AT&T and Verizon – the two integrated telecoms companies focusing on their wireless services for growth.Combining CenturyLink and Qwest’s local and regional telecoms businesses is expected to result in synergies of about $625m a year, after three to five years.The deal further blurs the line between the regional telephone companies spun out of AT&T – the so-called Baby Bells – and the network of rurally focused carriers in the US.It will move CenturyLink into the data-driven, long-distance market and increase its presence in providing business telecoms services. About a quarter of the combined revenues will now come from these segments, whereas they make up just about 11 per cent of CenturyLink’s revenues at present.Long-distance and business-related services are growing quickly, even as fixed-line operations come under pressure as customers migrate to mobile phones. Telecoms companies have been pushing into areas such as broadband and internet telephony to compensate for their ailing fixed-line businesses.“We’re going to continue to see customers migrate to wireless,” Glen Post, CenturyLink’s chief executive, said. “The future of our company is really in data. The wireless services in our areas rely on the wireline backbone and we’re expanding our reach.”Industry bankers suggested they expected to see more consolidation among the US’s rural carriers. They also argued the convergence of telecoms, internet and television services could present further opportunities for deal making.CenturyLink is already offering video services to its local customers and the combined company might also seek to boost its wireless offering. Qwest has a partnership agreement with Verizon Wireless.Qwest investors will receive 0.1664 CenturyLink shares for each share they own, valuing the company’s equity at $10.6bn, or $6.02 a share, based on Wednesday’s closing price.That reflects a 15 per cent premium to Qwest’s closing price.CenturyLink, in the process of changing its name from CenturyTel after the $5.8bn acquisition of rural carrier Embarq, will also assume $11.8bn in Qwest net debt as part of the deal.CenturyLink shares fell 3.29 per cent to $35.01 in New York on Thursday, while Qwest’s stock price jumped 2.48 per cent to $5.37.Barclays Capital, Evercore and JPMorgan advised CenturyLink. Lazard, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisers to Qwest. Perella Weinberg advised Qwest’s board.
16;CTL;Centurylink;2009-05-13T21:54:49Z;Verizon’s new Frontier;Shareholders should have few hangups over the deal;"Verizon’s shareholders should have few hang-ups over a deal announced on Wednesday to divest some mature assets. With wireless and broadband being its only growth areas, it will merge a substantial part of its rural wireline customers with Frontier Communications in an $8.6bn all-stock transaction. If the deal passes regulatory muster, Verizon’s owners will get about 68 per cent of the new, greatly enlarged Frontier in a tax-free spin-off in about a year, and can choose whether to hang on to the cash cow or sell it. At 4.5 times enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, the shrinking business is being purchased at only a modest discount to the larger firm.As for Frontier, the deal also looks like a winner. It will triple in size while paying only $1,800 per access line, including debt. Public market valuations are close to $3,000 for comparable companies, though the price is slightly higher than for the purchase of Embarq by CenturyTel in late October when telecommunications stocks were much cheaper. Frontier was considered a likely buy-out target given its middling size and heavy gearing, but the new Frontier will look quite different. It will be the third largest rural carrier after Qwest and Embarq/CenturyTel and will see ebitda to net debt shrink to a manageable 2.6 times from 3.8 times. Synergies touted by management seem realistic while the additional financial breathing room is welcome.Frontier and its rural peers are fighting an uphill battle in stemming revenue declines, but there are ways to shrink profitably. Cutting costs and capital expenditure is a big one, which explains the consolidation wave among similar companies. Verizon’s valuation was not flattered by its association with such a dull business, so the spin-off could easily make the sum of its parts worth more than the whole for shareholders.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

17;CTL;Centurylink;2008-10-27T23:12:12Z;Embarq/CenturyTel;;The sight of Hugh Hefner in his dressing gown, still playing the playboy for viewers of his reality TV show, is proof that a well managed decline can deliver satisfaction for much longer than might be expected. Hence the reason to cheer Monday’s agreed takeover of rural telecom provider Embarq by smaller peer CenturyTel, in an all-stock deal valuing Embarq at $11.6bn.There is still some growth left in the telecoms industry. Verizon reported a big jump in earnings for the third quarter on Monday thanks to a strong performance in its wireless business – the division managed to find 1.5m new customers in the saturated North American market. However, both Embarq and CenturyTel are suffering from continual declines in their core phone line businesses. So while they remain highly profitable – operating margins for both are 27 per cent – competition from cable, wireless operators, and the rise of free internet calling is steadily eating away at subscriber numbers.Getting together should allow the combined group to save about $400m in costs annually, or about 5 per cent of sales. The new group – yet to be named – should also have greater muscle in marketing and lobbying, an important aspect given that government payments account for about 25 per cent of CenturyTel’s turnover. And the future regulatory environment remains uncertain, with the Federal Communications Commission due to rule next week on changes to the subsidy system.That perhaps explains why Embarq investors appear to have got the better deal, in spite of CenturyTel being the only real buyer in town. Embarq’s shareholder’s will get two thirds of the combined entity, with the offer representing a 36 per cent premium based on Friday’s closing prices. CenturyTel’s share of the capitalised value of the synergies, meanwhile, is worth only about half that of the premium it has offered.

18;CTL;Centurylink;2008-10-27T15:29:03Z;CenturyTel to buy Embarq for $5.8bn;;CenturyTel has agreed to buy larger rival local telephone carrier Embarq for $5.8bn in stock, in a deal that marks a significant step toward the long-awaited consolidation of US regional phone service providers.Under the terms of the deal, Embarq shareholders will get 1.37 CenturyTel shares for each Embarq share of common stock they own. This is equivalent to $40.42 of CenturyTel stock for each share of Embarq, or a 36 per cent premium to Embarq’s closing price on Friday, the companies said.The deal assigns Embarq an enterprise value of $11.6bn, including the assumption of $5.8bn of debt.Kansas-based Embarq, which was spun off from Sprint in 2006 following Sprint’s takeover of Nextel, started talking to potential suitors back in August and launched a small auction to sell itself to one of a handful of rivals soon afterward, according to people close to the sale process.That process was scuttled, however, when the financing markets locked up in September and several potential suitors found themselves unable to raise the capital necessary for a takeover. Embarq’s shares sank from more than $48 in early September to less than $30 at the end of last week.But CenturyTel, which last Friday had a market capitalisation of $3bn compared to Embarq’s shrunken equity value of $4.24bn, found it held an advantage as one of the only bidders willing to go forward with an all-stock deal, according to a source close to the process.CenturyTel’s board of directors met to approve the transaction late on Sunday evening, following a handshake deal struck by the parties earlier in the day. On closing, Embarq shareholders will own about 66 per cent of the combined company, which had not yet been given a name.The merger could spur further consolidation by other US local phone carriers, who feel the cost savings that could come from increased size and scope would better help them compete against giants Verizon Communications and AT&T. The delineation between potential buyers and sellers in some cases, however, is still murky.Arkansas-based Windstream has been one of the more aggressive companies in the sector as it relates to searching for acquisitions, for example. Companies including Frontier Communications and Consolidated Communications, on the other hand, have been more frequently viewed as targets, and their shares have been valued more richly by the public markets for that reason, industry sources said.CenturyTel itself could be ready to make further acquisitions within a year or so. Glen Post III, its chief executive officer, told analysts and investors that the company will “be ready quickly to consider other acquisition opportunities.”The credit crunch, which continues to limit potential acquirers’ access to capital across nearly all industries, could stall activity in the telecommunications sector in the near term, however.Lead financial advisers to CenturyTel were Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley, while Embarq was advised by JP Morgan.
19;CTL;Centurylink;2006-09-18T19:31:14Z;Citzens to buy Commonwealth for $1.6bn;;Citizens Communications announced plans to acquire Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises in an agreed cash and stock deal worth $1.6bn that is likely to spur further consolidation in the US rural telecommunications sector.The deal follows a string of mega-mergers over the last 18 months that have reshaped the US fixed and mobile telecommunications industry culminating in AT&T’s pending $67bn acquisition of BellSouth.The US telecommunications giants like AT&T and Verizon are increasingly focusing on their broadband, wireless and their nascent TV operations leaving the traditional landline-phone business to a group of smaller regional operators and spin-offs such as Embarq which was spun off earlier this year by Sprint Nextel.These moves have prompted speculation that rural carriers would be the next targets for consolidation driven in part by technological change and the economies of scale as they focus on delivering investors consistent dividends amid a steady decline in use of local landlines.“The recent spin-offs (Embarq and Windstream), combined with an existing list of bidders, including CenturyTel, Citizens and private equity interest, makes this an opportune time for some of the smaller rural telcos to explore options,” said Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs in a note to investors.He added: ”This is a general positive for the RLEC (rural local exchange carriers) sector and reinforces our view that significant consolidation lies ahead for the rural telecom sector.”Some analysts have speculated that as the big telecomms companies focus of high growth markets like wireless and broadband IP-based services, a raft of big new second tier carriers will emerge.These second tier carriers could focus on providing low cost, highly efficient traditional phone service across the nation using traditional local copper lines sold off by carriers like Verizon which has made no secret of its desire to sell off some of its local operations including lines in upstate New York.Stamford, Connecticut-based Citizens Communications, which provides telephone, internet and cable services in 23 states, said the acquisition will expand its presence in Pennsylvania.“It gives us expansion into rural markets, which is definitely our sweet spot,” Maggie Wilderotter, Citizens’ chief executive said on a conference call with investors.With annual revenue of about $2.4bn, the combined company would be the nation’s 7th largest local telephone exchange, according to Citizens. The combined company will have 2.6m phone customers and 388,000 broadband Internet subscribersUnder terms of the deal, shareholders of Dallas, Pennsylvania.-based Commonwealth Telephone will receive $31.31 in cash and 0.768 shares of Citizens’ common stock.Ms Wilderotter said the company expected to save about $30m by combiningthe two companies and plans to finance the cash portion of the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and debt with a commitment for financing from Citigroup.The offer represents a 17 percent premium to Commonwealth’s closing share price of $35.60 on September 8, the business day prior to the company’s announcement that it had appointed Evercore Partners to help it evaluate strategic opportunities.Shares of Commonwealth rose $2.08, or 5.4 percent to $40.60 in midday trading on the Nasdaq. Shares of Citizens shed 4 cents to $13.51 on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal, which is expected to close in mid-2007, has been approved by the boards of both companies but is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.Citigroup and Cravath, Swaine Moore advised Citizens while Evercore Partners and law firm Davis Polk Wardwell advised Commonwealth.
20;CTL;Centurylink;2005-01-24T17:46:16Z;Telecoms focus may switch to fixed lines;;In recent months, most attention in the US telecommunications industry has focused on the consolidation under way in the mobile sector and the roll-out of new services and fibre-optic systems.But some analysts and industry insiders believe traditional voice telephony using fixed lines could be the next hotbed of activity.In part, this is because several prominent wireless operators in the US including Sprint, Alltel and Verizon have substantial wireline assets that will no longer be part of their core strategy.Sprint has announced plans to spin off its fixed telephony business after it merges with Nextel. While Alltel has not expressed any interest in disposing of its fixed telephony business after it acquires Western Wireless, analysts believe such a move would make sense.Alltel's fixed line operations currently serve about 3.1m customers, but on a pro forma basis, wireless will account for 70 per cent of total revenues and operating cash flow after the deal and is clearly its growth driver.Similarly, Verizon, the US's biggest telecoms group, has made it clear it intends to focus on its wireless and broadband businesses, and sell or spin off local access lines. The company, which reports its full-year results on Thursday, is investing heavily in a new fibre-optic network that will enable it to deliver a mix of digital services, and compete with the cable networks.Meanwhile, although Verizon Wireless lost its number one US ranking late last year when Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless, the joint-venture mobile carrier is an important growth engine for both Verizon and Vodafone of the UK.Senior Verizon executives, including Ivan Seidenberg, chief executive, believe the company's future lies in broadband services and wireless rather than in traditional fixed telephony.As a result, analysts believe Verizon might eventually dispose of about one-third of its 54m access lines, mostly in rural and slower-growing industrial areas.Last year, Verizon sold its Hawaiian operations, including 707,000 access lines, for $1.7bn to Carlyle, the Washington-based private equity firm. However, it abandoned plans to sell off local access lines in upstate New York after the sale failed to attract sufficient interest. Instead, Verizon told investors and analysts that it was considering “creative” ways to spin off some of its local operations. No further deals have been announced, but investment bankers say privately that Verizon is continuing to explore various options. As Frank Governali of Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to investors last week: “2005 may see the birth of new pure-play wireline companies”, that would compete with existing independent local exchange carriers (ILECs).Alternatively, some of these ILECs could themselves become acquirers of local fixed-line telephone operations which, while relatively slow growing, can still be highly profitable for their owners.Aside from buy-out specialists and private equity firms, two independent telecoms operators are mentioned as potential acquirers Citizens Communications and CenturyTel.CenturyTel, in particular, may be a potential acquirer of some of these assets, “given its wireline focus and its stated intention to pursue opportunistic deals”, Dave Novosel, a Gimme Credit analyst, said. CenturyTel operates 2.4m local access lines in 22 states, with large concentrations in Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas and Washington. But, as Mr Novosel also noted, “figuring out the value of wireline assets can be difficult”.For example, Sprint's fixed-line margins appear to be slightly lower than those of Alltel, which are comparable to those of CenturyTel. In addition, because such a large number of access lines are or will be available shortly, the US looks increasingly like a buyer's market when it comes to fixed telephony.“Consequently, we believe CenturyTel would pay far less than the $3,300 average it paid to Verizon for the access lines purchased in 2002,” Mr Novosel said. He said that access lines likely to become available were exactly the type of assets that CenturyTel had bought in the past mostly rural, with much less competition from the competitive local exchange carriers and the cable operators at least until now.“CenturyTel has done an outstanding job of increasing the sell-through of enhanced services and raising the profitability of these rural lines,” he said.
