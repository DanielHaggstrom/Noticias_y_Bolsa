But they will want any buyer of the German retail group to pay a full price. After one failed bid last year by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, Sysco could offer an answer. The US food distributor has informally approached the ailing business about a potential takeover. It can improve on Mr Kretinsky’s price.Metro would help Sysco broaden its footprint in Europe. It would also give the acquirer cash-and-carry expertise to bring to the US.Mr Kretinsky offered to buy the German wholesaler for €16 per share, valuing it at €5.8bn, in June last year. That bid now looks more attractive. Metro’s share price has fallen as low as €10.42, from about €14 at the time of the offer. Through his investment vehicle, Mr Kretinsky owns just under 30 per cent of the company, avoiding the mandatory offer threshold.Metro was however right to dismiss Mr Kretinsky’s bid as too low. Sysco would therefore have to exceed €16 per share for the board and the entrepreneur to consider it.Sysco can afford to pay up. Assume the US group had to offer a 30 per cent bid premium over the three-month average stock price. Sysco would need to cut around €190m of costs annually from Metro to cover that. At under 5 per cent of the German company’s overheads this looks feasible.Longstanding shareholders with links to the company’s founders were causing problems for Mr Kretinsky. His plan to heap debt on Metro had them worried. They would probably prefer Sysco as a buyer. If it can come up with a better price, there would be few objections.The real issue is whether Sysco’s own shareholders welcome a further European jaunt. It bought Brakes Group for $3.1bn in 2016, but has struggled to integrate the UK food distributor. Metro would be an incongruous acquisition, Jefferies analysts believe.

1;SYY;Sysco Corp;2020-03-03T19:52:13Z;Sysco Corp explores tie-up with Germany’s Metro;US restaurant supplier first approached European wholesaler last year;US restaurant supplier Sysco Corp has contacted German wholesaler Metro over a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter told the Financial Times.Shares in Düsseldorf-based Metro surged 14.8 per cent late on Tuesday after Bloomberg first reported that both companies had been informally exploring the possibility of a tie-up. Shares in the potential suitor, which wants to expand in Europe, lost more than 2 per cent. The discussions between both groups are in a very preliminary stage, the people said, stressing that no concrete takeover offer had been discussed so far. “There have been talks but it would be way too early to call them a negotiation,” warned one person briefed on the matter, adding that Sysco first approached Metro last September.Talks were then put on hold after a couple of months but were rekindled “in the very recent past”, said a different person with knowledge of the matter, adding that senior executives from both sides have been involved. Metro shareholders last summer rejected a takeover bid by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who jointly with his Slovakian business partner Patrik Tkac valued the group’s equity at €5.8bn, compared to just €3.8bn before the talks with Sysco became public this week. With $60bn in annual sales, Sysco generates twice as much revenue as Metro. Its stock market value of $35.4bn is about eight times the size of the German company. Metro declined to comment. “As a matter of practice, we do not comment on M&A rumours or speculation,” a spokesperson for the US group told the Financial Times. Metro has just finished a five-year transformation from an unwieldy retail conglomerate into a focused wholesaler that operates 678 cash-and-carry stores in 24 countries and focuses on hotels, restaurants and other small business clients. In mid-February, chief executive Olaf Koch announced the sale of struggling German supermarket chain Real to investment firm SCP Group. In late 2019, it sold 80 per cent of its China retail business to Wumei Technology Group, cashing in €1bn. Since the failed takeover attempt last summer, Metro has been facing a slow-burning power struggle between two large shareholder groups with diverging views on its future. Through their investment vehicle EP Global Commerce, Mr Kretinsky and Mr Tkac increased their stake to 29.99 per cent and became the largest shareholders. At the same time, Metro’s two remaining longstanding family shareholders — Beisheim Group and the Meridian Foundation — pooled their voting rights and lifted their joint holding to 23.1 per cent, building a blocking minority for future shareholder meetings. Spokespeople for both shareholders told the Financial Times on Tuesday that they were not aware of any talks between Metro and Sysco and declined to comment on what they called “rumours”.

We have a real chance to tackle this issue.”“We wanted . . . an impactful way of changing company behaviour and making sure everyone steps up,” she said.Investors are becoming concerned that measures to tackle global warming could leave some companies nursing large losses. A study led by academics from the University of Cambridge this month warned that by 2035 a decline in demand for fossil fuels could leave them falling sharply in value. It forecast that between $1tn and $4tn could be wiped off the global economy in fossil fuel assets alone.In 2015, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, also warned that investors faced “potentially huge” losses from climate change action. The Pope warned major oil company heads on Saturday that there was “no time to lose” to address the “challenge of epochal proportions” in global warming.Last year, LGIM wrote to more than 80 of the world’s largest companies across sectors it believed were most exposed to climate change, including energy and banks.It said three-quarters of the companies contacted responded to its initial letters. But others failed to engage, including China Construction Bank and Rosneft Oil.LGIM criticised Occidental for the US oil and gas group’s absence of plans to report total emissions, as well as its lack of ambitious carbon targets, while it said Japan Post and Loblaw had either zero or poor climate disclosure. It said Sysco Corp, the food retailer, lacked a climate change policy.It added that Dominion Energy, China Construction Bank and Subaru scored badly in several categories it used to rank companies’ preparedness for climate change, including business strategy.China Construction Bank, Dominion, Rosneft, Loblaw, and Subaru did not respond to a request for comment. Japan Post could not be reached for comment.Occidental did not comment on LGIM’s decision, but it had “positive engagements” with its shareholders while developing its 2018 climate report. “We are continuing to progress our strategy and focus to be a global leader in CO2 emission reductions through geologic sequestration and believe our engagements are critical to our success.”Sysco also gave no comment on the fund house’s decision but said it took its “responsibility as a good corporate citizen” seriously. “We have a long standing commitment to energy and waste management and sustainable agriculture practices, with continual enhancements to the programmes,” it said.LGIM praised food manufacturer Nestlé for its clear, public statements on climate change. It also commended Equinor, the Norwegian group previously known as Statoil, for publishing its total emissions, French oil major Total for its “2 degree strategy” and miner BHP Billiton for disclosing the earnings impact of various climate change scenarios.
3;SYY;Sysco Corp;2018-01-31T17:40:27Z;Chicken suppliers clipped by latest antitrust claims;;Major US chicken suppliers including Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride are seeing investors fly the coop on Wednesday after two major US food distributors became the latest to accuse them of participating in a years-long conspiracy to reduce the supply and raise prices for chickens.Shares of Arkansas-based Tyson Foods were down 4.36 per cent to $75.45, heading for their biggest one-day drop since May, while Pilgrim’s Pride, headquartered in Colorado, dropped 3.8 per cent to $28.49.The declines come after the Wall Street Journal reported that US Foods and Sysco – two major US food distributors – became the latest to serve up allegations of anti-competitive in the market for broiler chickens, which account for nearly all of the chicken meat sold in the US, in lawsuits filed Tuesday in federal court in Illinois.The claims echo those brought in recent civil litigation by distributors and farmers and other purchasers accusing the major US chicken producers of colluding for years to drive prices higher, including through alleged manipulation of the Georgia Dock, a widely used index for wholesale chickens that was subsequently suspended.Tyson has previously disclosed that it was being investigated by Florida’s attorney general in connection with the allegations. A probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission ended without any recommendation of an enforcement action against Tyson, the company disclosed in a letter last year.A Tyson spokesman said in a statement: “Follow-on complaints like these are common in antitrust litigation. Such complaints do not change our position that the claims are unfounded. We will continue to vigorously defend our company.”A Pilgrim’s spokesman said: “Pilgrim’s believes the case is completely without merit. We look forward to defending our interests through the appropriate legal process.”Photo source: Getty Images
4;SYY;Sysco Corp;2016-08-15T20:34:21Z;Sysco profits boost fails to ignite shares;Broad equity market rises as S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq extend march into record territory;Sysco shares initially rallied on Monday after the largest food manufacturer and distributor in the US reported better than expected profits in its fiscal fourth quarter.The Houston-based company said profits nearly tripled to $215.7m, or 38 cents a share, compared with $73m, or 12 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 64 cents a share topped analysts’ estimates.Sysco, which abandoned its $8.2bn takeover of rival US Foods last year but closed a $3.1bn acquisition of UK distributor Brakes last month, said sales rose 10 per cent to $13.6bn but were just shy of analysts’ expectations.Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea said that the latest results show that Sysco “continues to demonstrate that there are no ‘hangover’ effects from the termination of its acquisition of US Foods”. He added: “Share repurchases are proceeding with the levels and cadence we expected, and now that the Brakes acquisition has closed, Sysco will focus at least some of its sights on the challenging European market.”A separate filing from Trian Fund Management late on Friday showed that the activist investor co-founded by Nelson Peltz — also the company’s largest shareholder — had boosted its stake in Sysco to 43.97m shares at the end of the second quarter, up from 43.27m at the end of the first.Shares in Sysco, which have advanced 27.3 per cent so far this year, climbed as much as 3.4 per cent to $53.97 at one point, before reversing course and ending the day 0.1 per cent lower at $52.16.Elsewhere, Best Buy shares slipped after Jefferies cut its rating on the stock to “hold” from “buy”.The electronics retailer might struggle as the market for 4K televisions, which offer ultra-high definition video, reaches its maturation point, said analyst Daniel Binder.“[The] 4K TV product is getting commoditised more this year as prices drop and we see a significant step-up in the 4K TV assortments at mass merchants such as Walmart and Target,” Mr Binder said. “Meanwhile, we don’t think any of the emerging categories, such as connected home or virtual reality, will be big enough to offset slower 4K TV growth.”At the same time, Best Buy was also facing “diminished cost cutting opportunities” from when its turnround efforts began about four years ago, Mr Binder said.Best Buy shares fell 1 per cent to $34.51 on Monday, but are still up by more than 6.6 per cent over the past 12 months.At the close, the broader US equity markets were in the green, with the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq all building on last week’s record peaks. The S&P 500 rose by 0.3 per cent to 2,190.2, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 18,636.1, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced by 0.6 per cent to 5,262.Trading might be “relatively quiet” this week with “major economic releases for the month and the earnings season largely behind us”, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Mr Kelly added that many investors were looking ahead to comments later this month from Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve chief, at the central bank’s annual economic symposium at Jackson Hole.
5;SYY;Sysco Corp;2016-02-22T20:09:12Z;Sysco to buy Brakes Group of the UK for $3.1bn;World’s largest catering supplier agrees deal that will give the US group greater access to Europe;Sysco, the world’s largest catering supplier, has reached a $3.1bn deal including debt to acquire UK-based food distributor Brakes Group after abandoning a takeover of its biggest domestic rival US Foods last year.The deal is among the largest so far this year to involve an overseas buyer acquiring a British company, and comes as business leaders are bracing themselves for the UK’s referendum on whether to leave the EU — a vote that has been set for June 23.Sysco is buying Brakes, which supplies food to more than 50,000 customers including restaurants, hospitals, and schools, to gain greater access to Europe.“We are watching that development [Brexit] closely from here,” said Bill DeLaney, Sysco’s chief executive. “We certainly recognise what’s going on and [the outcome] is not clear from our perspective. But we are just taking a long-term view.”Sysco, which has annual revenues of close to $50bn, said Brakes would continue to have its headquarters in London, retain its top management and be run it as a standalone company.“A strong Europe is beneficial to our customers,” Ken McMeikan, who will remain as chief executive of Brakes, said. “We do a lot in terms of pan-European business. Uncertainty is not good for business . . . But it will be up to the British public.”Brakes, which has been controlled by US private equity group Bain Capital since 2007, had revenues of a little less than $5bn in its latest fiscal year.The deal comes several months after Sysco walked away from an $8bn deal to acquire US Foods, which was agreed in late 2013, due to concerns from US competition authorities. Sysco paid a break fee of $300m to US Foods and incurred heavy costs pursuing the deal.Last week US Foods, which is owned by buyout groups Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and KKR, filed for a public listing.“Once the US Foods deal was terminated, it gave us a chance to look at our other options,” said Mr DeLaney. The Brakes deal will be subject to review by European regulators.Bain has been exploring a sale or listing of Brakes since the middle of last year. Stock market turbulence since the start of 2016 has led many private equity groups to reconsider plans for exiting some investments through IPOs.Bain bought the company in 2007 for $2.8bn (then £1.4bn) from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, another buyout group. The Sysco deal values the equity of Brakes at roughly $800m, while it will assume $2.3bn of debt on its books.Sysco is paying 12 times Brakes’ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation last year. Shares in Sysco, which has a market value of $25.7bn, fell 3.4 per cent to $43.46 in early US trading.Brakes was founded in the 1950s as a poultry supplier to British caterers.
6;SYY;Sysco Corp;2016-02-22T17:08:12Z;Sysco/Brake: tourist trap;Dealmaking proves irresistible for a company that has benefited from organic growth;It seems that American tourists cannot wait to take advantage of the plunging pound. Just as sterling hits new lows on heightened fears of Brexit, the biggest US food supply distributor, Sysco Corp, has announced that it will acquire private equity-backed, London-based Brakes Group for £2.2bn.Last summer, regulators quashed the $8bn tie-up Sysco planned with its biggest domestic rival, US Foods. Since the day that deal died, its shares have risen by a quarter, well ahead of the market.The company could have seen this as proof of how a steadier strategy of cost-cutting and capital returns was superior to the tricky integration of a big deal. This is a view still held by the market: Sysco shares fell more than 5 per cent after the Brakes announcement.Food service distribution — delivering not just food but napkins, mustard packets and other sundries to restaurants, canteens and hotels — is a tedious and barely profitable game, never more so than when the customers are the big chain restaurants that account for the bulk of sales. Sysco had $49bn of revenue for 2015 but free cash flow came in at just over $1bn.The industry is also fragmented, with the top three US players controlling just a third of the overall market. Sysco is constantly buying tiny local or specialised companies and throwing them into its network.But the deal for US Foods, also owned by private equity backers, was too much of a leap for the US Department of Justice. The merged company would have too much clout to impose price rises on local chefs and bakers, it reasoned.Alas, Sysco does not agree that its recent rally shows that it should forbear from indulging in big M&A.While Brake is smaller than US Foods, it represents a new geography (Sysco’s only European presence is in Ireland) so cost savings may be limited. It says the deal will return 13 per cent a year, a decent amount but below its target of 15 per cent return on capital. Visiting London remains expensive for Americans.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
7;SYY;Sysco Corp;2016-02-22T13:12:35Z;Sysco buys UK food company Brakes for $3.1bn;;Sysco, a US food manufacturer and distributor, has agreed to buy a UK rival Brakes for $3.1bn (£2.2bn).The US company, which had a takeover of a US competitor blocked by authorities last year, said on Monday that the deal for Brakes will bolster its presence in the UK and Europe.Bain Capital, the US private equity firm that’s owned Brakes since 2007, is getting a multiple of about 12 times the UK company’s profits before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Bill DeLaney, the chief executive of Sysco, said that “we expect to retain key members of Brakes Group’s talented leadership team and to experience little distraction from integration given the minimal overlap of the businesses.”Brakes generated just under $5bn of revenues last year.
8;SYY;Sysco Corp;2016-02-09T22:10:09Z;US Foods files for IPO despite market volatility;;US Foods, the second biggest American food-service distribution company, filed for an initial public offering on Tuesday, shrugging off volatility in financial markets that has chilled the new listings market this year.The company said in a regulatory filing that it plans to float its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “USFD” in a $100m offering — the figure is a placeholder and may change as the IPO nears, writes Adam Samson in New York.The move comes after a move by Sysco, the biggest US food distribution company, to buy US Foods fell apart last summer as regulators objected to the tie-up on antitrust grounds.US Foods, owned by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, posted a net loss of $73m in 2014 on sales of $23bn. Its private equity parents would still control majority voting power after the offering.The filing comes at a time when companies have shied away from floating their shares amid intense turmoil in global financial markets. Only one company has priced an IPO this year in the US, according to Bloomberg data.
9;SYY;Sysco Corp;2015-02-20T20:37:57Z;M&A and antitrust: no good deed;Unprofitable industries may need different competition rules;Regulators block industry consolidation to prevent companies from having too much power over customers. That seems reasonable enough. However, should it matter if the underlying industries in which those regulators intervene are inherently dreadful? The current kerfuffle in which Sysco Corp finds itself is one example of this dilemma.With an enterprise value of $26bn, Sysco is the leading US foodservice distributor, the business of delivering supplies to restaurants, hospitals and other institutions. In December 2013, it announced plans to acquire the second leading distributor, US Foods, for $8bn. The biggest buying the next one down might appear problematic. On Thursday, the US Federal Trade Commission said it would sue to stop the merger on the grounds that the tie-up would curtail competition in 32 individual markets.But Sysco, even as the industry leader, has underperformed the broader stock market, with operating margins below 5 per cent. It must wonder what it can do to create value.Sysco had already offered to divest operations with $4.6bn of revenue. Maybe in this instance it pursued an overly ambitious deal. However, its shareholders were clearly impatient with the low organic growth available in its mature $250bn industry.Another example: US mobile operator Sprint Corp attempted a merger with rival T-Mobile and was also thwarted by regulators. Sprint, unlike Sysco, does not have top market share in its industry, mobile telecoms. But given that it is in third place, a merger with another undersized rival made some sense. The combined company would then have the heft to compete against much larger competitors AT&T and Verizon. But regulators have preemptively stopped that combination, too.There could be perverse results from this antitrust vigilance. The companies could fail, increasing industry concentration regardless.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
10;SYY;Sysco Corp;2014-05-30T13:50:47Z;Hillshire bidding war sets up Wall St food fight;;"Pickles may go with sandwiches, as Hillshire Brands chief executive Sean Connolly put it two weeks ago. But many were puzzled by the US food group’s announcement that it would pay $6.6bn to acquire New Jersey-based rival Pinnacle Foods, maker of Vlasic pickles and Birds Eye frozen food.Without the sort of cost savings necessary to justify the price, many saw the move by Hillshire, known in the US for Ball Park hot dogs and Jimmy Dean sausages, as a way to head off a potential takeover.Whatever the motive, the announcement proved meagre defence: two unsolicited bids for Hillshire emerged this week from US poultry producers. Pilgrim’s Pride, majority owned by Brazil’s JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, offered $6.4bn for Hillshire on Tuesday and Arkansas-based Tyson, offered $6.8bn just two days later. With investors driving Hillshire’s share price above Tyson’s $50 offer, expectations are high that more bids are in the pipeline.The offers come amid a flurry of activity in the food industry, as producers seek to win back pricing power from retailers, global groups seek growth in new markets and conglomerates reshuffle their brand portfolios.During the financial crisis and in the years since, the food industry focused on growth through cost cutting: leaner factories, more efficient supply chains and smaller labour forces. But the Hillshire bidding war suggests the industry is back on the hunt for growth.“In the last year we’ve really seen a pickup in food M&A, at both ends of the value chain,” says Leanne Sardiga, head of retail and consumer deals at PwC.Deal activity has soared since Warren Buffett and private equity firm 3G Capital’s $28bn acquisition of Heinz in February 2013, and accelerated further this year.According to Dealogic, the data provider, there have been 581 deals worth $85.6bn in the global food and beverage industry so far this year, compared with 1,340 deals worth $121.1bn in all of 2013. The company does not break out food deals specifically.In the past month, Anglo-Dutch Unilever sold its North American pasta sauces to Japan’s Mizkan Group for $2.15bn, while US-based Mondelez merged its coffee business with Dutch group DE Master Blenders 1753. That follows a year in which Texas-based Sysco bought US Foods for $8.2bn, China’s Shuanghui International purchased US pork processor Smithfield Foods for $7bn and Singapore-listed Del Monte Pacific agreed to buy canned foods company Del Monte Foods for $1.7bn.Producers are benefiting from many of the trends that are feeding the broader surge in M&A activity, including the modest economic recovery, low interest rates, and a willingness to spend money saved during lean years to offset slow organic growth, says Andy Levine, partner at law firm Jones Day.But foodmakers are also consolidating in order to compete in an environment where fewer and fewer retailers control the grocery shelves. Mr Levine compares the situation to that facing the pharmaceutical industry, another hot M&A market.“Their growth strategy is to buy other companies that do stuff they do in order to have the best leverage they can through the sales channel,” he said.In such an environment, well-known brands become increasingly important, he says. This has compelled packaged foodmakers to focus on – or buy – popular brands that can win some of the limited shelf space.For decades, the consumer goods industry has consolidated haphazardly, says Dan Wald of Boston Consulting Group. Fortune Brands owned both Jim Beam whisky and Titleist golf balls; Kraft had Miracle Whip and Oreos, along with coffee and tea brands; Sara Lee covered meats, cakes and instant coffee.During the past few years these odd pairings have been broken up and stitched together with more suitable partners: Japan’s Suntory bought Fortune’s spirits business, Beam Inc, in January, while Titleist went to Fila; Kraft spun its snacks off as Mondelez, which merged its coffee business with DEMB, which broke away from Sara Lee.Activist shareholders played a part in the break-ups of Fortune and Kraft, and continue to exert pressure on the food industry, says Mr Wald. Such agitation helped create an environment in which “you’ve got a bunch of big businesses looking for earnings growth and you’ve got a bunch of relatively small businesses out there for the taking”.Sara Lee’s meat business became Hillshire, and in all likelihood, it too will soon find itself tied to a new partner.But whatever happens to Hillshire, the appetite for big food deals appears unlikely to be sated."
11;SYY;Sysco Corp;2013-12-09T19:39:10Z;Sysco: Front of the line;Purchase of US Foods creates exit problem for Blackstone’s PFG;A 4 per cent operating margin and 2 per cent industry growth make consolidation the only viable strategy in food service distribution. But Sysco’s $8bn purchase of its leading rival, US Foods, still managed to surprise. The Blackstone-backed No 3 player, Performance Food Group, seemed to be a less risky (since smaller) target than US Foods, the No 2. And with much of the consideration for US Foods – owned by KKR and Clayton Dubilier & Rice – being paid in Sysco shares, there is still scope for Sysco to take a shot at PFG. But for regulatory and integration reasons, Blackstone may have seen its best exit chance slip.Almost all of the $3.5bn equity portion of the purchase price (the rest of the $8bn is debt) is being paid in Sysco shares. Had the entire price been financed with debt, Sysco’s total debt to operating cash flow ratio would have risen to 3.5 times instead of 2.5 times. Sysco will spend $100m annually in dividends on the new shares – about what the after-tax interest expense on $3.5bn of debt would have been. Taking stock, in effect making this an IPO, allows the private equity owners to share in the combination benefits – Sysco shares jumped 15 per cent on Monday. KKR and Clayton Dubilier & Rice put in nearly $2.5bn of equity in their 2007 buyout.Sysco has about a fifth of the fragmented food service market and with US Foods that goes up to over a quarter. The deal may require disposals so an additional transaction for PFG, which Blackstone bought in 2008, seems problematic. Blackstone instead could list the shares of PFG. But the reception could be chilly. Sysco’s shares are only up a fifth in the past two years as the casual dining industry, the primary customer of food service distributors, is suffering from weak consumer spending. So it was a canny move by the US Foods owners to sign up a deal with Sysco before PFG could.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
12;SYY;Sysco Corp;2013-12-09T16:40:15Z;Sysco to buy US Foods in $8.2bn deal;;Sysco has reinforced its position as the US’s top food distributor by snapping up rival US Foods in a deal valued at $8.2bn including debt.Under the terms announced on Monday, Sysco will pay $3.5bn in cash and stock and assume $4.7bn of the company’s debt.US Foods’ private equity owners, KKR and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, will collect only about $500m in cash and will take the rest in stock to end up with a 13 per cent stake in Sysco, according to analysts at Oppenheimer.Sysco shares briefly soared past their all-time high price at the opening bell and closed up 9.7 per cent at $37.62, giving it a market capitalisation of $21.9bn.The deal marks a partial exit for KKR and Clayton, which took US Foods private for about $7.1bn, including debt, in 2007. Under the terms of the transaction, Sysco has agreed to assume or refinance the $4.7bn of debt US Foods still carries. A representative of each of the private equity groups will be given a seat on the board of the enlarged company.By retaining stakes in a large listed company, KKR and Clayton have preserved the possibility of further profits from their investment. It is an increasingly common tactic as private equity firms seek to boost their returns on purchases made at the peak of the pre-crisis leveraged buyout boom.Oppenheimer estimated that the deal valued the private equity groups’ equity at roughly 1.5 times what they put in, above the 1.3 times where KKR had valued the deal in its end of September results. At its lowest point in 2010, KKR had valued the stake at as little as 0.8 times its original investment.“While this is not a ‘home run’ (at least not yet), one needs to bear in mind that this was a 2007 vintage investment done at the peak of the market,” they wrote.Sysco, whose chrome-sided trucks deliver thousands of tonnes of frozen meals, medical supplies and even text books across the US every year, controls the country’s largest food distribution network. In buying US Foods, the Houston-based company expects to increase its annual sales by 46 per cent to $65bn.Both companies are known as broadline distributors because they serve a wide variety of clients and provide a broad array of products, rather than supplying a particular set of products to a specific group of businesses such as a restaurant chain. US Foods was previously owned by Ahold, the Dutch supermarket company, and was at the centre of an accounting scandal in 2003.Sysco said the deal would generate annual cost savings of at least $600m by 2017, from supply chain efficiencies and lower merchandising and back office costs. The price tag represents 9.9 times US Foods’ trailing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $826m.Bill DeLaney, Sysco’s chief executive, said the deal would help his company achieve its vision of being its customers’ “most valued and trusted business partner”.“Sysco and US Foods have highly complementary core strengths including a broad product portfolio and passionate food people deeply committed to customer service, quality-assured products and safety,” he added.The companies expect the transaction to complete in the second half of 2014, pending antitrust approval.Sysco was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arnall, Golden & Gregory.

13;SYY;Sysco Corp;2012-02-06T21:26:45Z;Greek worries weigh on Wall Street;Disappointing earnings stall rally;Shares in Lazard fell 4.2 per cent to $27.65 after the largest independent US merger adviser posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of just 1 cent.That was a further sign that the slowdown in capital markets is hitting investment banking bottom lines.With January numbers available, analysts are struggling to pick winners and losers from the shake-out that saw the value of announced M&A deals fall by a third from December to January.Data from Goldman Sachs suggests smaller firms have been taking market share.Stifel Nicolaus, Raymond James and Greenhill & Co all saw healthy year-on-year growth in the value of completed M&A deals in January, while large-caps Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley all saw January deal value fall at least 60 per cent compared with 2011.But that is yet to show up in share price performance. Stifel is up 19.3 per cent to $38.25, and Raymond James has gained 14.8 per cent to $35.54 so far this year, but only Greenhill, whose shares have surged 33 per cent to $48.40, is matching the 25 per cent plus returns of BofA, Citi, Morgan Stanley and Goldman.Although banks have been among the leaders in the US equity rally so far this year, other stocks linked directly to capital markets have underperformed. Exchanges are lagging the S&P 500 by 5.5 per cent while trust banks have underperformed by 4.2 per cent.On Monday, Craig Siegenthaler at Credit Suisse also warned clients not to be tempted by shares in asset managers, as the strong equity market rally has not been matched by significant mutual fund inflows.“We see valuations remaining at depressed levels due to continued weak long-term flows in 2012,” he told clients.Money managers Franklin Resources and Federated Investors were both off 0.2 per cent to $116.22 and $18.65, respectively.Elsewhere, US stocks opened sharply lower, following the lead of global indices, which had sold off as a breakdown in negotiations once again raised fears of a Greek default.But, not for the first time this year, US stocks rallied once European markets closed, and the S&P 500 closed off just 0.04 per cent at 1,344.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,845.2, and the blue-chip heavy index remains close to its three-year high hit Friday.While Greece dominated headlines, disappointing earnings continued to weigh on individual stocks.Food wholesaler Sysco fell 3.6 per cent to $29.79. Quarterly profits fell slightly as the company absorbed food cost inflation of 6.3 per cent, almost 2 percentage points higher than in the year-ago period.Humana fell 5.4 per cent to $85.25 after the company, which provides healthcare to seniors under the government’s Medicare scheme, disappointed analysts with its earnings guidance for 2012.With the majority of S&P 500 fourth-quarter results reported, negative guidance for the current quarter has outpaced positive guidance two to one.That has raised concern among analysts for the sustainability of the rally, which has seen the S&P 500 climb 6.9 per cent this year.“Some improvement from the macroeconomic or earnings outlook will be needed to support a continued rally in equities,” Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital, told clients.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch surged 8.1 per cent to $43.78. But despite the temporary lull in selling pressure, the clothing retailer, which saw a year on year fall in holiday same store sales, remains the weakest performer in the S&P 500’s current bull run. Shares are down 26 per cent since October 3.Pharmacy benefits manager Medco Health Solutions fell 6.3 per cent to $59.62 on reports the company’s acquisition by rival Express Scripts may be blocked. Express Scripts shares also fell 4 per cent to $50.00.Social media stocks, which enjoyed a two-day Facebook filing-fuelled surge on Thursday and Friday, gave back some of their gains.Offers website Groupon fell 3.8 per cent to $23.51 and professional networking website LinkedIn fell 0.2 per cent to $79.76.Zynga, whose online games accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook revenue in 2011, fell 4.6 per cent to $12.77. The stock remains 35 per cent up for the year after a 33 per cent surge last week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index remained at levels not seen since the dotcom bubble 11 years ago, despite slipping 0.1 per cent to 2,901.99.
14;SYY;Sysco Corp;2011-11-07T21:40:41Z;Semi-stocks weigh on Nasdaq;Investors cautious on Greece and Italy news;Semiconductor stocks slipped on Monday, as supply chain disruption stemming from flooding in Thailand continued to weigh on the sector.Hard drive manufacturers have had to close factories in Thailand, raising fears that products such as personal computers, set top boxes and servers will all face production shortfalls next year.Texas Instruments was off 0.8 per cent to $31.53, and Nvidia was off 0.5 per cent to $14.74.Analysts said falling semi stocks could also indicate renewed concern about global growth, because chips are used in a wide variety of industrial processes and computer products.“We’re definitely seeing the impact of macro headwinds in this space,” said Kevin Cassidy, semiconductor analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.“Looking at third-quarter results, industry wide guidance for the fourth quarter was down 10 per cent, and the numbers for 2012 have been set very low,” he added.
15;SYY;Sysco Corp;2011-05-09T21:43:58Z;Tyson: beefing up prices may be fowl;The US meat producer believes chicken prices may benefit as beef soars;"The American carnivore may be eating a bit less red meat these days, but he (and it often is a he) has proved surprisingly willing to pay up for the pleasure.As the commodities boom has roared, steaks and pork chops have gone along for the ride, together with the grains that are meat producers’ main inputs. Yet Tyson Foods has largely been able to protect margins, using price. The US meat producer on Monday reported its fourth straight quarter in which average prices for both beef and pork were up well over 10 per cent, while volumes have stayed relatively stable. Beef prices for the most recent quarter were up just under 20 per cent; volumes were down less than 1 per cent.Tyson is not an isolated case. On the same morning, the restaurant-supply company Sysco reported better than expected sales driven by success in passing food price inflation through to customers while simultaneously growing volumes.But while the American consumer hasn’t broken, he is bending. Though calories consumed appear at least stable, judging from waistlines, meat produced for the US market has been on a slow decline for four years. According to government data it has fallen from 283 pounds per capita in 2007 to an expected 263 pounds in 2011. Producers have been more cautious and export markets are taking up the slack.Tyson’s leadership noted that, if red meat prices outrun consumer appetites over time, chicken prices (which have not been as strong) will benefit from demand for cheaper alternatives. Corn and meat prices have backed off a bit in recent weeks, but if this welcome trend reverses, the American consumer may start to crack – and the first fissures may appear in the form of a fowl taste.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
16;SYY;Sysco Corp;2010-11-08T22:11:52Z;Deal speculations lifts tech stocks;;"Deal speculation and an analyst upgrade for Hewlett-Packard helped the technology sector edge up while the broader S&P 500 fell. Hewlett-Packard rose 1.2 per cent to $44.25 after it was added to the UBS short term buy list.Analysts said holiday sales of computers and servers would drive fourth quarter results. But they kept its long term rating “neutral” on concerns of increasing competition.Intel was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” by UBS and given a price target of $25. Shares rose during the day but closed down 0.1 per cent at $21.23. Analysts predicted that the PC component inventory cycle had bottomed out and that the threat from tablet computers was included in the sales outlook.Amazon.com surged 0.7 per cent to $171.99 after the online retailer bought privately owned Quidsi, which owns diapers.com and soap.com. It paid $500m in cash for the company that will help it expand into baby care products.Yahoo rose 1.1 per cent to $16.44 after it was reported that the search engine operator could be exploring a tie-up with AOL. The latter’s shares climbed 4.7 per cent to $26.10.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,223.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.3 per cent to close at 11,406.84, but the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.1 at 2,580.05.Last week, stocks hit their highest levels in two years as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to extend quantitative easing and the Republican victory in the House of Representatives. David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, comparing the market to last time the S&P 500 broke out above 1,200 in April, said: “There are many fundamental reasons for stocks to rally further.“Higher earnings per share has made the S&P cheaper today than in April. Currently, the S&P is trading at 13.8 times annualised third-quarter earnings per share compared with 15.2 times annualised first-quarter earnings per share in April.“We believe the rising likelihood of Congress passing a tax package before year-end can get the S&P close to 1,300.”Financials fell 0.8 per cent as regional banks continued to suffer since they reported their third-quarter results.The S&P 500 regional banking index slid 0.8 per cent with Regions Financial Corp losing 1.7 per cent to $6.34 and PNC Financial Services declining 1.3 per cent to $57.65.Analysts at Oppenheimer reaffirmed their “overweight” rating for the industrial sector but said they were selectively increasing risk exposure, looking at machinery and road and rail stocks. They said machinery stocks were attractive because they would benefit from new orders and construction spending trends. Analysts at Credit Suisse echoed this recommendation, saying the stocks were cheap.Oppenheimer analysts also said road and rail stocks were expected to increase their sales, earnings and margins at a higher rate than the overall sector in 2011 because of freight volumes and truck tonnage increasing significantly in recent months.The S&P 500 industrials sector lost 0.3 per cent.But manufacturing and construction company Fluor added 2.2 per cent to $55.72 and rail transport stocks CSX and Union Pacific both edged up.CSX rose 0.7 per cent to $62.23 and Union Pacific, which benefited from an upgrade at Credit Suisse, was up 0.8 per cent to $91.98. Also in industrials, Boeing shares fell in spite of a $3.3bn order from Saudi Arabian Airlines for 12 aircraft and were lower by
1.5 per cent at $70.21.In materials, General Steel Holdings fell 6.8 per cent to $2.76 after the Chinese group reported a surprise third-quarter loss as it suffered from higher prices of iron ore and coking coal.McDonald’s was almost flat at $79.31 after it reported its global sales in October. The rise of 6.5 per cent was helped in recent months by sales of smoothies and its dollar menu but the increase in the US was lower than analysts had forecast. Sysco, which distributes food for the food service industry, fell 2.7 per cent to $29.23 after it reported its earnings were squeezed by higher food and commodity costs."
17;SYY;Sysco Corp;2010-09-01T20:35:11Z;Manufacturing strength triggers broad-based US rally;;US stocks jumped on Wednesday as investors were cheered by better than expected manufacturing data from the US and China.The S&P 500 closed up 3 per cent to 1,080.29, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.5 per cent to 10,269.47 and the Nasdaq Composite was 3 per cent higher at 2,176.84.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose, with eight rising more than 2 per cent and three up by more than 4 per cent.The Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing figures showed an unexpected rise in US manufacturing activity in August.Chris Wolfe, chief investment officer for the Private Banking and Investment Group at Merrill Lynch, said the market was rallying because of the positive manufacturing data and as a sigh of relief that a “terrible” August was over.“Importantly the prices paid [element of the ISM manufacturing report] actually rose much better than expected and that’s often closely linked to corporate profits,” he said.He added: “With the integration of the global picture, you can’t just pay attention to the US data. If the Chinese PMI was weak and the US ISM was strong, I speculate there would not be such a strong reaction in the markets today.”Investors brushed aside negative data on private payrolls and construction spending.Private sector payrolls unexpectedly declined by 10,000 in August while construction spending was also worse than expected, falling to a 10-year low in July.But the S&P 500 homebuilders index still rose 4.5 per cent, and the industrials and materials sectors gained after the positive manufacturing data.Industrials led the risers, surging 3.9 per cent, with Caterpillar up 4.6 per cent to $68.16 and General Electric advancing 3.7 per cent to $15.01.The materials sector gained 2.9 per cent, with iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources jumping 6.1 per cent to $64.95 and aluminium producer Alcoa climbing 3 per cent to $10.52.Shares in energy companies followed the oil price higher, with the sector rising 3.6 per cent and ExxonMobil gaining 3.1 per cent to $60.91.Hopes about a pick up in the pace of the global economic recovery also pushed up financials and consumer discretionary stocks. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index advanced 3.4 per cent.The S&P 500 financials index jumped 3.9 per cent, with Bank of Americasurging 6.1 per cent to $13.21, Citigroup gaining 3.7 per cent to $3.85 and JPMorgan Chasejumping 3.8 per cent to $37.74.Applerose 3 per cent to $250.33 after it unveiled new versions of all its iPods and announced changes to its TV set-top box and iTunes software.Its rivals also rose with Googleup 2.3 per cent to $460.34 and Microsoftrising 1.9 per cent to $23.90.In deal news,Genzyme, the pharmaceutical group that is the target of a bid by Sanofi-Aventis, rose 0.4 per cent to $70.38 after Henri Termeer, chief executive, said he was willing to sell the company – but not for Sanofi’s offer of $69 a share. US-listed shares in Sanofi surged 3.9 per cent to $29.73.Dell had until Wednesday to make another offer for “cloud computing” company, 3Par.Rival Hewlett-Packard is the highest bidder with an offer of $30 a share in a battle that Dell started a couple of weeks ago.Shares in Dell rose 3 per cent to $12.12, Hewlett-Packard added 2 per cent to $39.21 and 3Par nudged down 0.1 per cent to $32.08.Other potential deal targets include Burger King, which surged 14.7 per cent to $18.86 after it was reported that the fast-food chain was in talks with 3G Capital Management about a possible sale.AT&T rose 1.2 per cent to $27.35 after it was reported that it may be considering a bid for London-listed company Cable & Wireless Worldwide.Share repurchasing also continued, with Sysco Corp, the largest distributor of food to restaurants, hospitals and schools, rising 2.4 per cent to $28.14 after it said it would buy back 20m shares.In earnings news Borders reported a 11.5 per cent drop in revenue in its second quarter. Shares fell 3.7 per cent to $1.04.
18;SYY;Sysco Corp;2010-08-16T19:10:15Z;Wall Street lifted by tech and materials stocks;;"US stocks were almost flat on Monday after rising technology and materials stocks balanced out weak economic news in choppy trading.The S&P 500 closed a fraction higher at 1,079.38, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down a fraction at 10,302.01 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher closing at 2,181.87.Weak economic data from Japan and worse than expected manufacturing report from the New York region pushed the S&P into negative territory for much of the morning.The New York Federal Reserve said its manufacturing activity index, also known as the Empire State index, rose to 7.10 in August from 5.08 in July – the index was forecast to rise to 8.00.Orders and sales in New York, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut declined for the first time in more than a year.“The only tonic at this point for the mindset that exists is going to be jobs,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. But he said there were some indications that the job situations could be improving.“Both the ISM manufacturing and services figures went up in August, we also had the employment component of the small business index, which went up, and even this morning the Empire [State] employment component went up.”Metal producers, which fell last week on the back of weak economic data from China, rebounded as metal prices rose again.Iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 3.4 per cent to $60.47, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold rose 0.8 per cent to $70.63 and AK Steelwas up 1.1 per cent to $13.21.The S&P 500 information technology index rebounded after being dragged down last week by Cisco’s cautious outlook. The sector rose 0.4 per cent, Cisco jumped 2.6 per cent to $21.91 and Intel was up 1.7 per cent to $19.47.Ebay climbed 2.6 per cent to $22.05 after it was reported that its PayPal service might be used by Google’s Android smartphone, which could bring in up to $500m in revenue by 2013.Data from the National Association of Home Builders, which showed homebuilder confidence declining from 14 to 13, hit stocks. The S&P 500 homebuilder index fell 1.1 per cent with Lennar suffering the most, losing 1.4 per cent to $13.14.In earnings news, Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, said its forecast for the current quarter was lower than some analysts’ estimates.Home improvement retailers have suffered as cautious shoppers shy away from expensive items and renovation projects.Lowe’s missed analysts’ estimates in the last quarter as the impact from first-time homebuyer tax credit and cash for energy-efficient appliances programmes faded.Net income rose 9.6 per cent to 58 cents per share but just missed the consensus forecast of 59 cents per share. Revenue rose 3.8 per cent to $14.36bn, but missed the average estimate of $14.52bn. Its shares rose 0.6 per cent to $19.70.Sysco, the food distributor, also reported slightly lower-than-expected earnings, with net income coming in at 57 cents a share compared with an average forecast of 58 cents a share. The company beat projections on revenue, which was $10.3bn compared with estimates of $9.95bn. Its shares fell 2.3 per cent to $29.28.In deal news, Dell agreed to buy 3Par, a data storage company in a deal worth about $1.15bn, or $18 a share, almost double 3Par’s closing price on Friday.Dell shares fell 0.4 per cent to $11.96 while 3Par soared 86.5 per cent to $18.00.Shares in higher education companies declined after a report from the US Department of Education showed that some colleges owned by for-profit education providers have campuses where fewer than 20 per cent of federal student loans are being repaid.The government would like to use the data to determine which programmes can remain eligible for
aid.Strayer Education plummeted 18.4 per cent to $163.26, Devry fell 8.8 per cent to $38.80 and ITT Educational Servicesslid 14.6 per cent to $54.93."
19;SYY;Sysco Corp;2009-11-02T21:49:00Z;Ford drives Wall St higher;;US equities were volatile on Monday, turning sharply negative during the afternoon as financials slumped, before recovering some lost ground.Initially, stocks rallied, boosted by upbeat economic reports and a surprise swing to profitability for Ford.The US carmaker posted its first quarterly profit in more than a year as cost-cutting and the government’s “cash-for-clunkers” rebates helped produce earnings of nearly $1bn, or 29 cents a share, during the third quarter.That confounded expectations of a 12-cent-a-share loss and Ford closed up 8.3 per cent at $7.58.After the closing bell, Stanley Works announced it would acquire Black & Decker in an all-share deal valued at $4.5bn.After dipping as much as 0.7 per cent during the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent higher at 1,042.88, half its earlier rise of 1.5 per cent.It was a wild ride on Monday for Vix, the index of S&P options volatility. After dropping 8.5 per cent to 28, Vix powered back above 30, only to ease a tad as stocks recovered. Last week, Vix closed above 30, for the first time since July a sign of rising fear for stocksThe S&P financials also rebounded from an afternoon slide of 1.8 per cent, sparked by worries that the banking system remains vulnerable in the wake of CIT filing for bankruptcy on Sunday.“Weakness among financials was also likely reflecting investor concerns as how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will build reserves against future loses in an environment that’s already seen 100 banks fold this year,” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.Elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite closed higher by 0.2 per cent at 2,049.20, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,789.44.The behaviour of equities on Monday came after last week’s decline of 4 per cent for the S&P, which helped drag the broad benchmark into negative territory for October, its first monthly decline since February.Investors enter November facing a busy week of data, the end of the earnings season and a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Any change in the central bank’s policy statement as to the timing of removing easing policy could weigh on sentiment, notably in the bond market.Later in the week, attention will focus on the release of the October employment report. Economists expect a decline of 175,000 jobs during October with the unemployment rate rising 0.1 percentage points to 9.9 per cent.“The bottom line in Friday’s jobs data is likely to be that the labour market remains a significant source of vulnerability for the economic recovery,” said Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson Icap.On Monday the market was propelled to its intra-day highs after the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index was 55.7 for October.That was higher than an expected rise of 53 and was the best reading since April 2006. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion.Meanwhile, construction spending for September rose 0.8 per cent, its biggest gain since September 2008, and pending home sales for September were up 6.1 per cent as the home buyer tax credit boosted activity.Sentiment for stocks was also boosted by other earnings, brokerage actions and a deal in the energy sector.Denbury, the oil company, announced a deal to buy Encore for $3.2bn with Encore shareholders receiving $50 a share, consisting of $15 in cash and $35 in Denbury common stock.Denbury fell 10.3 per cent to $13.09 while Encore rose 20.5 per cent to $44.67.In other earnings news, Humana, the health insurer, posted a 65 per cent rise in third-quarter profit.The company reported earnings of $301.6m, or $1.78 a share, up from $183m, or $1.09 a share, a year before. Revenue rose 8 per cent for the quarter to $7.72bn and the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $37.01.Shares in Loews Corp rose 2.4 per cent to $33.90 after the conglomerate reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit of $469m, or $1.08 a share, beating a forecast of 89 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $144m, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Sysco Corp, the food distributer, recorded an 18 per cent rise in quarterly profit, just above estimates. The stock gained 0.2 per cent to $26.50 as sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.Shares in Clorox rose 0.3 per cent to $59.40 after the maker of bleach products posted a 23 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit, beating estimates.Shares in Motorola rose 5.4 per cent to $9.03 after Citigroup upgraded it to a “buy” from a “hold” and raised the target price to $10.50 ahead of the new Droid cell phone.Nordstrom gained 1.6 per cent to $32.29 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the retailer to a “buy” from a “hold” with a target price of $45 from $36on expectations of better store sales in October.
20;SYY;Sysco Corp;2007-08-13T20:59:34Z;Wall Street surrenders gains;;Wall Street stocks surrendered early gains late on Monday, but a divergence in performance among the leading benchmarks suggested that leveraged hedge funds and other investors were still adjusting their portfolios.The S&P 500 finished lower by 0.1 per cent at 1,452.92 but fell 1 per cent from its intra-day high. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.1 per cent at 2,542.24, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.02 per cent at 13,236.53.Bucking the bearish trend, the Nasdaq 100 index of large technology companies closed up 0.5 per cent. Traders reported selling of financials and other sectors and buying of large-cap technology stocks.The Russell 2000 index of small firms initially rallied and then plunged by about 2.5 per cent from its high for the day. By the end of trading, the Russell was down 1.1 per cent.In an early sign that the money markets were in better shape, the US Federal Reserve injected just $2bn into the repurchase market on Monday. That meant $36bn of Friday’s massive $38bn funding expired. Late on Monday, the effective Fed funds rate was trading below 5.25 per cent, the central bank’s target rate.Financial stocks began the day better as investors took some heart from Blackstone’s earnings. But the S&P financials index ended 0.8 per cent lower. The private equity firm which listed in June, released its first quarterly results and posted a net income of $774.4m. The shares were up 6.4 per cent at $26.89. That left the stock around 26.7 per cent lower since its listing.Still, the private equity company expressed a cautious outlook. “Concerns over weakness in the US housing market and sub-prime mortgage market, coupled with a large volume of debt financing backlog related to leveraged equity transactions, served to create more challenging financing conditions starting in the last week of the quarter, which continue to date.”The fate of the financials sector is seen to be driving the overall tone for the broader market.“You cannot have a solid stock market without the financials doing well,” said Anthony Conroy, managing director at BNYConvergEx.The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – a measure of equity volatility – retreated 6.6 per cent to 26.44 but remained more than 60 per cent higher since the start of July. Credit Suisse said Vix was consolidating below 30 but was marking time ahead of an eventual move to 35-36.In spite of the better mood, investors remain braced for further bouts of volatile trading. This week, many hedge funds are expected to reveal their results for July.Mr Conroy said: “Everyone is wondering how much leverage various quantitative funds have and to what extent they are exposed to further spikes in volatility.”On Monday, Goldman Sachs announced $3bn of new funding for its Global Equity Opportunities fund, which it said has lost 30 per cent of its value so far this year - most of it last week.Goldman also said two of its other hedge funds had also been hit by the credit turmoil. It had “reduced risk and leverage” in the funds to stem losses. Goldman shares closed down 1.7 per cent at $177.50.When volatility increases sharply, quant funds – which follow statistical models based on past patterns of trading – can suffer from a breakdown in historical relationships. In recent days, big swings have occurred in certain areas of the market as trading models that use large amounts of leverage have been forced to buy and sell stocks, often at a loss.“There has been a confluence of factors creating some internal market havoc as portfolios are being forced to change in a time frame that provides little liquidity when it is needed most,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup. “Many statistical arbitrage-driven strategies found that correlations had broken down.”Other areas of the stocks market that have suffered lately remained under pressure on Monday.Accredited Home Lenders plunged by 34.6 per cent to $5.82 after Lone Star, a private equity firm, backtracked on a deal to buy the money-losing subprime mortgage lender. Accredited Home Lenders also said it was suing Lone Star in an attempt to force it to complete the $400m takeover. Shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell following the government’s decision on Friday to deny the mortgage giants’ request to lift their portfolio limits. Fannie was down 3.5 per cent at $64.12 and Freddie fell 0.7 per cent to $61.52.The S&P homebuilders index fell 6 per cent after a 3.5 per cent slide on Friday.DR Horton, the largest US home builder, closed 3.3 per cent lower at $16.87 after JPMorgan lowered its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “overweight”.Beazer Homes fell 18.8 per cent to $12.34 after the company delayed filing its fiscal third-quarter report.In other earnings news, Sysco reported an 8.5 per cent rise in fourth quarter results and the stock closed up 3.6 per cent at $33.56.
21;SYY;Sysco Corp;2007-07-04T21:37:14Z;Sysco adds change to the menu;;When facing a full room of investors this year, Richard Schnieders, chief executive of Sysco, jokingly reminded them that he was from the company with the ticker symbol SYY – and not from Cisco, the technology company.But with revenues of $33.9bn last year, his company is the largest food service distributor in North America, supplying most of the food eaten in both chain and private restaurants, hospitals, schools and hotels across the continent.Sysco is more than 50 per cent larger than its nearest competitor, US Foodservice, sold by Ahold to KKR and Clayton Dubilier & Rice in May for $7.1bn.It also has about 400,000 clients and almost 50,000 employees. It operates the largest private truck fleet in North America, with more than 9,000 vehicles, exceeding Wal-Mart’s 7,000 truck fleet.Through gradually buying up small regional competitors over the past 37 years, Sysco has acquired a national network of 172 distribution centres located across the US. Its business is run by state-based operating companies which have traditionally enjoyed a high level of autonomy.In the 1980s and 1990s the company rode a steady wave of growth, both through organic increases in demand, and from 137 small acquisitions. But having achieved national dominance, it now faces challenges that have led to some fundamental shifts in the way it does business in a comparatively low-margin business – Sysco’s earnings last year were $855m, with an operating margin of 4.8 per cent.This year, for example, the company began purchasing its food supplies centrally for the first time, rather than leaving it to individual operating companies to negotiate with food suppliers. It has also moved to provide centralised support to its network of distribution centres, creating its first “redistribution centre” in northern Virginia to feed high-velocity products through to warehouses operated by 14 separate regional operating companies.The move is aimed at reducing inventory levels, and at increasing the efficiency of its trucking fleet – part of an overall effort to improve its logistics.Behind the changes, Mr Schnieders told investors last month, lie a series of factors that have cut into the company’s performance. In its core restaurant business, which accounts for about 60 per cent of sales, quick-service national chains – which can negotiate in bulk for lower prices – are gaining market share over traditional independent restaurants, reducing Sysco’s margins. Overall, the growth of the food service industry has also slowed, while high fuel costs have added to the pressure on the business.“We’ve been faced with these issues that kind of came together since the turn of century,” Mr Schnieders has said.That has led to the effort to centralise buying and to seek to improve its logistics, although, at only $1.3bn in a planned latest phase, the level of centralised buying remains comparatively small. Further redistribution centres are also planned, with another centre opening this year in Florida to serve the south-eastern US, and a Midwest centre planned for Indiana in 2008. The company is also launching a new transportation management system this year aimed at keeping its trucks full.Sysco is also looking to increase its margins with its own-brand products, such as giant tubs of ice cream, a business that was worth $12bn last year.It has also decided to go global, setting itself the target of becoming “the global leader in the efficient, multi-temperature food product value chain”. To that end, it bought International Food Group in 2005, a business that supplies American fast-food chains around the world, with Mr Schnieders arguing that Sysco can grow on global demand for US food products.
22;SYY;Sysco Corp;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Bain Capital snaps up Brakes;;Brakes, the UK’s biggest food distributor, was on Friday acquired by Bain Capital for more than €1.3bn (£877m), as the US private equity firm beat off interest from UK rivals and a potential trade buyer.Clayton Dubilier & Rice, a private equity firm specialising in distribution businesses, had attracted interest from private equity groups including Blackstone, CVC and Cinven, as well as Sysco, the biggest US food distribution company.Sysco, however, walked away from the auction of Brakes at an early stage, according to Frank McKay, chief executive of the UK company: “Sysco dropped out quite early. They like the business, but the timing just was not right for them.”CD&R bought UK-listed Brake Bros with the support of the founding family in 2002 for £434m. CD&R paid itself back the £270m of equity it invested in that deal with a special dividend after a refinancing last year.Friday’s deal is understood to have generated a more than three-times return on CD&R’s initial equity investment.Mr McKay said the buy-out firm had invested heavily in the business, including two acquisitions and a modernisation of its 1,400-strong fleet of lorries. He said the workforce had “increased significantly” to about 8,500.Brakes last year increased earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by 30 per cent to £109m on sales of £1.67bn. Its ebitda has risen more than 50 per cent since CD&R acquired it.Mr McKay said private equity was “being given a bad name wrongly” in the UK. The industry has been accused of stripping assets, dodging tax and cutting jobs. “In fact it is all about creating value,” he insisted.“Management and a wide circle of employees were well incentivised. If you add value for shareholders then you get adequately rewarded under private equity, which is not necessarily the case in a public-listed company,” said Mr McKay.Brakes is the UK’s largest supplier of food to the catering industry, with a 14 per cent market share and is in the top three in France. It supplies schools, restaurants, prisons and large catering companies.Bain Capital has built up a stable of food and distribution businesses. It owns the Burger King and Dunkin Donuts restaurant chains as well as Toys R US, the US retailer, and Brenntag Group, the German chemicals distributor.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank advised CD&R on the sale.
23;SYY;Sysco Corp;2007-06-08T01:21:59Z;Sysco joins bidding for Brake Bros;;Sysco, the Texas-based food distribution company, on Thursday night emerged as a contender in the auction for Brake Bros, its UK peer which is being sold by Clayton Dubilier & Rice, the private equity group, and could fetch more than £1.2bn.According to people familiar with the matter, Sysco will be competing for Brakes against several private equity groups, including US firms such as Bain and Blackstone, and UK firms CVC and Cinven. Sysco and CD&R declined to comment.CD&R, which specialises in owning distribution businesses and last month struck a $7bn deal to acquire US Foodservice from Ahold of the Netherlands, could make as much as three times its money from the Brakes investment. CD&R has owned Brakes for five years, having bought the business for £434m in 2002 with the founding family’s backing.Sysco is one of the world’s largest food distribution companies, with a market capitalisation of nearly $20bn at close yesterday. People close to the auction said Sysco was a “good fit” for Brakes in that it would help its plans for international expansion. Brakes is the UK’s largest supplier of food to the catering industry and among the largest players in France’s industry.In the private equity world, many executives will see Sysco’s entry into the Brakes auction as a test of the ability of strategic buyers to outbid buy-out groups. Until recently, strategic buyers were always seen as more likely to pay higher prices for assets because of their ability to extract more savings from mergers.But the availability of cheap debt turned that reality on its head in the past 18 months, as more private equity groups emerged victorious in auctions.
24;SYY;Sysco Corp;2006-11-01T22:24:52Z;CD&R in talks to buy Ahold’s US unit;;Clayton Dubilier & Rice is in talks to buy Dutch food retailer Ahold’s US Foodservice (USF) unit in a deal that could value the business at about $5bn.Discussions with the US buy-out group comes as interest in all or part of Ahold from Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is thought to have cooled.Two people close to the situation confirmed the CD&R talks but cautioned that they were “early” and could yet founder. However, CD&R is well placed as it already knows USF well. In 2001, it sold Alliant, a business that is a major constituent of USF, to Ahold in a $1.45bn deal. CD&R generated a gain of more than $1bn on Alliant, one of its best ever investments.USF is mainly involved in distribution, a CD&R speciality, while the buy-out group also has expertise in what one analyst described as “big, complex divestitures”. “[It] feels like a deal made for CDR,” one of the people said.An announcement on USF’s future could come this month. On Monday, Ahold is due to unveil the findings of a review of its retail operations that is intended to improve profits and sales. People close to the review said the fate of USF is part of that process.USF was at the centre of a 2003 accounting scandal that almost bankrupted Ahold. Its sale would return Ahold to its roots as a supermarket operator, where it was active for more than a century before embarking on a spending spree to assemble USF.The $3.6bn takeover of USF, brokered on a golf course in late 1999, was intended to catapult Ahold into food distribution. The rationale was the increasing number of consumers eating out.USF was the second-largest supplier to US restaurants and catering establishments after Sysco.Ahold went on to buy the third and fourth-largest groups, including Alliant, spending more than $6.6bn in total and bolting the businesses together.The addition of distribution activities created a €65bn ($83bn) turnover group, which at that time ranked third in the world by sales behind Wal-Mart of the US and France’s Carrefour.But Ahold underestimated the problems of integration and failed to detect an $800m fraud until it was too late. It has rebuilt USF, restoring margins and credibility since appointing new management after the scandal.The sale of the unit potentially clears a major obstacle to a merger between Ahold, and Belgian retailer Delhaize. It would also reduce Ahold’s market capitalisation, currently about €12bn, to something approaching the size of the smaller Belgian group, as well as free up capital to return to shareholders. Some shareholders have been lobbying for a break-up of the Dutch company in order to unlock value.Ahold has been discussing a merger in which the two retail groups would be combined into a holding company overseeing separate US and European supermarket activities.Goldman Sachs and ABN Amro are advising Ahold.
25;SYY;Sysco Corp;2006-10-16T22:51:49Z;Ex-FDA chief charged over stock holdings;;Lester Crawford, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, will plead guilty to charges filed on Monday that he lied about financial holdings and conflicts of interent while he was a top US regulator.He is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to one federal charge each of making a false statement and conflict of interest. Each charge carries a maximum of one year in jail.Mr Crawford’s indictment and guilty plea marks another blow to a Bush administration official, and highlights continuing scrutiny over conflicts of interest.The charges filed by federal prosecutors in federal court in Washington clarify Mr Crawford’s sudden resignation as FDA chief in September 2005. His resignation came less than three months after the Senate confirmed his nomination by the president to lead the FDA, a powerful regulator overseeing 25 per cent of US gross domestic product.Before his nomination he served for three years as acting FDA commissioner and deputy commissioner.According to the indictment, Mr Crawford lied from 2003 to 2005 about stock and options held by himself and his wife in companies with significant interests in FDA decisions. These stocks included Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products maker, PepsiCo, the soft drinks maker, food group Sysco, and retailer Wal-Mart.The indictment also details how US obesity regulation could have been affected by an alleged conflict of interest between Mr Crawford’s finances and a policy committee he chaired.In 2003, Mr Crawford was chairman of the Obesity Working Group (OWG) at the FDA. The group produced policy recommendations the next year, including new rules for food and soft drink labels’ calories, carbohydrates and contents.“During the entire period from the formation of the OWG . . . Crawford and his wife owned 1,400 shares of PepsiCo stock worth a minimum of about $62,000 and 2,500 shares of Sysco stock, worth a minimum of about $78,000 . . . Shareholders had a financial interest in the OWG’s conclusions and recommendations,” the indictiment said.Mr Crawford is also accused of making false statements on federal financial disclosure forms.
26;SYY;Sysco Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
