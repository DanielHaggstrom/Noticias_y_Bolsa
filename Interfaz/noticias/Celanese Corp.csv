0;CE;Celanese Corp;2009-05-04T21:56:07Z;Hopes for end to inventory cuts grow;;European companies are hailing a possible end of the vicious round of cuts in inventory levels as a sign that customer demand could be stabilising despite the ongoing global recession.The turn in the inventory cycle is due to be reached in the next two months in industries as diverse as mobile phones, steel and consumer goods and that should lead to a rise in sales, according to some executives.“We think the worst in destocking is over and we see better selling opportunities in the second quarter,” said Harold Goddijn, chief executive of TomTom, the struggling Dutch maker of satellite navigation devices.Richard Simonson, finance director of Nokia, said last week at its first-quarter results: “The massive destocking in inventory is largely complete.”Lakshmi Mittal, chief executive of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, also said he expected destocking to be completed by the end of June and sales should rise after that.Celanese, the US chemicals company with operations in Europe, said it thought most destocking had taken place throughout the supply chain except perhaps in the automotive and electronics sectors.However, other companies think the speed and depth of the destocking – the cutting of inventory throughout the supply chain – is such that any rebound will only be temporary as underlying demand remains weak. Some executives point out that some customers have cut inventory levels by so much that they may need to restock just to return to normal amounts of stock.Jürgen Hambrecht, chief executive of BASF, the world’s biggest chemicals maker, said: “We don’t consider temporary topping up of inventories in some regions and industries to be signs of a sustainable upturn.”Destocking has damaged the results of companies from Pernod Ricard and ArcelorMittal to BASF and TomTom as customers and suppliers have cut their orders dramatically.Chris Williamson, chief economist of Markit, which compiles purchasing manager data from around Europe, said recent surveys had pointed to record rates of destocking but also a belief that it would soon end.He added: “There is a turning point for destocking in sight and there should be a rise in demand. But whether beyond that inventory correction there is anything more sustainable is unknown and questionable.”
1;CE;Celanese Corp;2007-09-18T08:11:30Z;Mergers and acquisitions: Deals hit a record high;;Consolidation has been progressing at a steady pace but last year marked a record for mergers and acquisitions in terms of deal size.The largest deals included Linde’s acquisition of BOC group, the industrial gases company, for £8.2bn in March 2006 followed by BASF’s June acquisition of Engelhard, the US manufacturer of catalysts, for $5.6bn. (Click here for a list of the world’s top 50 chemicals companies)Out of the top 10 deals, almost half the buyers came from the world of private equity. They included BC Partners, the Carlyle Group, Advent, Apollo, CVC and Blackstone.“Chemical companies are attractive on account of their cash positions and the assets are cheap compared with other sectors,” says one analyst. “Private equity saw an opportunity to buy assets when the industrial buyers were just not as interested.”Indeed, private equity groups accounted for roughly 50 per cent of global mergers and acquisitions volumes in chemicals last year, against just 5 per cent in 2000.Yet private equity is not a natural buyer in the industry, say industry observers, as the asset fundamentals of a business are complicated.John Cole, private equity partner at Ernst & Young, says: “Knowledge does help in this industry. These are complex businesses with margins that are not easy to follow. They are capital-intensive and you have got to get to grips with the raw material cycle.”During the 1990s the sector was not really on private equity’s radar but it suddenly became fashionable.“When the tech bubble burst, it prompted a flurry of activity in this sector as private equity focused attention on old economy instead,” says one industry observer.“This rush may have meant that some investments were made in unnecessary haste,” he adds.The industry, by and large, appears not to have overpaid for the chemicals assets on its books. Private equity has paid an average multiple of 9.5 times ebitda, slightly less than strategic acquirers and there have been some very good exits in the sector.Companies that have listed on the public markets include Celanese, the US chemicals company. Blackstone raised $800m through the initial public offering and retains a controlling stake in the companyWhile Blackstone was forced to cut its offer price it still managed to turn Celanese around in just 10 months and secured what analysts view as one of the most profitable private equity investments in recent years.Symrise, the flavours and fragrances business formed by the Sweden-based investment fund EQT, also took the path to flotation in December, raising €1.4bn.KKR listed Rockwood, which raised $408m with the offering after it priced below its target range.There have also been some successful deals in the secondary market including Bain’s sale of chemical logistics giant Brenntag to BC Partners for about $4bn.But while many of these deals have been solid, there has been a distinct absence of IPOs and a relatively small number of second-phase deals this year.Observers point out that assets have been sitting on the balance sheets of private equity companies during an interest-rate cycle when financing costs were low.“The private equity firms have refinanced and taken dividends. Things are OK but there is not much equity left in these assets,” says one banker.But there is now a danger that the backlog of exits is building up at the same time as the industry comes to the end of the upside in the cycle.“Private equity firms that have not successfully restructured their assets could be at risk if the industry cycle starts to point downward and merger and acquisition activity slows down,” says another banker.“What private equity does with these assets is the $64,000 question. From a buyer’s perspective they are not very attractive. Many of them are going to have to hold on to the companies and improve them, and that is a hard slog.”Eric Chapman, global chemicals industry lead at Accenture, also believes that private equity’s commitment to investing in chemicals in the long run will be put to the test in the coming downturn, as cash falls and the longer-term investments needed for a successful exit create an even higher cash-drain.“During the downturn, the focus will shift to cost-savings, minimising capital investment and waiting until the next burst of activity in the up-cycle. Whether private equity’s focus on the longer-term will break this investment cycle remains to be seen,” says Mr Chapman.“Our research into the chemical industry shows that focusing on the fundamentals over the mid-term pays off in higher returns.“With a longer-term view, sources of cash outside own earnings and a focus on value, private equity investments retain a potential for above-average returns – if the owners have the patience and risk appetite to stick with their investment and exit plans.”Research carried out by Accenture suggests that the cycle will hit a downturn in late 2008, give or take a quarter, that the buying phase is now reaching the crest, and that the window for exits will shortly close.“This means private equity firms now face a period of stability in this area – they must either hold and improve value in the next two to four years, before we see a return to high levels of IPO activity. The alternative will be that they sell during the downcycle at a substantial loss.” says Mr Chapman.Jonathan Tyler, director of chemicals corporate finance at Houlihan Lokey, the US investment bank, stresses that under this scenario, the corporate strategic buyers could again enjoy a period of strength in bidding situations.“This would be driven by both less aggressive leverage models and the ability to capture operational synergies,” he says.
2;CE;Celanese Corp;2006-07-11T10:04:27Z;Linde BOC deal on track despite lawsuit;;Linde, the German conglomerate that is taking over the British industrial gases group BOC for £8.2bn, on Tuesday reassured investors that the merger was on track to take place in the third quarter following news that a $960m lawsuit has been lodged against BOC.A spokesperson for Linde said the complaint, filed by Celanese Corp in the US, will not affect the acquisition in any way.“Completion of the offer is still expected to take place in the third calendar quarter of 2006,” said the spoksperson.Earlier on Tuesday, BOC said Celanese, the Dallas-based producer of industrial chemicals, has filed a complaint against it in a Texas district court over the development of an acetic acid manufacturing plant in China.Celanese and its Chinese subsidiary, Celanese (Nanjing) Chemical are seeking $960m in damages, including $250m in compensatory damages.Further details of the lawsuit were unavailable, with BOC saying it has yet to be served the complaint.However, industry watchers said the suit appeared to stem from a contract that Celanese claimed to have signed with BOC two years ago, under which the UK group was to supply carbon monoxide to Celanese’s Nanjing facility.Celanese for its part declined to elaborate on the suit but sources close to BOC said the contract was terminated by mutual agreement in 2005.BOC, which currently supplies oxgyen and nitrogen gas to a Celanese plant in Clear Lake, Texas, called the case “without merit” and said it would “vigorously defend it.”In its statement, the group also drew attention to the timing of the suit, suggesting perhaps that Celanese was trying to derail its merger with Linde.Linde, which confirmed that it would take over BOC in a £16-a-share deal in March, rose 1 per cent to €62.64 in afternoon trade in Frankfurt, while BOC shares dipped 0.1 per cent to £15.86 in London.

4;CE;Celanese Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
