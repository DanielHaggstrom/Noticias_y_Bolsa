The “updated” contract sets out terms until 2025 and Serco said it will provide the MoD with greater flexibility to vary the terms, including pricing. There will be regular price reviews, with the first due to take place in 2019.Following the latest negotiations there will also be changes to the structure of the AWE Management joint venture company, which is contracted to manage the development, maintenance and manufacture of warheads for the UK’s nuclear deterrent. Lockheed Martin will become the majority shareholder in the JV and Serco and Jacobs have agreed to adjust their holdings from 33.3 per cent previously to 24.5 per cent.Mr Soames said:I am delighted that the UK Government has chosen to secure the operation and management of the Atomic Weapons Establishment through AWE ML, and that Serco will continue to play a central role in supporting a vital component of our national security and scientific expertise.
1;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2012-01-11T19:37:38Z;Investors embrace activist role;;US companies face being drawn into a bitter election year contest, as shareholder activism takes on a more overtly political tone and executives come under heightened scrutiny over pay and their accountability to investors.Companies now face challenges across the spectrum, from the protests of Occupy Wall Street, to a campaign by Bernie Sanders, the independent Senator for Vermont, for a constitutional amendment to restrict their ability to spend unlimited amounts on political causes.“American corporations today are like the great European monarchies of yore,” said Robert Monks, a shareholder activist and corporate governance adviser, in an article for the Harvard Law School last week.He argued that corporations have captured the United States – “its judiciary, its political system, and its national wealth, without assuming any of the responsibilities of dominion”, and that institutional shareholders must assert their duty to oversee the companies in which they invest.Pointing to excessive executive pay as just the “smoking gun”, he also highlighted the closure of defined benefit schemes that have transferred retirement risk to workers, the lobbying power of corporate interests and the removal of property to offshore holdings “where it is neither regulated nor taxed”.John Wilcox of Sodali, a governance consultancy, also sees challenges ahead in 2012: “All the principal players – shareholders, regulators, companies and boards – are under pressure to change in fundamental ways,” he said.Pay is already under the microscope after the 2011 round of annual meetings, when new regulations as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation required all companies to hold shareholder votes on compensation for the first time.Florida’s state pension board, the fourth largest public plan in the US, has already sent letters to the 37 companies in the Russell 3000 – including Hewlett-Packard, Jacobs Engineering and Stanley Black & Decker – which failed to receive majority support in such votes.The letter asked for the board’s reaction to the vote and to explain “what changes, if any, are planned to reform existing compensation practices”.Also likely to be controversial will be campaigns over “proxy access”. New rules allow shareholders to press for the right to nominate candidates for board membership on the proxy voting materials distributed to shareholders ahead of annual meetings.Norges Bank Investment Management, manager of the $550bn Norwegian government pension fund, has filed shareholder proposals for proxy access at six US companies for the first time.“Board members must be held accountable,” said Anne Kvam, head of ownership policy at NBIM. “When they fail to meet our expectations, we as shareholders should be able to propose alternatives without incurring prohibitively high costs.”Long an aim of corporate governance activists, new SEC rules designed to enforce such access for shareholders were defeated in court last year by the US Chamber of Commerce, which challenged the cost benefit analysis undertaken by the regulator in designing the regulations.However, the SEC has allowed individual shareholders to press for proxy access at a company by company level, leading to a free-for-all to set rules such as how large or longstanding a shareholder must be to gain access, and what costs the company must cover.Charles Elson, head of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, advocates reimbursement for all the cost of solicitation – the public relations, travel and advertising costs associated with mounting a proxy campaign – but only when shareholders approve the action.Simple proxy access, by comparison, merely pays for the cost of printing and distributing voting materials to shareholders, not the advocacy that accompanies it.“The problem with access is who gets to use it,” he said. The Chamber of Commerce, for instance, argued that it would be abused by unions and narrow special interest groups.“I think it’s more democratic and ultimately allows the shareholders themselves to differentiate between effective and non-effective proxy contests,” said Mr Elson. Health South is the only large company to adopt the measure so far, however, and shareholders still face an uphill battle to win access, and from there to police corporate behaviour.
2;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2011-11-15T22:15:10Z;Hopes for a new Italian government drive Wall Street;Strong retail data limit losses;"A flurry of positive economic data edged US stocks into positive territory on Tuesday, before traders seized on good news from Europe to give the rally momentum during the afternoon.Jacobs Engineering and Varian Medical Systems were the star performers in the S&P 500.Jacobs jumped 7.9 per cent to $41.17 after the construction group said it had ended the third quarter with a backlog of orders totalling $14.3bn. Varian was up 6.2 per cent to $60.60 after JPMorgan analysts told clients the German conglomerate Siemens would exit radiation therapy treatments, allowing Varian to gain market share.The S&P 500 finished the day at 1,257.81, on solid gains of 0.5 per cent. Trading had been volatile until midday when news that Italian prime minister-designate Mario Monti may form a government as soon as Wednesday triggered a decisive rally.“US markets have been given a reprieve for now,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But that could be reversed in a second if there is bad news from Europe.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 1,257.81.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.1 per cent to 2,686.2, with support from Apple, by far its most heavily weighted stock.Apple shares rose 2.5 per cent to $388.83 after ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall told clients he expected the company to initiate a dividend policy next year. Apple has not paid a dividend since 1995, according to Bloomberg data.Retail sales figures rose 0.5 per cent month on month in October, but that was not enough to stop
a host of bellwether retail names falling on results releases.Walmart was off 2.4 per cent to $57.46 despite reporting US sales growth for the first time in nine quarters.Sales were driven by discounting that hurt margins, driving profit 3 per cent lower than in the same quarter of 2010 to $3.3bn.“Walmart investors have become accustomed to earnings beats,” said David Shick, head of consumer research at Stifel Nicolaus. “But the company is correct to focus on expanding market share at the expense of the bottom line in the short term.”Walmart’s size and exposure to thrifty consumers have made it a favourite of defensive investors this year and it remains one of the best performers in the S&P 500.Urban Outfitters fell sharply in early trading, before riding the afternoon rally, to end the day up 0.1 per cent to $26.85. Many analysts were alarmed by the level of unsold inventory held at the quarter’s end, a concern that Jeff Black at Citigroup played down.“The stance to the end of the fourth quarter with inventory better aligned with sales reinforces our view that Urban’s margin trough is confined to the second half of 2011,” Mr Black wrote to clients.Office equipment store Staples fell 3.6 per cent to $14.81 on anaemic sales growth of just 0.5 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. Barclays Capital analysts noted, however, that in local currency terms revenue was up 7 per cent year on year.Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $38.07 despite beating analyst expectations with earnings per share of 60 cents. Sears Holdings dropped 3.1 per cent to $70.03 after its Canadian namesake – in which it holds a 90 per cent stake – posted a loss of C$45.8m.The focus on retailers took the heat off bank stocks with the financial sector of the S&P 500 gaining 0.4 per cent, despite another sharp rise in the yields of Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds.Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $28.02 on reports that a host of hedge fund investors, including John Paulson, had cut their stakes in the bank during the third quarter.High-profile investor flight also hurt professional networking website LinkedIn, which slipped 4.8 per cent to $74.86, on news Bain Capital will sell its entire stake of 3.71m shares, when the newly floated company’s lock-out period ends.PepsiCo was boosted by news that activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken a $146m stake. The stock was up 2.7 per cent to $64.50 on hopes that Mr Peltz will push the board to boost shareholder returns.Quanta Services climbed 2.2 per cent to $19.19, on renewed hope that the Keystone XL pipeline, for which Quanta has a lucrative service contract, will be given the go-ahead if the state of Nebraska’s environmental concerns can be addressed.The hard drive manufacturer Western Digital Corporation slipped 4.9 per cent to $25.05 as the open-ended impact of widespread flooding in Thailand on its factories led another analyst to downgrade the stock."
3;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2011-10-02T03:39:09Z;Calls mount for action on executive pay awards;UK directors’ remuneration has jumped, outstripping company performance;Escalating executive pay levels and the mismatch between remuneration and company performance are causing increasing concern among shareholders, regulators, the general public and even politicians.Last month a report by the UK’s independent High Pay Commission pushed the issue further into the spotlight. It showed that monetary and share-based rewards for FTSE 350 directors grew rapidly in the past 10 years, outstripping company performance.Proposals and guidelines to address concerns at national and European Union level are under way but commentators say institutional investors still need to play a bigger role to tackle pay awards in the companies in which they invest.Last week the Association of British Insurers updated its guidance on pay, focusing on the size of company directors’ pay packages and the role of boards and shareholders. This comes as companies begin their annual discussions on pay deals with shareholders.“We have tried to simplify our guidance, making more direct recommendations and aim to give directors a clear idea of what shareholders expect on remuneration,” says Marc Jobling, assistant director of corporate governance at the ABI.The body warns company boards they must understand that excessive or undeserved remuneration undermines efficient operation and is not aligned to shareholder interests. It says remuneration committees should look at executive pay in the context of corporate performance and in terms of overall pay deals and costs to shareholders.On the political front, Vince Cable, UK business secretary, recently waded in to the controversy, attacking pay-outs for failure. Government proposals, in a consultation paper, look at whether a binding vote for shareholders on deciding pay should be introduced in the UK, as in the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, and at having employee representation on remuneration committees. Shareholders currently have an advisory vote.Ed Miliband, UK opposition leader, also added his weight last week at the Labour party conference, saying it was time “to end cosy cartels of the way top pay is set in our economy”, and supporting Mr Cable’s proposal of including an employee on remuneration boards.Such proposals and guidance are welcome, says Louise Rouse, director of engagement at FairPensions, which campaigns for responsible investment. She believes a binding shareholder vote on remuneration “would give investors more empowerment and encourage more engagement with companies in advance of an annual general meeting. Companies would not like to see pay packages rejected”, she says.However, Ms Rouse is quick to add “it is now time for shareholders to do something. It is very much in the interest of pension funds to step up action on remuneration.” She cannot understand how shareholders failed to see that directors’ earnings in FTSE 350 companies doubled in the past 10 years with bonuses growing by 187 per cent while companies’ market value stagnated. “We are seeing ever spiralling pay for executives not in touch with reality and paying for failure,” she says.In the Netherlands, one of the first countries to introduce a binding shareholder vote on remuneration in 2004, Rients Abma, executive director of Eumedion, the Dutch corporate governance forum for institutional investors, says there is “a better relation between pay and performance and better dialogue [between shareholders and companies] but only since 2008”.Given about 75 per cent of Dutch-listed companies are owned by foreign shareholders, change was not immediate but making the vote mandatory led to an up-front increase in transparency on remuneration, Mr Abma adds.He points to the say-on-pay regime resulting in several landmark cases, the first in 2008, when shareholders at Philips Electronics general meeting rejected a proposal to change the long-term incentive plan, largely because the supervisory board wanted to remove the performance criteria for granting stock options.Shareholder rejection of executive pay packages at other quoted companies followed. “This is the power of a binding vote,” says Mr Abma. “If shareholders in UK companies vote down a remuneration package they have no legal power as it is only an advisory vote.”Not everyone is convinced a mandatory vote is the right way to go. George Dallas, corporate governance director at F&C Investments, believes “if you put the onus [of remuneration policy] on shareholders it lets off remuneration committees”.“As investors we do not want to micro-manage a company but to make sure the board is working for us,” he adds. He agrees that “sometimes investors need to make their positions better known to a company but without taking over”, a view shared by the ABI, where he is on the investment committee, and part of the working group that drafted the new guidelines.UK shareholders are far from alone in lacking a mandatory vote. In the US, where votes on pay are also non-binding, shareholders have been using new say-on-pay rules to protest against excessive executive remuneration, putting company decisions under pressure at a swathe of companies, including Hewlett-Packard and Jacobs Engineering.So why are US shareholders flexing their muscles more than their UK counterparts? Ms Rouse puts it down to cultural differences. “Traditionally there is a reluctance in the UK to vote against management. Shareholders prefer to work with them [through engagement] rather than vote against them. But shareholders need to understand dissent is not aggressive behaviour and can bring about change as in the US,” she says.
4;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2011-04-25T20:32:55Z;Talking cure eases remuneration tension;;"It is fashionable on Wall Street to malign the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation as a rushed piece of lawmaking likely to cause multiple, unfortunate, unintended consequences.Yet one of the few provisions of the bill to affect the broader corporate world, the introduction of new “say on pay” rules, appears to be having an immediate effect on the traditionally adversarial relationship between shareholders and corporate executives.“Both sides are reporting that they are talking more to one another, and investors like that, they want to hear from the companies, for the companies to explain what they are doing and why they did what they did,” said Robin Ferracone, head of Farient Advisors, a consultancy.Dodd-Frank requires companies to hold non-binding shareholder votes at their annual meetings on executive pay programmes, on the frequency of future say-on-pay votes and on “golden parachutes” – payments to executives in the event that the company is sold.Initially these votes were regarded as of little consequence since companies could technically ignore the result.Attention instead focused on the procedural matter of how often the vote should be held, and the challenge investors face in considering the sheer volume of proposals.“Say on pay threatened to suck all the oxygen out of the room this proxy season,” said Patrick McGurn of proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.But the advisory nature of the vote appears to have actually encouraged its use.“Most investors report that the non-binding nature of the Say on Pay vote gives them a ‘hall pass’ to express their discontent, without severe consequences to the directors or the employees,” said Ms Ferracone.So far Jacobs Engineering, Beazer Homes, Shuffle Master, Hewlett-Packard, Ameron International and Stanley Black & Decker have been subject to “no” votes on say on pay.In most cases the cause appears to be poor performance, with a study by ClearBridge Compensation Group of the first 30 votes at Fortune 500 companies finding a clear link between shareholder returns over three years and voting patterns.But the study, which examined proxy materials – the documents sent to investors ahead of annual meetings – published by the first 100 large companies, found companies already responding to investor
concerns.Potential compensation, the overall package available to executives if targets are hit, actually appears to be falling.“A few companies, including General Electric, took this disclosure a step further by including a summary of the compensation programme and why shareholders should vote for it at the very beginning of the proxy statement,” said Russ Miller, partner at ClearBridge.More companies also appear to be talking to investors pre-emptively.“It’s not a magic bullet,” said Tim Smith of Waldon Asset Management, a prominent advocate of socially responsible investing. “But the acoustics in the dialogue are changing, expanding and deepening those exchanges.” Historically, corporate governance has been pitched as a battle between shareholders and management. Indeed, another Dodd-Frank reform – proxy access rules – are tied up in court. These force companies to distribute as part of their own proxy materials rival candidates for directorships proposed by activist investors. This vastly reduces the cost of challenging a board. The US Chamber of Commerce has criticised the rules, arguing that they will be abused by special interest groups.Such clashes contrast with shareholder behaviour in countries where the opportunity for investors to make advisory votes on pay are long-established. In the UK, for example, companies very often consult investors before potentially controversial changes to head off any pay revolt.Improved communication may also diminish the role of proxy advisers such as ISS and Glass Lewis.“It’s healthy,” said Ms Ferracone. “It’s like instead of talking to a marriage counsellor, we’re communicating directly and that’s much better than having an intermediary there interpreting everything.”Additional reporting by Alison Smith"
5;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2009-11-17T21:49:47Z;Late rally lifts US stocks;;"Wall Street clung on to its gains from the previous session’s rally in spite of a downbeat statement from Home Depot on Tuesday.After spending most of the day in the red, the S&P 500 pushed higher in the last hour of trading and closed up 0.1 per cent at a new 13-month high of 1,110.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,437.42 and the Nasdaq also edged 0.3 per cent higher to 2,203.78.Soaring oil prices lifted US stocks on Monday to close at their highest level since October last year.But the consumer discretionary sector weighed on the market on Tuesday after retailers remained cautious about the upcoming holiday season.Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain in the US, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook on Tuesday after fighting to cut costs in the face of weaker demand. The shares fell 2.4 per cent to $26.99 after the retailer warned the housing market was still under pressure. The sector has been badly hit in the recession because homeowners have spent less on their existing properties and the frozen housing market has reduced the need for renovation projects.On Monday, Lowe’s, the second-largest player in the sector, had posted a 30 per cent decline in profits and said it did not expect a market recovery to start until the middle of next year.“The numbers were pretty decent but the problem for the market is that there are a lot of high expectations,” said Brett Hawkins, portfolio manager at Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley.“The underlying problem is that total credit is still contracting and we’re recovering off a really low base. To get people to really drive the market higher from here there has to
be some evidence that
we’re really reflating as an economy.”Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the US, also reported third-quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations. However, the shares fell 3 per cent to $48.77 after the group said it remained cautious about the upcoming few months.At the other end of the consumer market, Saks, the upmarket department store chain, swung to a net profit after analysts had been expecting continuing losses.While cost-cutting was the main reason for the reversal in the retailer’s fortunes, the company said it had also seen customers starting to spend more in the jewellery and women’s designer sportswear departments. Its shares were up 4.1 per cent to $6.67.Dillard’s, the department store chain based in Texas and Florida, also returned to the black in the third quarter thanks to a tax benefit and cost cutting. Analysts had forecast worse results and the shares rose 8.9 per cent at $14.51.Jacobs Engineering the country’s second-largest publicly traded engineering company, reported a bigger drop in quarterly profit than expected.The group said it had suffered from the cancellation of one big oil and gas project. Its shares fell 14.5 per cent to $38.88.Jacobs’ results added to the pessimism in the sector after data showed industrial production in October was lower than expected.Smith International, the oilfield contractor, lost 12.7 per cent to $26.89 after offering 28m shares in an effort to pay back debt and fund acquisitions. The company has suffered from a sharp decline in the US natural gas market, prompting it to cut almost one fifth of its workforce. Profits during the third quarter fell
97 per cent, the group said last month.Playboy shareholders suffered some of the biggest losses. Shares in the magazine publisher slid 14.2 per cent to $4.10 after Linda Havard, the company’s chief financial officer, resigned late on Monday.Applied Materials, the world’s biggest tool provider for the semiconductor industry, agreed to buy Semitool for $364m in cash.It said the acquisition would allow it to produce smaller and more powerful chips for use in smartphones and notebook computers. Semitool shares rose 31.2 per cent to $11.02 but Applied Materials slipped 0.9 per cent to $12.94.Shares in Palm, which produces smartphones, rose 5.8 per cent to $12.54 after Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”."
6;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2009-06-19T21:38:50Z;Strikes jeopardise big projects, warns IoD;;Business leaders fear that work on projects such as new power stations and London’s Crossrail scheme could be jeopardised unless the engineering construction industry can sort out its industrial relations.The warning came as talks to resolve a dispute at Total’s Lindsey oil refinery in Lincolnshire – where 647 workers have been sacked after staging an unofficial strike over job losses for more than a week – failed to take place.Union leaders said they and officials from Acas, the conciliation service, waited four hours on Friday before being told that Total “no longer felt the need” to meet.Acas said: “After discussions between Total management and their contractors, they decided not to go ahead with the talks.”Total, which has given the workers until Monday to reapply for their jobs, said negotiations could not take place while it was faced with an illegal dispute. The company said it hoped to talk to Acas again next week.The group’s tough stance appeared to be an effort to draw a line after repeated walkouts this year. Sympathy stoppages took place on Friday by 2,500 staff at eight power stations and petrochemical sites.Shaw and Jacobs, the two main Lindsey subcontractors, fired striking workers while others opted not to, suggesting divisions among employers. About 1,200 employees building a £200m desulphurisation plant that would expand the refinery’s capacity are involved.Alistair Tebbit, head of EU employment affairs at of the Institute of Directors, said: “With a host of vital infrastructure projects under way or in the pipeline, it is deeply worrying that we are seeing more and more illegal strike action taking place in the construction sector. It is completely unacceptable for trade unions to use walkouts as a way of strong-arming employers. The law is clear – there must be an official ballot before there can be a strike.”Even without disputes, the industry faces a huge task to deliver projects including a new generation of nuclear power stations. Its training board estimates a shortage of 35,000 skilled manual and white-collar workers by 2014, which suggests thousands more foreign staff will be needed.Unemployment is a big factor behind the disputes. This is a cyclical industry and 25-30 per cent of the 30,000 workers are jobless after projects dried up in recent months. There are more than 1,500 foreign workers on UK sites, which has fuelled the stoppages – although the current one does not directly involve overseas labour.Sympathy stoppages by contract workers were reported on Friday at six power stations as well as the Ensus biofuels site at Wilton, in Teesside, and Shell’s Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire. ConocoPhillips said its Humber refinery was not affected.
7;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2009-06-19T17:43:10Z;Refinery sackings spark sympathy walk-outs;;The sacking of 647 striking workers at an oil refinery has sparked a wave of sympathy walk-outs across England and Wales and raised the stakes in a long-running battle between employers and workers in the construction industry.Subcontractors at Total’s Lindsey oil refinery in Lincolnshire fired the workers after they refused to end a week’s unofficial stoppage over redundancies. The dispute began when 51 people lost their jobs last week, a move the strikers claim broke a local agreement to offer them other jobs on site. Total says there is no agreement.Shaw and Jacobs, the two main subcontractors, fired their striking workers while others opted not to, suggesting divisions among employers. About 1,200 employees building a £200m desulphurisation plant that would expand the refinery’s capacity are involved.Union officials condemned the sackings but agreed with Total to hold talks mediated by Acas, the arbitration service.But Acas said on Friday afternoon that proposed talks had been cancelled. “We were invited by Total management …but after discussions between Total and their subcontractors they decided not to go ahead with the talks. We remain in touch with the parties,” it said.A Total spokeswoman said: “Total has always been committed to fair, responsible settlement that leads to the safeguarding of Lindsey oil refinery.”However, she added that “these negotiations cannot take place whilst faced with an illegal dispute”.It is the third walk-out at Lindsey since January, when the hiring of Italian and Portuguese contractors there sparked wildcat strikes across the country.Workers at several power stations and refineries, including the Ensus biofuels site on Teesside, Shell’s Stanlow refinery in Cheshire and Aberthaw power station in south Wales, have come out in support.Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said: “Total has not tried to resolve this dispute, it has sought to escalate it and … to victimise people.“I’m appealing to Total to actually come to the table and help the unions resolve it.”Unite and the GMB, which represent most workers in the industry, cannot endorse unofficial action. However, this month they announced a national strike ballot over pay and conditions.It would cover about 30,000 scaffolders, laggers, pipefitters and other tradesmen who move from contract to contract around the country, not the operators of refineries and power stationsThe protests have not affected the plants concerned, but an official strike could do so as other workers may be reluctant to cross picket lines.A spokeswoman for Total said the company was open to dialogue but that work on the new project could not be delayed any longer.“This situation had to come to a head if they were going to encourage the contractors to go back to work,” she said.“If the employees are willing to return to work they will be able to reapply for their jobs on Monday.” Terms and conditions would be set by subcontractors, she said.The spokeswoman said that there were always fluctuations in demand for workers as contracts ended and new ones began.Skilled workers, who typically earn £650-£700 a week on contracts, recently received a 5.8 per cent increase in the final stage of a three-year deal. However, the recession and recent trend to hire foreign workers has highlighted job insecurity.Downing Street condemned the unofficial strike action.
8;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry.

The stake was put up for sale last year after ministers decided to break up BNFL, the state-owned group, which included AWE.The sale of the Aldermaston facility to Jacobs is likely to reignite controversy over the independence of the UK’s deterrent.The US already supplies the technology for the weapons but it was the recognition that the UK needed an independent nuclear deterrent after the second world war which prompted the government to develop the facility.However, there was no announcement from the government, which was accused of turning the matter into “a farce”.BNFL only put up a short statement on its website Thursday afternoon confirming the sale. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform had no official comment.Gerald Howarth, shadow defence minister, described the decision not to announce the sale to parliament as “unacceptable”.“It is consistent with the government’s unwillingness to share matters nuclear with parliament.“It is not an issue about which we can be cavalier. We need to know what the implications are of this.”Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: “The government appears guilty of concealing all this from parliament and the public. There has been a huge degree of suspicion over what has been going on at Aldermaston, particularly over recruitment and how this fits with our obligations under the non-proliferation treaty.“None of this has been properly explained. Why are we bothering with the fiction of being independent and separate from the US when this is clearly not the case? It sounds to me like this is turning into a farce.”AWE is jointly owned by the government, through its stake in BNFL; Serco, the British support services group; and Lockheed Martin, the US defence company.Jacobs had been competing against another US engineer, Fluor Corporation, for the stake since January. The US company did not disclose the purchase price but estimates in January valued it at £100m ($150m).Bob King, officer of the Prospect union for AWE, said Jacobs was well-known to staff and he hoped the company would provide some financial stability.But politically he admitted it was “a sad day” that Britain’s nuclear deterrent was now majority US controlled."

Private equity investors are also looking at the asset.First Reserve refused to comment.Brand Energy, the largest provider of scaffolding equipment in North America, performs tasks for oil refiners, chemical manufacturers and construction groups that range from painting and fireproofing to laying concrete.Its competitors include ThyssenKrupp, Jacobs Engineering, Foster Wheeler and Harsco.First Reserve bought the company from JPMorgan Partners in early 2007, and quickly led it through a string of acquisitions of smaller competitors.If First Reserve sells or lists Brand Energy in the forseeable future, it will have owned it for a shorter period of time than buy-out firms generally tend to own companies.If Georgia-based Brand Energy is sold to another private equity investor this year – a deal that would have been considered relatively small in 2007 – it could rank as the sixth largest US buy-out of 2008.A ceiling on the amount of high-yield debt available to finance any one private equity purchase is still putting deals worth more than $4bn or $5bn out of reach.Vestar’s recent $1.45bn deal to buy the North American detergents business of Unilever and an Apax-led group’s $1.37bn purchase of TriZetto rank within throwing distance of Brand Energy’s potential value.Deal activity between energy giants this year has stayed relatively light, as they debate the merits of broad diversification and fret over the steep discounts to net asset value at which some companies in the sector are now trading.Acquirers are focusing significant attention, however, on energy services companies – whose businesses have boomed as their clients explore more complicated and costly ways to drill for oil and natural gas.A private equity consortium beat Halliburton this year with a bid to pay $3.6bn for Expro International.First Reserve has made several forays into oilfield services, including its deal early this year to buy CHC Helicopter, which runs helicopter flights to offshore oil and gas rigs.
11;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2008-01-10T02:14:28Z;Atomic body set for US control;;The UK Atomic Weapons Establishment, which manages the Aldermaston weapons site on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, is set to come under the control of US companies.Fluor and Jacobs, two US engineering groups, have emerged as the only remaining bidders for the government’s one-third stake in AWE, which it put up for sale last summer.AWE is jointly owned by the government, through its stake in British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), Serco, the British support services group, and Lockheed Martin, the US defence group. If either Fluor or Jacobs emerges as victorious, AWE will be two-thirds owned by US companies.AWE is responsible for designing, manufacturing and decommissioning nuclear warheads for Trident, the fleet of nuclear submarines that is the UK’s sole nuclear deterrent.Although the US already supplies the technology for the weapons, the prospect that the deterrent may end up majority-controlled by Americans is likely to prove controversial.The recognition that the UK needed an independent nuclear deterrent after the second world war prompted the government to develop the facility. In 1946 Ernest Bevin, then foreign secretary, declared: “We have got to have this thing over here whatever it costs …we have got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.”Under a 25-year contract awarded to the AWE consortium in 2000, if one of the three parties wants to sell, the other two have pre-emption rights to acquire the stake at market rate.Both Serco and Lockheed have said they are keen to pick up the stake, but it is understood that the MoD would prefer it to go to a third party in order to inject more knowhow into the business. Latest estimates value the stake at about £100m ($195m, €133m).Serco said: “We are in discussions with the MoD about how best to achieve the sale of the BNFL shareholding and how to continue to successfully deliver the AWE programme.”The sale of AWE is part of the government’s plan to privatise all nuclear assets that were in public ownership. So far, foreign companies have been among the most successful in snapping up assets, sparking fears that Britain could lose valuable industry skills in the longer-term.Toshiba, the Japanese company, bought Westinghouse, BNFL’s nuclear reactor manufacturing arm, in 2006. America’s Energy Solutions won the contract to run and decommission the UK’s 10 Magnox reactors.A government spokesman declined to comment on the identity of the shortlisted bidders but said: “Any bidder would need to satisfy MoD stringent security performance requirements.”BNFL said: “We can’t comment on market speculation.”Investment bank NM Rothschild is handling the sale of the AWE stake on behalf of BNFL. A final decision on the disposal is expected in March.
12;J;Jacobs Engineering Group Inc;2007-05-28T19:40:43Z;Save lives and make money along the way;;"The other day a friend of mine asked me to do a favour for her. She had just sold a house and had some money to put to work. She asked me to sit with her while the financial adviser at the bank gave her his suggestions.I didn’t really want to do it. First off, I’m too busy writing important columns for the Financial Times. Second, I like to be liked and I knew the instant I walked in that office with her that the financial adviser would hate me. Not fun, but I did it anyway.We got to the guy’s office and “Hank” (not his real name) suggested she put all her money in the AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth Fund. He said that AllianceBernstein was the best, and that Large Cap Growth was where it was going to be at over the next year.Here is my opinion of these things: you have to ask three questions:
●What is it going to cost me in fees, and do they have a similar option with lower fees?
●What is the overall concept on the market (in this case, “Large Cap Growth”) or on asset allocation and diversification?
●What is the best vehicle for getting me there (does anyone have “alpha” or can I just use a low-cost ETF?).So I asked, “is there a load to this fund?” Meaning, do you have to give money out of your pocket for just walking in the door? The answer was: “Yes, 4.25 per cent.”My question then was: “Is there a no-load version?” And he replied with lie number one: “No.” But then, a minute or so later, on further drilling, he said, “Yes, but there’s a lot of other fees.” So we looked at it and there were some fees but not so bad.So I asked: “Can we get a no-fee version by doing a wrap account?” In other words, paying 1 per cent on assets and getting no loads or fees on any of the professional managers recommended by the bank. Then came lie number two: Again, it was at first a big “no” (you had to be “qualified”) but then it turned out my friend was qualified.I have no opinions on large-cap growth. Whatever. But I wanted to see statistics on how AllianceBernstein did relative to a large cap growth benchmark. Such as an exchange-traded fund (DIA, for instance). That led to lie number three: “ETFs are a lot more volatile. You’re better off with professional managers such as AllianceBernstein.”It turns out, on further research, that this particular fund had underperformed fairly consistently over the past eight years. My friend ended up doing a wrap account and being spread out in a diversified manner among various quality funds. I would have suggested one step further, and not waste time or money on the wrap account but, altogether, my friend saved a few percentage points on the load fees and got into a nice set of diversified funds at little or no fees.Now let us move on to more important topics such as solving global warming, bringing clean water to cities and protecting the planet against pandemics. I can help with those things also. There are three problems: the world is getting warmer every day. Heck, I’m sweating as I write this. The supply of clean water on the planet is staying constant but the number of people who need it (by virtue of the increasing populations in the cities of emerging economies) is growing. And every day the risk of a global pandemic increases.Global warming: the best thing we can do is buy the stocks of companies that make clean car technologies. Borg Warner, with technology straight out of Star Trek, makes more than 80 per cent of its revenues from technologies that increase the fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of cars. Magna International, uses its hydroforming technology to make lighter cars. We can also clean up some pollution by investing in Foster-Wheeler, which helps power plants cut sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.Clean water: let’s start off with Calgon Carbon Corporation. Their products are used to get organic compounds (bacteria) from water and any other liquids. They are making the shift to profitability this year. Next, I like Jacobs Engineering and even General Electric – both companies have subsidiaries that help countries and cities with clean water treatment of polluted or potentially polluted areas. Tetra Tech also derives more than 80 per cent of its revenues from clean water treatment and environmental clean-ups.Global pandemics: both Vical and Endo Pharma are developing vaccines for bird flu and other virulent strains of the flu. Let us also throw in Valeant Pharma for working on cures for Parkinson’s Disease (not strictly a pandemic but it affects more people as we all live longer), and also trading at a multiple to earnings of 16.When my friend and I had worked out all the details with her adviser, he politely showed us to the door, shook our hands, and then turned to me and said: “Sir, exactly what is it that you do for a living?”I save lives.james@formulacapital.com"
