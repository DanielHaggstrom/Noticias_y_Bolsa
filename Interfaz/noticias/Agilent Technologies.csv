0;A;Agilent Technologies;2015-11-02T14:01:07Z;#techFT – HP’s risky rebirth;;Welcome to #techFT, a new daily newsletter on technology, digital media and telecoms from the Financial Times that we’re launching from the Web Summit in Dublin this week. Please send any feedback to techFT@ft.com and encourage friends and colleagues to sign up here.HP moved its original business out of the famous pre-war garage – the “birthplace of Silicon Valley”- 75 years ago, a year after Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded the company on its workbenches.It spun off their testing and measurement equipment company as Agilent in 1999, added Compaq to become a PC powerhouse in 2002 and now sheds that line of business today, with Meg Whitman leading a new HP enterprise group (HPE).HP Inc is the new name for the PC and printer company left behind. While the PC market has been struggling, there is still hope of major growth in printing, with some predicting the 3D printing industry will eventually outgrow PCs.But, as Richard Waters reports, HP is splitting itself up at a time when Dell and others are consolidating, making the two smaller companies possible M&A targets. They’re far from being garage businesses, but is the new nimbleness being gained by the separated divisions enough to help them survive and thrive?Blockchain banking Financial institutions are racing to harness the power of the blockchain – the shared database technology that gained notoriety as the platform for bitcoin. They hope it will cut up to $20bn off costs and transform the way the industry works.

1;A;Agilent Technologies;2012-06-08T22:21:50Z;Sweden’s EQT wins BSN Medical auction;;Swedish buyout fund EQT has won the race for BSN Medical, the German bandages maker, in a deal worth €1.82bn, people close to the situation said.Confirming private equity's appeal for companies in the healthcare sector, which is relatively recession-proof, vendor Montagu is set to triple its original 2005 stake of €1bn, including dividends.The Hamburg-based company, created in 2001 out of a joint venture between Smith & Nephew and Beiersdorf, had been coveted by rivals Wendel and CVC, which tabled a bid alongside BC Partners.BSN Medical had been prepared for a stock exchange listing in 2010, only to cancel its plans when markets soured. Montagu had looked to sell it outright in 2008.BSN makes bandages, casts and orthopaedic braces. The company employs more than 4,000 workers and made €665m in revenues last year.Wound care has become an increasingly attractive area for investors recently due to improving technology and growing demand for treatment of wounds as diabetes becomes more prevalent.Investors are also hopeful that when the economy recovers, demand for medical devices and procedures will rise.The EQT deal comes less than a month after the private equity group agreed to sell Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics group, for $2.2bn to Agilent Technologies, a US medical device company. EQT took Dako private in 2007 for $1.3bn.Montagu and EQT both declined to comment.
2;A;Agilent Technologies;2012-05-17T20:39:18Z;Agilent buys Danish cancer diagnostics group;;Agilent Technologies, the US medical device company, said that it would acquire Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics group, in a $2.2bn deal that would increase its presence in the life sciences industry.Thursday’s all-cash acquisition of Dako from the Swedish private equity group EQT is the biggest deal in Agilent’s history and marks the latest acquisition in the rapidly consolidating sector.“Dako is one of the world’s leading providers of cancer diagnostics tools, and together we will be able to develop a wider range of products that help in the fight against cancer,” said Bill Sullivan, Agilent’s chief executive. “Agilent’s strategy in acquiring Dako is about strengthening the company’s presence in life science and about revenue growth.”Dako makes tools and antibodies that provide faster diagnoses for cancer patients. The company, which was taken private by EQT in 2007 for $1.3bn, had $340m in annual revenue in 2010. Last year Agilent made $6.6bn in revenues.The deal is expected to close in the next 60 days. Credit Suisse advised Agilent on the transaction.Healthcare groups have been acquisitive lately, with mergers worth more than $33bn in April, according to Dealogic. AstraZeneca spent $1.3bn to purchase Ardea and companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Roche have been seeking new targets.Agilent shares fell 0.3 per cent to $39.63.
3;A;Agilent Technologies;2012-03-29T11:39:58Z;Roche / Illumina: time to talk;Swiss pharmaceuticals group raises offer for US diagnostics company;"Severin Schwan is a determined man. The chief executive of Roche Holding will simply not give up on Illumina. Thursday’s revised terms raised the Swiss pharmaceuticals group’s cash offer for its US target by 15 per cent, valuing the genetics company at $6.7bn. But Illumina chief executive Jay Flatley is also playing tough: his studied disdain for Roche’s offer, in the near certainty that it would have to table a better one, is obviously working.Valuing the potential of genomic research is all but impossible, but Roche will not keep raising its offer forever. So Illumina is close to having to recommend the bid before its suitor walks. That said, the Swiss group is still well within its means: free cash flow was nearly SFr14bn in 2011; Goldman Sachs estimates that the company will generate SFr37bn of free cash flow net of dividends and capital expenditure over the next five years. It has little debt, and deep pockets. And Illumina is a good fit: although it would add only 2 per cent to Roche’s revenues, its gene sequencing technology could help to develop new cancer drugs.Even so, the riskier of the two balancing acts probably is Mr Flatley’s. Roche’s revised offer represents an 88 per cent premium to Illumina’s share price before speculation about the Roche deal leaked into the market in late November (although it is still a third below the equally bid-inflated level at which the shares were trading last July). Roche’s offer equates to a tempting forward earnings multiple for Illumina of 34 times, compared with 12 to 14 times for such peers as Life Technologies and Agilent. Some Illumina shareholders are already backing Roche. If Mr Flatley and the board are too intractable, Illumina’s share price has a long way to fall.Illumina says its shareholders should take no action on the revised Roche offer. But the US company’s board should give the terms a thorough hearing. The time for talking is approaching.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
4;A;Agilent Technologies;2011-02-24T15:22:10Z;Year of ‘foundation building’ takes toll on GM earnings;;General Motors lost ground after quarterly earnings figures disappointed investors, while the wider markets hovered in neutral territory as positive sentiment created by healthy employment data were negated by the continuing unrest in north Africa.The carmaker reported its best yearly earnings figure in more than a decade and the first profitable year since 2004. But fourth-quarter profits came in at $510m, or 31 cents a share, which was below expectations.Daniel Akerson, chief executive of GM, said that 2010 had been a year of “foundation building”. Shares in GM were down 4.5 per cent to $33.02, while rival Ford Motor lost 1.1 per cent to $14.70.In the wider markets, sentiment was lifted by promising weekly unemployment data. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped by 22,000 to 391,000 last week, ahead of the 5,000 fall expected by most economists.The more stable four-week moving average of new claims dropped 16,500 to 402,000 in the week, which is the lowest level since July 2008 and provides hope that the US jobs market is recovering.But investors continued to worry about the violence in Libya and the disruptions that this is causing to oil supply, fearing that sustained high oil prices could slow down the domestic economic recovery.Oil prices fell back slightly late in the day – helped by rumours on the trading floor that Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, had been shot – which took some pressure off equities.This left the S&P 500 down 0.1 per cent to 1,306.10. The index has lost 2.8 per cent this week already on geopolitical concerns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent to 12,068.50, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent at 2,737.90.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, fell back 5.1 per cent in the session although it is still up nearly 30 per cent over the week.The retail sector suffered from a mixed batch of earnings reports from key industry players.Sears Holdings tumbled lower after the retailer said that profits had fallen by 13 per cent in the fourth quarter after same-store sales declined during the holiday period. That sent shares down 5.5 per cent to $82.40, the sharpest one-day fall in six months. On Wednesday, the company announced a new chief executive after a three-year search. The stock is down 11.4 per cent over the week.Elsewhere in the sector, Target reported higher same-store sales and fourth-quarter earnings. The discount retailer said that net income had risen 10.5 per cent to $1.035bn, or $1.45 a share, on the strength of a successful holiday shopping season and its improving credit card business.Comparable store sales at Target increased 2.4 per cent, helping shares climb 3.5 per cent to $52.Earlier this week rival discount retailer Walmart reported its seventh consecutive quarterly same-store sales decline.Kohl’s, the department store chain, reported a 14 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profits but gave a 2011 earnings forecast that fell short of expectations. Still, shares were up 3.4 per cent to $53.80.Not all the economic data of the session was as positive as the employment numbers.Durable goods data showed a strong 2.7 per cent increase in orders by businesses, a sign of confidence in the recovery. But most of this was down to a spike in aircraft orders. New orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft, declined 6.9 per cent in January, according to the Commerce Department.Sales of new homes also tumbled last month, damping hopes of a speedy housing market recovery. New single-family home sales fell by 12.6 per cent in January from the previous month, worse than the 8.8 per cent decline predicted by economists.Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific equipment, was up 1.7 per cent to $41.15 after lifting its full-year 2011 earnings forecast to as much as $2.63 a share, exceeding analysts’ average estimate of $2.51 a share.E-Trade Financial, the online bank and brokerage house, was down 4.8 per cent to $15.85 on reports that Citadel Investment Group, a major shareholder in E-Trade, was planning to sell most its shares.Priceline.com, the online travel company, ticked 8.5 per cent higher at $462.34 after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits and a rise in bookings.
5;A;Agilent Technologies;2009-12-08T16:41:02Z;Anite pulls plug on Agilent joint venture;;Anite has ended a two-year venture with Agilent Technologies, the equipment maker, in favour selling its own telecom testing software for next generation mobile networks directly to customers.The UK group called time on the collaborative venture with the US group as it feared the effects of delays in delivery of Agilent’s hardware as large network providers such as Verizon Communications of the US aggressively ramped up spending.“We felt we were going to miss the boat unless we took action,” said Chris Humphrey, chief executive. “We’re now in control of our own destiny.”In the past six months Anite has run successful trials with South Korea’s LG Electronics and made early sales to other mobile network equipment makers of its fourth-generation networks, known in the industry as long-term evolution (LTE).Analysts broadly welcomed end of the partnership, saying it was now in complete control of its own product development. “On the other hand, Anite now must meet the challenge of scaling up its with a full commercially available LTE product,” said Stacy Pollard, an analyst at Cazenove.Anite said there had been “limited” revenues from LTE sales in the half year to October 31, with more expected to be generated in the second half. Neverthless it said “4G” revenues in the fourth quarter would be critical to the full-year outcome.Revenues for the six months to October 31 fell from £47.4m to £35.2m while it swung to a pre-tax loss of £1.1m compared with a profit of £4.4m a year ago. It turned to a loss per share of 0.3p from a profit of 0.5p a year ago.Underlying profit for the period fell to £160,000 compared with a profit of £31.6m in 2008, which a £30m gain from the £54.3m sale of its public sector software business to Northgate Information Solutions 14 months ago.Anite’s investments in LTE, and declining demand for older technology, has meant the group has already guided that profits for the year 2009-10 would be lower than 2008-09.Shares in Anite traded up ½p at 32¾p on Tuesday.
6;A;Agilent Technologies;2009-07-31T22:31:28Z;KKR eyes market blitz of up to six IPOs;;"Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the world’s biggest buy-out group, is preparing up to six companies for initial public offerings worth billions of dollars, including Toys R Us, as it sells some of its most valuable groups back to the stock market.There have been virtually no IPOs in the past two years, but as the worst of the financial crisis recedes and stock markets start to rebound, investors are eagerly waiting to see if private equity firms such as KKR will start listing companies bought in the boom years.A person familiar with KKR said the companies it was preparing to float included US toy retailer Toys R Us; HCA, one of America’s biggest hospital groups; First Data, the credit card processor; TDC, the Danish telecoms group; and Dollar General, the discount retailer.“We think there are five to six companies in the [KKR] portfolio that can be taken public in the next 12 months,” said a person familiar with KKR’s plans.The New York-based group has already filed for an IPO of Avago Technologies, the Singapore-based semiconductor company formerly known as Agilent, which it bought with Silver Lake for $2.66bn in 2005.The new IPOs would be a boost for KKR, which was founded by cousins Henry Kravis and George Roberts in 1976 and shot to fame 20 years ago with the $30bn takeover of RJR Nabisco, immortalised in the book Barbarians at the Gate.HCA was one of the biggest ever buy-outs when KKR, Bain Capital and Merrill Lynch paid $33bn for it in 2007. It runs 163 hospitals and 112 outpatient centres, generating $28.4bn of revenues last year. KKR in March valued its stake at $1.1bn.As HCA still has $26bn of debt, KKR is considering selling new shares to repay loans, rather than cashing out itself.It may do something similar with First Data, which it bought for $26bn in 2007 and has held up well in the recession, increasing adjusted earnings by 5 per cent last year.The listings will be welcome news in an industry that has suffered two poor years because of falling stock markets and the crisis-hit banking sector.KKR underlined the woes of the buy-out sector by reporting a $1.2bn loss last year."
7;A;Agilent Technologies;2009-07-28T20:18:47Z;IBM acquisition steps up software race;;IBM looked set to trigger another round of consolidation among the world’s largest makers of business software on Tuesday as it announced an all-cash $1.2bn acquisition of SPSS, a company whose technology is used to analyse and forecast customer and market trends.The deal also brings an intensification of the mergers and acquisitions wave that has started to sweep across the technology sector, as cash-rich companies take advantage of the downturn to make strategic acquisitions that round out their product ranges.It comes a day after Agilent, the maker of electronics test equipment that was spun off from Hewlett-Packard, agreed to pay $1.5bn in cash to diversify into the life sciences industry through the acquisition of Varian Semiconductor.EMC last week completed a $2.2bn cash purchase of Data Domain to extend its reach into an important new area of data back-up.Dealmaking between tech companies was frozen earlier in year as share prices crashed and demand from customers dried up, but it has revived as valuations have recovered somewhat and volatility has receded.The acquisition of SPSS gives IBM a stronger foothold in the new high ground of business software, known as predictive analytics.The technology, which analyses past patterns of behaviour to try to forecast future trends, is used in things such as online marketing campaigns, where prices and other factors can be adjusted in real time to improve effectiveness.“Every client is asking for an information-led strategy” that relies on technologies such as predictive analytics to “optimise everything” in their operations, said Ambuj Goyal, general manager of IBM’s information management division.IBM’s biggest software rivals were now likely to scramble to reinforce their own technology in this area to counter IBM, said Boris Evelson, an analyst at Forrester Research.SAP, which has relied on a close partnership with SPSS, faces the most immediate threat. “We will definitely see a similar move from SAP fairly soon,” Mr Evelson said.A similar round of acquisitions was triggered in the larger business intelligence software market after Oracle bought Hyperion early in 2007 for $3.3bn. IBM and SAP countered with deals of their own later that year for a total of $11.7bn.IBM said it would pay $50 a share in cash for SPSS, a 42 per cent premium to the closing price the day before.
8;A;Agilent Technologies;2009-07-27T20:31:07Z;Late rally lifts Wall Street;;US equities posted small gains on Monday, as investors digested a mixed array of earnings results that overshadowed better news on the housing front.In New York, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 982.18 and closed at a fresh eight month peak.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 1,967.89, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 9,108.51, with Verizon’s latest earnings weighing on sentiment.After the closing bell, Amgen provided some earnings cheer, as its second quarter earnings beat estimates and shares of the biotech company jumped in afterhours trade.The S&P 500 reached its high for the day, at 982.49, after reports that new home sales in June rose 11 per cent from May and inventories of unsold homes dropped to their lowest level since February 1998.While median home prices dropped 12 per cent over the past year, the data provided further evidence that the housing market may have bottomed said economists. The S&P home builders index rose 5.7 per cent.Among the 10 main S&P industry sectors, financials rose 1.5 per cent with information technology lagging by 0.3 per cent.Equity volatility edged up with the S&P Vix (volatility index) trading above 24, after touching a low of 23 last week.Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos believes a normal range for Vix, is between 18 and 22. He said there is still a risk that the S&P 500 could drop back to 825.In the past two weeks, the S&P has risen about 11 per cent beyond 950, the level that had capped stocks since the end of May.Traders believe that the benchmark is on course to reach 1,000, a level not attained since last November. In recent weeks, banks have been raising their year-end targets beyond 1,000 for the S&P.This week’s earnings results will determine whether equities can maintain their recent strong run, say analysts. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup said that while companies reporting earnings to date, some 40 per cent of the S&P 500, have beaten forecasts by about 11 per cent, the results are still down approximately 25 per cent compared with a year ago.“To be fair, margins have been resilient as corporate management teams have been very effective at delivering the bottom line,” he said.Mr Levkovich said that while some worry about the sustainability of growth, it is not an issue until the second quarter of next year and that latecomers to the market rally could miss out as “stock prices will not stand idly by as they generally trade in sync with earnings”.Analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management said: “With liquidity still supportive, high cash levels still waiting to be deployed and a less volatile environment, as well as improved earnings and a reasonable message from technical signals, the near-term environment appears favourable.”Earlier in earnings news, Honeywell reported a drop of 38 per cent for its second-quarter earnings and after an early fall, its shares rose 0.7 per cent to $34.24.The company’s revenue dropped more than a forecast $7.73bn, falling 22 per cent to $7.56bn versus $9.67bn for the same period a year ago.Shares in Verizon dropped 1.6 per cent to $31 after a 21 per cent drop in profits to $3.16bn.The telecoms group announced 8,000 job cuts, and revenue increased 11 per cent to $26.86bn, boosted by growth in wireless subscribers.Corning, the maker of liquid crystal glass, generated second-quarter earnings of $611m, which beat forecasts, but its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $16.50.Meanwhile, Radioshack, the electronics retailer, also beat estimates as it cut costs, but its shares dropped 6.6 per cent to $15.In deals, Agilent Technologies said it plans to buy Varian for $1.5bn in cash, or $52 a share. Agilent rose 1.8 per cent to $22.66. Varian surged 29.1 per cent to trade at $50.61.Shares in Mylan, the drug maker, fell 12.6 per cent to $12.10 as the company denied a newspaper report that its workers overrode government-mandated quality controls.
9;A;Agilent Technologies;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;A;Agilent Technologies;2009-02-18T12:12:39Z;Mobile WiMax – when will it take off?;;"Businesses around the world stand to make significant gains from the availability of reliable, widespread, high speed mobile broadband services.However, existing data services are often unable to meet the various needs of all users fully. Wired services offer the highest speed internet access but are restricted by location and immobility; wireless internet services support mobility but can be slow and expensive.Mobile WiMax is one of the wireless options. It provides seamless high speed mobile broadband access across huge areas, providing reliable internet access to the most bandwidth hungry applications both on the market and still in development such as streaming video content to a mobile device.It is in some ways comparable to Wi-Fi networks, but it has a much broader service range. While Wi-Fi web access is confined to an office or a building, a WiMax network can cover an entire city.But realising WiMax’s full potential will require innovation in terms of product development and commercialisation.With businesses becoming increasingly mobile, high speed mobile broadband is becoming as important to business as the mobile phone. It gives employees the ability to access important files and e-mails while on the road and can improve customer service and retention by by speeding up response times to e-mails etc. And it helps to address the needs of a new generation of employees that require constant connectivity.With city-wide deployments already live in Amsterdam and Moscow, WiMax is on its way to becoming widely accepted. However, before it can be widely adopted by the business community, several things need to happen.Devices and services provided over WiMax, as well as the network itself, need to be consistently dependable: a mobile WiMax network needs to be stable enough to meet the reliability requirements of business users; equally, the devices used to access the network will need to be robust and reliable.Mobile WiMax compatibility will need to be embedded into devices to drive consumer demand. Some vendors have already begun to produce laptops, PDAs and mobile phones with built-in WiMax capability. Once services become more pervasive and stable, businesses will need to purchase WiMax certified products that are WiMax enabled or take advantage of the USB devices and cards that are also becoming available to enable the existing generation of mobile devices to connect to a WiMAX network.Businesses can also utilise ”femto cells” to achieve uninterrupted services at their sites that would improve coverage within large buildings. These small cellular base stations can be easily connected to the network to boost coverage indoors, especially where access would otherwise be limited or unavailable. There could also be some kind of data server or software requirements but the technology and product offerings are not mature enough to make any firm conclusions yet.On the operator side, the availability of the necessary radio spectrum to provide mobile WiMax services is vital. In the UK for example, Ofcom, the country’s independent communications regulator, is soon to hold a spectrum auction around the 2.6GHz frequency, which will be able to support mobile WiMax. The outcome of this will be key to shaping the adoption of the technology in the UK.In addition, for telecoms providers, bundling mobile WiMax access with other services such as voice over the internet (VoIP) will be essential to ensuring profitability and so ensuring that providers make mobile WiMax services widely available. We are likely to see the eventual addition of voice services to the data services initially on offer."
11;A;Agilent Technologies;2008-09-03T19:38:17Z;Spirent suffers as growth worries hit Footsie;;The difficulties of placing large chunks of stock in current market conditions were underlined when an attempt to sell 17 per cent of Spirent Communications, the FTSE 250 telecoms testing company, had to be abandoned.Sherborne Partners, the activist US investor that has revived the fortunes of Spirent, announced plans to sell around two-thirds of its holding through UBS and RBS. By lunchtime the placing had been pulled after prospective buyers balked at the indicative pricing – rumoured to be 72p-81p.Traders said the discount needed to be bigger given the recent run-up in Spirent’s share price – 35 per cent in the past month – and market volatility. On top of that, they noted that Sherborne’s chairman, Edward Bramson, is also executive chairman of Spirent.Company watchers believe Sherborne, which first bought into Spirent two years ago when it was trading just above 40p, might now attempt to sell its holding to another telecoms equipment maker, such as Agilent Technologies or Ixia.Spirent ended 9.4 per cent lower at 75p, one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250, which dropped 173.9 points, or 1.8 per cent, to 9,369.7.The FTSE 100, meanwhile, closed 121 points, or 2.2 per cent lower, at 5,499.7, dragged down by a weak opening on Wall Street and further concerns about slowing global economic growthJust three blue-chip stocks ended the session in positive territory. Defence company BAE Systems was one, improving 0.5 per cent to 485¼p as the US dollar continued to rise against the pound, reaching $1.776British Energy added 0.4 per cent to 735p on rumours France’s EDF had struck a deal with the two funds that blocked its previous offer to acquire the company.But one of the funds, M&G, dismissed the speculation. “No discussions have taken place with EDF about its offer for British Energy. We continue to think that 765p a share undervalues the group and would prefer to have an opportunity to see a proposal from Centrica.”Private equity group 3i was the third FTSE 100 riser, up 0.2 per cent to 923½p after a Morgan Stanley upgrade to “overweight”.“We believe current management has done a good job to de-risk the portfolio from early stage technology, whilst diversifying the historical UK skew towards Europe and Asia,” it said.Mining stocks remained under pressure. Ferrexpo, the Ukrainian iron ore producer, dropped 15.4 per cent to 211¼p as it traded ex-dividend and Ukraine’s president Viktor Yushchenko threatened to call a snap election after the collapse of the ruling coalition.Elsewhere, Kazakhmys lost 6.1 per cent to £11.12, while Xstrata was down 3.3 per cent at £27.11 on news a $2.8bn commodity fund was closing after losing 27 per cent of its value in August. Traders said this had fuelled fears about forced selling of oil and mining stocks and other fund closures.Banks were also weak on talk UK lenders had borrowed up to £100bn from the Bank of England’s Special Liquidity Scheme, which closes next month. Royal Bank of Scotland lost 1.9 per cent to 237p, while HBOS fell 2.2 per cent to 303¼p.However, Morgan Stanley said the fears had been overplayed, pointing to a speech made by Mervyn King, the governor of the BoE to the British Bankers Association in June. “A replacement liquidity scheme is being developed that works in all seasons – both ‘normal’ and ‘stressed’. We do not believe that the banks will be left without central bank support,” it said.Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays fell 3.7 per cent to 350¼p after RBS advised clients to “sell” citing concerns about a £4.9bn-£7.5bn capital shortfall.On a more speculative tack, Tullett Prebon slipped 4.1 per cent to 428¾p on concerns that talks with US rival GFI could falter because of the recent weakness of sterling against the dollar. This will make the deal more expensive to pull off because it is likely to be structured as a Tullett purchase of GFI.Punch Taverns sank 12.1 per cent to 278¼p after the pub company scrapped its final dividend to free up cash to redeem a £295m bond. That news weighed on rival Enterprise Inns, which fell 8.8 per cent to 280¼p.
12;A;Agilent Technologies;2008-05-15T20:44:26Z;Strength in techs fuels US blue-chips rally;;"Wall Street stocks extended recent gains on Thursday as investors shrugged off new data giving mixed signals about the health of the US economy while strong performances in the information technology sector bolstered the leading indices.The morning session was dominated by a number of downbeat data releases that showed slumping industrial activity across the US, rising initial jobless claims and declining business conditions among New York region manufacturers.Still, the economic outlook remains opaque. The latest Philadelphia Fed survey, for example, suggested that the contraction in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region moderated somewhat in May, adding to the fog.In spite of early losses, a run in materials and energy stocks initially pushed indices into the black and as oil prices fell back, consumer discretionary stocks picked up the slack.Meanwhile, a flurry of deal news and positive analyst comments helped information technology shares advance 2.1 per cent, underpinning gains on the major equity markets.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had overturned earlier losses to climb 1.1 per cent to 1,423.52 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,992.25. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.5 per cent to 2,533.73.On Tuesday US stocks made strong gains as investors responded positively
to relatively benign inflation data and digested better-than-expected earnings re-ports from Freddie Mac.The financial sector added to those gains on Thursday, rising in tandem with the broader market rally and skirting comments by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who urged banks to raise more capital.An index of financial stocks rose 1.2 per cent. Among the leading gainers were Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which rose 2.1 per cent to $23.73 and 6 per cent to $44.77 respectively.Amid the broader market rally industrials stocks were hobbled by the manufacturing data. The S&P 500 industrials index rose only 0.3 per cent as gains for Deere & Co, which added 2.9 per cent to $83.61, were offset by losses for United Technologies, which fell 1.2 per cent to $74.29.General Electric was also in focus, after reports that it had hired Goldman Sachs to look at selling or seeking a partner for its appliances unit. GE shares fell 0.4 per cent to $32.37.A handful of results from retailers highlighted the divergent fortunes of some companies in the sector, but the respite in oil prices lifted stocks across the board.JC Penney said first-quarter net income slumped 50 per cent as shoppers reined back spending amid the US economic slowdown.Tiffany & Co, the upmarket jeweller, posted first-quarter earnings that exceeded forecasts thanks to a “promising start to the year”.JC Penney shares threw off early losses to gain 4.7 per cent to $46.32, Tiffany shares added 6.6 per cent to $48.88 while an index of consumer discretionary stocks rose 1.3 per cent.Energy and material stocks dipped in mid-afternoon but bounced back by the close, adding 1.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively.Internet and media companies provided a frisson of excitement. Yahoo added 2.3 per cent to $27.75 after Carl Icahn launched a proxy battle to force the internet search company to reopen buy-out talks with Microsoft.At the same time, CBS said it would buy web media company CNET Networks for about $1.8bn.The move will broaden the broadcaster’s reach on the internet giving it a total of 54m unique users per month. CBS shares fell 2.4 per cent to $24.23 while CNET shares jumped 43.5 per cent to $11.41. As a whole, the information and technology sector was the strongest in the S&P 500, boosted by a bullish analyst report on semiconductor companies. Intel rose 4.7 per cent to $24.97 while Nvidia added 7.8 per cent to $23.78. The leading gainer, though, was Agilent Technologies, which jumped 8.6 per cent to $35.34 after the maker of scientific-
testing equipment reported a 41 per cent jump in second-quarter profit.EMC, the maker of storage computers, followed close behind. It climbed 6.7 per cent to $17.80 on speculation that the company will sell part or possibly all of its holding in VMware."
13;A;Agilent Technologies;2007-06-11T22:30:47Z;Blondes have more fun in pageview war;;I live and breathe stocks. I’ve run funds, funds of funds and I’ve been a trader for hedge funds, as well as a daytrader for myself. But it hasn’t always been about stocks for me.Eleven years ago, I approached HBO with an idea: they were the best in the cable TV world for original programming. How about you do the same for the internet? Do an original web show.This was pre-YouTube, pre-blog and so forth. The idea I pitched was called “III:am”. Get it? 3am. The basic concept was that if you were outside at three in the morning on a Tuesday night (Wednesday morning) something was up. I mean, why aren’t you sleeping? Don’t you work the next day? Or don’t you have school? Why are you out and about in New York City at that hour? So every week I would go out with a camera crew. I’d stop everyone I could find in the East Village, the meat packing district, every place in the city from Wall Street to Rikers Island (the local jail). For two years, I turned over every rock in the city, interviewing drug dealers, prostitutes, their customers, and everyone in between. I saw the craziest things I’ll ever see and I did it 104 straight weeks until I finally realised I needed to sleep more. We’d get transcripts of all the interviews and put them on the internet, along with pictures and video. Designers would compete to see who would do the design for that week’s “webisode”. Not only was it a hugely popular site during our two-year run but it was also a lot of fun. And it changed my life.Each week, I would put on the front page of the site four pictures of what I considered that episode’s best interviews. Very early on I realised the trick of pageviews on the internet. People only clicked on pictures of blonde women. Or blonde transvestites (sometimes people clicked more on the transvestites). Prostitutes that were blonde? Those would be the biggest pageviews of the month. If I put my own picture on there? Forget it. Negative pageviews.When people fire up their web browsers they want flash, scandal, excitement. I think for seven days in a row now either Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan has been on the front page of the New York Post.The same thing goes for stocks. Everyone wants to talk about Google or Dendreon. I know this because I see what people click on on stockpickr.com, a “MySpace for finance” I set up that’s now owned by thestreet.com. For a while, Sirius and XM Satellite Radio Holdings were the big winners. But now Dendreon is gold, with Google a close runner-up and, believe it or not, NYSE Euronext.But let’s look beyond that to find some value. Let’s look at the most boring stocks imaginable. These are stocks that are so boring they can’t even get three or four characters in their ticker symbol. Heck, they can’t even get two characters. I’m talking about stocks such as “A” (Agilent Technologies) or “B” (Barnes Group). “M” was just given to Macy’s. Microsoft didn’t want it. Too boring, Steve Ballmer supposedly said.I like Barnes Group. You can’t find a more boring company. I can’t even describe what they do here or I’ll lose you. Suffice to say it supplies very specific parts for aircraft engines and replacement parts for railroads. The company started in 1857, during the “dotcom” boom of the 1850s: railroads. It was literally the picks and shovels of the railroad boom. B is a great backdoor way to play the current railroad boom that guys such as Warren Buffett have been predicting with his purchase of companies such as Union Pacific and Burlington Northern. The company trades at a forward price/earnings ratio of just 13 and has done a good job surviving no matter what market conditions are.I also like A. Hewlett- Packard analysts were falling asleep during conference calls until the company decided to spin off A, a maker of measurement tools. This was the original Hewlett-Packard, started in the clichéd Silicon Valley garage, but in 1938, not 1998. The company trades at 7.5 times cash flows and I think it will end its story as a public company through a leveraged buy-out sometime in the near future.Rather than list all the single letter stocks, let’s just look at the ones that haven’t yet been taken (just in case you want one): G (was Gillette until recently), I, J, L, N, P U, V, W and Z.As an aside, I pitched my idea to HBO. They gave me a budget to make it and got a great documentary producer to help me: Jon Alpert. I learned a huge amount from him during the year we shot our pilot. But this is a long way of saying I owe someone an apology. Jon Alpert’s brother, Bill, writes for Barron’s. A year ago in these pages I accused Bill of doing “a hatchet job” on a stock, Sulphco. The jury is still out but it looks like he was right after all. Bill, I’m sorry. I’m the hatchet man.james@formulacapital.com
14;A;Agilent Technologies;2007-05-18T20:57:59Z;Bull run continues on Wall Street;;Wall Street’s bull run continued this week, with the exception of the technology sector, as deals and earnings news pushed the S&P 500 index to within sight of its all-time high.Late on Friday, the S&P had risen 0.65 per cent to close at 1,522.75, a gain of 1.1 per cent over the week. The benchmark notched its seventh consecutive weekly rise and closed at its highest level since setting its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Energy and telecoms stocks were the best performing sectors, while information technology was the laggard among the 10 major groups within the S&P.Higher oil prices and a further rise in bond yields were unable to weigh on stocks.“We are seeing so much consolidation and the market has also shifted its focus to the economy,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The market can absorb higher oil prices and bond yields if the economy is looking stronger.”Blue chips remained the bull’s prime choice this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 13,500 points for the first time and set a series of record closes as its run of strength since the end of March continued.On Friday, the Dow rose 0.6 per cent to finish at 13,556.53, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.A feature of the market’s current rally has been strong buying of large blue chip stocks. This positive sentiment was nurtured this week when high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett, Edward Lampert and Carl Icahn revealed their latest stock selections in regulatory filings.Railroads were a prominent sector, boosted by investment from Mr Buffett and Mr Icahn, and the S&P railroad index rose 3.8 per cent this week. Mr Lampert’s disclosure of a stake in Citigroup helped the bank’s shares rise by 3.6 per cent to $55.By contrast, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was bedevilled by weakness among many semiconductor stocks amid a general rotation out of tech. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.7 per cent this week. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.75 per cent to close at 2,558.45, but slipped 0.15 per cent for the week.The Russell index of small companies fell 0.7 per cent for the week.Leading declines among chip makers was Micron Technology, down 6.9 per cent to $11.47, after the group said it planned to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.One ray of light among chip makers was Advanced Micro Devices, up 6.2 per cent to $15.59 this week, as it rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games.In another week replete with deals, Microsoft said it would purchase Aquantive, the digital marketing group for about $6bn on Friday.It is the largest acquisition yet made by Microsoft, and its stock fell 0.5 per cent to $30.83, while Aquantive soared 77.8 per cent to $63.79 on Friday.“We view the acquisition as a necessity for Microsoft to compete against Google in online advertising, an estimated $40bn market growing at a 20 per cent rate through 2010,” said Jim Yin, systems software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in General Electric rose 1.2 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, as the conglomerate moved towards selling its plastics business for $11bn to Saudi Basic Industries.In other acquisition activity this week, Cardinal Health bought Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn. Viasys rose 38 per cent to $43.53, and Cardinal Health rallied 3.9 per cent to $71.77.Mylan Laboratories, the drugmaker agreed to pay $6.6bn for the generic drug business of Germany’s Merck KGaA. Shares in Mylan fell 11.8 per cent to $19.75.Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.4 per cent to $67.10.Alliance Data Systems, the issuer of private-label credit cards agreed to be acquired in a $7.8bn deal by Blackstone Group. ADS rose 24.6 per cent to $78.33 and set a 52-week high of $80.30.Acxiom agreed to a $2.24bn buy-out from private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and ValueAct Capital. Shares in the information technology company gained 13.4 per cent to $27.78 this week.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen fell 4 per cent to $54.04 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.In earnings news this week, Intuit said late on Thursday that its third-quarter profit climbed 23 per cent and the software maker raised its fiscal 2007 profit above analysts’ forecasts. Shares rose 13.85 per cent to $31.56 on Friday, and were up 13.2 per cent for the week.Compuware rose 9.9 per cent, to $11.06 and reached a five-year high of $12.56, as its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results exceeded expectations.Agilent rose 4.9 per cent to $38, after it reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and raised revenue outlook for the year.Hewlett-Packard, down 1.5 per cent at $44.58, was the worst Dow performer this week as its second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year-earlier period.Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter due to variable weather and a weaker housing market. The stock closed out the week a fraction higher at $38.62.
15;A;Agilent Technologies;2007-05-15T22:22:21Z;Tech stocks weigh on Wall St;;Shares in Wall Street were mixed on Tuesday, as blue-chips vaulted further into record territory, while losses in technology weighed upon broader benchmarks.News that consumer price inflation moderated last month helped stocks avert a tough start when Wal-Mart and Home Depot disappointed investors with their first-quarter results ahead of the opening bell. The mood turned bullish, however, after the release of benign inflation data for April. Annual core inflation – which excludes food and energy prices – rose less than expected.“Investors are making an interest rate play as the fall in annual core inflation takes us closer to the Fed’s comfort zone and they could be in a position to cut rates later this year,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at Avalon Partners.The moderation in annual core inflation to 2.3 per cent in April from 2.5 per cent during March is seen providing the Federal Reserve with some flexibility should the economy slow further in coming months, economists said.“This report is definitely a positive surprise for us on the inflation front,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.But Treasury bond yields rose, suggesting the data did little to raise traders’ hopes of a near-term rate cut. The rise in yields in spite of continued weakness in the housing market helped clip the early gains seen in stocks said traders.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,501.19, still adrift of its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000. Materials and telecom stocks were the best performing groups within the index, while the technology sector was in negative territory, weighed down by a 1.1 per cent fall in the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,525.29.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed in record territory on Tuesday and rose 0.3 per cent to 13,383.84. The blue-chip barometer established an all-time intraday high of 13,481.60 and set its 22nd record close for the year. The Dow managed to absorb disappointing results from two members, Wal-Mart and Home Depot.The world’s largest retailer said its first-quarter earnings rose 8.1 per cent, matching estimates, but investors were disappointed with Wal-Mart’s warning that second-quarter results would come in at or below forecasts. Its shares fell 0.5 per cent to $47.62.Meanwhile, Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter. The home improvement chain blamed variable weather and weakness in the housing market for failing to beat estimates. Its shares lost 1.8 per cent to close at $38.30.Shares in Agilent rose 5.2 per cent to $37.78, after it posted a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and said its revenue outlook indicated a strong second half to the fiscal year.Ingersoll Rand shares jumped 5.8 per cent to $49.29 after the machinery and heavy equipment maker said it was looking to sell some of its businesses.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen were 3.7 per cent lower at $54.01 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.Johnson & Johnson, whose anaemia drugs was also in focus at the FDA last week. It fell 1.3 per cent to $61.82. The company was the worst laggard in the Dow.DaimlerChrysler reported that first-quarter profit rose in spite of a wider loss at its Chrysler group, which it agreed on Monday to sell to a private equity firm. Shares in the carmaker closed 0.8 per cent higher at $84.80. Other car makers were higher, with General Motors up 4.4 per cent at $31.97 after it was boosted by a brokerage upgrade. Ford rose 2.3 per cent to $8.91.In deal news, Beckman Coulter, the biomedical instrument maker, said it would not raise its $90-a-share bid for Biosite, the medical diagnostic company that has backed a $92.50-a-share offer from Inverness Medical Innovations .Shares in Biosite fell 3.1 per cent to $91.71. Beckman shares were up 2.3 per cent at $66.08, while Inverness slid 2.7 per cent to $39.89.
16;A;Agilent Technologies;2006-11-14T21:36:09Z;Wall Street shrugs aside profit takers;;US stocks rebounded from early weakness on Tuesday, as investors digested corporate earnings reports, and viewed sharply lower wholesale inflation and mixed retail sales data as elements heralding a soft landing for the economy.Opening gains in the indices were surrendered and consolidation loomed, only for buyers to emerge during afternoon trade. As buying picked up, the S&P 500 broke through a key barrier at 1389, and closed near a six year high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average pierced a key trading level at 12,190, and rallied further to a new record close.Stocks also took some heart after William Poole, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve, said inflation expectations are “well controlled” and that the central bank’s current policy stance is “about right.”Typifying the spirit of the day was Home Depot, which initially fell 1.7 per cent to a low of $35.77, as it blamed a “very challenging housing environment” for a third-quarter profit of 73 cents a share, below estimates of 75 cents a share. But despite its lowered guidance, shares rallied and closed up $1.56, or 4.3 per cent at $37.96.“The bulls came back after some profit taking. This has been the story for the past few months and is the type of day that postpones the idea the market is poised to take a break,” said Ken Tower, senior market strategist at CyberTrader, a division of Charles Schwab.The market was also led higher by Intel, up 88 cents, or 4.2 per cent at $21.88 and Wal-Mart, up $1.34, or 2.9 per cent at $47.66. The US’s largest retailer hit a peak of $48.20, after reporting earnings of 63 cents a share in the third quarter, at the top end of the company’s guidance provided last month. That beat the consensus estimate of 60 cents per share and analysts said lower guidance by the company was not as bad as feared.Among fallers was Agilent, down 5.7 per cent at $33. Agilent, which makes measuring technology, posted fourth-quarter net income of 36 cents a share, short of a forecast of 54 cents.Excessive pessimism over homebuilder DR Horton was abruptly punctured after its earnings of 88 cents per share comfortably beat estimates of only 69 cents. The company’s shares leapt 9.5 per cent to $24.50.The discount retailer Target earned $506m, or 59 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $435m, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. The results exceeded the consensus forecast of 55 cents a share, and sent the company’s stock 2.4 per cent higher to $59.16.The S&P 500 finished up 8.8 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 1,393.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was 24.28 points, or 1 per cent higher, at 2,430.66. The Dow rose 86.13 points, or 0.7 per cent to 12,218.01.Retailer Saks reported net income of $6.18m, or 5 cents a share, for the fiscal third quarter, beating estimates of 3 cents a share. Shares in the company rose 2.6 per cent to $20.40 having been more than $24 earlier in the session.Shares in Staples fell 0.9 per cent to $25.83 as earnings of 36 cents a share, just pipping estimates of 35 cents.Still, some analysts believe stocks could be due for a period of consolidation after a run of solid gains that has sent the S&P 500 index towards a six-year high, buoyed by solid earnings.“The market has been brought a long way over the past 14 weeks and we now require a compelling signal to spark further gains,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is not capped, it just looks like we will see a period of consolidation in November.”Stock index futures were indicating a bright start in early trade and then pushed higher after retail sales and wholesale inflation reports for October arrived.Headline retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, less than the projected fall of 0.4 per cent, while sales for September were revised lower to a decline of 0.8 per cent, versus an original drop of 0.4 per cent.Excluding automobile sales, the data revealed that sales fell 0.4 per cent, more than the projected decline of 0.3 per cent.But, stripping out petrol sales, overall sales rose 0.4 per cent, a figure that shows the consumer is still spending say economists.“The main story on retail sales was the sharp revisions to the September data, while the October was fairly close to expectations,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The market is apt to still take away a view that the consumer has been restrained in spending the income that had been going to gas when gas prices were higher.”Meanwhile investors were soothed by the inflation picture at the wholesale level. The producer price index fell 1.6 per cent last month versus the expected decline of 0.5 per cent. Excluding food and energy, the core rate fell 0.9 per cent, again well under the expected rise of 0.1 per cent. The core rate rose 0.6 per cent during September and last month’s fall was the largest since August 1993. The core PPI has fallen in four of the past five months.Investors now await the consumer price index for September due on Thursday.Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson ICAP noted the “report doesn’t change our forecast of a 0.2 per cent increase in the core CPI.” Still he concedes “the fact that PPI food prices surprised us on the downside (-0.8 per cent) does shift the risk in the overall CPI.”
17;A;Agilent Technologies;2006-11-14T14:16:07Z;Wall Street spins its wheels lower;;Wall Street stocks were sinking in mid-morning trade on Tuesday, as investors digested several earnings reports from retailers against the backdrop of a welcome slide in wholesale inflation and a mixed retail sales report.The tone of the data suggests the consumer remains in reasonable health. Producer price inflation fell sharply, potentially good news for the Federal Reserve.Affter a run of solid gains that has sent the S&P 500 index towards a six year high, buoyed by solid earnings running above 19 per cent on a year-on-year comparison for the third quarter, stocks are poised for a period of consolidation according to analysts.“The market has been brought a long way over the past 14 weeks and we now require a compelling signal to spark further gains,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is not capped, it just looks like we will see a period of consolidation in November.”About an hour into the trading day stock indices were lower.The S&P 500 was down 3.54 points, or 0.3 per cent at 1380.88 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 7.07 points, or 0.3 per cent at 2399.31.Hurting the broad market was a sharp fall in Agilent, whose shares were off $2.24, or 6.4 per cent at $32.75. The maker of measuring equipment and technology said fourth-quarter net income was $152mn, or 36 cents a share, on revenue of $1.33bn. That was well short of an expected gain of 54 cents a share on sales.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.06 points, or 0.3 per cent at 12,094.82.In earnings news, the nation’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart beat estimates, while hardware supplier chain, Home Depot fell short of expectations. Both companies are components of the Dow and Wal-Mart was the indice’s leading gainer.Wal-Mart said net income rose to $2.65bn, or 63 cents per share in the third quarter ending October 31, from $2.37 billion, or 57 cents per share a year earlier. That was at the top end of the 59 to 63 cent guidance provided by the company last month and beat the consensus estimate of 60 cents per share. Shares hit a peak of $48.20 and were recently up $1.18, or 2.6 per cent at $47.50.Wal-Mart’s discount competitor TargetMeanwhile, Home Depot blamed a “very challenging housing environment” for a flat third-quarter profit, of 73 cents per share, that missed estimates of 75 cents per share.The company cut growth expectations, and now expects a 12 per cent rise in sales and a 4 to 5 per cent rise in earnings per share for the current fiscal year. That’s down from estimates set in August of 14 to 17 per cent growth in sales and a 10 to 14 per cent rise in earnings per share. Shares were off 35 cents, or 1 per cent at $36.05.Excessive pessimism over homebuilder DR Horton was sharply punctured after its earnings were released.The builder reported its fiscal fourth-quarter profit slid 51 per cent against the backdrop of the housing slump, however,Retailer Saks reported net income of $6.18mn, or 5 cents per share, for the fiscal third-quarter, beating estimates of 3 cents per share. Shares in the company rose 38 cents, or 1.9 per cent to $20.27.Shares in Staples were down 54 cents, or 2.1 per cent lower at $25.52 after the company’s earnings excluding one-time items arrived roughly in line with expectations. despite. Staples’ profit rose 18 per cent to $265mn, and the 36 cents per share result just pipped estimates of 35 cents per share.Shares in Ford were off 11 cents, or 1.24 per cent at $8.76 after the company restated earnings citing accounting errors, due to how interest rate hedging by its financial arm, Ford Motor Credit was calculated, dating back to 2001. The revision boosts the company’s net income since then by $850mn and narrows its $7.25bn net loss for the first nine months of 2006 to $7bn.Stock index futures were indicating a bright start in early trade and then pushed higher after retail sales and wholesale inflation reports for October arrived.Headline retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, less than the projected fall of 0.4 per cent, while sales for September were revised lower to a decline of 0.8 per cent, versus an original drop of 0.4 per cent.Excluding automobile sales, the data revealed that sales fell 0.4 per cent, more than the projected decline of 0.3 per cent.“The main story on retail sales was the sharp revisions to the September data, while the October was fairly close to expectations,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The market is apt to still take away a view that the consumer has been restrained in spending the income that had been going to gas when gas prices were higher.”Meanwhile investors were soothed by the inflation picture at the wholesale level. The producer price index fell 1.6 per cent last month versus the expected decline of 0.5 per cent. Excluding food and energy, the core rate fell 0.9 per cent, again well under the expected rise of 0.1 per cent. The core rate rose 0.6 per cent during September and last month’s fall was the largest since August 1993. The core PPI has fallen in four of the past five months.Investors now await the consumer price index for September due on Thursday.Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson ICAP noted the “report doesn’t change our forecast of a 0.2 per cent increase in the core CPI.” Still he concedes “the fact that PPI food prices surprised us on the downside (-0.8 per cent) does shift the risk in the overall CPI.”

Mr Barnholt said KLA would name Mr Levy “chairman emeritus” in recognition of his contributions to the company.Top executives and board members at more than a dozen companies have lost their jobs as a result of backdating, an apparently widespread practice in which the value of an options grant is inflated by changing its grant data to coincide with a low point in a company’s share price.The reshuffle at KLA followed the resignation earlier this week of William McGuire, the chief executive of United Health, the US healthcare group, who was widely regarded as one of the top performing US chief executives. Last week, top executives at McAfee, the anti-virus software group, and CNET, an online publisher, also resigned over backdating.More than 100 companies suspected of options backdating have come under investigation by federal authorities, who are examining whether executives misled shareholders and regulators about options grant dates.Former executives at two companies, Brocade Communications Systems and Comverse Technology, face charges of securities fraud for their alleged roles in backdating schemes.

21;A;Agilent Technologies;2006-07-23T22:58:51Z;Three firms mull bids for Philips chip unit;;Three teams of private equity firms were on Sunday night putting the final touches on bids for the semiconductor division of Philips Electronics, which could be worth more than $10bn in a sale.According to people familiar with the situation, Netherlands-based Philips had set a deadline for the submission of final bids later this week, and would then proceed to determine whether to sell the unit.Competing in the auction is one group composed of Bain Capital, Francisco Partners, and Apax Partners. A second consortium includes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners, which already joined forces to acquire the semiconductors unit of Agilent in 2004. A third group involves Blackstone, Permira and Texas Pacific Group, people familiar with the process said. They cautioned that while bids were due this week, the process was likely to drag on for some time before any decision would be made.Even as interest rates are rising, and the cost of financing acquisitions with debt becomes more expensive, the largest buy-out funds continue to pursue large targets. A buy-out of Philips’ chip unit would represent the largest private equity deal in the technology industry after last year’s $11.3bn purchase of SunGard Data Systems by seven firms.The uncertainty over the future of Philips’ semiconductor division comes amid more dealmaking in the chip business. Over the weekend, Advanced Micro Devices was close to an agreement to buy ATI Technologies of Canada for about $5.5bn, people familiar with the matter said.Philips announced its intention to sell a majority of its chip division in June saying at the time that it had accelerated the process of deciding the future of the unit. It is one of five business units the Dutch technology company operates, and generates about one-sixth of total sales.It said it would reduce its position in the semiconductor unit to a minority either via a flotation or sale to financial buyers, by the end of the year.It did not rule out eventually exiting semiconductor manufacturing entirely. The industry has proven a volatile drag on Philips earnings, as the company shifts from high volume electronics to a healthcare and lifestyle group in which manufacturing is largely out-sourced.Philips said on Sunday it had “no reason to comment” on the interest from private equity because “all options remain open”.The legal separation of that business will be completed by the end of the third quarter. It announced that process in December in order to increase shareholder value. Philips has been under pressure for some time to dismantle its conglomerate structure in order to realise value.
22;A;Agilent Technologies;2006-02-13T18:12:05Z;Google has Wall Street searching for stability;;Google shares suffered another blow on Monday, dropping to their lowest level in four months after the influential business weekly Barron’s warned that the stock could fall by as much as 50 per cent over the next year because of the threat of click fraud and increased competition.Barron’s said that “there could be a lot more tumbling ahead” as the internet search leader grappled with growing competition from Microsoft and Yahoo and pricing pressure on its online advertisement sales.Sentiment towards Google has turned sharply negative since its fourth-quarter results fell short of the most optimistic market expectations. Its shares have shed 26 per cent of their market value over the past four weeks and yesterday fell 4.7 per cent to $345.70.Google’s pull-back weighed on other internet stocks, with Yahoo down 1.5 per cent at $32.04 and online book retailer Amazon falling 1.7 per cent to $37.86.Apple Computer, another stock that had seen its market value soar in recent months, dropped 3.9 per cent to $64.71.The losses left the Nasdaq Composite down 1 per cent at 2,239.81 for the session while the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,262.86 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2 per cent to 10,892.32.Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the market was weighed down by a number of factors, including fear of a hawkish Federal Reserve. He added that the market had dropped below an important technical support level, potentially prompting investors to lose confidence.“The 50-day trendline of the S&P 500 serves as a short to intermediate term barometer for the market’s strength,” he said. “The fact that we are trading below this trendline indicates that stock prices have been deteriorating and are likely to continue until we move back above the line.”Among other movers, coffee chain Starbucks retreated after UBS cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”. The broker cited valuation concerns, saying that there was potential for slower same-store sales growth. Starbucks shares fell 2.6 per cent to $34.57.Merrill Lynch shares were active after reports that the investment bank was in advanced talks to acquire a large stake in money manager BlackRock for $8bn. Merrill was up 1.4 per cent at $73.83. BlackRock surged 8 per cent to $141.99.The quarterly earnings season ends this week. Scientific testing equipment maker Agilent Technologies fell 4 per cent to $34.45 despite announcing a bigger than expected increase in first-quarter profit.Computer makers Hewlett-Packard and Dell, due to report this week, put in mixed shows. HP gained 0.7 per cent to $31.74 and Dell fell 0.7 per cent to $31.57.
23;A;Agilent Technologies;2005-11-22T18:36:40Z;Data handling is key to next telecoms leap;;"Ever since the invention of the telephone, testing and data management have been crucial for success – from the engineers who made sure circuits worked for the first phone calls, through to the complex systems deployed in 3G networks today.The telecommunications industry is now on the edge of a revolution that will see sophisticated data manipulation and reporting techniques applied to every aspect of telecom companies’ business – from relationships with individual subscribers through to large corporate accounts, and management of the network itself.The implications of this revolution are every bit as significant as the first GSM text message sent by Motorola engineers in 1992, or the first satellite phone call in the 1960s. And just like those earlier breakthroughs, we have yet to fully realise what improving data collection and management will mean for the telecoms industry as a whole.Mobile network operators have performed brilliantly in selling the advantages of mobile telecoms to the public, so much so that there will soon be more mobile devices in many European countries than there are people. These devices possess true 21st-century sophistication, with the capability to download e-mail, voicemail and data services such as presentations, video clips and internet access.Traditional voice services look Neanderthal next to today’s super-capable devices, with network statistics from all providers suggesting an increasing take-up of new services as consumers become familiar with the power and range of their mobile phones and PDAs.So far, so good. But now the industry must satisfy and retain its increasingly sophisticated customer base. If today’s average customer expects to be able to make voice calls, send text messages and perhaps to access e-mails via their mobile device, then the average customer 10 years hence will expect to be able to deal in their share portfolio with 100 per cent accuracy over the network; to videoconference with their families from 8,000 miles away, and to edit sales presentations and send them to customers with fully encrypted security.Technically, today’s devices can cope with all of these functions in terms of processing power and memory capacity. Now certainty, security and speed – the qualities that will enable commercial transactions across the mobile network – are coming into focus. The integrity of data transfer between mobile devices and the network must come as close as possible to broadband internet’s standards if consumers are to realise their mobile devices’ potential. What’s more, both consumers and the organisations that deal with them – from stockbrokers through to mortgage lenders, insurance companies and e-commerce outfits – will expect 100 per cent security of transaction and processing. They will also expect these services to be delivered quickly and efficiently, just as they are today over broadband connections.The key to delivering services more quickly and with 100 per cent security is innovative data management. Whereas at one stage good data management meant a green light on all network operations systems, and the knowledge that a service could be provided, now it will mean constant measurement of the quality of delivered services – right down to the level of service received by an individual handset, anywhere on the network.The concept of service in the telecommunications industry is shifting from servicing and managing a network to managing the experience of individual customers and groups of customers.The benefits of this customer-centric service management model are immense. Consumers will be able to access and send encrypted data across the mobile network, enabling a wide range of financial and other services in a completely secure environment. Telecommunications operators will be able to increase the amount of time people spend on their network as the range of uses for mobile devices widens – and increase their revenues and profitability in the process. Finally, the companies offering services across the network to consumers will also see their revenues soar. Better data management will enable the telecommunications network for e-commerce and could be the second phase in the e-commerce revolution that began six years ago with the provision of faster, safer internet access by ISP’s.Customer-centric service management will mean that problems experienced in the delivery of services to an individual handset can be resolved quickly and effectively. Large corporate customers for mobile telephony could see how their subscribed services are being used, by location, handset and service, as well as having access to accurate measurements on network performance that will demonstrate the value for money they are receiving from their network service providers.As telecom service providers implement advanced data management techniques, the effect will be even wider take-up of mobile services than we have seen in the 25-year history of mobile communications. What was once a means of staying in touch will become a bank, a shopping mall and an office – all held in your pocket.New and more sophisticated data management techniques will enable this, helping telecom service providers and their customers to access faster and more secure operations across the mobile network, as well as allowing for better reporting and management of faults.Despite all that we have seen so far, and all that is remarkable in today’s telecommunications industry, there can be no doubt that the best is yet to come.Tom White is UK Managing Director of Agilent Technologies"
24;A;Agilent Technologies;2005-11-02T19:19:49Z;New issues: Junk arena gets boost;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners are set to single-handedly boost junk bond issuance after a weak month for such deals in October with a planned $1bn issue to help fund their buy-out of Agilent Technologies chip business.The two US private equity firms could price the deal as early as next week and it is likely to be split into a number of tranches, according to one person familiar with the transaction.Citigroup, and Lehman Brothers, which provided financing for KKR and Silver Lake’s $2.66bn deal for Agilent’s chip unit, are managing the junk bond sale, along with CSFB.Junk bonds, which are those rated below investment grade, saw issuance of just $7.5bn in October, according to figures from Dealogic, which compared with $19bn in September and was about half the monthly average of $14.9bn for the rest of the year so far.KKR and Silver Lake will also be looking to take out a syndicated loan for $450m-$475m, the person said.The rest of the $2.66bn purchase price for the Agilent business will be funded with equity stakes by the two firms.Kingfisher, the leading European DIY retailer, is set to return to markets after more than two years with a deal worth at least £500m.The company, which is rated two notches above junk by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, is looking to sell a benchmark-size issue with a seven to 10-year maturity, according to Pierre Lebel at SG CIB, which is managing the deal along with BNP Paribas and Royal Bank of Scotland.A benchmark issue is one of at least £500m, but Mr Lebel would not comment on the size beyond that. He said the issue was currently at the road show stage being shown to investors and would be likely to price between November 8 and 11.BP, the UK-listed oil group, has tapped into the demand among European investors for dollar-denominated issues by selling $300m of five-year bonds yesterday. The deal, which was managed by Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada were priced to yield about 39 basis points over 5-year US Treasuries, bankers said.France Telecom is making a private placement of a €300m floating rate note. The deal is being managed by SG CIB, which would not give any further details.
25;A;Agilent Technologies;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Agilent Technologies: The benefit of being local;;Agilent, the testing and measurement business spun off from Hewlett-Packard in 1999, has more claim than most to be regarded as a pioneer of doing business in China.As HP, the company started the first hi-tech joint-venture on the Chinese mainland in 1985, some eight years after David Packard first visited the country.By 2004, China was Agilent’s second-largest market, after the US, and the operation is regularly placed in the top 10 joint-ventures in the country.This, according to the president of Agilent’s electronic measurement group in Asia, Su Hai, bodes well for his parent company as well as for the Chinese marketplace.“China today is the factory for the world,” he says. “But China is itself a very big market for all kinds of products. No one can neglect China.”Nevertheless, making the most of the business opportunity means meeting the demands of domestic Chinese and export customers alike.China is widely seen as a source of low-cost manufacturing, especially in industries such as textiles and consumer electronics. But that is only a partial truth.“The business we are in is not heavily dependent on labour but on the intelligence of our people,” says Mr Su.“For ourselves, labour costs are not so much a reason to locate there. But if we are manufacturing in China, we are best placed to keep up with the pace of the Chinese market. We can produce the things that local customers need.”Aligent’s business is helped by the fact that customers for its testing and measurement products are in some of China’s fastest-growing industries, including telecommunications, life sciences and semiconductors.As a company selling almost entirely to other businesses, there are advantages to operating from a location close to both customers and to the supply chain.Not only does Agilent manufacture in China, but its factories there are increasingly supplied by local partners.Success in China also relies on finding the right joint venture partner from the outset.Although it is now easier for foreign companies to invest in China than it was 20 years ago, a good local partner can still complement the skills of an incomer.“When we started, HP provided the knowledge for the manufacturing operation and the business practices,” says Mr Su.“The partner complemented that with local knowledge, including how to deal with the government and how to expand services and distribution.”Agilent has continued to use joint-ventures to expand its reach, especially in the local Chinese market.Most recently it established a joint-venture with Chengdu Qiafeng Electronics, specifically to develop and make test equipment for the Chinese market.Mr Su maintains that far from being a market driven almost entirely by price, Agilent’s Chinese customers are becoming increasingly demanding as they, in turn, look to improve the quality and efficiency of their operations.
26;A;Agilent Technologies;2005-09-09T22:26:38Z;Former Boeing chief dies;;Lewis Platt, a medical products engineer who rose to become chief executive and chairman of Hewlett-Packard, died on Thursday. He was 64.Mr Platt was most recently lead director of Boeing, where he was chairman of the world’s biggest aircraft manufarcturer from December 2003 to July this year.Mr Platt spent 33 years at HP from 1966 to 1999, serving the last seven years as president and chief executive of the computer and printer maker. In 1993 he succeeded co-founder David Packard as chairman and he continued to serve as president and chief executive until his retirement. He was succeeded by Carly Fiorina.Mr Platt took the helm at HP at a very opportune time. The computer market was thriving and the company’s printer business was booming. In 1994 he was named Technology Leader of the Year by Industry Week and HP was named Top Corporate Performer of the year in 1995 by Forbes.Mr Platt was an advocate of the HP Way, a management culture that promised to treat employees well in exchange for hard work and solid results.However, critics noted that HP under Mr Platt seemed unable to conquer big new markets. The company continued to invent promising technologies, but it failed to develop them into tangible products. HP also failed to capitalise on the internet boom during his watch and observers began to question the company’s lack of direction.Criticism that the company had allowed itself to be outmaneuvered by rivals prompted Mr Platt to agree to split the world’s second-largest computer company into two separate firms, HP and Agilent Technologies. He stepped aside as part of the restructuring and was replaced by Ms Fiorina.Mark Hurd, HP’s current chief executive, said: “He was a natural leader who was enormously well liked. The way he treated people and how he ran the company set an exceptionally high standard of personal decency.”Mr Platt joined Boeing’s board of directors in 1999. He assumed the role of non-executive chairman in 2003 after Boeing’s former chairman and chief executive, Philip Condit, resigned amid ethics scandals.When Mr Condit’s successor, Harry Stonecipher, resigned in March following revelations of an affair with a female executive, Mr Platt led the search for his replacement. He was instrumental in persuading James McNerney to leave 3M to take over as chairman, chief executive and president of Boeing in June.Mr Platt is survived by his wife Joan and their children.
27;A;Agilent Technologies;2005-08-15T21:52:33Z;Agilent shares leap on job cuts and disposals;;Shares in Agilent Technologies shot up about 12 per cent on Monday after the world's largest testing equipment maker agreed to jettison several business lines, including its semiconductor unit, and eliminate 1,300 jobs as part of a restructuring plan that will cut costs by $450m.Private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Silver Lake Partners will pay about $2.66bn for Agilent's chip business. Philips of the Netherlands has agreed to buy Agilent's 47 per cent stake in Lumileds Lighting, the light-emitting diode maker, for about $945m.Agilent said the deals would allow it to focus on its testing and measurement business. The group said it would repurchase about $4bn in shares and buy back $1.15bn in convertible debt in a bid to boost its stock price. “I believe after we complete these transactions by the middle of next year our restructuring will be 85 per cent complete,” said Bill Sullivan, chief executive.Agilent also plans to spin off its system-on-chip and memory test business in 2006.The company has weathered ahard times since it was spun off from Hewlett-Packard, the computer and printer maker, in 2000. Analysts have argued that the company's poor performance has been in part because of its cash-intensive semiconductor business, which has suffered from sharp cyclical swings. The company had signalled that it wanted to sell the chip business.Agilent said it would use proceeds from the sales to acquire product lines more closely related to its core measurement business. The group makes equipment used to test and measure scientific instruments, electronic gear and chemicals.Mr Sullivan said Agilent would look at acquisition opportunities in the bio-analytical measurement market, which includes food and life-sciences testing. He also pointed to opportunities in nanotechnology and homeland security, noting the demand for equipment to monitor air and water quality. He said the moves announced on Monday would reduce the headcount by about 9,400, about one-third of its workforce. In addition to losing about 8,000 jobs via divestments, an additional 1,300 employees would be cut through transfers, attrition and workforce reduction.The company also reported third-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates, as cost-cutting offset a 10 per cent drop in sales.Agilent said net income rose to $104m, or 21 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 31, compared with $100m, or 20 cents, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell to $1.7bn from $1.9bn and gross margins improved by more than 2 percentage points over last year.Agilent shares closed up $3.92 at $30.33 on Monday in New York.
28;A;Agilent Technologies;2005-08-15T17:16:42Z;Lumileds takeover lights way for Philips;;Philips is to buy back up to €1.5bn ($1.8bn) worth of shares and acquire almost total control of a high-tech lighting business set up in a joint venture with Agilent.The Dutch technology group will spend €765m in cash on the California-based company's 47 per cent stake in Lumileds, which they founded in 1999.The acquisition underlines Philips' interest in expanding in the high-margin lighting sector and reducing its exposure in the more cyclical parts of its business, such as semiconductors.Cash-rich Philips, which has made no secret of its hunger for acquisitions, will have 96.5 per cent control of Lumileds by the end ofthe year.An employee trust company will own the remaining 3.5 per cent of the business.Philips, the world's biggest lighting maker, wants to focus on divisions such as healthcare and lighting for growth, amid slowing demand for electronic items and over-capacity in thechip sector.The market for high brightness LEDs of the type produced by Lumileds is expected to grow by an average of 25 per cent annually over the next few years. Philips said Lumileds was expected to grow faster than the market.Analysts said the purchase fitted neatly with its moves to sell non-core assets and make acquisitions in its target sectors.“This acquisition improves the growth and margin profile of its lighting division. With Agilent willing to sell its stake, this was a logical step for Philips,” said Peter Olofsen, analyst at Stroeve, the Dutch stockbroker.Philips, which has an estimated €4bn cash pile, said last month it was considering resuming share buybacks after completing a €500m repurchase earlier this year. It cancelled those shares, as it plans to do with its latest buyback.Its acquisition of the minority stake in Lumileds, which had an operating profit of $83m last year, is expected to boost earnings from next year.Light-emitting diodes, which are used in mobile telephones, shop displays and traffic lights, are expected gradually to usurp bulbs. They are smaller and more environmentally friendly than traditional lights and last longer.
29;A;Agilent Technologies;2005-08-15T17:04:20Z;Agilent fails to bolster Wall Street;;Wall Street made a torpid start to the week on Monday despite a dip in oil prices and bold restructuring plans from Agilent Technologies.Shares in the company soared 13.2 per cent to $29.90 after the electronics and testing equipment maker said it would sell its semiconductor unit to private equity firms for $2.66bn. The company also reported higher quarterly net earnings and said it would sell its stake in Lumileds to Philips for $950m, spin off its SOC and memory test business next year, and begin a $4bn stock repurchase.The market remained umimpressed, however, and at midday the S&P 500 was up just 0.2 per cent at 1,232.96, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,166.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 10,623.23.A slight fall in oil prices helped bolster the market, which had been concerned about several consecutive days of record highs, culminating with Friday’s peak of $67.10. The September crude contract fell 21 cents to $66.65 a barrel.“We are now firmly in the doldrums part of the year,” said Sarah Hunt, senior vice president at Capital Management Associates. “We’re through the earnings season, a lot of people have simply left town and there isn’t much information coming out at the moment.”Two of the day’s most dramatic moves were triggered by unconfirmed stories in the press. Delta Airlines became the biggest loser on the S&P 500 after the airline was reported by the New York Times to be lining up financing for bankruptcy protection. Shares in the troubled airline, which has been on deathwatch by the markets for weeks, fell 16.2 per cent to $1.35.Also, the New York Post reported that Dow Jones, the financial news publisher that owns the Wall Street Journal, may be up for sale. Shares gained 15.4 per cent to $42.77, making it the biggest percentage change in the S&P 500.Also in the media sector, Time Warner gained 1.5 per cent to $18.52 after it emerged that four major investors, including billionaire Carl Icahn, had gained a major stake in the company and were intending to pressure the board to buy back $20bn in stock and spin off the cable business.In retail, Lowe’s, the world’s second biggest home improvement retailer, raised its annual profit forecast after new store openings and demand for kitchens boosted second-quarter profits by 20 per cent. However, the shares gained just 0.1 per cent to $65.27.Wal-Mart was up slightly after saying it continued to expect August same-store sale growth to remain within its previous forecast of 3-5 per cent. Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $48.91.Home Depot is due to report its results on Tuesday, with analysts expecting to say that second-quarter net income rose 12 per cent. Its shares were up 1.1 per cent at $41.72.
30;A;Agilent Technologies;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Agilent set to sell chip unit for $2.66bn;;Agilent announced on Monday the $2.66bn sale of its semiconductor unit as part of a broader restructuring of the technology testing and measurement equipment business.The sale, to Silver Lake Partners and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is the second-biggest buy-out of a technology company, following the $11.3bn purchase of Sungard by the same buyers and other private equity firms earlier this year.It marks the growing interest of private equity firms in an industry that most once shied away from, given the high risk in many new technologies and the often heavy dependence on a handful of key engineering personnel.Agilent, a company which was spun off from Hewlett-Packard, has been under pressure to boost its share price, and has been studying a number of options, including selling this and other divisions.It said on Monday it would also sell its stake in Lumileds Lighting, a joint venture with Dutch group Philips Electronics, and would spin off its memory test unit. The proceeds will go towards a $4bn stock repurchase programme.The broader restructuring announced will see the loss of 1,300 jobs, or about 4.6 per cent of the company’s workforce.Agilent shares jumped more than 13 per cent at the start of trading on Monday, rising to $29.96.Agilent's semiconductor business, which makes chips for a wide range of products from mobile phones to networking equipment and printers, is currently generating revenues of about $1.8bn annually, according to one person familiar with its business, and is set to be the world's biggest private semiconductor company. The unit has been plagued by volatile earnings, however.In the short term, the sale is likely to lead to some restructuring of the chip business as its new owners seek to repair its profit margins and put it on a more stable path. However, the aim will be to invest heavily in research and development in order to turn it back into a growth business, according to the person familiar with the deal. Of 6,600 employees at the chip business, about 1,300 are involved in research and development, this person said.Agilent's semiconductor division largely outsources the production of its chips to manufacturers in Asia, a practice which reduces its need for capital and makes it more suitable for purchase by private equity investors.The willingness of private equity buyers to invest in technology ventures like this signals a new phase of the buy-out business, as investors look for undervalued operations with solid core technology and a position in growth markets.While KKR and other well-known East Coast buy-out firms are relatively new to the technology world, Silver Lake, which was set up in the late 1990s in Silicon Valley, has now been involved in the four biggest deals seen in the industry. The others include the purchase of UGS from EDS, the tech services company, and Seagate, the biggest maker of computer disk drives.Agilent said on Monday its quarterly profits rose 4 per cent to $104m in spite of a 10 per cent fall in revenues.
31;A;Agilent Technologies;2004-11-11T21:30:29Z;Wall Street higher amid oil price decline;;"Wall Street stocks moved higher on Thursday after crude futures staged a freefall and investors found solace in the Federal Reserve's view of the economy the previous day.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,469.84 while the broader S&P 500 index put on 0.9 per cent to 1,173.48. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3 per cent to 2,061.27.Trading was heavier than expected after bond markets were closed owing to a federal holiday. Even with one less source of guidance, stock investors traded about 1.4bn shares at the New York stocks Exchange, about the daily average volume for the year.Crude oil futures fell 2.9 per cent and erased most of the gains in the prior session as rising crude inventories offset concerns about possible shortages of heating oil this winter. The perception that Yassir Arafat's death overnight would help prospects for peace in the Middle East further undermined crude prices as supply worries eased.This offered support to stocks following their initially muted reaction to the widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which reiterated its upbeat view of the world's largest economy.The indices have been bound in a narrow range in the past few sessions, with intraday patterns hinting at a tense tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Some traders characterised the action as bullish consolidation.The bulls will be keen to tack on consistent gains following warnings from some market watchers that the current rally faces technical resistance and that several factors threaten to stop it in its tracks in a similar way to other failed rallies earlier this year.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, attributed much of yesterday morning's gains to the decline in oil prices and the upcoming dividend from Microsoft, set to inject about $30bn in the market.""I think we're coming to the end of it [the current rally] and next year's fundamentals continue to look pretty cloudy,"" Mr Boockvar said.On the corporate front, shares of PeopleSoft eased 1.6 per cent to $22.43 after the company rejected a final takeover bid from Oracle, whose shares edged off 1.8 per cent to $13.14.In other merger-and-acquisition news, Blockbuster launched a $70m offer for Hollywood Entertainment, a rival video rental company.

Jones shares lost 3 per cent to $34.91.In the same sector Target edged back 0.2 per cent to $50.78 after the discount retailer reported a 78 per cent rise in quarterly earnings but missed analyst estimates.Among blue-chips, Coca-Cola lost 0.5 per cent to $40.96 after it lowered its long-term earnings and volume forecasts.Shares in rival PepsiCo were up 0.4 per cent at $51.54.Also lower were shares in Starbucks, the coffee house chain, whose 47 per cent rise in quarterly earnings failed to impress the markets. Shares inched up 0.3 per cent to $55.44.Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market saw shares add 9.8 per cent to $94.57 after it reported a 27 per cent increase in quarterly earnings.Among technology stocks, Dell Computer inched up 1.1 per cent to $37.25 ahead of its quarterly results after the close. Agilent Technologies was also due to report results after the bell, and shares gained 2.5 per cent to $25.68.Semiconductor shares saw buying as RF Micro Devices rose 7.6 per cent to $6.69 following an upgrade to ""neutral"" from ""underperform"" by analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.5 per cent to $18.59 after Merrill Lynch analysts raised their rating for the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".National Semiconductor shares, up 2.5 per cent to $16.26, defied a downgrade from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" by analysts at UBS.Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, gained 1.4 per cent to $23.17 after it named a new chief executive officer replacing Craig Barrett.A less positive note came from Nortel Networks, whose shares fell 5.9 per cent to $3.37 after the telecommunications equipment group delayed the filing of its quarterly results."
