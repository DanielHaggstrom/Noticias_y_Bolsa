0;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rating agencies brace for backlash after rash of downgrades;Critics claim S&P, Moody’s and Fitch might be poised for rerun of 2008 financial crisis;"Credit rating agencies are scrambling to adjust to the coronavirus pandemic, slashing assessments of vulnerable companies under the scrutiny of critics who blame them for exacerbating the last financial crisis.The agencies — led by the big three of S&P Global, Moody’s and Fitch — have pushed through large amounts of rating downgrades as the Covid-19 outbreak has accelerated. March had the fastest pace of downgrades, on records going back to at least 2002, according to a report last week from Bank of America. The bank added that more issuers could expect to have their ratings docked in the weeks ahead.To critics, this is a rerun of the 2008 financial crisis, when ratings that were set too high came tumbling down, magnifying a sense of alarm, particularly in markets for securitised products that were packed with mortgage-backed bonds.“Here we are, déjà vu all over again,” said Dennis Kelleher, head of Better Markets, a consumer advocacy group. Ratings are being cut “after what appears to be . . . significant ratings inflation, also just like last time”, he said.Agencies say they are simply reacting to changed circumstances, reflecting sudden strains that have emerged as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. “We are really just trying to call it as we see it, being balanced, but also acknowledging that this is a very big stress that the economy is facing,” said Craig Parmelee, global head of practices at S&P.About 80 per cent of S&P’s ratings actions since early February — about 213 downgrades out of 4,000 rated non-financial companies — have been on issuers already in “junk” territory before the coronavirus crisis, the company noted.“We are taking a considered approach to downgrades across geographies and asset classes,” said Anne Van Praagh, head of Moody’s credit strategy and research. “Our job is not to move all ratings down; that does not serve anybody. Our job is to identify the outliers.”Concerns that ratings were set too high before the coronavirus outbreak stem from the business models of the agencies, which are paid by the companies and the governments whose creditworthiness they assess. A rating from a top agency can make the sale of a bond or a loan much easier, providing investors with notionally independent views of the borrower’s prospects. Such views are also hard-wired into the mandates under which many fund managers operate, forcing them to sell bonds if ratings drop below certain thresholds.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.But issuers generally pay to be rated — a structure that can cause conflicts, leading to accusations that agencies compete to win business by offering high ratings.In 2015, S&P agreed to pay the US and states about $1.4bn to settle allegations that it boosted ratings on mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis, admitting that it held off on downgrades for fear of losing market share. Moody’s paid $864m in 2017 to settle similar charges.Today the pair accounts for 81 per cent of outstanding credit ratings, according to a January 2020 report from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fitch makes up another 13.5 per cent of the market.Before the outbreak intensified, regulators had been asking questions about the agencies’ business practices. In November SEC chair Jay Clayton said the activities of the agencies should be “continually” monitored, while asking whether there were “alternative payment models” that would better align the interests of rating agencies with investors.Egan-Jones, a smaller rating agency that is paid by investors rather than issuers, said in a January letter to the SEC that “no amount of disclosure or internal separation of ratings and marketing staff is sufficient to overcome the taint created by such conflicts”.In their letters of response to the SEC, Moody’s and S&P said potential conflicts were inherent in all rating-agency business models.It is still the same after 10 years. Nothing much has changedAnalysts note that the “issuer pays” model also causes some recipients of downgrades to behave as if they are aggrieved customers of the agencies, rather than subjects of unbiased assessments. Last month SoftBank, the debt-laden Japanese group, complained about a downgrade from Moody’s, saying the agency had made “excessively pessimistic” assumptions about the market environment.Investors often make decisions independently of the assessments of rating agencies. This week, cruise operator Carnival paid handsomely for a new bond issue despite its “investment-grade” ratings, as fund managers judged the company to be in peril after the viral outbreak.The debate over rating agencies’ business models is unlikely to fade, as this time the scope of cuts is much broader than the realm of structured products. Already, downgrades of big companies such as carmaker Ford and retailer Marks and Spencer, from the lowest rung of investment-grade ratings into junk, have appeared to cause ructions in credit markets.The old flaws in business models are becoming obvious once more, said Riddha Basu, an assistant professor at George Washington University.“It is still the same after 10 years,” he said. “Nothing much has changed.”"
1;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-03-30T16:11:39Z;South Africa’s rand hits record low after debt downgrade;Coronavirus inflicts further damage on country already hit by poor economic growth;The South African rand hit a record low against the US dollar after Moody’s removed the last investment-grade credit rating for Africa’s most industrialised economy, citing the hit to economic growth from the coronavirus pandemic.The rand weakened as much as 2 per cent to move past 18 against the US dollar on Monday, following the rating agency’s downgrade of South African debt to junk on Friday. By mid-afternoon, the currency had regained a little ground to trade at 17.99.The Moody’s downgrade completed South Africa’s descent into junk status after rivals S&P Global and Fitch Ratings removed their investment-grade ratings in 2017, highlighting mounting strains on public finances and persistently poor economic growth.South African bonds will now be removed from indices used worldwide to track investment-grade debt, adding to pressure on the currency as some investors will be forced by their mandates to sell their holdings.Moody’s kept the country’s debt on a negative outlook as it said that the shutdown of pandemic-struck economies around the world “will exacerbate” economic and fiscal challenges.“South Africa is entering a period of much lower global growth in an economically vulnerable position,” the rating agency said. “The government's own capacity to limit the economic deterioration . . . is constrained.”The country is under a three-week lockdown ordered by president Cyril Ramaphosa. Cases of coronavirus in South Africa have surged past 1,000.Even before the crisis, government debts were expected to rise to more than two-thirds of economic output as a result of costly bailouts for struggling state companies and weak growth.“To say we are not concerned and trembling in our boots about what might be in the coming weeks and months is an understatement,” said Tito Mboweni, the South African finance minister, at the weekend.FTSE Russell, operator of the widely-used benchmark World Government Bond index, has postponed the removal of South African bonds until the end of April because of what it called “extremely stressed” markets.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.South African bonds have a weighting of about 0.4 per cent in the index, which implies up to $10bn of forced selling, according to UBS analysts. They said part of this outflow was likely to have taken place, adding: “As a rough rule of thumb, we estimate that a $5bn portfolio outflow shock can be neutralised by a 5 to 10 per cent depreciation in the real exchange rate.”The rand has lost more than a quarter of its value this year.South African government debt has sharply sold off in recent weeks as investors pulled money out of emerging markets at a record pace.The yield on South African 10-year bonds rose above 12 per cent last week before the country’s central bank announced it would begin buying government debt in secondary markets to calm the turmoil.

Those actions have triggered a 55 per cent jump in its share price, which fell to a four-year low last week as investors panicked over its hefty debt exposure. That stood at $170bn at the end of last year, so the $23bn just allotted by SoftBank for paying off debt will not make a big dent in that.It’s this kind of irritating scrutiny by the likes of Moody’s that makes a founder like Masayoshi Son think about going private, which is exactly what happened last week, according to our FT scoop.1. Amazon and Flipkart caught up in Indian freeze
India’s biggest ecommerce businesses Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have been forced to suspend all services, amid confusion over whether their couriers are exempt from the strict 21-day coronavirus lockdown.2. Broadband engineers lockdown
Frustrated broadband users in the UK looking to change internet provider may not be able to switch after BT said its Openreach engineers would prioritise essential fault repairs and upgrades to avoid unnecessary home visits. Broadband provider Virgin Media is hiring 500 call centre people in the UK to cope with customers looking to upgrade their broadband. 3. BBC suspends job cuts
The BBC has suspended a sweeping reform of its news operations to concentrate on its public broadcasting role during the coronavirus crisis, temporarily saving the jobs of hundreds of journalists. Director-general Tony Hall said the proposed £40m worth of cuts, which would lead to shows being taken off air and 450 job losses, was to be put on ice.4. Tech predictions for a post-virus world
It is hard to imagine what the world will look like in a year’s time after just a few weeks of coronavirus-enforced quarantine. Will “stream shaming” become a popular pastime? Will iPod prices shoot up on eBay? Tim Bradshaw predicts what he might be reporting on a year from now.Chinese start-up Royole has been a pioneer in flexible and foldable screens in phones, beating Samsung and Huawei to the punch in 2018 with the first commercialised foldable phone, the Royole FlexPai (pictured above).It has been slower out of the blocks with its follow-up, the FlexPai 2, finally unveiling some details of its forthcoming model in a Wednesday presentation. It comes with a large, 7.8-inch external 'outie' display with a 4:3 aspect ratio, reports Tech Radar. It will also feature a more robust hinge system. The launch is expected in the next three months, but no pricing is available yet"
3;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-03-25T12:24:02Z;SoftBank attacks Moody’s after debt downgrade;Rating agency’s decision to move technology group down two notches draws angry response;SoftBank has demanded that Moody's remove all of its bond ratings on the Japanese conglomerate, after the rating agency issued a two-notch downgrade that cut its debt deeper into junk status. The group led by Masayoshi Son, the risk-seeking Japanese dealmaker, immediately accused Moody’s on Wednesday of having “biased and mistaken views”.The downgrade came two days after SoftBank said it planned to sell $41bn of its assets to pay down its heavy debt load and to hugely increase the scale of a share buyback.Those actions have triggered a 55 per cent jump in SoftBank share price, which fell to a four-year low last week as investors panicked over its hefty debt exposure. Moody’s cited SoftBank’s “aggressive financial policy” for its decision to cut its rating from Ba1 to Ba3, saying the value of the group’s portfolio would be reduced if it sold off its lucrative stakes in Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba and Sprint during the market volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “Asset sales will be challenging in the current financial market downturn, with valuations falling and a flight to safety,” said Motoki Yanase, Moody’s senior credit officer, in a statement. The company hit back, saying: “[SoftBank Group] believes that Moody’s ratings action is based on excessively pessimistic assumptions regarding the market environment and misunderstanding that SBG will quickly liquidate assets without any thorough consideration.”The downgrade may increase borrowing costs for the group, which has $55bn in net debt. Yields on SoftBank’s perpetual bonds, which have no maturity date, climbed above 11 per cent after a sell off in Wednesday morning trading.The FT revealed this week that Mr Son explored an attempt to take the company private over the weekend with investors including activist hedge fund Elliott Management, before choosing to proceed with a plan to sell its assets.While the company has not revealed what it will sell, analysts expect the sale to be a mix of its shares in US carrier Sprint following its merger with T-Mobile, Alibaba, and its domestic mobile unit which is listed on the Tokyo market. People close to the company said the choice of assets would change depending on market conditions. This month, rating agency S&P Global cut its outlook on SoftBank to negative after it also raised concerns about the group’s earlier plan to carry out a smaller share buyback. But following SoftBank’s announcement on Monday, S&P said the huge asset sale has “potential to ease the downward pressure on its credit quality” and reduce its debt load by ¥2tn ($18bn). “As much as we hate to pick sides, we do not follow Moody's rationale here,” said Mary Pollock, an analyst at research firm CreditSights. But Ms Pollock said that she believed the rating agency was behind the curve in cutting the Japanese group's rating.“We would go so far as to say Moody's are using the [SoftBank Group] asset sale announcement as an excuse to re-rate a credit which was overdue a downgrade,” she said.While its debt relative to cash flow mean that western rating agencies class SoftBank as junk, the group has an investment-grade rating from the local Japanese rating agency, JCR.SoftBank has taken advantage of this higher domestic credit rating to raise debt from retail investors. The group last year became the biggest issuer of debt sold to “Mrs Watanabe”, the catch-all term for Japan’s army of retail investors, accounting for more than half of all outstanding retail bonds from companies and financial institutions in March last year.
4;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Corporate borrowing costs soar amid default fears;Interest rates for even highly rated companies double from levels of days ago;Borrowing costs for companies around the world are rising dramatically despite central bank interest rate cuts as rating agencies warn that the economic impact of the coronavirus will lead to a surge of corporate downgrades and defaults.Fears about creditworthiness are prompting investors to put their money in the most easily traded securities — such as short-term government debt — raising borrowing costs for more highly rated corporate borrowers and choking off credit to riskier ones.Rating agency Moody’s estimates the default rate for speculative-grade companies could hit nearly 10 per cent, with energy companies particularly hard hit. That is up from 2.3 per cent a year ago, and a historical average of 4 per cent.“I think the pandemic coupled with the oil price crash and the asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across regions, sectors and markets,” said Anne Van Praagh, a researcher at Moody’s.“The combined credit effects are unprecedented. This is not like anything we have seen before.”Even highly rated companies that have been able to sell bonds during the outbreak have agreed to deals that will increase their total financing costs by hundreds of millions of dollars as revenues are threatened by an economic downturn.The average yield for investment-grade corporate debt has risen from a year to date low of 2.26 per cent two weeks ago to 4.7 per cent on Friday, according to an index run by Ice Data Services.“It’s brutal. We have never seen such a big move in such a short amount of time,” said Monica Erickson, a portfolio manager at DoubleLine. “This is the quickest and most severe I have ever experienced, and I was around for 2008.”For higher-risk “junk” rated companies, the sell-off has been even more severe, with the average yield on an index run by Ice doubling this month to over 10 per cent.Companies have scrambled to raise as much cash as possible, with roughly $60bn of bonds sold by investment grade companies this week in the US, including more than $16bn on Friday.The companies selling debt are all high-quality names, such as a $5bn bond sale for Coca-Cola and an $8bn deal for Intel, with those outside the very top tier still shut out from capital markets.“Companies are focused on increasing liquidity, drawing down revolvers and accessing cash wherever possible. They are preparing for the worst because we are in an unprecedented environment,” said Ms Erickson.
5;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-02-19T13:42:02Z;Bankruptcy risks rise for US shale;Credit crunch looms for producers as ‘staggering’ amount of debt nears maturity;Bankruptcy risks in the US shale sector are rising, with weak oil prices and tightening access to credit worsening the outlook for some producers just as a “staggering” $86bn in debt maturities start to come due.Speculative-grade, or subinvestment, debt makes up more than 60 per cent of the total to be repaid between now and 2024, “implying a higher degree of default risk for the industry”, said Moody’s, the rating agency, in a report on Wednesday. Speculative-grade maturities will peak in 2022, dwarfing investment-grade maturities by almost two to one that year, Moody’s said. But weakening oil and gas prices, and bearish market sentiment — caused by expectations of a global oil-supply overhang in the first half of 2020 — will hurt producers’ efforts to raise more money this year, in turn threatening to starve them of capital to invest in production to keep cash flow intact, said analysts.Companies already rated at subinvestment level and those focused on natural gas are especially exposed and will face investors that have developed a “risk aversion” to the sector, said the Moody’s report. Natural gas-focused Antero Resources, EQT and Chesapeake, which between them hold debt of more than $5bn due to mature between now and 2024, were among 12 companies Moody’s said would face a “particularly challenging” refinancing outlook.“While these companies have already taken some measures to address maturities, more needs to be done,” said Moody’s.In January, the average interest rate paid by shale producers for corporate debt rated by Moody’s as B3, or highly speculative, was 400-500 basis points above the average for B3 rated debt across all sectors, said Sajjad Alam, the lead author of the Moody’s report. Oil prices have fallen more than 15 per cent since early January, reflecting worries about global oversupply that have been exacerbated by the weakness of Chinese demand since the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, front-month US natural gas prices plunged to their lowest February close in 20 years last week, amid unseasonably warm weather.But US shale producers are also victims of their own longer-term success. Natural gas output in the Lower 48 states of the contiguous US has almost doubled since 2005 and crude oil production has leapt almost 160 per cent since 2008.US natural gas production, which hit a record high in 2019, would rise by another 2 per cent this year, according to a forecast last week by the Energy Information Administration, a division of the Department of Energy. Crude oil production would increase almost 8 per cent, to 13.2m barrels a day, it said.That already represents a slowing of recent annual growth rates, but the looming credit crunch and increased cost of capital for indebted producers, alongside persistent weakness in oil and gas prices, could further damp production growth expectations, said analysts.

The other main agency Fitch has an investment grade rating for the company’s debt.The downgrade of the French carmaker’s debt to Ba1 by Moody’s was based on its view that the carmaker would need time to restore healthy profit margins.“Based on the company’s 2020 guidance anticipating a further decline in the group’s operating margin and the continuing weakness of the market environment, we do not expect that Renault will be able to restore healthy operating margin levels in the medium term,” Moody’s said in a statement. Moody’s outlook for the rating is now stable.S&P said the move “reflects our belief that a recovery in free cash flow generation in line with our earlier expectations . . . might take longer than 24 months.“We believe that the company's intended countermeasures could be difficult to implement, given the unfavourable market conditions, and this could stir up resistance from various stakeholders.”Renault declined to comment.The carmaker’s shares have fallen close to 30 per cent this year. That performance follows a year during which the arrest of former boss Carlos Ghosn shook the group and its relationship with partner Nissan and saw both sides of the alliance shake up their management teams.Those pressures are piled on top of the woes suffered by the car industry at large, which is grappling with slowing demand in China and tough new targets for CO2 emissions.Renault last week revealed that its profits were almost wiped out in 2019 as it faced falling margins in its core business — predicted at 3 to 4 per cent next year, down from 4.8 per cent in 2019 — and a collapse in income from Nissan. Contributions from Nissan, of which Renault owns 43 per cent, dropped 84 per cent to €242m last year. This followed the worst performance at the Japanese carmaker for a decade.Renault also cut its dividend and lowered profit guidance for this year as it launched a €2bn restructuring effort, with interim chief executive Clotilde Delbos set to announce swingeing cuts in the near future.However, sentiment was further hit on Tuesday, said analysts, by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire warning the company that it should not close factories or endanger French jobs as part of its cost-cutting.Renault will hope to have put some of its issues behind it by the time incoming chief executive Luca de Meo, who replaces ousted Thierry Bolloré, joins the group this summer from Volkswagen.“Over the past 20 years, Renault has gone from daring to drifting, selling both low-margin products and assets under pressure over time,” said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies, in a note to clients.
7;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-02-17T04:00:14Z;North America and Asia fail to keep pace in green bond boom;European issuers account for nearly half of the market;Green bonds are booming. But while they head for another record-breaking year, North American and Asian markets have failed to keep pace.European issuers grew from 39 per cent of the market in 2018 to 45 per cent in 2019, while North America’s share remained flat and Asia saw a decline.Europe also dominates the rest of the world in the emerging sector of sustainability-linked loans, which reward companies for hitting certain sustainability goals without specifying how the proceeds must be used.Within the green bond market, Moody’s analysts identify a particular weakness among North American non-financial corporate issuers, which only represented $11bn of the $258bn in green bonds that came to market.Last year’s $1bn green bond from Verizon might encourage other US companies to tap into the market, Moody’s said. But it is now a full year since that Verizon bond came to market, and no such rush has materialised yet.Green bonds are not the only component of the sustainable debt market. When other types of debt are taken into account such as green loans, social bonds and sustainability-linked loans and bonds, the US market is on an upswing, says Dan Shurey, vice-president of sustainable finance at ING.“I expect 2020 to be another strong year for sustainable debt in the US, and particularly among corporates. Sustainability has become a central focus on corporate agendas, and companies will turn to capital markets and sustainable lenders to fund new sustainability commitments,” he said.The Asian market was dragged down by a drop among Chinese issuers, but a new push to standardise the definition of green assets — similar to the EU’s incoming green “taxonomy” — has gained support from five Chinese ministries and will probably spur growth in the future, Moody’s said.The rest of the world, including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, have a long way to go, accounting for just a combined $11bn in 2019. Still, Moody’s is also bullish on growing issuance in these regions, due to “significant needs for sustainable development”.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
9;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-01-20T13:26:47Z;Moody’s cuts Hong Kong rating on rising concerns over government;Agency warns on territory’s institutional strength and governance after months of protests;Moody’s has cut Hong Kong’s credit rating, saying the government’s “slow” and ineffective response to months of protests has prompted it to reassess the Chinese territory’s institutional strengths and governance.Hong Kong’s rating was reduced by one notch to Aa3 from Aa2, making Moody’s the second major agency to cut its rating since protests began last summer.“The underlying drivers of the protests are certainly deep-seated and intractable,” Moody’s said. “Nevertheless, the response by Hong Kong’s government to both political demands by parts of the population and broader concerns about living standards in [Hong Kong], housing costs and equality of economic opportunities has been notably slow, tentative and inconclusive.”The territory’s economy has come under strain — and its place as one of Asia’s pre-eminent financial hubs called into question — as chief executive Carrie Lam’s government has struggled to contain months of violent clashes between policy and protesters.HSBC, the territory’s biggest lender, was forced this month to close branches after it was accused of helping police close an account used to raise funds for demonstrators.Moody’s warned in its report issued late on Monday Hong Kong time that the lack of an effective response points to more “significant constraints on the autonomy of Hong Kong’s institutions than previously thought, notwithstanding the ‘one country, two systems” policy which has underpinned autonomy for the last two decades”.When Fitch cut Hong Kong’s rating in September, it expressed concerns over the extent of Beijing’s control over the territory.“Months of persistent conflict and violence are testing the perimeters and pliability of the ‘one country, two systems’ framework that governs Hong Kong’s relationship with the mainland, underscored by mainland officials taking a more public stance on Hong Kong affairs than at any time since the 1997 handover,” the report said.The ‘one country, two systems’ relationship between Hong Kong and China is a crucial element that has for more than two decades drawn businesses to Hong Kong. The territory provides foreign groups with access to China and the region more generally, but with a legal system and other protections that analysts say are more closely aligned to international norms than on mainland China.Moody’s said that signs that the relationship is fraying raise “the risk that actions by foreign governments negatively impact its competitiveness and economic strength and hinder the effectiveness of policymaking still further”. It pointed specifically to a US law passed last year that could lead to the revocation of trade and other commercial privileges Washington extends to Hong Kong.

The plumber you call to fix the boiler insists it needs replacing, at vast cost to you and benefit to them. The car mechanic says your head gasket has blown. But has it really?Whenever there is an asymmetry of knowledge — and many are ignorant about the ins and outs of boilers and car engines — the scope for being ripped off is large.The realm of credit ratings is more heavily stacked against users than the flaky plumber or mechanic could even dream. It is the equivalent of a boiler manufacturer paying the plumber who recommends and installs its equipment — a bargain until the boiler blows up and destroys your house.That, crudely, is what happened in the US subprime mortgage market in 2008, when large chunks of home loan debt, repackaged as triple A-rated derivative investments, defaulted and left end investors with billions of dollars of losses.Global policymakers came down hard on most culprits in the financial crisis — investment banks, structured credit specialists and hedge funds all found their moneymaking curtailed by regulation.But rating agencies got off lightly. Yes, they were fined by the US Department of Justice and they attracted some fresh regulation. But they also got a huge boost from policymakers. The decade of record-low interest rates has produced a bonanza of debt. Last year marked a new $2.6tn high for corporate bond issuance, according to Dealogic. Most of it has gone through the sausage machine of being rated for creditworthiness by the oligopoly ratings providers, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch.S&P and Moody’s dominate the market and their financial performance has soared. In their last quarterly results to September, both reported a leap in profits. S&P’s net income was up 25 per cent to $617m. Moody’s rose 22 per cent to $379m. In each case, growth in rating activity resulting from the expansion of debt issuance was a key driver. Full-year numbers due soon are expected to be bumper, too.This is not only an irony of the crisis. The root problem, whereby toxic assets were spread around the world before 2008 thanks to the misleading reassurance of a high-grade rating, remains unchanged. Today, with far more debt in issuance, the same may well be happening again.Tougher capital rules mean banks are better protected. More vigilant regulators will help protect the financial system. But the basic premise of debt investment predicated on flawed credit ratings is the same.The flaws are multiple. Aside from the obvious concerns about this being such a concentrated market, and the world’s failure to regulate rating agencies properly, there are two clear shortcomings that threaten to cause havoc in future.First, rating agencies use essentially backward-looking methodologies. That was painfully evident in the financial crisis and has been demonstrated in a string of idiosyncratic company blow-ups, from Parmalat to Steinhoff, that the agencies were slow to spot. This approach also makes ratings pro-cyclical when things do go wrong.Second, there is the boiler-destroying-your-house business model. Some big bond investors have dealt with the inherent conflict of interest of a bond issuer paying for its own rating by ignoring ratings altogether. Pimco, one of the biggest, has spent the past decade building a team of 70 in-house credit analysts, obviating the need to use S&P and Moody’s research at all. But most debt investors cannot afford such an overhead.Small competitors such as Germany’s Scope are trying to shake up the model. At least some of its revenue comes from charging asset management clients to rate prospective bond investments, rather than earning the fees from the bond issuers. But the company remains tiny compared with the big three and the more wholesome fee model is an outlier.That leaves a rather depressing outlook. As the world’s debt mountain grows, and credit risk with it, one of the big lessons that should have been learnt from the financial crisis has been ignored. For the foreseeable future, investors will continue to place blind faith in agencies’ credit ratings. But come the market downturn, that credit — from triple A to triple C — risks exploding in their faces.patrick.jenkins@ft.comRatings agencies have made big changes since the financial crisis / From Yann Le Pallec, S&P Global Ratings, New York, NY, USMoody’s greatest asset is the quality and integrity of our credit ratings / From Michael West, President, Moody’s Investors Service, New York, NY, US
11;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-01-07T04:00:39Z;Green bonds set to keep flying off shelves in 2020;Pace of issuance exceeds expectations, spurred by strong demand from investors;Green bonds are red hot. Issuance smashed through analysts’ projections in 2019 and is set to continue expanding this year as sustainability-minded investors snap up almost every deal that hits the market.Through the end of September, more than $189bn in green bonds — whose proceeds are used to fund environmentally-friendly projects — had come to market for the year, outstripping 2018’s total of $171bn. Credit-rating agency Moody’s had predicted a record-setting year for green bonds from the outset, but had to revise its projection to $250bn from $200bn after growth exceeded expectations. The average offering is more than three times oversubscribed, according to a recent report from BNP Paribas.Companies were the biggest green-bond issuers of the year, accounting for 46 per cent of the market through the end of the third quarter. That trend continued through the final three months. Apple launched a €2bn offering in November — its first euro-denominated green bonds — in one of the continent’s largest sustainable debt deals.Moody’s expects even stronger growth this year, spurred by the EU’s newly approved set of guidelines on what counts as a sustainable investment, which were drawn up to curb the practice of “greenwashing”, or making misleading claims about environmental benefits. The new taxonomy is “a clear signal to the financial markets that sustainable investment should become the new mainstream”, Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP told the Financial Times.
12;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-01-02T05:00:39Z;Scope faces uphill struggle to crack credit rating market;The German company has ambitions to be a European rival to S&P, Moody’s and Fitch;Inside the boardroom of Scope Ratings’ Berlin headquarters is a pair of ancient binoculars mounted on a wooden tripod.A gimmick designed to show visitors that the boardroom has a direct line of sight into the German chancellery a mile to the north, the binoculars are also a reminder that the company’s ambitions require it to take the long view.Scope is trying to break into the lucrative business of rating the debt sold by governments and companies, an industry long dominated by the US trio of Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. The three control more than 90 per cent of the European market, according to the European Securities and Markets Authority.Founded two decades ago, and initially focused on rating investment funds, Scope started aiming higher in 2014 when it poached Torsten Hinrichs, the former head of S&P in Germany, to spearhead its expansion. It followed that in 2015 by securing investment from Stefan Quandt, one of the country’s richest men.“It is our goal to break into the global ratings oligopoly,” says Mr Hinrichs, now an adviser to the company. “We want to be the European alternative to Standard & Poors, Moody’s and Fitch.”Although Scope doubled its European market share in 2018, the German company has not yet had any more success than other smaller competitors in breaking the stranglehold of the big US agencies. At just 0.5 per cent, its share of the European market lags behind that of Canada’s DBRS, another challenger.The hurdles facing Scope are reflected in its recent financial results, according to a briefing for investors seen by the Financial Times. After climbing 54 per cent to €16m in 2018, Scope’s revenues have stalled over the first nine months of 2019, while its losses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation widened to €14.3m, the briefing shows.Despite S&P, Moody’s and Fitch coming under fire for their role in the financial crisis, the industry has proved difficult for anyone else to crack.Companies are often reluctant to look beyond the big agencies for the ratings that help set their cost of borrowing. At the same time, those investors who rely on ratings when buying bonds can be loath to stray from the agencies they know.In Europe, regulations are another obstacle. The European Central Bank, for example, only accepts bonds that have been rated by Scope’s three big rivals as well as DBRS as collateral in its monetary refinancing operation.“As a newcomer, Scope is facing an uphill battle to be taken seriously by investors and for now is lacking the same market acceptance as the big rating agencies,” said Dirk Bartsch, head of strategic investor relations at Commerzbank, which is one of Scope’s clients.Yet Florian Schoeller, Scope’s chief executive and largest shareholder, is undaunted. The company, which was valued at €150m in its latest fundraising in July, had enough resources to expand its coverage of large European companies to the level of S&P and Moody’s within the next 30 months, he said.Under Mr Hinrichs, the former S&P analyst, Scope pursued an aggressive expansion that saw its staff numbers jump from 50 to the current total of more than 200.And it has had some notable wins.In December, it secured Vonovia, Germany’s largest residential landlord, as its fourth blue-chip domestic client after Daimler, Lufthansa and Merck. Overall, Scope says it is rating about 30 per cent of the banks and corporates represented in the iBoxx euro investment grade index.A large European company has hired Scope because it wants to “foster more competition on the market for credit ratings”, a senior executive told the Financial Times. The big three’s grip results in high fees, and “a certain amount of group think”, the person added.S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, whose European operations each employ more than three times the staff of Scope, said they welcome competition.Scope said that weak revenues in the first nine months of 2019 were caused by a change in regulation that temporarily hurt its structured finance business. The group said it expected revenues to increase by 50 per cent in 2020 and aimed to break even by 2021.“The market for credit ratings is a highly attractive segment for investors,” said Mr Schoeller. Starting a new agency from scratch demanded a lot of upfront investment and “a longer time horizon than the four years common for private equity”, he added.Mr Quandt, who is the single-largest shareholder in BMW and injected a “low, double-digit euro amount” into Scope in 2015, wants to see a serious European rival emerge to take on the US market leaders.“The key motivation for the investment was to counter the market dominance of US rating agencies with a European challenger that has a better understanding of the European economic area, its entrepreneurial players and its banks,” a spokesperson for Mr Quandt said.That will require more European companies to shift their business.Sophie Palagos, head of the financial institutions team at Paris-based asset manager Ostrum, which has €275bn of assets under management, said that although the “quality of Scope’s analysis is good”, the group was struggling to win the attention of bond investors.When a company’s rating was downgraded by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch, it “can drive change in credit spreads, [but] this is not really the case for Scope at this stage”, she said.Two large Frankfurt-based asset managers and one of Europe’s largest insurance groups said that Scope’s ratings did not hold any sway for them.For now, Scope’s backers are standing firm. A year ago, several European insurance companies including HDI and Signal Iduna bought stakes. Earlier this year, RAG-Stiftung, a foundation linked to funding the liabilities of now closed coal mines, paid €3.5m for a 2.3 per cent stake, according to a person familiar with the transaction.One of the company’s institutional investors told the Financial Times that it was not worried by the company’s results in 2019.“We have to see through the fact that Scope is still in its investment phase,” said the person. Turning a profit within a few years “will require a lot of hard work, but we think it is an achievable goal”.
13;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-12-20T11:29:14Z;Moody’s warns on frothy US junk bond market;Rally in riskier end of debt market has left asset class expensive relative to fundamentals;US junk bonds may fall “significantly” after a rally this year that has left the riskier end of the corporate bond market in a perilous state, Moody’s has warned.The rating group’s capital research arm said late on Thursday that the strong gains in high-yield credit in 2019 have left borrowing costs out of line with the business climate.“High-yield bonds have rallied mightily despite the lack of any observable broad-based acceleration of either business sales or corporate earnings,” Moody’s said in a report led by economist John Lonski.“If the anticipated improvement in the fundamentals governing corporate credit quality do not materialise, a significant widening of high-yield bond spreads is likely.”The spread or difference in yield between junk bonds and Treasuries — a measure of the premium investors demand to hold the bonds — has pulled back significantly this year as yields have declined. The fall in yield points to a rise in price.On Thursday, the spread on US junk bonds was 354 bps (3.54 percentage points), down by 200 bps from a January peak, according to a closely watched Intercontinental Exchange index. The asset class has delivered returns, including coupon payments, of 12 per cent this year — the strongest performance since a rebound in 2016 that followed a wobble the previous year.Investors have had to hunt higher and higher on the risk spectrum in a global market that has been starved for yield, providing a boost to lowly-rated credits.Moody’s cautioned, however, that high-yield bonds now appear to be expensive relative to the fundamentals implied by a variety of economic and market gauges even if spreads are not especially low by historic standards.The report notes that a model including elements like expected default rates, private-sector employment and a Federal Reserve national economic index suggests spreads should be in the 420 bps to 480 bps range.At the same time, “the high-yield bond market has effectively ignored a comparatively elevated ratio of downgrades to upgrades for US high-yield credit rating changes,” Moody’s said. The ratio during the fourth quarter of 2019 is set to come in at around 1.86 downgrades for each upgrade, “well above” the 1.32-to-one median recorded during each quarter stretching back to 1986.Wall Street analysts are optimistic for profits next year: earnings per share of groups listed on S&P’s composite 1,500 index are forecast to rise 10 per cent next year, after stalling in 2019, FactSet data show. Still, economic growth is expected to ease from and estimated 2.3 per cent in 2019 to 1.8 per cent in 2020.Moody’s warning echoes that of other high-profile names in the fixed income market who have recently said high-yield bonds may be vulnerable.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine has said “losses will be huge when the economy turns down”. Pimco, the bond-focused manager that oversees almost $1.9tn in assets, has said it remains “cautious” even as “central banks are accommodative and near-term sources of uncertainty have been reduced.”
14;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-12-03T11:44:13Z;Companies vow to improve climate disclosure after TCI warning;Moody’s and Airbus among those targeted by hedge fund over emissions;Companies including Charter Communications and Moody’s have vowed to improve their environmental disclosures after receiving warning letters from activist hedge fund TCI, which has said it will vote against directors at groups that do not publish their carbon dioxide emissions.TCI, a long-only fund with $28bn under management, has launched a campaign to force companies in its portfolio to disclose their emissions and publish plans to reduce them. Founder Christopher Hohn has been an outspoken advocate for greater disclosure on carbon dioxide emissions, arguing that investors must step in as governments have not yet made climate-related disclosures mandatory.Ten companies — including Airbus, Moody’s, Safran and Charter Communications — have received letters from TCI reprimanding them over their climate records.Moody’s pledged to improve after it was criticised for receiving a “D grade” in its emissions rating from CDP, a non-profit climate assessment group.“Moody’s takes shareholder input on ESG [environmental, social, governance] issues seriously,” a spokesman said, pointing to the group’s recent acquisition of several sustainability related businesses.Although Moody’s is increasingly focused on environmental risks in its ratings business, the group received the low grade from CDP because it has not set any emissions targets for its own business.“It is untenable for Moody’s to achieve such a low score when seeking to demonstrate environmental leadership,” TCI warned in its letter. “It may also leave Moody’s at a competitive disadvantage relative to peers.”TCI, which holds a 3 per cent stake in Moody’s, also asked the agency to lobby for better disclosure from banks about the exposure of their loan books to climate risk.“Moody’s must advocate for banks to disclose climate change risks associated with their loan books,” the activist hedge fund wrote.Charter Communications, the US cable telecoms group in which TCI holds a 4.2 per cent stake, was also quick to respond to the campaign.“Charter Communications will be issuing its inaugural ESG report in the coming weeks and has met with TCI to discuss their concerns,” a spokesperson said. The group does not currently disclose its emissions.Several companies including Airbus said they were still preparing their response to the letter they had received. Guillaume Faury, chief executive of the aerospace group, is speaking with the fund later this week.Safran said it was looking into the seven recommendations made by TCI and that it would “set up goals” to address some of the shareholder’s points. Most of the recommendations are already “quite aligned” with the French defence group’s existing goals, a spokesperson said.While carbon emissions disclosures were once considered an afterthought for investors, they are now becoming a higher priority for many fund managers as they focus on climate-related risks.“Investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its pollution is like investing in a company that doesn’t disclose its balance sheet,” Sir Christopher said in an interview with the Financial Times.The number of companies that disclose their emissions to the CDP rose by a fifth in 2019 compared with the previous year.More than 500 institutional investors use the CDP’s database as they make investment decisions said Paul Dickinson, chair of CDP.“We’ve seen a rapid rise in the number of investors and how investors are using CDP data, particularly since 2015 with the Paris agreement,” he said. “This is absolutely the new normal, as we see the whole financial system addressing climate risk.”One of CDP’s major donors is the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a charity set up by Sir Christopher which donates about $150m a year to climate-related causes.Only 2.2 per cent of companies that disclose their emissions to CDP received an “A grade” last year, the level that TCI considers acceptable.A recent study found companies that underperformed on ESG metrics were more likely to be targeted by activist investors.Companies in the lower half of ESG rankings were 24 per cent more likely to be targeted by an activist campaign, according to the study of 1,300 European companies conducted by Alvarez & Marsal, a professional services firm. However, that poor ESG performance is usually a signal of poor governance overall, rather than the subject of the activist campaign itself.Activist funds have previously stopped short of going as far as TCI and launching a campaign on climate disclosure for every company in its portfolio.“Everyone is looking around, saying who is going to save the planet. One answer is investors,” said Sir Christopher. “They can use their voting power to force change on companies who refuse to take their environmental emissions seriously.”
15;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-12-03T08:52:48Z;Moody’s cuts outlook on UK banking system from stable to negative;Brexit uncertainty and low rates are hitting lenders, says rating agency;Moody’s has reduced its outlook on the UK banking system from stable to negative, saying Brexit uncertainty has eroded “the country’s growth prospects” while low interest rates are hitting lenders’ profitability.The credit rating agency warned that the “deteriorating” operating environment for UK lenders was “weighing on their asset quality and profitability”.Meanwhile “persistently low interest rates and increased mortgage market competition” had dented net interest margins — a metric that tracks the difference in banks’ cost of funding and the rates they charge to borrow.“The UK’s economy is weakening, making it more susceptible to shocks, and prolonged uncertainty over Brexit has reduced the country’s growth prospects,” said Laurie Mayers, associate managing director at Moody’s.Profits have already fallen at several big banks this year, and executives have acknowledged that the pressures are likely to continue. Nationwide, the country’s second-largest mortgage lender, last month became the latest business to say it would have to rein in new mortgage lending in some areas as margins come under sustained pressure.Mortgage market competition — encouraged by new regulations that left HSBC and Barclays with billions of pounds in excess liquidity that can only be used in the UK — has driven some smaller banks to move towards riskier lending. Economic uncertainty has also reduced demand for commercial loans, while provisions for bad debts have begun to increase, albeit from a low base.The decision by Moody’s on Tuesday to reduce its outlook suggested negative ratings were “more likely on average” over the next year and a half, the group said.Shares in UK banks have underperformed the broader domestic market this year. The FTSE 350 banks index has fallen 2.5 per cent in 2019, compared with a rise of almost 10 per cent for the market as a whole, Refinitiv data show. In addition to broader economic concerns, lenders have sustained a collective £50bn blow from the payment protection insurance scandal.Moody’s expects the UK economy to expand 1.2 per cent this year, with growth then slowing to 1 per cent in both 2020 and 2021. It forecasts that the jobless rate will tick up “slightly” from historically low levels during the period.“Our base case is that the UK and the EU will ultimately reach a free trade agreement, but it is increasingly unlikely that any such deal will substantially mitigate the negative economic impact of Brexit,” Moody’s said in its report.Moody’s said that while “asset quality will remain strong overall”, it expected a “moderate increase” in banks’ credit losses for loans that go sour during the next 12 to 18 months. Similarly, the agency forecasts a small rise in credit losses from retail loans that are not backed by collateral — such as credit cards.“We expect credit losses from retail unsecured lending to increase as unemployment rises moderately, although the change will be marginal thanks to continued low interest rates and rising household disposable income,” Moody’s said,“However, the banking industry practice of offering interest-free credit for prolonged periods (over a year in some cases, albeit with a fee) to borrowers who transfer credit card balances is a source of additional risk.”
16;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-11-27T04:00:29Z;Credit rating agencies focus on rising green risks;Moody’s warning on ExxonMobil marks watershed for debt markets;Debt issuers ignore ESG at their peril. The announcement by Moody’s last week — saying it was considering stripping US oil major ExxonMobil of its triple A credit rating, flagging risks in its adjustment to a lower-carbon economy — marks a watershed.Concerns over environmental, social and governance standards are most acute in the fossil fuel sector, where companies have been under increased pressure from regulators, activists and investors.However, the world’s efforts to hit emissions targets will pose a threat to many more industries’ creditworthiness, including some that do not directly emit much carbon, according to the top rating agencies. Last year Moody’s identified 11 sectors, with a combined $2.2tn in rated debt, as being in danger of a downgrade owing to concerns over carbon.“ESG risk is absolutely starting to hit and it’s spreading like wildfire across all asset classes,” said Mark Lewis, Paris-based head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “People . . . need to be thinking sooner rather than later about how to revamp their business models to cope.”ESG factors were not the primary driver for Moody’s downgrade to its outlook for ExxonMobil, the biggest energy company in the world by market capitalisation, from stable to negative. Pete Speer, an analyst, cited its negative free cash flow, weak margins and a rising reliance on debt to fund operations. But in a rare move, the New York-based rating agency explicitly cited ESG concerns as an “emerging threat” to the company.“A strong financial position and low financial leverage are important characteristics for managing these environmental and social risks,” Moody’s wrote.The other big credit rating agencies have also sharpened their focus on ESG.S&P Global made a splash last week by buying the ESG ratings arm of RobecoSAM, a Swiss asset manager, in a bid to capitalise on increasing demand for data on sustainable investments. Fitch introduced ESG “relevance scores” earlier this year to show how its credit-rating decisions are influenced by such factors. It issued a warning for the Brazilian agriculture sector this month, explaining that an international backlash over this year’s Amazon wildfires could spark boycotts of the country’s beef and threaten the EU-Mercosur trade deal.Equity analysts have been alert to greater political pressures, particularly in energy. Redburn, the London-based equity research house, recently removed all its “buy” ratings from the biggest integrated oil companies, arguing that the industry faces an “existential risk” that is not reflected in long-term forecasts for oil demand. ExxonMobil was hit with a double downgrade, falling to a “sell” rating in one fell swoop.As for Moody’s, its report last year on sectors at risk for heightened ESG concerns included shipping, steel, carmakers and other big carbon emitters. In a downgrade of Ford in September, the agency cited the potential for “large emission penalties in 2020 and 2021” as part of the reason for docking the carmaker to junk status.Even non-emitters are under the microscope. Banks, for example, do not typically have much direct exposure to environmental risks, yet their loans to fossil-fuel companies could be threatened by carbon taxes, according to research published this month by BlackRock, the world’s biggest funds firm with $7tn under management.The European Investment Bank, the lending arm of the EU, pledged this month to cut off funding to oil, gas and coal companies on the expectation that regulation and emerging technology will upend the sector.“I think we’re going to hear a lot more talk in the next couple of years about environmental liabilities crystallising much sooner than we thought and there’s a cost to that,” said Mr Lewis at BNP Asset Management. “These liabilities are bigger than the value they’re shown at on balance sheets today.”Market participants say a lack of data is the biggest hurdle they face in trying to sift ESG laggards from leaders, a recent Moody’s survey found. Companies are making progress on disclosing more relevant metrics, particularly with respect to emissions, but quantifying the financial effects of climate risks “remains at a nascent stage,” the rating agency wrote.Still, many investors are in no doubt that such metrics will stay in focus. The UN Principles for Responsible Investment, a group that counts thousands of asset owners as signatories, says it is only a matter of time before governments take more forceful action to meet climate-related commitments. It predicts bans on coal and internal combustion engines, as well as a wider uptake of carbon pricing policies.“The advice we’ve been giving to companies is: ‘be aware’,” said Chris Kocinski, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in Chicago, which signed up seven years ago. “From our perspective it’s a material part of how we assess credit risk.”This article has been amended since original publication to make it clear that S&P Global bought the ESG ratings arm of RobecoSAM.
17;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-11-21T16:30:52Z;Bundesbank grows gloomier on outlook for German lenders;Central bank and rating agency Moody’s warn that outlook is getting worse;Germany’s banks are facing an even tougher outlook thanks to a combination of negative interest rates and a slowing domestic economy, the Bundesbank and rating agency Moody’s warned on Thursday.The rating agency cut its outlook for the German banking system from neutral to negative while the Bundesbank, the country’s central bank, has warned that the country’s financial stability is increasingly under threat. The pessimistic forecasts come as Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, having failed to merge earlier this year, have stepped up cost-cutting efforts in an attempt to improve profits. Over the first nine months of 2019, Deutsche Bank recorded €4.1bn of losses while Commerzbank’s profit over the same period fell 9 per cent from a year earlier to €684m. Across Germany’s wider banking sector, profits last year plunged 31 per cent, according to Bundesbank data. “Banks’ weak profitability will decline further as net interest income falls,” noted Bernhard Held, an analyst at Moody’s.At 2.4 per cent, the average return on equity of German banks in 2018 was already the second lowest in the EU and far below the average of 6.1 per cent, according to the European Banking Federation. Analysts and regulators are concerned about banking profits as they stunt lenders’ ability to generate additional equity, while depressed share prices weigh on their ability to raise fresh equity from investors. Shares in Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank trade near all-time lows, valuing the lenders at just 20 per cent of their book value. At such low valuations, any capital increase would be highly dilutive for existing shareholders. While Moody’s forecasts that the asset quality and equity buffers of German banks will remain stable, Bundesbank is increasingly concerned that the country’s lenders may be underestimating future credit risk. “Banks are now increasingly financing the very enterprises that would be the first to encounter problems in the event of an unexpected economic deterioration,” Claudia Buch, a Bundesbank executive, said on Thursday. High real estate prices create another potential pitfall for the banks, the Bundesbank warned, as it estimated prices in cities were between 15 per cent and 30 per cent above their fundamental values. “The vulnerabilities of the German financial system to unexpected macroeconomic developments are growing further,” Ms Buch warned.Even without a recession or a property crisis, Moody’s warned that bank profits over the next 12 to 18 months would be further squeezed by falling revenue and stubbornly high costs.“The banks will find it hard to achieve meaningful expense savings in the short term, as investment needs related to regulatory requirements and technology improvements remain high,” the rating agency said.
18;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-11-08T23:07:24Z;Moody’s lowers UK credit outlook to negative on Brexit ‘paralysis’;Divisions in British society raise the risks on government debt, rating agency says;Moody’s has lowered the UK’s credit outlook to negative, saying Brexit “paralysis” has made policymaking less predictable.The move comes a little more than a week after lawmakers backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call for a general election next month, in the hope of breaking the gridlock over his plan for the UK to leave the EU.Credit rating agencies had warned that Britain’s sovereign debt would be at risk of a downgrade in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with S&P and Fitch having already put the country on negative watch.Moody’s, which previously had a “stable” outlook for the UK’s credit, said that the country’s institutions have weakened in the face of policy challenges and that British economic and fiscal strength is expected to soften.“The increasing inertia and, at times, paralysis that has characterised the Brexit-era policymaking process has illustrated how the capability and predictability that has traditionally distinguished the UK’s institutional framework has diminished,” Moody’s said in its report.Moody’s added that the decline in “institutional strength” is “likely to survive Brexit”, citing divisions within society and the political landscape.“It would be optimistic to assume that the previously cohesive, predictable approach to legislation and policymaking in the UK will return once Brexit is no longer a contentious issue, however that is achieved,” the report said.The UK was set to leave the EU by the end of October, but the deadline has been extended to January 31.The agency reaffirmed the UK’s rating of Aa2. It said the rating was unchanged given credit-supportive factors including economic diversification and a sound monetary policy framework, offsetting what it described as a high debt burden and weak productivity growth.At Aa2, Moody’s rates UK government debt two notches below the top grade — consistent with ratings by S&P and Fitch.Sterling traded fractionally lower at $1.2768 on Friday, falling to session lows in reaction to the Moody’s report.
19;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-11-08T09:01:16Z;Indian stocks slip after Moody’s lowers outlook to negative;Rating agency cites deepening economic slowdown and insufficient government action ;Indian stocks wobbled on their record-high perch after Moody’s lowered its outlook for the country to negative, citing concern over a deepening economic slowdown and insufficient government action.The New York-based credit rating agency said it was less confident about the government’s ability to manage the slowdown, which has seen growth in gross domestic product fall to 5 per cent year-on-year between April and June, a six-year low.Growth has been curtailed by a severe liquidity squeeze, prompted by an intensifying crisis in India’s enormous shadow-banking system and bad loans at its public and private banks.The negative outlook reflected in part “lower government and policy effectiveness at addressing longstanding economic and institutional weaknesses than Moody’s had previously estimated”, it said. The rating agency cited demand for reforms to labour and land laws in order to boost productivity and stimulate private investment.India is currently two notches away from losing its hard-earned investment grade status. Moody’s, which first gave India a premier ranking in 2004, proceeded to upgrade its rating a second time in 2017 amid optimism about early reforms made in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first term.The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensex index fell 0.8 per cent on Friday, having risen to a record of 40,684 points a day earlier. Indian 10-year bonds sold off a little, with yields up 3 basis points to 6.534 per cent, while the rupee softened to 71.3 against the dollar from 71.The government retorted that it has undertaken a series of initiatives to counter the slowdown and reform India’s economy, from the corporate-tax cut and real estate investment to scrapping a controversial tax increase on foreign portfolio investors.“These measures would lead to a positive outlook on India and would attract capital flows and stimulate investments,” the finance ministry said. “The fundamentals of the economy remain quite robust with inflation under check and bond yields low. India continues to offer strong prospects of growth in [the] near and medium term.”Indian stocks have been on a bull run since Mr Modi’s government announced in September that it would cut corporate taxes from an effective rate of 35 per cent to 25 per cent.The rally in Indian stocks accelerated this week after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government would commit Rs100bn ($1.4bn) to invest in the country’s struggling real estate sector, helping to restart projects that have become stuck amid a severe credit crunch sparked by a funding squeeze in India’s financial system.That prompted the stocks of major real estate developers such as DLF to surge higher. The market also got a boost after China and the US on Thursday agreed to remove some tariffs, increasing hopes that the pair would strike a truce after a 20-month trade war.Moody’s decision to lower its India outlook halted the rally, sparking concerns that further economic deterioration could ultimately lead to an investment downgrade. The rating agency cited the risk of increasing government debt levels, forecasting a fiscal deficit of 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product in the year ended March 2020. The government in July laid out a target of 3.3 per cent.Analysts at Nomura cited the risk to Indian equities and earnings from the sharper-than-expected slowdown, and forecast that GDP growth will fall further to 4.2 per cent in the coming quarter.“With tight domestic credit conditions persisting amid weak global demand, we now expect India’s recovery to be delayed and the pick-up to remain below potential,” it said.Additional reporting by Daniel Shane in Hong Kong

In financial markets, too, there were scenes of celebration on Monday after Moody’s elected not to downgrade the country’s debt to junk.Late on Friday the US credit rating agency decided to keep the sovereign debt in investment-grade territory — meaning it is eligible to be bought by most institutional investors — even after a budget update from Cape Town showed continuing struggles with ballooning debt and a widening fiscal deficit. On Monday the rand gained about 1.6 per cent against the US dollar, easily the biggest rise among major currencies, while the price of protecting the country’s debt against default fell by the most since June.Yet the verdict from Moody’s is hardly a vote of confidence in Africa’s second-biggest economy. The agency cut its outlook for the debt from “stable” to “negative”, citing a material risk that the government would be unable to repair its finances.The government now has three months to demonstrate a tangible change of course ahead of its budget in February, or a downgrade is inevitable, according to Luis Costa, lead strategist at Citi.“It’s a stay of execution,” agreed Paul Greer, portfolio manager for emerging markets debt at Fidelity in London.For now, Moody’s decision prevents an automatic expulsion from the FTSE World Government Bond index, which would have caused investors to sell bonds en masse and could have made it more expensive for South Africa to raise money. A cut to junk in February could generate an exodus of up to $15bn from passive, index-tracking funds and other rating-restricted investors, said Magdalena Polan, emerging markets strategist at LGIM.South Africa’s national debt, currently about 3tn rand (about $200bn), was set to balloon to 4.5tn rand during the next three years without drastic action, said Tito Mboweni, finance minister, in an address to parliament last week. The former central bank governor took one of the country’s hardy aloe ferox plants to the lectern as he gave his budget speech.The consequence of not acting now would be grave for South Africa“This is a serious position to be in. Our little aloe is not doing well. It needs attention, like our public finances,” Mr Mboweni said.“The consequence of not acting now would be grave for South Africa. Over time, the country would likely face mounting debt service costs and higher interest rates and may enter a debt trap,” he added.Moody’s has been an outlier for a while. Other big credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Fitch cut South Africa’s rating to junk in 2017 as corruption hollowed out state-owned enterprises under former president Jacob Zuma, who quit last year.If Moody’s was to preserve its rating, said analysts, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s ruling African National Congress needed to come good on its promised macroeconomic reforms, including the restructuring of debt-laden public enterprises such as Eskom. The power company sells almost all of South Africa’s electricity but can no longer keep up payments on 450bn rand of debt without state help.Bailouts to keep the lights on are likely to push South Africa’s debt to more than 80 per cent of its gross domestic product by the end of the next decade, according to Mr Mboweni. That is a much higher ratio than was forecast just months ago, when the government said the debt ratio could be held at less than 60 per cent.The government appears to be playing what analysts have called a poker game over future support for Eskom. The utility’s managers have pushed for the state to directly take over a large chunk of its debts so the company could borrow more cheaply. But the finance minister has insisted that they must first split Eskom’s unwieldy monopoly into three more manageable businesses.However, analysts say Mr Ramaphosa is hostage to union allies of the ANC who have threatened to take to the streets over what they see as a bid to privatise Eskom.Workers’ groups are also likely to oppose attempts to control another big driver of South Africa’s debt increase: public-sector wages. The government’s spending on civil servants’ salaries equates to 46 rand out of every 100 collected in tax.Meanwhile, tax collection is weakening due to the sluggish economy, with the South African Treasury slashing its forecast for this year’s growth by a full percentage point, to 0.5 per cent. It will mean another year in which GDP per head has fallen as the country’s population growth outpaces the economy.Despite the sombre outlook, analysts and asset managers believe that last week’s midterm budget was the first time in many years that South Africa has presented a realistic picture of its financial position.“Yes, the accumulation of debt is concerning, [and] it will lead to lower growth in the short term and raise tensions in society,” said Gustavo Medeiros, deputy head of research at Ashmore in London. “However, there is already an institutional fight against the old ANC practices and there’s a real chance that this fight gets won over time.”“The cannons are aiming in the right direction,” agreed Mr Costa of Citi. “Though policy implementation will be slower than the markets expect.”
21;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-11-01T23:01:56Z;S Africa debt risks junk status after Moody’s cuts outlook;Cut signals rating agency’s concern that Ramaphosa government will fail to restart economy;Moody’s cut its outlook for South Africa’s rating from “stable” to “negative”, leaving the debt of Africa’s most industrialised nation on the brink of junk status.Moody’s, the last big credit rating agency to classify South Africa as investment-grade, retained the country’s Baa3 rating on Friday.But it warned that failure by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government to fix slowing economic growth and rising debts may soon lead to a downgrade to junk.“The current rating rests on the government’s ability to quickly develop a credible strategy to halt and ultimately reverse the rise in debt. Such a strategy has not been forthcoming to date,” Moody’s said.The negative outlook signalled Moody’s concern that Mr Ramaphosa’s ruling African National Congress “will not find the political capital to implement the range of measures it intends” to restart the economy, it added.Mr Ramaphosa promised a “new dawn” when he replaced Jacob Zuma as South Africa’s president last year after a lengthy period of rising corruption in the state.But he has been hard pressed by vicious infighting in the ANC over reforms such as tackling a crisis at Eskom, the state power monopoly that has been called the biggest threat to the economy.Eskom sells nearly all of South Africa’s electricity but, because of waste and corruption, it can no longer keep up payments on R450bn ($30bn) of its mostly state-guaranteed debts without government help, straining public finances to the limit.Tito Mboweni, finance minister, warned this week that, without reforms, bailouts for Eskom and a bloated public-sector wage bill would raise state debts from less than 60 per cent of GDP to a danger level of 70 per cent over the next three years.Moody’s added that structural blocks in the post-apartheid economy, such as the world’s worst inequality rate and high joblessness, were sapping reform efforts “to an even greater extent than previously expected”.Mr Mboweni’s Treasury believes that the economy will grow only 0.5 per cent this year. Factories, mines, shops and smelters have all been battered by Eskom-imposed rolling power blackouts in 2019.A complete fall into junk status would bar South Africa’s debt from global bond indices tracked by investors, making it even more expensive to raise money on the markets.Mr Mboweni’s next budget in February is increasingly being seen as a critical moment to turn the fiscal tide for South Africa.“The development of a credible fiscal strategy to contain the rise in debt, including in the 2020 budget process and statement, will be crucial to sustain the rating at its current level,” Moody’s said.
22;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-11-01T09:54:55Z;Markets poised for South African sovereign debt review;Downgrade by rating agency Moody’s has potential to trigger substantial bond sales;Moody’s will announce its much awaited review of South Africa’s sovereign debt on Friday evening, which could trigger substantial outflows from government bonds.Moody’s is the only one of the top three rating agencies which still has an investment grade assigned to South Africa’s sovereign debt. Fitch downgraded South Africa to junk in April 2017 and S&P did likewise in November of the same year.The ratings company will either maintain its current investment grading for South Africa, at Baa3, change its outlook to negative, or downgrade the sovereign debt to junk. A downgrade to junk would likely trigger substantial sales of the nation’s bonds, and cause South Africa to lose its place in the FTSE World Government Bond Index.“A downgrade would exacerbate fiscal woes by raising borrowing costs at the time when the government is already struggling to consolidate public finances,” Rabobank analysts wrote in a note.The rating revision follows the government’s midterm budget, published on Wednesday, which stated that the country’s fiscal deficit would increase from 5.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent of GDP, amid sluggish growth and multiple bailouts of state-owned enterprises.Eskom, the beleaguered state-owned power company, is set to receive R138bn (£7bn) in bailouts until March 2020.
23;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-10-03T05:00:25Z;US shopping mall vacancies hit 8-year high;Bankruptcies and lower footfall pose serious challenges for retailers;Vacancies in US shopping malls have hit an eight-year high but new data show that some areas are coping with the retail upheaval far better than others and the gap is widening.The proportion of units lying empty in some cities, including Indianapolis and Birmingham, Alabama, is about four times higher than the economic hotspot of San Francisco, according to new data from Reis, part of Moody’s Analytics.The signs of difficulty in local retail property markets come as landlords brace for a wave of store closures following the bankruptcy of Forever 21 this week. The fast-fashion retailer, which has 32,800 employees globally, has earmarked 178 locations for closure across the US.Jonathan Goulding, the company’s chief restructuring officer, said in court documents that Forever 21 was “saddled with excessive floor space” in several unprofitable markets.The company’s stores occupy 12.2m sq ft worldwide and tend to be especially large, prompting worries that mall operators will struggle to find replacement tenants.“It’s definitely a concern because there’s not that many retailers that will want that amount of space,” said Neil Saunders, retail managing director at consultancy GlobalData. “In some locations there’s just a real glut of space.”The Reis data published on Thursday, which track 77 metro areas, show 9.4 per cent of units were empty in the third quarter — equalling a post-financial crisis high reached in 2011.The retail vacancy rate was less than 7 per cent in 17 cities, led by San Francisco with a 4.1 per cent rate. By contrast, 24 cities saw vacancy rates above 12 per cent, including Memphis, Buffalo and Albuquerque.In 43 cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Las Vegas vacancy rates improved over the past year.The metric worsened in several areas where there were already a higher than average proportion of empty properties. In Syracuse, New York, retail vacancies rose 2.4 percentage points over the past year to 14 per cent.Shopping malls have borne the brunt of a wave of closures and bankruptcies this year. Gap and Victoria’s Secret are among several household names to announce closure plans, while Payless ShoeSource and Charlotte Russe have each launched bankruptcy filings.Some analysts blamed Forever 21’s demise on changing tastes among younger shoppers and overexpansion, but Mr Goulding said a drop in mall footfall was the “most significant” factor.“As its neighbours have closed, the number of customers walking past Forever 21 has declined,” he said.
24;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-10-01T18:12:35Z;Moody’s puts Lebanon under review for downgrade as monetary crisis deepens;;Moody’s said it placed Lebanon’s already non-investment grade credit rating under review for a further downgrade, another knock for one of the world’s worst indebted countries.Lebanon’s huge debts — more than 150 per cent of gross domestic product — are eroding its central bank foreign currency reserves, credit analysts have warned.Fitch has already downgraded its rating for the small Mediterranean nation, which is experiencing economic slowdown and has a severe trade deficit. S&P did not downgrade the bonds but gave a harsh review of Beirut’s creditworthiness.Moody’s has a Caa1 rating on Lebanon’s debt. It said in a statement on Tuesday it would take 90 days or more to assess whether or not the Mediterranean nation’s fractious political leadership was able to see through its 2020 budget, unlock “confidence-enhancing” international finance packages for infrastructure projects, or land support from traditional Gulf backers.It stressed the review had been triggered by the “recent significant tightening in external financing conditions and the reversal in the bank deposit inflows that are essential in enabling Lebanon to meet the government’s financing needs.”Lebanon has long-relied on a growing deposit base, largely supplied by its huge diaspora, to help meet its foreign currency needs. But that trend has reversed course this year, raising concerns about how the country will pay for imports and debt servicing.Lebanon has never defaulted on its debt. Politicians and analysts alike have warned of the worsening fiscal and economic position, and demonstrators took to the streets of Beirut this weekend to protest over joblessness, lack of service provision and corruption.
25;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-09-09T23:00:34Z;Ford credit rating downgraded to junk by Moody’s;Action comes against backdrop of carmaker’s $11bn restructuring plan;Ford’s credit rating has been cut to junk by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited weak earnings and cash generation as the carmaker undergoes a costly restructuring.The company, which has about $100bn of debt globally, in the form of bonds and loans, is trying to retool its business “from a weak position as measures of cash flow and profit margins are below our expectations, and below the performance of investment-grade rated auto peers”, Moody’s said in its report.Ford has said it will take charges totalling $11bn in a restructuring aimed at improving profitability and better positioning itself to capitalise on new technologies including electric and self-driving vehicles. The company has announced job cuts and plant closures in Europe, while also reducing salaried staff across the globeIt also has formed an alliance with the German carmaker Volkswagen in which they will share development costs on electric cars.Ford now faces the challenge of addressing operational problems as demand in major markets is softening, and as the auto industry is contending with an unprecedented pace of changeShares in Ford were down more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading following the Moody’s announcement, having been up more than 2 per cent during the day’s formal session. The stock had gained 25 per cent since the start of 2019, as of Monday’s closing price.Moody’s cut the rating on Ford’s bonds one notch from Baa3, the lowest investment grade rating, to Ba1, the highest rung of the junk bond scale. The other two major credit rating agencies, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch, each have investment-grade ratings for the company.The yield on Ford’s 10-year bond, issued earlier this year, shot higher following the announcement from Moody’s, rising 15 basis points to 4.93 per cent.“The erosion in Ford’s performance has occurred during a period in which global automotive conditions have been fairly healthy,” Moody’s said. “Ford now faces the challenge of addressing these operational problems as demand in major markets is softening, and as the auto industry is contending with an unprecedented pace of change relating to vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, ride sharing, and increasingly burdensome emission regulations.”The downgrade raises the risk that Ford could end up in high-yield market indices, where it will be a significant presence. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, $34.5bn of Ford’s US bonds would be eligible for inclusion and would represent 2.9 per cent of the total US high yield market.The debt remains in investment-grade bond indices for now, however, since a majority of the rating agencies still have an above-junk rating. S&P said in July that it expects to downgrade the company by one notch sometime this year, but that it would still maintain an investment grade rating on the company.“A two-notch downgrade to a speculative-grade rating is unlikely over the next 24 months unless a higher risk of a US recession coincides with a lack of profitability improvements in Europe and China, which — together — would reduce the cash cushion Ford would need to withstand the next downturn,” S&P wrote in its most recent report.Investors have become concerned in recent years over the rising numbers of companies happy with issuing debt at the very lowest rungs of investment grade. They fear worsening economic conditions could imperil companies’ ability to service bloated debt loads, leading to downgrades.Prices could then fall precipitously, since some bond fund managers would be forced to offload the debt, bound by strict investment mandates that prohibit holding lower-rated bonds.But some analysts and investors downplayed the impact of Ford’s downgrade.“I think the Ford situation is understood by investors to be sufficiently idiosyncratic,” said Hans Mikkelson, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “This is not a sign that you are going to see a raft of downgrades from triple-B to high yield.”
26;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-08-29T11:55:57Z;Wirecard rated just above junk by Moody’s as it launches €500m bond;Rating agency gives German fintech lowest possible investment grade classification;German financial technology group Wirecard has been rated just above junk status by rating agency Moody’s as it looks to issue a €500m bond.Moody’s assigned a Baa3 rating — the lowest investment grade classification — to both Wirecard generally and the planned unsecured notes specifically, citing constraints including the payment company’s size relative to US rivals and the “constant threat” of competition from new market entrants and technologies.But the rating agency also cited positives including Wirecard’s strong market position in Asia an Europe, its diversity, scalability and “sound financial profile”.“Wirecard’s Baa3 issuer rating reflects its leading position in the payment processing market, especially in Europe and in the strongly growing Asian markets and its comprehensive product portfolio in the highly competitive industry,” said Dirk Goedde, Moody’s lead analyst for Wirecard.Based out of Aschheim, Germany, Wirecard has grown rapidly in recent years, selling technology and knowhow used by businesses to take payments from customers. Its share price has been under pressure since late last year when it became embroiled in an accounting scandal.Moody’s gave the group a stable outlook and said it expects it to generate growth in adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation in the “high-teens to mid-twenties” over the next 12-18 monthsIt added that it does not expect Wirecard to exceed an adjusted debt to ebitda ratio of three times, including the new €500m bond and an “envisaged” €900m investment by Japan’s SoftBank via a convertible bond that was announced earlier this year.Wirecard plans to begin a roadshow for the new five-year bond on September 2 to meet with fixed income investors. Crédit Agricole, Deutsche Bank and ING will act as global coordinators, while Citi and Credit Suisse will be active bookrunners.
27;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-08-13T06:59:10Z;Moody’s downgrades Rolls-Royce on cash flow concerns;Rating agency lowers debt to three notches above junk;Rolls-Royce has had its rating lowered by Moody’s on concerns over its cash flow, a week after the UK-based aero-engine group reported an extra charge to cover costs for its engine programme and said it has spent £100m preparing for a no-deal Brexit.The rating company on Tuesday said it had downgraded the long-term senior unsecured debt rating of Rolls-Royce to Baa1 from A3 and changed its outlook to stable from negative. The FTSE 100 company’s rating is now just three notches above speculative, or junk, territory.Moody’s change reflects the “expectation that target free cash flow in 2019 will include working capital gains, which are not considered sustainable” and that it will be similarly supported in 2020, the agency said in a report.“The company has made several important steps towards improving longer term performance,” Moody’s said, “including reducing the losses on the sale of large commercial engines, whilst achieving strong growth in commercial engine after-market revenues and in power systems.”The agency added that it continues to expect the company to improve earnings and cash flow particularly as the installed base of engines grows.Rolls-Royce said last week it had spent extra funds building up inventory and arranging logistics should the UK exit the EU without a deal on October 31. The group also reported an extra charge of £100m over the next three years to cover additional costs on its Trent 100 engine programme, which powers Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. This is as well as the £1.5bn already earmarked for that purpose.Free cash flow for the first half of 2019 was negative, with an outflow of £391m for the core business, due largely to a seasonal timing of engine deliveries. Rolls-Royce has maintained its guidance of £700m and £1bn free cash flow for this year and next, Moody’s pointed out.Moody’s expects about £600m to £800m of working capital gains but does not view them as “sustainable in the long term”.
28;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-07-02T12:25:50Z;UK ‘likely’ to enter recession in no-deal Brexit, Moody’s warns;Rating agency hardens warnings and says disruptive exit has become more likely;Moody’s has hardened its warnings over the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit, and now believes the UK “would likely enter a recession” if it crashes out of the EU.The rating company has previously said the UK would risk a recession with a no-deal exit. On Tuesday, it said the UK’s Aa2 rating would “come under downward pressure” if the economic impact of Brexit is more severe than it currently expects, such as in a no-deal scenario.“Such an outcome would be very disruptive to current UK-EU trading arrangements and have a material, negative impact on the UK economy and on the economies of certain EU member states,” Moody’s said in its annual credit analysis of the UK.The agency added that no-deal has become a more likely scenario, in its eyes, due to the Conservative party’s poor performance in the European elections and Theresa May’s resignation.Both contenders to become the next Tory leader and prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have said they are prepared to lead the UK out of the EU without a deal.Moody’s said that would likely weaken the pound, raise inflation and squeeze real wages over the two to three years following Brexit, weighing on consumer spending and depressing growth.A no-deal outcome would also place further strains on the UK’s institutional strength, Moody’s said.“The predictability and effectiveness of economic and fiscal policymaking — an important aspect of institutional strength — has already diminished somewhat since the UK’s vote to leave the EU,” Moody’s added.“In the event of a divisive shock such as a no-deal Brexit, the effort involved in trying to forge a domestic political consensus to respond to this outcome would likely dominate policymaking even more.”The agency also warned on the UK’s fiscal position — with or without a disorderly Brexit. Moody’s said the government faces “very significant pressures with regard to health and other ageing-related expenditures,” leaving it “increasingly challenging” to maintain a stable deficit level. It added that recent expansionary fiscal policy has left the UK with little wriggle room in a no-deal Brexit scenario.Chancellor Philip Hammond, who is not expected to remain in 11 Downing Street under the next prime minister, has warned Messrs Hunt and Johnson not to throw away the Conservative party’s reputation for fiscal prudence.“The ‘fiscal firepower’ we have built up in case of a no-deal Brexit will only be available for extra spending if we leave with an orderly transition,” Mr Hammond tweeted on Monday.
29;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-07-02T08:01:37Z;Moody’s India affiliate ICRA puts chief executive on leave;Move comes as market regulator Sebi probes agency’s role in IL&FS ratings;India rating agency ICRA, a local affiliate of Moody’s, has put its chief executive on leave as it faces a regulatory probe over its role in assigning a triple A rating to an infrastructure group whose default rocked the country’s financial system.ICRA said in a statement that its board of directors decided to put chief executive and managing director Naresh Takkar on leave immediately and indefinitely, pending the outcome of an investigation by the markets regulator into an anonymous complaint.The company did not elaborate on the nature of the investigation in its statement, nor did it respond to requests for comment. Mr Takkar could not immediately be reached for comment.Two people familiar with the matter said the probe stemmed from a complaint by a whistleblower about Mr Takkar’s role in helping maintain a triple A rating for Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, a large infrastructure group that defaulted on debt in September.The default sparked a liquidity squeeze that has reverberated through India’s financial system, raising concerns about the health of other financial groups and weighing on consumption and economic growth in the country.ICRA is among a number of rating agencies and auditors facing regulatory scrutiny over their role in the IL&FS default, as authorities investigate whether their actions helped problems at the group to go largely undetected.Last month, India’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs filed a petition seeking a five-year auditing ban on Deloitte and KPMG for their roles in allegedly helping conceal bad loans at IL&FS.The country’s Serious Fraud and Investigation Office is also pressing charges against 30 defendants including Deloitte and KPMG after an investigation into IL&FS.ICRA said in May that the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, had begun legal proceedings in response to an anonymous complaint about the credit rating ICRA had assigned a customer. According to the people familiar with the matter, that customer was IL&FS.Last month Sebi introduced tougher rules for rating agencies, including a provision requiring them to assign a “probability of default” to certain rated instruments.“The rules are a significant tightening,” said Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers. “Now obviously we’re into the inquest.”IL&FS became one of India’s largest non-bank lenders, with top credit ratings, before it started to miss debt payments late last year. The company racked up more than $10bn in debt as a result of lower-than-expected returns on projects.“Those issues are coming to the fore, and therefore the ratings agencies are being asked to explain their rationale,” said Prabodh Agrawal, chief financial officer at IIFL, a financial group. “The idea is to see whether we can fix the problems in the system.”
30;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US corporate cash pile shrinks as spending climbs after tax cuts;Moody’s says balances will continue to fall as businesses cut debt and pay out to investors;US corporations’ cash pile has receded from a record high, according to a report from Moody’s Investors Service, as companies put more of their dollars to use in the wake of tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump.Moody’s said Monday the 928 non-financial companies that it rates held $1.69tn in cash and liquid investments as of December 2018, a 15.2 per cent drop from an all-time high of $1.99tn a year earlier.Spending on capital investments, dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions each set record highs in the year following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included measures that lowered the corporate tax rate and reduced the tax hit on earnings repatriated from foreign subsidiaries.Moody’s said it expects cash balances will continue to shrink, saying improved access to global cash following the tax overhaul will encourage cash-rich companies to repay maturing debt and return more cash to shareholders.In 2018, capital expenditures consumed the largest portion of cash flow, rising 12 per cent to hit a record $851bn. Dividends were up 6.7 per cent to $412bn, net share buybacks nearly doubled to $467bn and acquisition spending grew 14 per cent to $405bn — all new highs.“With improved access to global cash following the tax overhaul, we expect aggregate cash balances will continue on a declining path, particularly as many cash-rich companies repay maturing debt and return more cash to shareholders,” Richard Lane, senior vice-president at Moody’s, wrote in the report.The drop in cash holdings last year also coincided with strong global economic growth for most of 2018. Moody’s-rated non-financial companies booked revenue of $11.9tn, up 9.5 per cent year-over-year, a healthier pace than the 8 per cent growth seen in the prior year. Aggregate cash flow from operations jumped $224bn to $1.77tn, marking the largest increase in a decade.Moody’s warned that “economic activity has decelerated from rapid growth in the first half of 2018”, adding that “elevated trade tensions have exacerbated the cautionary stance on business investment that will weaken business conditions in 2019”.However, spending on capital investments, dividends, acquisitions and share buybacks will rise to a total of $2.3tn this year from $2.14tn in 2018, according to Moody’s forecast.Heavyweights of the technology industry continued to lead the rankings of cash-rich companies. Apple led the pack with $245bn on hand, followed by Microsoft at $127.9bn. Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook rounded out the top five.Biotechnology and healthcare groups, including Gilead Sciences and Medtronic, and automakers Ford and General Motors were also high on the list, with each company closing the year among the 15 largest holders of cash. After the tech sector, the industries with the largest cash piles were healthcare/pharmaceutical, retail, manufacturing and energy.Apple alone held 14.5 per cent of the total non-financial corporate cash balance. The iPhone maker’s cash balance was greater than the aggregate amount for every US industry sector, excluding technology.Together, the top five companies had $564bn in cash. That amounted to 33 per cent of the total non-financial corporate cash balance, down from 34 per cent in 2017, Moody’s said.
31;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-05-29T13:39:06Z;Morningstar takes aim at rating giants with $669m DBRS deal;Group looks to break into oligopoly of S&P, Moody’s and Fitch;Morningstar, the financial data company, has redoubled its efforts to crack the credit ratings business with a deal to buy DBRS, the fourth largest agency.Chicago-based Morningstar said on Wednesday it will pay $669m for DBRS, headquartered in Toronto, as it bolsters its attempts to dislodge the three companies that dominate the industry.Morningstar is a powerful force in the ratings of mutual funds, but accounts for just 0.1 per cent of the credit-rating market. This will rise to 2.4 per cent once the DBRS deal closes, according to data from the US securities regulator. By contrast, the big three of S&P Global, Moody’s and Fitch have a combined 96 per cent.Morningstar began publishing credit ratings on public companies in 2009, and the following year acquired Realpoint, which had a niche in commercial mortgage-backed securities. DBRS, which was bought five years ago by private equity firms Carlyle and Warburg Pincus for an undisclosed sum, reported $167m in revenue for the year to November 2018.S&P, Moody’s and Fitch have managed to fend off numerous attempts over the years by smaller rivals to challenge their dominance. Others, such as Egan-Jones, which was early to downgrade notorious collapses such as WorldCom and Enron, have struggled to crack the oligopoly.“It’s traditionally a tough area for smaller players to break in to and establish market share,” said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “They are minnows as compared to the two very big fish and the third, slightly smaller, fish.”Mr White added that Morningstar’s brand recognition in mutual funds has so far failed to carry over into credit ratings. “The Morningstar imprimatur turned out not to be that important. What is important is the record of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch,” he said.Rating agencies were thrust into the spotlight after the financial crisis, when critics complained that their ratings on mortgage-backed securities were inflated to win business, misleading investors who had relied on them to provide a good guide to the risk of default. In 2015 S&P paid $1.4bn to settle claims over its role in the run-up to the crisis, while Moody’s paid $864m. Yet this did not loosen their stranglehold on the market.“They clearly had a lapse a decade ago with mortgage-backed securities but it was isolated to that part of the bond market and didn’t change how bond managers viewed them,” noted Mr White.Kunal Kapoor, chief executive of Morningstar, said the deal to buy DBRS reflected the company’s plan to create a “fintech” rating agency to challenge the established players.“Despite increased calls for transparency since the financial crisis, we do not believe there has been adequate change to restore investor trust,” Mr Kapoor said. “Dominant competitors remain entrenched and fail to innovate on behalf of investors while delivering ratings in much the same manner as they had before the crisis.”
32;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Do not expect rating agencies to dock the US;S&P and Co are maintaining stable outlooks despite shutdowns and widening deficit;"In her dystopian novel The Mandibles, Lionel Shriver describes how the US federal government in 2029 summarily defaults on its growing debt. The dollar loses the role of world reserve currency to a multilateral “bancor”, thus belatedly bringing to life Keynes’ plan for the postwar world currency order.The economy collapses and the formerly comfortable middle class is plunged into destitution. In the novel the rating agencies, whose job it is to foretell defaults, are conspicuously absent in the run-up to the financial disaster that engulfs the US.Back in the real world, what is the likelihood of the ratings industry detecting and calling a deterioration — however gradual — of the solidity of the US government’s full faith and credit obligations? In part, of course, this has already occurred. While Fitch and Moody’s continue to rate the US government a top-notch AAA, S&P lowered the rating to AA+ in August 2011 at the time of the debt ceiling row.At the time S&P argued that Washington’s fiscal plans failed to stabilise the government’s upward trending debt burden and that, more broadly, “the effectiveness, stability and predictability of American policymaking and institutions have weakened”.Arguably, both negative tendencies have since intensified. Factoring in the unfunded tax cuts passed in late 2017, the International Monetary Fund forecasts the US public debt ratio to rise to 117 per cent of GDP by 2023, doubling within two decades. S&P simulated that this ratio could surpass 250 per cent in 2050, thanks to the pressure of unreformed entitlement programmes in an ageing society — and not far from the breaking point in Ms Shriver’s 2016 novel.Yet all of the main agencies assign a “stable” outlook to the US rating. So do not hold your breath for another downgrade anytime soon. The agencies will most probably continue to stress the privilege of issuing the world’s foremost reserve currency and the monetary flexibility that bestows. The agencies are also likely to argue that the growth prospects and debt capacity of the US will continue to outdo the country’s G7 peers.Finally, we will hear that the constitutional checks and balances are still operational. This would prevent self-damaging policy choices, even in our age of a more volatile White House tenant. All of these arguments contain a lot of truth. Yet the ratings scale is not an all-or-nothing affair and the gradations are particularly granular at the top end. A stable outlook on a triple A rating is the gold standard of the ratings industry. It is as close to perfection as you can get.No plausible threat to the dollar’s dominant reserve status will emerge, given the troubles of the European economy and the lack of full convertibility of the renminbi. More likely triggers to move the US rating would be a further deterioration of the political environment; for example, through a succession of government shutdowns or another debt-ceiling impasse. While such events would cast a dark shadow over US governance, they would also negatively impact the growth and public finance outlook.The stable outlook on US ratings suggests the agencies do not believe these triggers will be pulled during the Trump presidency. This is a justifiable position. There may be also some reluctance to lower the rating during an election campaign, so as to appear not to meddle in the political process. Yet things that have never happened before keep happening since the 45th president took his oath of office, ranging from reversing the decades-old trend of trade integration and multilateralism to Mr Trump’s being “proud” to shut down the government for border security. Downgrade scenarios remain within the realm of possibilities.So imagine a surprise one. Could it precipitate a downward public finance spiral through higher government borrowing costs? Unlikely. In the aftermath of the S&P downgrade Treasury yields fell. This pattern would probably repeat itself should another agency follow suit. This is hardly surprising. In uncertain times investors seek quality. US Treasuries would be the safest securities around, even if they were docked one notch. Investment mandates would adjust to make AA the new AAA. Whereas a near-term downgrade appears unlikely it would not create a worrisome market dislocation even if it did.There would, however, be political repercussions. Beyond the partisan blame game we could take for granted, there could be other, less obvious consequences. For example, the US Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in February 2013 against S&P over what it considered misleading analysis of the mortgage sector. Some observers wondered whether the lawsuit was some kind of retaliation for the agency’s downgrade. Whether a Trump administration would act less vindictively is a speculation most safely left to novelists like Ms Shriver.The author is chief economic adviser of Acreditus, a risk consultancy headquartered in Dubai.

33;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-02-27T16:21:48Z;To monitor risk, don’t rely on rating agencies;The canaries in markets’ coal mine are thriving but their job is to state the obvious;"Last week rating agency Fitch put the UK on watch for a credit downgrade, warning that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit would have serious consequences for the country’s economy — something that had been obvious to most observers for quite some time. Bond and currency markets barely moved.Stating the obvious has been the foundation of rating agencies’ business model for years, and they are doing well on it.Fitch — owned by US corporation Hearst — reported record revenue and profits in 2017, the most recent results available. In the same year S&P Global made net income of $1.8bn on turnover up 7 per cent year on year at $6bn. Moody’s made $1.8bn operating income on $4.2bn of turnover, a rise of 17 per cent.It is a remarkable performance for businesses that were at the crux of the global financial crisis just a decade ago.Their longevity is a testament to the extent to which people who are paid to manage large amounts of other people’s money are willing to outsource that responsibility.As tollbooths on the highways of the global capital markets, rating agencies charge a small fee for each bond or issuer they assess. In return, investors get an independent assurance that their investment is worth what they pay for it.As the capital markets grow, so does the tollbooth business. There are $24tn of international debt securities outstanding, according to the Bank for International Settlements — up 36 per cent since 2007.Shares in S&P trade at about $200; in 2007 they were priced at $70. Moody’s has seen a similar rise, from $71 to $170.As in the case of Fitch’s warning on the UK, the agencies are often not telling investors anything they do not already know. Their judgment just gives asset managers something objective to point to when seeking to justify their decision-making to clients.So where’s the danger? The problem comes when credit ratings are combined in a mechanistic and simplistic way with other ways of outsourcing decisions, such as passive funds and index compilers.Funds that allocate capital based on instruments’ investment grades and index weighting may look like they are playing it safe but, in fact, they are taking a gamble. This ultimately creates towers of risk, any floor of which could prove unstable. It is an investment structure that is revealed to have done a bad job only when disaster arrives, as in the financial crisis. A decade ago, it was too often the case that by the time issuers’ credit ratings were downgraded, investors were already staring the worst-case scenario in the face.So do not look to the canaries in the financial markets’ coal mines to sound an early warning. By the time the downgrades come, it will be too late."
34;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
35;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-02-23T05:00:03Z;Credit rating agencies turn attention to ESG risk;Investors demand ethical analysis to help them avoid companies liable to crises;The bodies that influence how bonds worth trillions of dollars are priced have become the latest part of the financial industry to be caught up by the surge in interest in investing with environmental, social and governance principles.Credit rating agencies increasingly view risks through an ESG lens when they assess if corporate bond issuers will be able to pay back their obligations and stay in business.Pushed by investors who believe that ESG credentials help companies avoid expensive crises, the three biggest agencies are trying harder to explain how issues such as the move to a low-carbon economy and good governance inform their decision-making.Fitch Ratings last month announced plans to publish ESG “relevance scores”, which will show how ESG factors affect individual credit-rating decisions.Earlier, Standard & Poor’s Global Ratings had said it would include information on how ESG factors influenced credit ratings. “The aim of these sections is to highlight which ESG factors are material in our credit risk assessment and which are not,” says Gregg Lemos-Stein, head of analytics and research for corporate ratings at S&P.Moody’s Investor Services does not have an ESG scoring system but related issues, in particular governance, are considered in credit decisions, says Swami Venkataraman, senior vice-president. He says there is more pressure from investors for agencies to “show their working”.“There is greater demand for transparency now on the part of us as credit rating agencies,” he says. Moody’s began to build a standalone ESG team, consisting of a dozen analysts, about 18 months ago.Sustainability concerns encourage analysts to consider longer-term issues relevant to credit risk, he says. What is new “is transparency and the demand for incorporating or talking about risks that may have a long lead time”.In a reportthis week, Moody’s said social issues such as how a company manages health and safety, while “not typically the primary driver”, can still be material to credit quality. “There are four potential channels through which social issues affect credit quality: reputational, operational, litigation and regulatory risks,” the analysts said.There is already evidence that ESG is affecting rating decisions. Mr Venkataraman points to European utilities companies today compared with a decade ago, arguing that ratings are on average three notches lower thanks to policymakers pushing in favour of low-carbon economies.Meanwhile, S&P conducted a review to look at whether social factors, such as how well companies manage labour relations, affected ratings between 2015 and 2017. Out of almost 9,000 research updates published in the period, S&P found 346 cases where social factors were deemed “very important” for the final rating and 42 instances where they alone had prompted a change to the rating or outlook.In 2018 S&P changed its outlookon Las Vegas casino operator Wynn Resorts from stable to negative after chief executive Steve Wynn was accused of sexual misconduct. S&P said the move reflected “the potential for impairment to Wynn Resorts’ brand following the recent allegations [and] our limited transparency into potential succession plans in the event that Steve Wynn is forced to resign as CEO”. Mr Wynn has since stepped down from the company. He denies the allegations.S&P also placed Vale, the mining group, on a negative credit watch following the collapse of a dam at an iron-ore mine in Brazil last month that left at least 169 dead and scores missing. “Vale’s environmental and social liabilities could be substantial, especially considering that such an incident has happened before,” S&P said, referring to a dam failure in 2015.Mitch Reznick, co-head of credit at Hermes Investment Management, says greater ESG integration will promote the influence of non-financial factors in ratings decisions.“What is new is the greater efforts by the rating agencies to formalise and create structure around the ESG integration process,” he says. “The enhanced disclosures are also very much welcome because as investors . . . we always look for more information or additional context or perhaps a different way to analyse the same risks that we see.”In terms of understanding what rating agencies are doing “it’s still early days to make a judgment,” says Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management.She says more rating agencies now highlight their approach on ESG. “They’re providing proper training to the analysts on ESG, which is really critical.”Regulators and policymakers are also looking at the issue. The European Commission, which has called for legislative action on responsible investing, has said it is unclear to what extent sustainability factors are being considered by credit rating agencies.It has asked the European Securities and Markets Authority to review the matter and publish guidance by mid-2019. Esma’s consultation will run until March 19 and proposes that agencies provide a clear explanation of how ESG factors are considered in their methodologies.“In the case of a positive statement, the CRA should then identify which of the key underlying elements behind the credit rating relate to ESG factors,” the regulator said. “Should this approach be adopted by all CRAs, it will over time become clear which CRAs consider ESG factors as part of their credit ratings, and of the CRAs that do consider ESG factors, what factors they are considering on the most regular basis.”The Principles for Responsible Investment network has also paid attention to the subject. In 2016 it began a project to understand how ESG factors were being integrated into credit ratings analysis.“Governance has traditionally featured in credit risk analysis [but] on the environmental and social side there are new factors being taken into account,” says Carmen Nuzzo, author of the PRI report.She believes that rating agencies increasingly factor different kinds of risk, such as the labour management, into their analyses.“There is increased scrutiny on labour relations,” she says. “All these issues are looked at through a different lens [when compared with] the past.”In a report on the topic last month, the UN-backed responsible investment initiative echoed Esma’s approach and called on rating agencies to make clear their thinking on ESG issues relevant to credit decisions.“CRAs need to continue proving that their methodology takes into account ESG factors in credit risk analysis,” the report said.“They need to be explicit in the press releases and commentaries that accompany changes in rating opinions or outlooks about how the materiality, likelihood and timeliness of ESG factors, when relevant, contribute to rating actions.”Not everyone is convinced. Olaf Tölke, head of corporate research at Scope Ratings, says the European agency supports responsible investing but is not persuaded of the merits of emphasising ESG considerations when assessing corporate debt.“We look at whether the company is able to pay its bills in two to three years. Nobody knows what is going to happen in ten years,” he says. “If you’re going to give advice to bondholders it’s dangerous to look farther out.”He is concerned that analysts could fall prey to making value judgments or be swept up by the pro-ESG zeitgeist, for example by being too favourable to companies that adopt environmental technologies.Mr Reznick warns that increased attention to ESG factors from rating agencies could increase the cost of credit for some issuers.“We are likely to see a bifurcation in the cost of capital between the leaders and the laggards [in ESG],” he says. “Those that do not [anticipate ESG-related risks] are likely to see risk premiums rise because they did not have the vision to look ahead and indemnify their operating cash flows.”While investors believe that more disclosure from rating agencies will help bond investors integrate ESG standards into fixed-income portfolios, Ms Hamilton Claxton cautions that the work of credit analysts cannot be a stand-in for analysis by asset managers themselves.Mr Lemos-Stein says investors are free to disagree with the assessments of credit analysts but that their work is a force for greater transparency. “Individuals, pension funds, big institutional investors . . . all are looking for more clarity,” he says.
36;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-02-04T11:34:46Z;Vedanta outlook cut after Volcan deal;Move follows controversial investment in rival Anglo-American;Rating agency Moody’s has cut its outlook on Vedanta Resources Limited, the mining group controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, following its investment in UK-listed miner Anglo-American.Shares in Vedanta lost a fifth of their value on Friday as investors reacted with fury to a $500m+ deal to purchase a stake in Anglo American from Volcan, Mr Agarwal’s family trust. Moody’s, which has a non investment grade rating on Vedanta, said the deal was a means to “fund the risk appetite of its shareholder”, and a clear indication of the company’s willingness to deploy cash at Vedanta to support Volcan interests. The agency cut its outlook on Vedanta to negative.“Moody’s earlier ratings on Vedanta were based on the expectation that Volcan will not move cash from Vedanta to provide liquidity to itself. The deferred payment is therefore a clear departure from this expectation, and exacerbates the risk that Volcan will continue to use Vedanta as a financing vehicle,” it said.In addition to the immediate cash outflow of $208m to Volcan, Moody’s said Vedanta will make deferred payments aggregating $353m until October 2020, making the investment bigger than many people had realised.Explaining the investment, Vedanta said on Monday that one of its subsidiaries had been offered the chance by Volcan to invest some of its surplus cash in a structured financial instrument of about 24.71m Anglo shares, almost 2 per cent of the company.It said the investment was made at an arm’s-length basis, and met all governance requirements.“The structure provides significantly higher returns compared to other overseas cash management investments that would typically return around 2 per cent,” Vedanta said.“After careful consideration of the risk-adjusted returns of this opportunity relative to other available investments, it elected to invest a portion (which is less than 5 per cent of the group’s cash and cash equivalent of around $5bn) of its available cash resources, as part of its cash management activity. The ownership of the underlying shares, and the associated voting interest, remains with Volcan,” it said.Through a complex capital markets instrument created by bankers at JPMorgan, Volcan acquired in 2017 a near 20 per cent interest in Anglo.To fund the £3.5bn acquisition, Volcan issued interest-bearing mandatorily exchangeable bonds, which mature next year.
37;MCO;Moody's Corp;2019-01-29T15:06:01Z;TP ICAP downgrade triggers spat with Moody’s;Agency said lower rating reflected interdealer broker’s increased costs and debt levels;TP ICAP has become embroiled in a public dispute with Moody’s Investor Services after the UK interdealer broker was downgraded by the credit rating agency.Late on Monday Moody’s cut its rating on London-based TP to “Ba2 from Ba1”, with a stable outlook.But in a fierce response on Tuesday TP said Moody’s downgrade had been unsolicited and it had not co-operated with the agency before the rating was published.Normally companies pay credit rating agencies to analyse and submit a rating on its debt on behalf of potential investors. Ratings analysts are usually given access to top management and sensitive commercial information.David Fanger, an analyst for Moody’s, said the lower rating reflected his view that increased costs, debt levels and capital expenditures at TP were unlikely to abate in the short term, and had led to a weakening of the group’s financial profile.But TP alleged Moody’s ignored the broker’s request that Moody’s “states clearly and prominently that the credit rating is unsolicited and non-participatory”.Without it, added TP, the downgrade and a Moody’s research note in October that put TP ICAP on review, were “in contravention of EU Credit Rating Agency Regulations”, the broker said in a statement.Moody’s declined to comment on TP ICAP’s statement.Public spats between companies and rating agencies are not uncommon. In 2011 Jefferies contested a downgrade from Egan-Jones, an investor-paid credit rating agency, over the US investment bank’s exposure to European sovereign debt.TP’s dispute highlights investors’ concerns over its integration of rival ICAP two years ago. An IT integration was delayed because of the introduction of Mifid II markets rules, and its chairman and chief executive clashed over an incentive scheme. New chief executive, Nicolas Breteau, admitted the company had become “distracted” by the integration, and has ruled out making big deals for the coming year in favour of preserving cash.TP also disputed some of Moody’s findings, including that TP would integrate the ICAP voice broking business by 2018. “The company also disagrees with Moody’s assumptions contained in the release in relation to leverage and interest expense,” it said.Moody’s argued that TP ICAP would not be able to lower its debt ratios from 2.5 times gross debt/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation before the end of this year.TP said it continued to have a participatory and solicited rating with Fitch, which rates the company at BBB-.TP shares closed 0.09 per cent lower at 323.90 in London.
38;MCO;Moody's Corp;2018-08-28T16:32:39Z;SEC hits Moody’s with first rating symbol-related enforcement action;Rating agency pays $16.25m in settlement;The US Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday that credit rating agency Moody’s has agreed to settle claims that it failed to consistently apply credit rating symbols*, marking the regulator’s first enforcement action involving rating-symbol deficiencies.The SEC said Moody’s failed to use and document effective internal control structure for models it had outsourced from a corporate affiliate and used in rating residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from 2010 through 2013.The rating agency agreed to pay $15m to settle charges of internal control failures involving the models. The rating agency agreed to pay a separate $1.25m and agreed to review its policies and internal controls regarding rating symbols.The SEC claimed Moody’s failed to consistently apply credit rating symbols to so-called combo notes.Credit rating agencies assess the riskiness of various types of debt, using letters, or “symbols”, to provide a guide that indicates a security’s safety.“Investors expect and the law requires that symbols used by rating agencies be clearly defined and consistently applied,” said Reid Muoio, deputy chief of the SEC enforcement division’s complex financial instruments unit. “Today’s proceeding is the SEC’s first enforcing the Universal Ratings Symbol requirement and we will continue to pursue failures that render rating symbols unclear or inconsistent.”Moody’s did not admit or deny the SEC’s claims.“We are pleased to have resolved these legacy matters, which reach back to 2010,” a spokesperson for Moody’s said. “Moody’s Investors Service regularly reviews and refines its policies and procedures and is committed to maintaining strong controls around models used in the rating process.”*Note: The piece was amended to reflect the failure to apply credit rating symbols pertained to combo notes.
39;MCO;Moody's Corp;2018-06-29T13:06:52Z;Moody’s warns of prolonged uncertainty from slow Brexit talks;;Moody’s has warned the waning momentum of the UK-EU negotiations suggests Brexit uncertainty could “persist for longer than anticipated”.The chances of agreeing the exit terms by October as currently planned were fading, the rating agency warned, as the failure of the two sides to agree the terms of a backstop plan to avoid controls at the Irish border hamstrung negotiations.“Previously, the uncertainties over Brexit appeared to be ebbing, after the EU and UK in late March agreed, in principle, to a transition period until end-2020,” Colin Ellis, Moody’s chief credit officer for Europe said. He added:However, the transition, which would be part of the withdrawal agreement, depended on both sides agreeing to the terms of the UK-Irish border backstop, and the parties appear to have made little progress on this issue in the past three months. As such, the elevated level of uncertainty will continue to hamper corporate investment in the UK, household spending and growth.The delay diminished the time left to avert a no deal Brexit scenario next March, Moody’s cautioned, which could result in “substantial negative consequences for the UK economy”, including “slower growth or outright recession and higher unemployment and inflation” that could make it harder for UK businesses to issue debt.Expected benefits to companies from the planned transition period were also under threat because of the lack of progress in negotiations, Mr Ellis said, and could add to pressure on companies to push forward with their contingency plans:EU authorities require UK banks that conduct business on the continent, including subsidiaries of large non-UK international banks, to plan on the basis that no transition will be adopted and that current ‘passporting’ regimes will cease in end-March 2019.Until then, UK banks will have to restructure their operations and relocate activities as necessary, whereas EU banks active in the UK are allowed to rely on the transition being adopted as set out by the UK regulator, and hence are obliged to implement such measures only until end-2020
40;MCO;Moody's Corp;2018-06-25T08:52:28Z;Moody’s gives guarded blessing to Greek debt relief deal;;Moody’s has given its cautious blessing to the historic Greek debt relief deal hammered out in Luxembourg last week.The eurozone agreement gave the southern European country “significant further debt relief that ensures the Greek government has very moderate refinancing needs for the next 10 years”, the rating agency said, marking a shift in position from the more sceptical stance taken on previous plans to cut Greece’s debt burden.Kathrin Muehlbronner, lead sovereign analyst for Greece at Moody’s, said on Monday the deal should:. . . pave the way for the government to return to capital market funding on a sustained basis, a credit positive. We consider the package a significant benchmark in Greece’s ongoing recovery from its deep government debt, economic and banking crisisTighter than usual monitoring should trim the risks of Greece rolling back previous — painful — reforms, Ms Muehlbronner added.Greece will be subject to much closer supervision and monitoring than other euro area countries that exited external support programmes, which provides further assurance that the Greek authorities will stick to fiscal and economic reforms . . .Reviews will be quarterly, rather than bi-annual as for other countries following the exit from their programmes.Two other (smaller) debt relief measures — a staggered return to Greece of profits accrued on the bonds held by the European Central Bank and other euro area central banks, and the cancellation of an increase in the EFSF’s interest margin on one of the tranches — are conditional and depend on Greece completing a series of reforms in the coming years, which the creditors hope will provide a further incentive for Greece to remain on track
41;MCO;Moody's Corp;2018-03-23T23:12:20Z;Moody’s keeps South Africa credit rating at investment grade;Ramaphosa’s reforms are given a chance to succeed after turmoil of Zuma era;South Africa avoided a further downgrade in its credit rating to junk status after Moody’s kept the country at investment grade, citing the beginning of reform under President Cyril Ramaphosa.The agency said on Friday that keeping South African government bonds at one notch above junk reflected its “view that the previous weakening of South Africa’s institutions will gradually reverse”, a reference to the political turmoil under Jacob Zuma, the former president.Mr Ramaphosa, leader of the ruling African National Congress, became president last month after the party forced Mr Zuma from power under a cloud of corruption allegations.Mr Zuma was accused of allowing so-called state capture to target critical fiscal institutions such as the treasury and revenue service, leading Fitch Ratings and S&P to downgrade South Africa to junk in 2017.A further downgrade by Moody’s would have kicked Africa’s most industrialised economy out of international indices followed by bond investors, endangering the financing of government debts, which ballooned under Mr Zuma.The previous weakening of South Africa’s institutions will gradually reverseMoody’s said its outlook for the credit rating was stable, balancing “significant growth potential” for the economy against the risks of continued infighting in the ANC affecting Mr Ramaphosa’s “still to be tested” administration.Averting junk status by all three of the main rating agencies is a reprieve for Mr Ramaphosa, who has promised to restore economic stability and to remove corruption from government.The beginning of the presidency of the former trade unionist turned business leader “offers a real prospect of a decisive reversal” in South Africa’s decline, Moody’s said.The agency praised “the speed with which the president has moved to replace the leadership in key institutions”, including removing Mr Zuma’s cronies as finance minister, head of the tax authority and overseer of state-owned companies.But it warned that it was still “early days” for reform and said that the debts of mismanaged state-owned firms such as Eskom, the power monopoly, still threaten government finances.As a result of a tough state budget that raised taxes days after Mr Ramaphosa became president, government debt is likely to stabilise at 55 per cent of gross domestic product between now and 2020, Moody’s said.“While an unchanged rating was a foregone conclusion for markets, and very much priced in, the changing of the outlook to ‘stable’ is important news, in our view,” said Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa at Standard Chartered.
42;MCO;Moody's Corp;2018-03-15T05:15:25Z;Global rating agencies: creditable;Bond spreads still react to downgrades and changes to outlooks;Do global credit rating agencies have anything to tell the market that it cannot find out for itself? The jaded bond investor’s answer would be no. How else to explain the lack of price reaction to such seismic events as the UK’s loss of its gold-plated AAA status or Portugal’s return to the investment grade club. Recent credit rating moves in Turkey and Italy have produced similarly lacklustre results. The minimal market reaction suggests government ratings could be scrapped without much protest.The reason they will stick around is that no one has yet come up with an alternative. Attempts to defang the agencies after they missed the risks in collateralised debt obligations, and were then accused of accelerating the European debt crisis, fell flat. Agencies are still paid by the organisations they rate — a clear conflict of interest — and the sector is still dominated by three big companies: S&P, Moody’s and Fitch. Their views remain a key benchmark by which investors allocate funds and the alphabet soup they use to indicate creditworthiness has not changed.There is also some evidence to suggest that their ratings do offer markets new information on sovereign bonds — even if knee-jerk price reactions are missing. Looking at credit default swap spreads on 55 sovereign bonds between 2005 to 2013, the Bank for International Settlements has found that spreads noticeably respond in the three weeks after a rating downgrade event.The nuance missing from previous analysis is that spreads react more to a change in outlook than a change in rating. Bad economic news made public can move bond prices before credit agencies place sovereign debt on negative outlook, but an actual outlook announcement will still cause a rise in CDS spreads — particularly for bonds just at or just below investment grade.Regulators should still be more vigorous in expanding the universe of rating agencies. But the argument that the crisis diminished credit agencies for good lacks credibility.
43;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Moody’s downgrades Turkey on political, economic risks;Agency cites concerns about the country’s wide current account deficits;Moody’s downgraded Turkey’s debt on Wednesday, warning of the erosion of checks and balances under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and an increased risk of an external economic shock.The agency lowered the country’s sovereign debt rating one notch to Ba2 from Ba1, with a stable outlook, citing concerns about the country’s wide current account deficits, higher external debt and large rollover requirements in the context of political uncertainty and rising global interest rates.“This overall picture suggests that the possibility of a sudden, disruptive reversal in foreign capital inflows, a more rapid fall in already inadequate FX reserves and, in a worst-case scenario, a balance of payments crisis, while still quite low, has increased beyond Moody’s expectations a year ago,” it said.Moody’s voiced alarm about the “continued loss of institutional strength” in Turkey, where Mr Erdogan has been accused by opponents of putting political pressure on the judiciary and the central bank.It said that this had led to “further erosion in the effectiveness of monetary policy and further delays in implementing core structural economic reforms.”It warned that a radical strengthening of the office of the presidency, due to come into force after the next elections, would further undermine the predictability and effectiveness of Turkish policymaking.Moody’s decision pushes its rating on Turkey further into junk territory. Other major agencies Fitch and S&P have also assigned the country non-investment grade ratings.

As a result, the bank's profitability will likely come under pressure.""The agency added that if PNB had to provide for its entire exposure to the alleged scam, then the bank's ""capital position would deteriorate markedly, and fall below minimum regulatory requirements…Consequently, PNB may need to raise capital externally — mainly from the government"".Moody's further noted that the discovery of the alleged fraud highlighted ""the weak operational controls and corporate governance at the bank"".Shares in PNB fell 4.6 per cent on Tuesday morning, bringing the total decline since the shock announcement to 31 per cent."

46;MCO;Moody's Corp;2017-08-31T18:36:15Z;Rating agencies warn on failure to raise US debt limit;Signs of angst in Treasury market amid contentious debate in Washington;Credit rating agencies have ratcheted up their warnings over the consequences should a divided Washington fail to raise the US debt ceiling, with anxiety beginning to surface in the $14tn Treasury market.S&P Global, the largest of the world’s three dominant rating agencies, cautioned that a failure by Congress to lift the debt ceiling would likely be “more catastrophic” than the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 that brought the global financial crisis to a head.The alarm from S&P comes ahead of what is expected to be a contentious debate in Washington about lifting the Treasury’s self-imposed borrowing authority. The Treasury department has already resorted to extraordinary measures to pay the nation’s bills, and Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has told congressional leaders that they should act by September 29.Analysts with rival Fitch warned last week that a failure to raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner would result in a review of its triple-A rating on the US with “potentially negative implications”, signalling a cut to either its outlook or rating. Moody’s, which also rates the US triple-A, has said if a debt payment is missed it would also have “negative rating implications”.S&P chief US economist Beth Ann Bovino said a default on US government debts would be “devastating” to markets and the economy. Her team forecasts that a default would result in a contraction in government spending and would push the US economy back into recession, “wiping out much of the progress made by the recovery”. S&P downgraded the US credit rating to double-A plus in 2011.Investors and economists expect the Treasury will hit its debt limit in early to mid-October. Dislocations in Treasury markets have appeared for debts maturing on October 12 and 19, with money managers demanding greater compensation to hold those obligations. Debts maturing on October 19 traded hands on Wednesday with a yield of 1.1 per cent, 16 basis points above bills that mature at the end of September and 10 basis points higher than debts that come due at the start of November.Matt Zames, a former top JPMorgan banker, last year sent an open letter to then Treasury secretary Jack Lew arguing that the debt ceiling system was “the most glaring flaw in the government’s financing system”, and warned that a US default would be disastrous.“The possibility that future debt limit showdowns could introduce market uncertainty and trigger another catastrophic financial crisis still exists and remains the unresolved ‘elephant in the room’,” he wrote to Mr Lew. “It is time to introduce an alternative method of raising the debt limit.”JPMorgan analysts recently detailed a wide array of factors that could cause mayhem even in the case of a temporary “technical” US debt, such as the impact on money markets stuffed to the gills with Treasuries, or how the financial system might function if one of its prime collateral assets were in default.While there are no “cross-default” provisions in Treasuries — so a default on one security would not necessarily mean a technical default on the US government’s entire debt burden — the bank warned that “market liquidity will probably be substantially impaired”.
47;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;China’s real credit risk lurks in shadow finance;A crackdown on irregular dealings is creating collateral damage;"The downgrading of the world’s second-largest economy’s sovereign debt rating should rank as an important event. But financial markets greeted China’s downgrade last week by Moody’s, the credit rating agency, with their version of a nonchalant shrug. Chinese domestic bond prices remained steady and Hong Kong’s main stock index actually rose during the week.But the non-event should not lull observers into complacency. China not only has one of the most highly leveraged corporate sectors in the world — with company debts equivalent to about 170 per cent of gross domestic product — it is also engaged in risky manoeuvres to cut an overgrown shadow finance sector down to size.Indeed, the market’s shrug says more about the structure of China’s financial architecture than it does about the very considerable risks that lurk within it. The truth is that foreign rating agencies have little influence over domestic bond investors and foreign ownership of Chinese bonds amounts to just $61.5bn, or 4 per cent of the total.In any case, China’s outstanding foreign debt stood at a modest $1.42tn — or just 13 per cent of GDP — at the end of 2016. Beijing’s huge stash of foreign exchange reserves, which currently stands at $3tn, makes it highly unlikely that the country would default on its sovereign bonds.Nevertheless, the one-notch relegation of Moody’s rating to A1 should encourage observers to delve into the strange nature of Chinese financial risk. Although the downgrade puts China on a par with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic, there is almost no equivalence between the challenges it faces and those of these countries.The risks inherent in China’s system derive mainly from the regulatory disobedience of a state-owned phalanx of banks and companies that have reaped handsome returns from a booming netherworld of shadow finance. This twilight domain has tripled in size over the past five years to be worth $9.4tn, or about 87 per cent of GDP, at the end of last year, according to Moody’s estimates.In recent months, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and other official bodies have sought to re-impose Beijing’s authority by cracking down on a long list of irregular but commonplace financial dealings. Guo Shuqing, the CBRC chairman, has been quoted as saying he would rather resign than see the banking system become a “complete mess”.But the crackdown is creating collateral damage. A squeeze on the money market, a font of shadow finance liquidity, has driven short-term interest rates higher, raising the costs of funding not only for irregular dealings but also for legitimate mid-sized banks and companies that rely on such funding to manage stretched balance sheets.Bond market defaults are relatively new; the first one was permitted in 2014. But this year there have been 13 defaults so far, the most recent in late May when Dalian Machine Tool Group — one of the world’s largest machine-tool companies — failed to repay the principle and interest on debt issued.The potential for debt default contagion is huge, due to a widespread practise of companies guaranteeing other companies’ loans. Nearly half of the lower-rated companies in China have extended loan guarantees of more than 30 per cent of the value of their equity, according to Everbright Securities, a Chinese brokerage. Thus while the Moody’s downgrade may not signal a clear and present danger, it should alert investors to the myriad credit risks within China’s opaque economy."
48;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-09-28T22:04:22Z;Moody’s trims staff to contain expenses;Market turbulence cut the rating agency’s revenue early in the year;Moody’s has axed 30 staff across its business as the rating agency seeks to contain costs after a challenging start to the year, according to people briefed on the situation.The job cuts are concentrated among analysts but include some staff from other areas of the company.Moody’s, which issues ratings and research across a range of bonds and other securities, struggled at the start of the year, after widespread market turmoil curtailed the issuance of bonds and structured products, cutting the company’s income from rating new transactions.The pace of new deals has picked up in recent months but Moody’s executives highlighted concerns over political risks, including the US presidential election, at an investor conference on Wednesday, at which they also discussed plans to rein in expenses.Some cost savings would come from using employees in lower-cost locations such as India, Sri Lanka, China and Costa Rica, said Linda Huber, Moody’s chief financial officer, according to a Bloomberg transcript of the event.“We haven’t liked the way the revenues have come in . . . we realised we have to work on expenses because we’ve had a tougher time with revenue,” she said.First-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates by $37m, coming in at $816m. Revenues recovered in the second quarter, beating estimates by $25m at $929m, according to Bloomberg data. The company’s share price is up 9 per cent for the year but fell 0.4 per cent on Wednesday despite it raising its full-year earnings outlook at the investor conference.“Increased issuance activity combined with a greater impact from our cost savings initiatives has resulted in a modestly improved outlook,” said Raymond McDaniel, Moody’s chief executive, in a statement.The move to axe analysts in an effort to cut costs is unusual for the company, which rarely engages in large-scale firings, according to the people. Moody’s has about 1,600 analysts in total, according to regulatory filings.Moody’s is separately under investigation by the Department of Justice for allegedly inflating credit ratings on mortgage bonds that were at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis. Rival rating agency S&P Global Ratings, has already settled over similar allegations, paying out $1.5bn.John Goggins, general counsel at Moody’s, was asked about the investigation at Wednesday’s investor conference. He said it was not appropriate to comment on the ongoing investigation but Moody’s would make appropriate disclosures in the event of material developments in any litigation matter.Moody’s declined to comment on the job cuts.
49;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-09-15T16:10:01Z;South Africa political woes trigger downgrade review on state groups;Credit rating agency raises concerns about corporate governance;Five of South Africa’s state-owned companies, including the power utility Eskom, have been threatened with a credit rating downgrade over concerns about corporate governance and the political climate in Africa’s most industrialised economy.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, placed its Ba1 rating on Eskom under review due to “the rising funding challenges faced by [the company] in the context of an adverse regulatory framework and evolving political environment”.It is also reviewing the ratings of Development Bank of Southern Africa, Industrial Development Corporation, Land and Agricultural Development Bank of South Africa, and the South African National Roads Agency.Moody’s decision comes at a delicate moment for South Africa’s sluggish economy. Though the country has thus far managed to stave off recession, growth is low and the government continues to battle high unemployment and yawning inequality. Both were significant factors in the ruling African National Congress’s worst-ever electoral performance in local elections in August.It also comes amid a high-stakes power struggle that has pitted the Treasury against powerful state entities, including Eskom. The Treasury has publicly accused Eskom, the biggest buyer of South African coal, of hindering an investigation into a contract with Tegeta Exploration and Resources, a company with ties to the powerful Gupta family. Eskom has said it has co-operated with the Treasury’s requests and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing.South Africa’s state-owned enterprises, which are a major employer and provide vital infrastructure and services across the country, have come under scrutiny in recent years for their poor management and performance. Among other problems, they are also a huge strain on the government’s already stretched coffers.In his budget speech this year, Pravin Gordhan, finance minister, emphasised the need to reform the country’s state-owned companies, and pledged that further government financial support to them would depend on “firm resolution of governance challenges”.In August, President Jacob Zuma was named head of a new council tasked with overseeing state-owned enterprises, a move that raised questions over the necessity and motivation of adding another layer of supervision over the companies.In recent months, Mr Gordhan has been the subject of a controversial probe into the tax authority by a special police unit, raising concerns that Mr Zuma may be seeking to remove him and replace him with a more pliant finance minister. Mr Zuma has said he fully supports Mr Gordhan but could not intervene in the investigation.Anoj Singh, Eskom’s chief financial officer, described the Moody’s review as “unfortunate” and said the company’s financial position had improved following a turnround plan.Moody’s said the utility’s rating could be confirmed if it demonstrated it has continuing access to liquidity and the agency’s assessment of its government support remains unchanged.Moody’s said the utility’s rating could be confirmed if it demonstrated it has continuing access to liquidity and the agency assesses that its government support remains unchanged.Earlier this month, Futuregrowth Asset Management, a specialist investment firm that manages about R170bn ($11bn) in assets, said it would stop lending to several of South Africa’s largest state-owned enterprises, including the five placed on review by Moody’s, due to concerns over the companies’ governance and “decision structures”.
50;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-05-31T08:16:07Z;S&P lowers Fosun outlook after Moody’s takes opposite view;Rating agencies differ on Chinese group’s debt-fuelled buying spree;S&P on Tuesday lowered its outlook on Fosun International’s BB-minus rating to negative, illustrating that even rating agencies cannot agree on the risks of a debt-fuelled deal spree.The move came just a month after rival Moody’s took a more sanguine view of the Chinese conglomerate, upgrading its outlook on the ratings of Fosun Group’s flagship listed company from negative to stable.Fosun, founded by Guo Guangchang, is China’s largest private company and also one of its most acquisitive. It has scooped up Club Med, the French holiday operator, a stake in Cirque du Soleil and another in Thomas Cook, the UK holiday group. The group has also spent more than $4bn buying insurance assets.But Fosun recently has gone quiet on the deal front after Mr Guo disappeared for four days in December in connection with a Chinese corruption probe. He was not a target of the investigation but was helping authorities, people close to the company said at the time.Fosun has aimed to copy the success of Warren Buffett by using its insurance operations to provide fresh investment capital for new deals. But S&P said on Tuesday that the group was still reliant on its other units to generate profits in the near term.“The negative outlook reflects our expectation that Fosun’s leverage for its industrial operations will remain high over the next 12 months,” S&P said. “The prospect of a material leverage reduction is uncertain, despite our expectation that Fosun will focus on consolidating its existing investments instead of more aggressive acquisitions in the near term.”Moody’s, however, seems more confident. It revised the company to a stable Ba3 outlook (equivalent to BB at S&P) last month, writing: “The stable outlook reflects Fosun’s demonstrated ability to maintain its access to the funding markets and improve its debt maturity profile, as well as Moody’s expectation that the company will prudently manage its expansion and strengthen its financial profile according to plan”.According to S&P, Fosun’s non-financial assets accounted for 45 per cent of its total assets, but 81 per cent of its revenues at the end of last year.In February Fosun dropped plans to buy Israeli insurance company Phoenix Holdings for Shk1.8bn ($462m). While the decision was taken as one of the first signs Mr Guo’s detention might be affecting its investment strategy, the company cited global market turmoil.The deal was not large by Fosun’s standards, and with the company’s net debt of $9bn and net debt to equity of 63 per cent, was considered manageable. But people close to Fosun said scrapping the requisite debt financing for the deal would lower the company’s leverage at a time when it is keen to improve its investment rating.Shares in Hong Kong-listed Fosun International are down 8.6 per cent this year.
51;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-05-24T08:02:43Z;Moody’s downgrades Deutsche Bank’s credit rating;Rating agency warns of challenges as it makes second cut this year;The credit rating agency Moody’s has cut Deutsche Bank’s debt rating for the second time this year, arguing that the German bank faces “increased challenges” in pulling off its turnround plan.The US-based rating agency said late on Monday night that it had cut the rating for Deutsche’s unsecured senior debt to Baa2 from Baa1, two notches above junk status. It also cut the lender’s long-term deposit rating one notch from A2 to A3.Last autumn, Deutsche set out a five year-plan designed to boost its profits and capital position after years of meagre returns and high legal charges. The plan envisages slashing 9000 jobs, exiting 10 countries, as well as offloading assets and cutting costs.Moody’s said that, once “substantial progress” had been made in carrying out this plan, Deutsche would have “a reduced risk profile, more balanced earnings and operate with more conservative levels of leverage”, and that as a result its ratings outlook was “stable”.However, in the shorter term, the credit agency said that the bank faced a number of challenges, pointing out that Deutsche’s performance in recent quarters — the bank made a €6.8bn loss last year — had been “weak”.It also argued that the combination of low interest rates, which have crushed banks’ net interest margins, and macroeconomic uncertainty could lead to “periods of subdued customer volumes and revenues within Deutsche Bank’s retail, asset management and institutional franchises”.As a result, Moody’s warned that “continuing headwinds could limit management’s ability to address one of the bank’s key credit challenges — to improve its structurally weak profitability and internal capital generation by 2018”.“Deutsche Bank’s new management team is executing in a disciplined way, but the headwinds have stiffened, reducing the firm’s operating flexibility,” said Peter Nerby from Moody’s.Marcus Schenck, Deutsche’s chief financial officer, played down the move, pointing out that “all key ratings remain investment grade”.“They remain in ‘A’ territory in our counterparty risk assessment and long-term deposit rating, which are most important for our clients,” he added.The downgrade is the second time Moody’s has cut Deutsche’s credit rating this year. In January, it cut the bank’s rating along with those of a number of other German banks after the country introduced changes in bail-in rules.Shares in Deutsche closed up 2.6 per cent at €15.56 in Frankfurt.
52;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-05-17T23:09:48Z;Moody’s warns of energy risk in shadow banking;Business development sector valued at $34bn is heavily exposed to oil and gas;Volatile markets could trip US business development companies’ covenants, triggering defaults in the $34bn corner of the shadow banking system, Moody’s warned on Tuesday.Falls in the valuations of energy companies to which some of the largest BDCs are heavily exposed have weakened their profitability and capital buffers, Moody’s noted, increasing the risk that they breach regulatory limits in the event of sharp moves in broader markets.Moody’s said it did not expect further energy portfolio losses to force such a breach in anything but the “unlikely” event of a full writedown, but cautioned BDCs were now more vulnerable to broader market volatility.Apollo Investment, part of Leon Black’s Apollo Global Management, and FS Investment are the most exposed to the stressed oil and gas industry of the six largest BDCs Moody’s assessed.In each case, their exposure to the sector equates to more than 100 per cent of the buffer of capital they hold above the regulatory-required minimum. Just three investments account for 60 per cent of Apollo’s buffer and 91 per cent of the surplus capital at FS, Moody’s found.BDCs represent a small corner of the financial market but industry participants have expressed concern over their exposure to energy companies which have been hurt by the fall in oil prices. Fitch warned last month of BDCs’ rising leverage, saying that they will struggle to maintain their high debt levels after the 18 biggest BDCs all boosted their indebtedness last year.BDCs were created in 1980 by an act of Congress aimed at spurring corporate lending. The vehicles can invest in a wide range of assets — from loans to subordinated debt — while paying little or no corporate tax.The sector swelled after the financial crisis on expectations BDCs would step into the vacuum left by banks constrained by new regulation. The combined market capitalisation of the BDCs is now close to $34bn, according to Fitch, a rival rating agency.Unlike banks, a BDC’s debt cannot exceed its equity. Unless BDCs stay above a 200 per cent asset coverage limit, regulators will not let them borrow or pay out dividends.“It’s a regulatory level, but it’s also included as a covenant in BDCs credit facilities, so a violation of this covenant could cause a default,” which could make the debt immediately come due, said Moody’s analyst Anna Sherbakova.“People say, ‘BDCs are so well capitalised, what is there to worry about?’ That’s exactly what we’re worried about: they have illiquid portfolios, and they have this covenant that if triggered, BDCs could potentially be forced to liquidate their illiquid portfolio.”This story has been updated to reflect a change in Moody’s calculation of surplus capital at FS.
53;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-04-15T20:23:04Z;Moody’s upgrades Argentine credit rating;Move shows further support for Buenos Aires ahead of $15bn bond sale;Moody’s upgraded Argentina’s credit rating on Friday after a US appeals court ruling this week cleared the way for Buenos Aires to proceed with the biggest debt issue by an emerging market country in 20 years.The credit rating agency said its decision to raise Argentina’s rating was driven by expectations that the country would soon resolve its 2014 debt default, and because of economic reforms since President Mauricio Macri’s market-friendly government took power in December.Although the upgrade to B3 from Caa1 keeps Argentine debt firmly in junk territory, the move represents further support for the country ahead of its $15bn bond sale due on Monday, which Alfonso Prat-Gay, finance minister, said on Thursday had prompted an “awesome” response from investors.The proceeds from the sale will allow Argentina to pay about $8bn to its “holdout” creditors, after a decade-long dispute dubbed the “sovereign debt trial of the century” triggered by the country’s 2001 economic crisis which saw it default on $100bn of debt.Once the holdouts have been paid, US court injunctions preventing Argentina from paying other creditors will be lifted, enabling it to pay some $2bn to holders of its restructured debt and put an end to its second default this century in 2014.Daniel Pollack, the court-appointed mediator between Argentina and the holdouts, said in a statement on Friday that he expected the injunctions to be lifted as soon as next Thursday or Friday, depending on how soon the bond issue is completed.Moody’s said that the upgrade was also motivated by improvements to economic policy since Mr Macri took office, including the lifting of capital controls, a devaluation and slashing of subsidies.This is an enormously important event for the Republic [of Argentina], its 40m people and the world financial systemHuge challenges remain, including an inflation rate that ended last year at about 30 per cent, representing one of the highest of all the sovereign issuers rated by Moody’s, but the agency expects it to start falling in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, Moody’s expects economic growth to start picking up next year, after a contraction of 1 per cent in 2016.Mr Pollack said the appeals court ruling would have “an enormous and positive” effect on settlements between Argentina and bondholders that had still not reached agreement. The ruling had already led to settlements with creditors with claims worth $800m, while others were “in active negotiation”.“Prior to the ruling . . . it did not seem likely that agreement could be reached with these individuals,” he said, adding that now it was “a reality about to happen”.“This is an enormously important event for the Republic [of Argentina], its 40m people and, indeed, the world financial system,” said Mr Pollack.
54;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-04-05T17:13:46Z;Soho House: party pooper;Using capital markets to fund hipster nightlife could be the club chain’s undoing;For A-listers accustomed to ignoring the velvet rope and swanning straight into the club, it is humiliating to join the queue with the proles.Soho House, the members club for creative types, now knows the feeling. Its debt was downgraded to one of the lowest junk ratings this week — several rungs below “cool” or “exclusive”.When the company, known for its modish hotels-cum-night-spots, issued £115m in bonds in 2013, it was hailed as a watershed moment for Europe’s stodgy capital markets. A medium-sized business keen to fund expansion had proved there was an alternative to bank debt.Investors were initially relaxed about Soho House’s high leverage. The original five-year bond promised a hefty 9 per cent coupon despite the clubs’ earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of only £19m. It has since increased its borrowings by another £37m.The ratio of debt to ebitda has risen from six times to more than seven times, according to Moody’s.The debt went mostly to fund new clubs, many outside core cities, such as London, Los Angeles, Berlin and New York. Some openings, which encompassed less renowned party towns such as Toronto and Chicago, have yet to generate as much cash as expected. Half of future openings will be in established locations where the company is confident of demand.The fact that revenues have grown by an impressive compound rate of more than 20 per cent for the past few years is only mildly reassuring.Soho House would need to more than triple operating earnings from its past fiscal year, which ended in June, just to meet its interest payments. The yield on its bonds shot up to 9.2 per cent from 7.5 per cent over the past year, underperforming the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Europe high-yield index.For a business that lives and dies on image and reputation, capital markets funding and rapid expansion was a big risk.

55;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-03-22T17:10:32Z;CLO managers stay calm over Valeant exposure;More than $3bn of company’s loans are held in CLOs, says Moody’s;Investors in bonds backed by risky loans remain broadly positive on deals that include the debt of pharmaceutical company Valeant, despite this week’s warning from Moody’s.The New York rating agency cautioned that roughly a third of the group’s loans had been packaged into collateralised loan obligations, securities in which loans are pooled together into bonds and sold to investors.Moody’s estimated $3.4bn worth of loans had been purchased by CLOs, including those managed by hedge funds Anchorage and Apollo, as well as Oak Hill Advisors and Silvermine, which are among the largest exposed.“In aggregate, there is a risk because it is such a widely held name,” said Chris Acito, chief executive of Gapstow Capital Partners. “That said, the most recent loan pricing I’ve seen indicates that the market doesn’t view this loan as a distressed name.”Moody’s said that 696 of the roughly 800 CLOs it rates contain Valeant debt.The average exposure across all CLOs to Valeant is 1.1 per cent, with the highest concentration held by an Apollo-managed CLO at 4.7 per cent.Valeant raised the prospect of defaulting on its debt last week, disclosing a covenant breach as a result of a delayed regulatory filing, culminating in the resignation of its chief executive Michael Pearson on Monday. Valeant’s loans have declined to about 93 cents on the dollar this year, according to Moody’s data.However, many investors and managers remain relaxed. As Valeant consults with the holders of its debt to try to negotiate new terms, managers will be incentivised not to allow the company to default, said Maggie Wang, a strategist at Citi.While some investors have backed away, unwilling to face the risk borne by holding Valeant loans, others have used the sell-off to add to positions in an attempt to build up reserve collateral.“Some managers are adding risk,” Ms Wang said. “Investors generally feel the stock has been volatile but the loans are covered. It’s not a bad decision so long as it doesn’t default and keeps paying.”Apollo, Anchorage and Oak Hill declined to comment. Silvermine failed to respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Moody’s has already downgraded Valeant from Ba3 to B1 and has the company on review for further downgrade. As a result of the review, for certain credit assessments the rating is assumed to have already been downgraded, pulling down the overall CLO credit quality and potentially triggering certain covenants that would require the manager to purchase only higher quality debt.CLOs tend to over-collateralise, meaning they hold more debt than they need to pay investors. If a CLO manager is pushed to sell out of its position in Valeant then it will probably face losses, reducing the value of the portfolio and some safeguards that exist with over-collateralisation.“A large majority of outstanding US CLOs will feel a negative effect from Valeant’s woes . . . To make matters worse, several CLOs with large exposures to Valeant are also among the most heavily exposed to the oil and gas industry, particularly the exploration and production and oilfield services sectors, which have been in turmoil since last year,” the report said.
56;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Moody’s to withdraw from Russian domestic market;Retreat by rating agency from joint venture follows ‘legislative changes and other restrictions’;Moody’s is withdrawing from the Russian domestic market as global rating agencies are caught in a dilemma between new Russian laws and western sanctions.Moody’s said on Wednesday that it would withdraw domestic credit ratings in Russia following “legislative changes and other potential restrictions” that affect the business of providing national scale ratings by its joint venture in the country, Moody’s Interfax Rating Agency.Once ratings are withdrawn, the MIRA joint venture will close.The decision from Moody’s marks the most drastic reaction so far to new Russian regulation of credit rating agencies, but highlights the risk that the country’s financial markets may become more isolated from global markets amid the tit-for-tat fallout of western sanctions against Moscow.National-scale ratings assess the creditworthiness of issuers and financial obligations within a country. Under legal amendments approved last year that take effect in 2017, Moscow will allow agencies to issue local ratings only through a subsidiary in the country that agrees to certain conditions, including a guarantee not to withdraw ratings under external political pressure.The legislation also requires central bank approval of the assignment and withdrawal of local ratings.The new rules could leave global rating agencies in violation of either western law or Russian law if applied to Russian issuers under US or EU sanctions.Moody’s is the only one of the big three global rating agencies with a joint venture in Russia. Fitch said late last month that it was considering a withdrawal of local ratings because of the new regulations. The agency issues national-scale ratings for Russian companies through a branch office, but that option will no longer be possible under the new rules. Standard & Poor’s said it was still considering its options.“The large three rating agencies in light of this regulatory change are all going in the same direction,” a person familiar with the matter said. “That gives you an indication of the smaller nature of the business.”A spokesperson for Fitch said that she expected the changes to have “little impact on our business in Russia” and that the rating agency continued to have “constructive dialogue with the Bank of Russia”.The big three agencies are expected to continue to rate Russian groups on their global scales, limiting immediate fallout from the move. About 150 ratings will be affected by Moody’s decision, although a “large majority” of those companies hold credit opinions on its international rating system.The global scale allows investors to compare the creditworthiness of issuers that operate in different jurisdictions. However, that analysis can cluster issuer ratings. National, or local ratings, have in turn been used to add further clarity.Foreign rating agencies had long lobbied against the changes, but in vain. Following the adoption of the legal amendments, Russia launched Analytical Credit Rating Agency, its own agency, in an attempt to counterbalance ratings provided by western agencies which have downgraded Russian credit. The Russian agency started operating in November.Last month, Russia announced that it was planning its first international bond sale since war in Ukraine in 2014 resulted in sanctions from western economies, as Moscow seeks fresh sources of budget funding amid a second year of recession.Separately, Moody’s put three dozen Russian and Kazakh financial institutions on review for downgrade on Wednesday, including Sberbank, Alfa-Bank and the Bank of Moscow, as the drop in oil prices reduce the creditworthiness of bank clients.The action was in part triggered by the agency’s decision to review Russia’s junk government bond rating for downgrade last week.
57;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-01-28T15:09:45Z;Successive restructurings allowed Moody’s to cut tax rate;Elaborate but lawful moves under intense focus on both sides of Atlantic;"Moody’s, the rating agency, cut its tax rate by 9 percentage points over eight years, according to documents seen by the Financial Times which spell out the lengths to which international companies will go to pay less to governments around the world. Successive restructuring plans adopted between the financial crisis and 2014 took advantage of tax codes in different jurisdictions, people familiar with the matter said, cutting Moody’s tax burden from just over 40 per cent to about 31 per cent. Moody’s net income rose more than 31 per cent over the same period.The plans included one called Project Jubilee, a proposal from PwC to reduce Moody’s US and UK tax bills which the company began implementing in 2012, according to people familiar with its details and documents seen by the FT.The elaborate structure was entirely legal, but such measures are facing growing scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic as governments push to close the loopholes companies exploit to reduce their tax bills. Tackling tax avoidance has become a priority for the Group of 20 leading economies and the OECD.Project Jubilee involved a complex series of steps that led to the formation of two new US limited liability companies, four new UK entities, and billions of dollars moving between them and other subsidiaries.Such behaviour has attracted scrutiny across major economies as governments work to close loopholes and crack down on methods adopted by companies to reduce their tax bills.This week alone, US presidential candidates have attacked “inversions” such as Johnson Controls’ $20bn Tyco deal which would move the US group’s tax base to lower-tax Ireland; Apple has defended what Brussels alleges are sweetheart tax deals; and Google has faced a backlash over its deal to pay £130m in back taxes to the UK, ending a 10-year probe into whether it shifted UK profits to Ireland.Part of Project Jubilee was a $2.3bn loan made from a US company to a UK company limited by guarantee, which was structured as a Quoted Eurobond for UK withholding tax purposes, according to documents seen by the FT. The US component of the transaction was treated as equity but was considered debt in the UK.Quoted Eurobonds — which bear interest and typically have a stock market listing without being traded — have attracted parliamentary scrutiny in the UK because they can be used to avoid the 20 per cent withholding tax on interest payments to foreign lenders, since the Quoted Eurobonds are exempt from that rule.As the G20 pledges to crack down on multinational tax avoidance, the FT looks at the issues surrounding corporate taxation and why governments are willing to help companies reduce their tax burdenThe OECD has been cracking down on such structures — known as hybrid instruments — and the “mismatch” in how they are treated in different jurisdictions. Because of that mismatch, the structures often avoid taxes in both jurisdictions, leading to a double non-taxation, including long-term deferrals.“These types of arrangements are widespread and result in a substantial erosion of the taxable bases of the countries concerned,” the OECD said in an October report. “They have an overall negative impact on competition, efficiency, transparency and fairness.”“As a global company, Moody’s is careful to ensure that it manages its business in ways that meet local laws and regulations, including in the US and the UK,” the company said. “We pay all of the taxes we are required to pay under current applicable tax codes and will continue to comply fully with our tax obligations.”As part of the $2.3bn loan, Project Jubilee also called for shares in the rating agency’s Cyprus entity to be continually transferred through at least four different US and UK entities.For the US, the Moody’s plan assumed that several of the transactions under Project Jubilee would qualify as a “tax-free” exchange as part of a rule that was aimed at removing the tax consequences companies could face as the result of incorporating an unincorporated business.That meant a tax on any gain from the exchange of shares for money would be deferred. Companies argue that global tax codes need to be overhauled and it is their duty to shareholders to find ways to pay the lowest amount of taxes possible."
58;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
59;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-01-22T12:31:55Z;Moody’s puts 175 energy and mining companies on downgrade watch;Oil groups in the spotlight amid rout in commodity prices;Several of the world’s biggest oil and gas groups — including Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Chesapeake Energy — are among 175 energy and mining companies at risk of rating downgrades following a collapse in crude and other commodities markets, Moody’s warned on Friday.Downgrades that could increase financing costs are seen as most likely for exploration and production companies in North America, where the sharp fall in oil prices is putting pressure on many groups that led the US shale boom.Moody’s has put on review for downgrades 69 US-based companies — including Schlumberger, the oil services group which on Thursday announced 10,000 job losses, and Chesapeake, the gas producer.“Multi-notch downgrades are particularly likely among issuers whose activities are centred in North America, where natural gas prices have declined dramatically along with oil prices,” said the rating agency.In a review of the natural resources industry, Moody’s blamed China’s economic slowdown for its gloomy outlook and pointed to a “substantial risk” that oil prices will recover only slowly from 12-year lows this week of less than $30 a barrel.“Oil prices have deteriorated substantially in the past few weeks and have reached nominal price lows not seen in more than a decade,” said Moody’s. “Even under a scenario with a modest recovery from current prices, producing companies will experience much lower cash flows.”Moody’s notice for 120 energy companies and 55 miners is its largest single warning of potential corporate downgrades since the financial crisis.It comes after plunges in the prices of various commodities, including iron ore, resulting in many producers’ share prices tumbling to historic lows. The slide highlights investors’ fears that companies will struggle to maintain dividend payouts and refinance debt as revenues are hit.Brent crude has fallen as much as 75 per cent from its summer 2014 peak of $115 a barrel amid weaker Chinese demand, robust US production and the decision of Opec, the oil producers’ cartel, not to cut output.Moody’s cut its projection for Brent crude this year to just $33 a barrel, barely higher than current levels, and to $38 in 2017. It said that even this assumption could prove optimistic.Brent gained 8 per cent to trade at $31.68 on Friday.US exploration and production companies are seen as vulnerable by some analysts partly because — unlike the oil majors — they do not have refining businesses that have in some cases recorded strong performances during the oil slump.“Lower oil prices will further weaken cash flows for [exploration and production] companies and the upstream portion of integrated oil and gas companies,” said Moody’s.In Europe, in addition to Shell and Total, BP is at risk of a downgrade as well as Transocean, the oil services group.The prospects for miners are bleak, primarily because of China’s economic slowdown.“China’s outsized influence on the commodities market, coupled with the need for significant recalibration of supply to bring the industry back into balance indicates that this is not a normal cyclical downturn, but a fundamental shift that will place an unprecedented level of stress on mining companies,” said Moody’s.Rio Tinto, Vale and Alcoa were among the mining-related groups earmarked by Moody’s for possible downgrades.Terry Marshall of Moody’s said Opec members engaged in a battle for market share were “contributing to the current oil glut”. He expected a rise in Iran’s output following the lifting of international sanctions “to offset or exceed” US producers’ cuts.Moody’s expects to conclude most of its planned rating reviews of energy and mining companies by the end of the first quarter.Leading oil producers’ debt is rated investment grade. Oswald Clint, analyst at Bernstein Research, said any downgrade could pose a long-term strategic disadvantage.“But in the short term, the impact on the interest cost for debt and financial instruments is an immaterial number relative to operating profits for any integrated oil company,” he added.
60;MCO;Moody's Corp;2016-01-12T17:06:02Z;State-backed debt growth lifts default fears;Doubts over government obligation to bail out stressed borrowers;Investor fears that the bloated sovereign debt market is beginning to pose risks to the world economy could soon be exacerbated by an additional threat lurking in the shadows of government finance.Since the financial crisis, a hidden pool of government-linked securities has emerged which, thanks to its hybrid status, has the potential to draw on national resources yet rarely shows up in national accounts.Borrowers backed by the state, including cities, local authorities and fully or majority state-owned companies comprise a vast, and still growing, sector highly attractive to investors because of the implicit assumption that it will be bailed out in times of trouble.Because the debt is not issued directly by the state it is not always included in official debt-to-GDP numbers. This means it is not included in analysis of a country’s solvency.To understand the scale of the sector, consider gargantuan US mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The government-sponsored enterprises were put into “conservatorship” at the height of the financial crisis but their debt was never absorbed into the US balance sheet because, the government said, the arrangement was temporary.Eight years on the conservatorship remains in place but the obligations are still outside official federal debt calculated by the Department of the Treasury.The phenomenon is not confined to the US. Mexican state-controlled oil company Pemex, government-backed Export Credit Bank of Turkey, the city of Paris, Sri Lankan Airlines and Germany’s development bank KfW are all part of the same group.In emerging markets alone, JPMorgan estimates there is now $800bn of quasi-sovereign debt in dollars and other foreign currencies.What they share is the benefit of a strong link to sovereign credit. Although not always backed by a legal guarantee, this link enables them to borrow money on markets at lower rates than other corporate debt issuers.“This practice keeps the sovereign’s official debt ratio low, thus facilitating its continued access to future borrowings,” wrote the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in a paper examining the sector last summer.“Preliminary evidence suggests that, since the global financial crisis, sovereign contingent liabilities have grown exponentially . . . How these growing contingent liabilities may be included in sovereign debt restructuring is currently unclear.”Charles de Quinsonas at M&G points out that spreads of quasi-sovereign bonds above their respective sovereigns have increased in emerging markets as concerns about corporate defaults rise. In Latin America the average spread hit 286 basis points in late 2015, compared with 98 basis points in Asia.According to the World Bank, contingent liabilities are a source of risk in part because of the erratic way they are accounted for by governments.In the UK, for example, the Office for National Statistics recently changed its mind over housing association debt, deciding it should be included in sovereign debt calculations.Mexico includes state-owned energy company Pemex in its calculations, but not debt borrowed by local governments. Brazil’s partially state-owned Petrobras is not included in Brazilian debt-to-GDP figures.Lee Buchheit, who has written on contingent liabilities along with Mitu Gulati at Duke University, says the variable accounting treatments allow some sovereigns to raise capital on the strength of their credit standing without visibly increasing the size of their stock of debt.What lies in store for financial markets in the coming year? The FT looks at the prospects for major asset classes, including currencies, emerging markets, bonds, equities and commodities“From the sovereign's standpoint, the level of explicit support depends on what the market demands,” he says. “It’s only when default is looming and a sovereign starts to point that there is no actual guarantee that things can get ugly.”Right now, this scenario is being played out in Austria, where the Alpine state of Carinthia is suffering the ill effects of offering collapsed local Hypo Alpe Adria bank a guarantee. Carinthia cannot pay, and investors want the Austrian state to stand behind the debt. Austria has refused.“It’s interesting because sovereigns and quasi-sovereigns do not default very often so it becomes a theoretical exercise for investors to try to price that risk,” says Joe Kogan, head of emerging-markets strategy at Scotiabank, who has frequently written on the sector.“In good times the spread between the two compresses but recently there have been specific problems at certain companies and spreads at places such as Pemex have increased.”The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development points out that this can skew markets by encouraging investors to favour possibly weak issuers with a strong sovereign backer, which can then suffer sell-offs during periods of lower risk appetite.Credit rating agency Moody’s says that possible weakness in quasi-sovereign borrowers is already having an impact on certain sovereign ratings in emerging markets.Recently, it cautioned Malaysia that rising contingent liabilities were weighing on its credit profile.“The key thing we look at is the likelihood that it will crystallise on the balance sheet,” says Anne Van Praagh, managing director of sovereign risk at Moody’s.“There has been notable increase of this sort of debt. It is certainly an area that would benefit from far more transparency.”
61;MCO;Moody's Corp;2015-12-18T18:25:43Z;Moody’s downgrades Glencore debt to one notch above junk;BHP Billiton rating also put on watch for possible cut amid weakening outlook for commodity prices;Glencore’s debt has been downgraded to one notch above junk status by credit rating agency Moody’s, amid a weakening outlook for commodity prices.The rating agency on Friday said the mining and trading group was cut from Baa2 to Baa3. However, by assigning its rating a ‘stable’ outlook, Moody’s indicated that it did not expect to make a further downgrade to the company’s credit rating in the coming months.Moody’s also put the rating of BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner by market capitalisation, on watch for a possible downgrade.“In the unlikely event that BHP Billiton takes no material countermeasures, the firm’s ratings are very likely to be downgraded,” Moody’s said. It gives BHP an A1 rating, stronger than that of Glencore.Cuts to these ratings, and outlooks, reflect expectations that the commodities downturn — which has accelerated this year, dragging the prices of oil, copper and other metals to multiyear lows — will persist in 2016.Miners are preparing for the possibility of a prolonged period of low prices, and Glencore — one of the most heavily indebted mining companies — has been working on a wide-ranging plan to reduce its borrowings.It has issued $2.5bn of shares, sold future silver production and reduced the inventories it holds for trading. In addition, the group plans to sell a stake in its agricultural business.This month, Glencore said it expected its actions to reduce net debt to between $18bn and $19bn by the end of 2016 — down from almost $30bn at the end of the second quarter.Elena Nadtotchi, Moody’s lead Glencore analyst, said commodity prices made “a return to the previous level of earnings unlikely . . . However, we believe that Glencore has the capacity to adjust its balance sheet to a reduced earnings level in order to maintain its investment grade ratings”.Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is crucial for trading houses such as Glencore, which rely on cheap finance to move millions of tonnes of oil and metal around the world.BHP and Glencore are also rare among miners in being significantly exposed to the oil price, as producers or traders. BHP has said it wants to keep a “strong A” credit rating.Shares in Glencore closed flat at 80.9p in London on Friday. They remain down almost 75 per cent in 2015, putting them among the market’s worst performers. Shares in BHP rose 2.5 per cent to 717.2p.
62;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EMs ‘not discriminated against’ by rating agencies;BIS paper finds no unfair treatment, but argument rages on;Rating agencies do not systematically discriminate against emerging market countries by unfairly awarding them lower credit ratings than developed nations, according to analysis published by the Bank for International Settlements.Emerging market governments and investors have long argued they are the victims of an ingrained bias against them by Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Services and Standard & Poor’s, the three US-based agencies that dominate the sector.In particular, they argue it is wrong that EM sovereigns typically have a lower credit rating than developed world governments despite, in most cases, having a lower debt burden as a proportion of gross domestic product.Analysis by Frank Packer of the BIS and Marlene Amstad of the Chinese University of Kong Kong, Shenzhen, demonstrates clearly that EMs tend to have lower ratings than developed economies despite being less indebted.As the first chart shows, Japan, with a gross debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 200 per cent, has an average rating of A+, near the middle of the investment-grade ratings. Other developed nations with big sovereign debt loads such as France, the UK and the US have higher ratings still.Yet the vast majority of EM governments are rated more lowly than Japan, despite having far smaller debt burdens. And while this ratings gap may be narrowing, it appears to be doing so very slowly.In 2007, for any given debt-to-GDP ratio, an EM government typically had a rating eight to 12 notches lower than a similarly indebted advanced one, the analysis found. This gulf has diminished a little since then, but only by two notches.Despite this, Mr Packer and Ms Amstad argue that the ratings system is fair. First, they point out that emerging market governments typically have to pay higher interest rates than developed world ones.For instance, while Japan’s debt load is more than 200 per cent of GDP and that of Turkey is little more than 30 per cent, Japan currently spends just 1.5 per cent of its GDP servicing this debt, while Turkey has to pay more than 3 per cent of GDP, as the first chart also shows.Using debt affordability, rather than the debt burden, to measure credit worthiness “considerably reduces the difference in the treatment of advanced and emerging market debt ratios”, the study claims.By this measure, the “penalty” for being an emerging nation has fallen from about 7.5 notches in 2007 to five notches in 2015.This is illustrated in the second set of charts, which map debt affordability (defined as interest payments as a percentage of general government revenue) against the average credit rating.A penalty for being EM still appears to exist, but it is somewhat smaller, with a smattering of developed nations now seemingly more harshly rated than some EMs.However, the authors argue that even this remaining gap essentially drops away when more variables are introduced into the analysis, such as per capita GDP and whether or not a country has a flexible exchange rate or reserve currency status.Perhaps the most important of these additional variables is a government’s default history, with a default since 1983 typically reducing a country’s credit rating by four notches.Taking all these factors into account, the authors conclude that the penalty for being an emerging market is less than one notch, and is “statistically insignificant”.The paper also looked at the views of some smaller rating agencies, such as Dagong Global Credit Ratings, China’s largest agency, German asset manager Feri and the Japan Credit Rating Agency.It found that these bodies typically give higher ratings to EMs than the big three houses do, and lower ratings to advanced countries. Dagong and Feri both have a smaller ratings gap between EMs and DMs than Fitch, Moody’s or S&P.This raises the question of who is right? The paper answers this by arguing that the findings of the big-three agencies are more in line with market measures, such as credit default swap spreads and the views of institutional investors.“If a bias does exist [in the work of the big three] it is one shared with financial markets and asset managers more generally,” the authors state.Not everyone is convinced by this analysis, however. Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore, an EM-focused asset manager, argues that the default history variable used by Mr Packer and Ms Amstad is a “de facto EM dummy variable”.He is critical of the fact that this measure penalises countries for defaulting in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s “when EM was still caught up in the cold war and countries were indeed very badly managed”. He argues instead for a variable that only picks up defaults since 2000, “when the cold war regime had truly been purged from the system”.“It is simply not fair to judge EM countries by events that occurred 40 years or more back in time. This is a de facto dummy [EM] variable but with more power because some countries defaulted more than once,” Mr Dehn says.Secondly, he argues that this analysis lets developed countries off the hook by taking a “really strange, narrow-minded view of what constitutes a default”.Mr Dehn says developed countries tend not to default in the classic sense because they often have global reserve currencies, which makes central banks “captive buyers” of their debt, and sizeable pension industries, which are also natural buyers.“They don’t need to default because they have someone who will always buy these assets,” says Mr Dehn. However, he argues that investors in developed-world sovereign debt can still lose money as a result of higher-than-expected inflation or debasement of a currency.“Developed markets can force pension funds to hold bonds that make losses so pensioners get screwed, or debase currencies so that foreign holders of bonds get screwed. These types of defaults are simply not considered at all.“Rating agencies do not class this as a default, but in P & L [profit and loss account] terms it’s exactly the same,” adds Mr Dehn, who describes the prevailing view that developed market sovereign bonds are “risk-free” and those of emerging markets are “risky” as “financial apartheid”.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
63;MCO;Moody's Corp;2015-12-04T15:23:29Z;Corporate debt downgrades hit $1tn worth of issues;Defaults rise to post-crisis highs as investors fear end of credit cycle;More than $1tn in US corporate debt has been downgraded this year as defaults climb to post-crisis highs, underlining investor fears that the credit cycle has entered its final innings.The figures, which will be lifted by downgrades on Wednesday evening that stripped four of the largest US banks of coveted A level ratings, have unnerved credit investors already skittish from a pop in volatility and sharp swings in bond prices.Analysts with Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch expect default rates to increase over the next 12 months, an inopportune time for Federal Reserve policymakers, who are expected to begin to tighten monetary policy in the coming weeks.S&P has cut its ratings on US bonds worth $1.04tn in the first 11 months of the year, a 72 per cent jump from the entirety of 2014. In contrast, upgrades have fallen to less than $500bn, more than a third below last year’s total.The New York-based rating agency has more than 300 US companies on review for downgrade, twice the number of groups its analysts have identified for potential upgrade.“The credit cycle is long in the tooth by any standardised measure,” Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit at DoubleLine Capital, which manages $80bn, said. “The Fed’s quantitative easing programme helped to defer a default cycle and with the Fed poised to increase rates, that may be about to change.”Much of the decline in fundamentals has been linked to the significant slide in commodity prices, with failures in the energy and metals and mining industries making up a material part of the defaults recorded thus far, Diane Vazza, an analyst with S&P, said.“Those companies have been hit hard and will continue to be hit hard,” Ms Vazza noted. “Oil and gas is a third of distressed credits, that’s going to continue to be weak.”Some 102 companies have defaulted since the year’s start, including 63 in the US. Only three companies in the country have retained a coveted triple A rating: ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft, with the oil major on review for possible downgrade.Portfolio managers and credit desks have already begun to push back at offerings seen as too risky as they continue a flight to quality. Bankers have had to offer steep discounts on several junk bond deals to fill order books, and some were caught off guard when Vodafone, the investment grade UK telecoms group, had to pull a debt sale after investors demanded greater protections.Bond prices, in turn, have slid. The yield on the Merrill Lynch high-yield US bond index, which moves inversely to its price, has shifted back up above 8 per cent. For the lowest rung triple-C and lower rated groups, yields have hit their highest levels in six years.A large portion of the lowest quality debt issuers will face “severe refinancing challenges” by 2018 as cash flow generation remains weak, Matthew Mish, a credit strategist with UBS, noted.“It is our humble belief that the consensus at the Fed does not fully understand the magnitude of the problems in corporate credit markets and the unintended consequences of their policy actions,” Mr Mish said. “The implication is that their actions will be reactive, not proactive — but only time will tell.”

It centres on a 2011 report by Moody’s that scored 61 companies for 20 so-called “red flags” covering corporate governance weaknesses, opacity of business models, speed of growth and the quality of their earnings and financial statements.Of the five companies that raised the most flags in the report, one has collapsed, another is entering liquidation and shares in the other three are trading at least 50 per cent below their pre-report levels, compared with a 10 per cent fall in the broader Hong Kong market in the same timeframe.No details of the SFC’s complaint are so far available. The fact there was any action only became public when a request for privacy by Moody’s was turned down by the appeals tribunal late last year. Like regulators elsewhere, the SFC only announces case details once fines or other actions have been taken.“While we haven’t yet seen the full case, it is of real concern to anyone enjoying freedom of speech — and the ability to be right or wrong in their analysis,” said David Webb, an investor and corporate governance activist in Hong Kong. “You have to invert this scenario and then ask whether the SFC would equally go after a ‘green flag’ report recommending stocks.”Rating agencies came under SFC oversight in 2011.Mark Steward, the SFC’s enforcement head, said in a speech in March that disciplinary cases such as this one “involve allegations that the firm has breached required standards of conduct, eg poor or substandard work or management practices”.He added that one question in the Moody’s case “will be whether there was a reasonable basis for these red flags — were they actually red flags or was there a less alarming explanation — as well as the adequacy of the control process”.Moody’s said it “disagrees that the report was misleading — or that there were any deficiencies in its procedures governing the provision of credit rating services — and looks forward to presenting its case”.The SFC declined to comment further on Wednesday.At least one company mentioned in the Moody’s report publicly disputed its findings. Kaisa Group, the Chinese property developer that defaulted this year, issued a clarification two days after publication to say it had not changed auditors, as Moody’s had claimed.Kaisa raised seven red flags — joint top in the property sector.The five companies that raised the most flags according to the report were West China Cement, Winsway Coking Coal (now Winsway Enterprises) China Lumena, Hidili Industries and LDK Solar, which each triggered between nine and 12.
65;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Moody’s warns over lending crackdown threat to refinancing;Healthy but highly leveraged companies at risk amid ‘unintended consequences’ of US rules shake-up;Highly indebted companies could struggle to refinance their debts as a result of the US crackdown on risky bank lending, according to a new report from Moody’s that warns of the “unintended consequences” of loan regulation.Leveraged loans — the loan equivalent of junk bonds — were heavily criticised for their role in the 2008 financial crisis. In 2013 new guidelines restricted the terms on which banks could lend along with the amount.But with a new refinancing cycle set to kick off in earnest in 2018, Moody’s has warned the guidelines could make it more difficult to refinance the $90bn of loans due in that year alone.“We’re worried about who’s going to be there to refinance some of these very leveraged companies,” said Christina Padgett, senior vice-president at the credit rating agency. Tougher loan conditions could make life difficult for otherwise healthy companies, she added.“If you’re challenged to de-lever and then you have to refinance with higher pricing it will just leave even less capital available for investing in the business,” said Ms Padgett.Leveraged lending guidelines were designed to lower bank exposure to risky loans and reduce systemic risk. They set deadlines for repayment of debt and say banks should only “originate” loans up to six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.In November, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve clarified the guidelines to make it clear originating a loan included refinancing of existing loans. The agencies estimated $255bn, or 33.2 per cent, of existing leveraged loans fell foul of the guidelines and were termed “criticised”.The success of the guidelines has been described by Barclays analysts as a test of regulators’ ability to curb risky banking practices. Eric Gross, credit strategist at the bank, said the uncertainty about how existing loans would be financed could contribute to an increase in volatility.“A lot of companies [with existing loans] could be caught outside the leveraged lending guidelines and they may find the banks are basically in somewhat of a grey area in terms of whether they can or can’t participate,” he said.Meredith Coffey, executive vice-president of research and analysis at the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, an industry body, says companies are likely to face tougher loan terms when they try to refinance, even if their finances have improved since the loan was first issued.We’re worried about who’s going to be there to refinance some of these very leveraged companies“It would be like if you cleaned up your credit rating, went back to have your mortgage refinanced and the bank said you could borrow less and you’d have to pay more,” she said.An OCC spokesperson said banks should only refinance criticised loans if there were “effective” strategies in place to improve the credit.Moody’s reports the leveraged lending guidelines have helped reduce the supply of loans, in part because the six-times leverage restriction has contributed to a decline in the number of leverage buyouts. Leveraged loan issuance fell 32.8 per cent to $371.5bn in the first half of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters.However, the fall has corresponded with a decline in covenant quality and an increase in the amount of financing provided by the likes of Macquarie, Nomura and Jefferies, nonbanks who are not covered by the guidelines, a shift that undermines the regulation, Moody’s warns.Richard Handler, chairman and chief executive of Jefferies, currently the most active nonbank leveraged buyout underwriter, said leveraged loans at more than six times ebitda were a “tiny fraction” of its business and that 93 per cent of such deals in the market involved banks.
66;MCO;Moody's Corp;2015-07-08T14:43:44Z;Lower oil pressures energy junk debt;Default rates forecast to rise for energy sector;"Declining oil prices are increasing the pressure on junk bonds, fuelling a rise in company defaults concentrated among energy firms.Data from rating agency Standard & Poor’s shows 59 defaults globally in 2015 compared to 26 for the same period last year, with almost half coming from the Energy and Natural Resources sector.Pressure on speculative-rated energy issuers of debt will only intensify should oil prices fall further into bear market territory, say analysts, with rising defaults making it harder for companies to secure financing and roll over maturing bonds and loans.Commodities prices have come under recent pressure with oil markets experiencing particular strain this week, against the backdrop of share market turmoil in China and the prospect of more crude supply entering the market.Brent crude fell 8 per cent and below $60 a barrel earlier this week, a level that had held since mid-April. Nymex August West Texas Intermediate, the US crude benchmark, dropped more than 3 per cent on Tuesday to its lowest price in almost three months.“The [junk] market rallied on the back of stabilising oil prices,” said Raman Srivastava, managing director for global fixed income at Standish. “If oil prices stay at these levels or fall further, then we’re going to see companies default . . . Some companies can cut costs and adjust, but not all can.”A major US junk bond index’s yield, which moves inversely to price, rose 15 basis points on Monday from its close on Friday, and a further seven basis points on Tuesday — a continuation of its 46 basis point sell-off through June.In recent years, issuers of junk debt have benefited from record low interest rates, enticing investors to move further down the credit spectrum in a desperate search for yield, offering the chance of financing to companies that otherwise may have struggled to issue bonds.Prolonged weakness in the price of oil stands to apply further pressure on energy companies and the junk bond sector. Rating agency Moody's calculated a 5.75 per cent 12-month trailing default rate for metals, mining and oil and gas sectors in May, compared with 3.34 per cent at the start of the year.“As you see more stress and credit losses then investors will begin to discriminate more,” said Matthew Mish, credit strategist at UBS. “The concern we have is that those borrowers that have lived off the bid for yield with fundamentals that aren’t robust, will at some point see fundamentals come back and matter more to investors.”Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingMichael Contopoulos, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the looming prospect of rising interest rates could see junk bonds attraction deteriorate as other, less risky asset classes begin to offer adequate returns.Others are more optimistic, seeing the current turmoil as temporary and tied to uncertainty on the international stage, particularly in Greece and China. A deal over a Greek bailout should stabilise oil prices, said Daniel Morris, global investment strategist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management.“We have a considered view about what this means for investments,” he said. “We haven’t seen a big sell-off yet. We think it will recover.”"
67;MCO;Moody's Corp;2015-06-23T10:46:29Z;Moody’s to reassess clearing house risks;Industry worries about new ‘too big to fail’ entities;The credit quality of clearing houses involved in derivatives and whether they are a potential source of systemic risk is triggering a reassessment of the industry by Moody’s, the rating agency.Clearing houses have assumed a crucial role within the massive over-the-counter derivatives industry in the wake of the financial crisis. Regulators have mandated that derivatives move into clearing houses, so that the central authority can collect collateral from entities involved in a trade. This helps cover potential losses should a counterparty default, with the aim of reducing credit risk and averting the kind of derivative market turmoil that erupted with the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.But some observers have warned concentrating risk in one place increases the systemic consequences should a clearing house fail, leaving taxpayers on the hook in a crisis. With some in the industry calling clearing houses “too-big-to-fail” institutions, regulators are on a fact-finding mission with the intention of eventually introducing global standards for stress tests, to assess their ability to cope in difficult market conditions.Against that backdrop, Moody’s has put out a request for comment from industry participants to create a new methodology and rating for clearing houses.“We believe these institutions have always had a very elevated systemic risk profile,’’ said Ana Arsov, associate managing director at Moody’s, who spearheaded the development of the methodology. “But now with the mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives their profile is even more elevated.”The agency currently produces ratings for some of the exchanges’ holding companies that also run clearing houses, such as CME Group, the London Stock Exchange, which owns LCH.Clearnet, and Intercontinental Exchange.But all of these ratings use existing securities standards and are not specifically designed for rating clearing houses that process large amounts of OTC derivatives trades.“[The new methodology] will reflect our opinion first and foremost on the ability of the clearing house to meet its clearing and settlement obligations to its members and then to determine the financial loss that could result if clearing houses were unable to meet these obligations,” Ms Arsov said.It divides the assessment of a clearing house into four broad categories: intrinsic credit strength, operating environment, qualitative adjustments and affiliate and systemic support.The last of these seeks to address the issue of a clearing house requiring government support if it failed.“What is the significance of the products being cleared, what is the market impact if a clearing house defaults and what kind of public involvement would be required,” she said. “These are all things that we would take into consideration to decide if a systemic support uplift in the rating is warranted.”
68;MCO;Moody's Corp;2015-05-12T23:10:18Z;Moody’s downgrades Chicago to junk;Challenge for Rahm Emanuel as rating agency’s move could trigger $2.2bn in claims;Moody’s has stripped Chicago of its investment grade rating over its yawning pension plan deficit, potentially triggering up to $2.2bn of claims and setting back mayor Rahm Emanuel’s efforts to turn around the finances of America’s third-biggest city.The credit rating agency lowered its grade on the city’s debt by two notches — from Baa2 to Ba1, a rung often called “junk” — after a ruling from the Illinois Supreme Court last week limited both Chicago’s and the state of Illinois’s ability to handle unfunded pension plans.Mayor Emanuel, re-elected in April after a close campaign, savaged the Moody’s downgrade as “irresponsible”, arguing that it did not take into account Chicago’s “growing economy [and] progress we have made on our legacy financial liabilities”.The relegation affects $8.9bn of general obligation, sales and motor fuel tax-backed debt. Moody’s kept a negative outlook on Chicago’s rating, indicating that it could lower its rating further into junk territory.“Whether or not the current statutes that govern Chicago’s pension plans stand, we expect the costs of servicing Chicago’s unfunded liabilities will grow, placing significant strain on the city’s financial operations absent commensurate growth in revenue,” Matthew Butler, a Moody’s analyst, said in the report.The downgrade to junk will exacerbate Chicago’s financial difficulties. Although municipal bond investors will not be forced to sell their holdings as Standard & Poor’s and Fitch still rate the city investment grade, Moody’s noted that its move could give lenders and counterparties on other financial deals the option to demand up to $2.2bn in accelerated principal, interest and termination fees.“This action by Moody’s is not only premature, but it is irresponsible to play politics with Chicago’s financial future by pushing the city to increase taxes on residents without reform,” Mr Emanuel said in a statement.He added: “I am committed to focus on both reform and revenue to address Chicago’s fiscal crisis, and we will continue our work in Springfield and with our partners in labour to ensure we will always meet our obligations, protect the retirements of our workforce [and] continue to deliver vital city services, while protecting our taxpayers.”Mr Emanuel made his ability to steer the city through tough financial waters the centrepiece of his recent re-election campaign, which saw a relatively unknown rival draw the high-profile Democrat into a run-off.The mayor often touts the deals he has struck with two of the city’s four employee pension funds as evidence of his ability to persuade labour to accept some cuts. But the recent Illinois Supreme Court ruling that struck down a 2013 state pension law raises questions about whether his pension deals can withstand legal challenges under a state constitution that treats employee benefits as sacrosanct.The Illinois Supreme Court decision was expected, but has still weighed further on bonds in the state since the ruling was made last Friday.
69;MCO;Moody's Corp;2015-01-29T02:23:35Z;P2P consumer loans given landmark rating;Moody’s move is a big win for nascent sector as it seeks to expand by tapping new types of investors;A bundle of peer-to-peer consumer loans has been given a credit rating by Moody’s, the first time a major rating agency has evaluated a securitisation deal created by the fast-growing “P2P” lending industry.Achieving such a credit rating is a major win for the nascent peer-to-peer, or marketplace lending, sector as it seeks to expand by tapping new types of investors.Data-driven technology and online platforms are used to directly connect borrowers with lenders, extending financing at a lower rate than that offered by traditional lenders while simultaneously generating higher returns for investors.In recent years, P2P lenders have seen an influx of cash from professional investors including hedge funds and asset managers keen to buy up the P2P loans originated through the platforms. Securitising the loans into saleable bonds allows investors to further boost their returns by applying leverage to the deals.Securing a credit rating is expected to open up the sector to a broader range of investors such as pension funds and insurers. It also means a new line of business for bankers who are seeking fresh types of assets that can be bundled into securitisations in the aftermath of the housing crash that led to big losses on bundles of subprime mortgages.The $327m deal, called Consumer Credit Origination Loan Trust 2015-1, was put together by BlackRock Financial Management and involves packaging loans originated through Prosper, the world’s second-biggest P2P lender.Moody’s gave the $281m top slice of the deal an investment-grade rating of “Baa3” while the lower $45m portion has been given a speculative-grade rating of “Ba3”. The rating agency said that its cumulative net loss expectation for the CCOLT 2015-1 loan pool is 8 per cent.The deal features a $50m prefunding feature that will see investors essentially buy into the securitisation before the P2P loans have even been originated.Such prefunding accounts were a hallmark of securitisations sold before the financial crisis. They have made a return in recent years as investors clamour to put their money into anything that might generate higher returns.The swiftness of the rating may surprise some financial market participants. Many believed rating agencies were taking a cautious approach to evaluating new asset classes in the aftermath of the crisis, which saw them accused of handing out top-tier ratings to undeserving bonds.Nevertheless, the prospect of a vibrant market for P2P securitisations has attracted interest from Wall Street, where a wide range of financial institutions is salivating over the chance to make money by packaging, selling and providing financing for the deals.The hedge fund Eaglewood Capital was first to securitise P2P loans with a $53m unrated deal sold in 2013. Last year, SoFi scored a major win for the industry when it received an investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor’s for a securitisation of P2P student loans. Jefferies announced last year that it would buy and securitise $500m worth of P2P loans originated through CircleBack Lending.The FT previously reported that BlackRock was working with Prosper to create the first rated transaction of P2P consumer loans. Santander is believed to be working with Lending Club, the world’s biggest P2P lender, on a similar deal.Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of PeerIQ, a risk analytics platform for the P2P industry, said such securitisations open the sector to a “broad” pool of investors and capital. “Rated securitisations are a step forward in the maturation of P2P lending into a full-blown asset class,” he added.
70;MCO;Moody's Corp;2015-01-13T22:36:19Z;Contractors caught in Petrobras scandal;Fitch cuts ratings for builders facing financing constraints in wake of kickbacks probe;"The fallout from a scandal at Brazil’s Petrobras deepened on Tuesday with the downgrade of the credit ratings of several of the state-run oil operator’s construction contractors.Fitch downgraded its ratings for builders Construtora Queiroz Galvão, Galvão Participações, Galvão Engenharia and Mendes Júnior Trading and Engenharia with the first three remaining on negative outlook.The rating agency said it was concerned that an investigation into allegations of a political kickback scheme at Petrobras meant “decreasing financing options for most companies in the sector; yet-to-be determined punitive measures . . . and the potential restructuring, suspension or delays [of] existing contracts with Petrobras”.Employees of Petrobras and some of its contractors have been accused by police of inflating the value of projects for their own profit and paying kickbacks to politicians, mostly from the ruling Workers’ Party coalition.While some of the contractors have denied involvement, the sector is under scrutiny in markets after OAS, another Petrobras contractor, missed two payments on its debt and is edging closer to a formal default.Petrobras has also frozen payments to 23 construction groups, raising the prospect of further financial distress in a sector that is considered essential to the country’s drive to improve its inadequate infrastructure.The impact of the scandal has started to spread beyond construction to other service providers of Petrobras, with Moody’s Investors Service announcing on Tuesday it was reviewing the ratings of the oil company’s drilling rig contractors.Moody’s said this was due to “the convergence of a number of credit pressures, including weakening industry fundamentals, uncertainties due to the ongoing corruption allegations and liquidity risk associated to the deteriorating credit profile of [Petrobras]”.In its statement, Fitch said, however, that it had maintained the ratings of several of Brazil’s bigger construction groups that were also caught up in the scandal.One of these, Camargo Corrêa, had seen its chief executive, vice-president and chairman of the board of its engineering and construction subsidiary incarcerated, Fitch said.Yet the engineering unit accounts for only a relatively small proportion of the group’s earnings, which are supported by its cement division.“If Petrobras’ ban continues for six months, and if it extends to the cement division, a negative rating action is likely,” Fitch said of Camargo Corrêa.It said two other large contractors, Construtora Andrade Gutierrez and Construtora Norberto Odebrecht, were also on the list of companies temporarily banned from new deals with Petrobras. But Fitch did not downgrade them, saying Petrobras represented only a fraction of their order books."
71;MCO;Moody's Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rating agencies: Outlook unchanged;Criticised for their role in the crisis, the big three actors were expected to reform – but their efforts have come unstuck;"Paul Taylor reaches into a folder of papers. “Cue another prop,” he says. The chief executive of Fitch Ratings, the number three credit rating agency, brandishes a report his analysts recently put out entitled “Bond bubble threat for US corporate bond investors”, which warns that there could be significant losses across the financial system if interest rates rise and bond prices go south. It is the latest in a string of “big picture” publications designed to persuade us that Fitch is thinking big thoughts, that it is taking a bird’s-eye view of the world economy and that it is not the type of company to miss, say, a whopping financial crisis in the making.“We have a lot of internal debate,” he says. “I could give you all kinds of internal discussion, emails and documents from 2004 about the US housing market. None of that was ever published as research – and at the end of it we didn’t follow it, we got it wrong. But had we had some kind of report out at that point saying, ‘we’re concerned about this, we’re not sure, we think about it, there’s some tail risk going on here’, then we’d have been in a far better position than we currently are, because we wouldn’t be seen as quite so silly as people think we were.”Rating agencies’ outsized role in the credit crisis is well known. By validating the transformation of subprime mortgages into triple A rated securities, based on mistaken assumptions about the US housing market, they contributed to the infection of the global financial system.The public and political opprobrium has been intense, with much of the blame laid at a central conflict of interest in the agencies’ business model, namely that they are beholden for their revenues on the issuers of the debt they are judging. Their high-impact downgrades of sovereign debt in Europe and the US have made them even more unpopular.Yet one by one, ideas for radical reform of the industry have failed. Issuers still pay the bills and still get to pick which agency rates their debt. Power is still concentrated in the big three agencies – Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch – that rate 96 per cent of all the world’s bonds. And attempts to strip credit ratings of their central role in financial regulation are proving complicated. So why does the post-crisis landscape look such a lot like it did pre-crisis? Critics of the industry point to intense lobbying by rating agencies and Wall Street more generally, as powerful market actors assert their self-interest.But there is an alternative view, recognised by some of the smaller rating agencies who hope to gain from the discomfort of the big three, which is that many mooted changes foundered on the rocks of impracticality.Executives at the leading agencies say the need for radical change was always based on a false premise.In the long menu of possible causes of the credit crisis from which historians will choose, the “issuer-pays” business model of the credit rating agencies will surely remain a favourite.The model has proved impossible to change.To continue reading, click here“That conflicts of interest led to inflated ratings at Moody’s is a concept I categorically reject,” says Raymond McDaniel, the agency’s chief executive. “One way to try and answer this is to make the argument in the negative. Why would it affect only housing and why would it affect only mortgage securities?”While the assumptions about ever-rising house prices were wrong, other Moody’s ratings on complicated structured finance products, based on different assumptions about how many people would pay their credit-card bills or make good on their car loans, performed well over the deep recession, he said. Fitch and S&P make a similar point.In the US, a Senate committee found that credit rating agencies “at times gave into pressure from the investment banks and accorded them undue influence in the ratings process”, but no evidence that has led to any action by regulators. An Australian court, finding against S&P, said a “reasonably competent” rating agency could not have given a triple A rating to mortgage-backed securities that the judge described as “grotesquely complicated”, but in the US and Europe agencies have so far largely been successful in fighting off liability for the fallout from faulty ratings.Rating agencies’ processes for managing conflicts of interest are now more closely scrutinised following a demand by the G20 in 2009 that they be brought under the oversight of regulators. Nine agencies are formally registered in the US and 20 in Europe.Outside the big three there is consternation. Smaller rivals fear that the cost of new rules is entrenching the status quo, making it ever harder to shake up the industry.“It’s hard for anybody to complain too loudly about all this new, relatively onerous regulation because it’s pretty obvious why we are finding ourselves in this situation,” says Dan Curry, president at DBRS, Canada’s dominant rater, which has been trying to build a bigger global footprint. “We tried to politely point out to regulators that they designed all this regulation looking at, particularly, Moody’s and S&P, and a lot of these smaller agencies are going to get caught in the crossfire. Everyone’s saying they’d like more competition but what you’re doing is impeding competition and creating big barriers to entry.”According to executives at the big three companies, they are entrenched for a reason: reputations and analytical prowess built up over generations. S&P traces its history back to 1860, when Henry Varnum Poor published his History of the Railroads and Canals of the United States; John Moody & Company published Moody’s Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities in 1900. Fitch, established in 1913, thinks of itself as a hungry young challenger, and the best horse for those looking to back competition in the industry.Mr McDaniel is sceptical that the industry can sustain many more actors. “There were eight or nine agencies back in the late 80s and early 90s. They had a choice to compete or to sell out, and they chose to sell.”On both sides of the Atlantic, reformers have pushed an idea they say will deal with the conflict of interest at the heart of the “issuer pays” business model and encourage more competition for the big three. The idea is that there would be an independent body to stand between the issuers of asset-backed securities and the rating agencies, assigning work on new issues to agencies in rotation or according to expertise. Smaller rivals that might otherwise find it hard to persuade issuers to use them will be able quickly to build a record of ratings.However, a reform package unveiled in November by Michel Barnier, EU commissioner for financial services, limited the idea to so-called resecuritised products – instruments that have all but died out since the financial crisis.In the US, the idea of a central rating assignment body is being championed by Senator Al Franken, but a Securities and Exchange Commission report last month sounded sceptical. It spent 390 words on the benefits of the idea and 1,700 words on the drawbacks, and recommended only that there be more discussion.“This is the easiest way to make sure there is no conflict of interest and to break the oligopoly,” Mr Franken said. “Unless it is addressed, people are going to get hurt again and the whole economy is going to get hurt again.”In some areas of the market, there are stirrings of greater competition. When it comes to ratings on new commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), instruments made out of parcels of loans on office blocks and retail parks, you are as likely to find newcomers Kroll, Morningstar and DBRS as you are S&P, which withdrew from the market for a year while it fixed mistakes in its ratings model.Yet for all DBRS’s progress, and even if the Franken plan were to be implemented, Mr Curry cautions that it will be a long time before newcomers nibble any significant market share from the big three. “Even something that looks like a big change is going to actually cause things to change gradually over many years,” he said.…There is at least one other big item on the reform agenda that is being implemented. The G20 urged regulators around the world to stop relying on credit ratings for judging the safety and soundness of the banks and financial companies under their purview. So what if S&P and Moody’s decide that the assets on a bank’s balance sheet are investment grade? Regulators should come up with other ways to decide how risky an asset is and therefore how much capital a bank must hold in reserve in the event of losses. The idea is to reduce the importance of credit ratings to the overall financial system and to make sure there is less damage the next time that the agencies miss, for example, a whopping crisis in the making.However, it has proved easier to wipe away references to credit ratings than it has been to decide what to replace them with.The Bank for International Settlements, writing new international capital requirements known as Basel III, is consulting on complicated rules governing how banks can use their own internal models for deciding the credit risk of structured finance assets. It recognises, however, that some smaller institutions will not be sufficiently sophisticated to do this and will instead have to rely on rating agencies after all.Some work by the UK Financial Services Authority has found that banks’ own models, relative to external credit ratings, will sometimes understate the risks.Larry White, the New York University professor who argued for eliminating ratings from prudential regulations, admits it is hard work. “You need more regulators, you need them to be well paid and you need them to be respected.”It is at least work that the rating agencies themselves profess to welcome. None wants their ratings to be treated as gospel; none wants downgrades to cause shockwaves through the financial system because of automatic triggers in capital rules. They just want to be seen making an honest, educated and hopefully more successful job forecasting the future.“I don’t want to give the impression we haven’t changed,” Fitch’s Mr Taylor says. “We’ve changed lots. We’ve changed people, we’ve changed process where we’ve needed to, we’ve got a lot better at publishing more information. But I don’t want to just sell that point. The important point is lots of what we were doing was working absolutely fine and has continued to work fine. And one of the reasons I feel a bit sorry for ourselves is, if you look at the people who use our product, if you look at our customers, they know that.”"
72;MCO;Moody's Corp;2010-05-04T17:42:16Z;Barnier considers EU rating agency;;The European Union senior financial services regulator said on Tuesday he would look at setting up a European credit rating agency, as he expressed concern over the way in which Greek debt was dealt with.Michel Barnier, EU internal market commissioner who has responsibility for the financial services sector, told European lawmakers that he had watched, with surprise, the “rapid deterioration of the [Greek] rating”.“I’m as frustrated as you are,” he said.Speaking to the European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee, Mr Barnier said the agencies had considerable power and that was why he urged them last week to act responsibly and consider the impact of their actions.The commissioner noted that new pan-EU rules governing credit rating agencies – which will require them to register for the first time and be more transparent about their ratings methodologies – will come into force in December. This legislation was passed last year, in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial turmoil when the role of agencies was subject to much criticism.Mr Barnier held out the possibility that there could now be further constraints on agencies’ activities. “Will that be enough ? I don’t know. We’ll have to evaluate the situation very quickly,” he told MEPs.One area the commissioner highlighted, in particular, was whether there should be more diversity in the rating agency market – which is dominated by three players, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch.“We need more competition and diversity in rating agencies,” he said.The creation of a new European-based rating agency, which could specialise in sovereign debt, could help resolve that problem.But Mr Barnier gave few details of how such an institution might work and whether, for example, it should be publicly or privately owned. Officials said later the commission’s thinking in this area was still at a very early stage.Rating agencies maintained on Tuesday that they were performing a duty to investors by providing an independent view of long-term credit risk.Mr Barnier’s comments came in the course of a wide-ranging hearing, in which he laid out the commission’s extensive plans for new financial services regulation this year and promised that Brussels would fulfil all its G20 commitments on this score over the next 12 months.Mr Barnier also said he would be asking the commission to adopt a “green paper” aimed at reinforcing corporate governance in financial groups next month and going ahead with improvements to the deposit guarantee fund directive this summer.He also pledged to go further, in terms of new disclosure rules on short selling, than the current proposals put forward by EU securities regulators.The commissioner also proposed delaying the entry into force of solvency rules for the insurance sector until the end of 2012. Although the delay is just two months, it could give more time to thrash out fine details for the new regime, which are proving contentious, and fit better with the accounting deadlines of most EU insurers.
73;MCO;Moody's Corp;2010-04-28T23:17:58Z;CDO fees flow to ratings agencies;;Credit rating agencies are still being paid millions of dollars a year to report on the performance of collateralised debt obligations that have lost most of their value despite having been issued in many cases with triple A stamps of approval.The fees, known as “ratings surveillance” payments, are paid to the agencies ahead of any payments to investors under the terms of the CDO contracts – and without regard to how accurate the original ratings were.US regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have proposed new rules to link such fees to the performance of the underlying deals. This was not a common practice in the run-up to the financial crisis.The terms of the CDO contracts highlight how lucrative these instruments were for the agencies, with annual pay-outs of up to $50,000 made to track deals. Such payments come on top of the fees received to rate the initial transactions. The fees paid to the rating agencies have become controversial following the collapse of so many securities that were issued with the highest ratings.A congressional investigation found last week that Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s, the biggest rating agencies, were unduly influenced in assigning ratings on CDOs by the banks that paid these fees.Ratings surveillance fees are still being paid on CDOs that have suffered “an event of default”, meaning payments to some investors have ceased. Such CDOs often escape liquidation because of the complexity of the underlying contracts.Ramius, which handles CDO liquidations, estimated that 290 mortgage-related CDOs that have had an “event of default” have not been liquidated yet.As long as these CDOs are not liquidated, they typically allow for payments to service providers, including ratings agencies.These payments are at the top of the “waterfall”, the term used to describe the way money is passed through CDOs, which pool debts or securities and distribute the cash to investors. Even the most distressed CDOs often still generate some cash.From 2004 to 2007, Moody’s and S&P produced a record number of ratings and record revenues, primarily because they expanded their business rating mortgage-backed securities and CDOs.The liquidation of CDOs has created friction between investors in different tranches. In some cases the rights of various investors are not clear in the contracts underpinning the deals. These legal battles mean even toxic CDOs can continue to exist for many years.Moody’s and S&P declined to comment.
74;MCO;Moody's Corp;2010-04-28T21:42:50Z;Senator targets ‘conflicts of interest’;;Carl Levin, the Democratic senator who presided over this week’s 11-hour interrogation of Goldman Sachs executives, on Wednesday laid out a case for legislation to end “conflicts of interest” on Wall Street.Mr Levin said his committee’s 16-month inquiry into the root causes of the financial crisis has resulted in “deeply troubling findings” that underlined the need for financial services reform.His office said he planned to introduce legislation to address conflicts at credit ratings agencies, end the issuance of negatively amortising mortgage loans and patch holes in regulatory enforcement.Any legislation sponsored by Mr Levin would be added as an amendment to the financial regulation reform bill that is being hashed out in the Senate.“We have got to build a fence against these kinds of excesses,” Mr Levin said.There are other steps he could take in the wake of the permanent subcommittee’s investigation into Goldman. The panel will issue a final report on its findings and has left open the possibility that its investigation could continue. It could also hold further hearings into complex financial products sold on Wall Street.The Senate panel has the authority to refer matters to the US Department of Justice, a right it has used sparingly in its history.For Goldman and other firms in Mr Levin’s line of fire – including Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, the rating agencies – this means pressure from the committee could continue after the hearings end.Referrals are taken seriously by the DoJ because of the panel’s long history of bipartisanship, said Ray Shepherd, a former chief counsel of the committee when it was run by ex-Senator Norm Coleman.The subcommittee – officially known as the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations – was established during the second world war, when it investigated war contracts.The committee’s power was abused by Joseph McCarthy, who chaired it in 1953 and used it to investigate whether government officials were communists.This led to rules that force the panel to act in a bipartisan fashion. Mr Levin has proven to be one of the most effective chairmen of the subcommittee.Investigations into money laundering in the late 1990s led to rules enshrined in the Patriot Act. Mr Levin has investigated Riggs Bank, KPMG, Enron and UBS, each of which faced legal scrutiny by criminal or civil authorities.
75;MCO;Moody's Corp;2010-04-28T19:20:28Z;Time to rein in the rating agencies;Any reform that would loosen their grip on bond markets deserves a shot;Goldman Sachs executives suffered a marathon grilling in front of the Senate investigations subcommittee on Tuesday. But just as important a hearing of the body – arguably more important – occurred last week.The organisations on political trial last Friday were the ratings agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, which played a more central role than any investment bank in the failure of so many investment-grade securities. If all the subprime mortgage securities they rated triple A had not turned to junk, no bail-outs would have been required.The stories that former Moody’s and S&P employees told at that hearing – of the agencies trying to please investment banks that were paying big fees to get high ratings – cast doubt on a central plank of how the fixed-income markets are supposed to work. Why should investors place faith in these over-rated bond market guardians again?Ratings agencies have been criticised in past crises – most recently in the aftermath of Enron’s collapse – for lending their approval to dubious bonds and issuers. Their failings in the housing bubble were much greater. Yet, despite shareholder lawsuits against the agencies and some political heat, there is little sign that their quasi-official status – or their business models – will be substantially changed. The financial reform bill that is still blocked on Capitol Hill has placed other priorities, such as derivatives regulation, above them.That is unfortunate. If the crisis proves anything, it is that the agencies enjoy too much authority among investors and regulators. Any reform that would loosen their grip on bond markets deserves a shot.This was a triple-A crisis. The banks and insurance companies that came close to failure believed so implicitly in the safety of “super-senior” mortgage debt that they were willing to stuff their balance sheets with it. They would never have taken such a punt on high-yield securities or equity tranches of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs).In the case of Goldman, it managed to get the Abacus 2007 deal, over which it is accused of securities fraud, rated as investment grade by the agencies. That sufficiently reassured IKB, the German bank with a long position on the deal, and the bond insurer ACA, that they took on the risk that Abacus’s senior tranches would fail – as they did.The ratings failures went beyond synthetic mortgage CDOs. James Robinson, a non-executive director of the pharmaceuticals company Bristol-Myers Squibb, recounted at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills this week how BMS’s audit committee had questioned its treasury staff about whether they were making any risky investments.“They said everything was in treasuries and nothing more than 90 days [maturity], triple A. What were they in to the tune of $800m? Auction rate notes, triple-A rated by the agencies,” he said. Mr Robinson said that this cost BMS $600m when the auction rate note market collapsed in February 2008.It is not only investors and companies that have placed too much reliance on bond ratings. The ratings agencies were first given official status by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1975 as a means for regulators to assess capital charges for broker-dealers.Since then, their influence has spread into unexpected quarters. American International Group’s financial products unit, which used its triple-A rating to insure CDOs for banks, offered them a regulatory arbitrage based on ratings. The banks that wrapped senior debt tranches with AIG did not have to set aside so much regulatory capital.In all kinds of ways, ratings agencies have extended their grip and lulled investors and institutions into a false sense of security. “Throughout the world, the ratings agencies were instrumental in building up a house of cards. They were behind the scenes everywhere you looked,” says James Barth, a senior fellow at the Milken Institute.What should be done about it? A place to start would be to remove their “regulatory licences” – the status of Nationally Recognised Statistical Rating Organisation – or at least to open the status up more broadly. That might worry regulators who like some official seal of approval, but it would also reduce the halo effect.Frank Partnoy, a law professor at San Diego University, argues that there is an alternative market mechanism for judging risky investments in credit default swap spreads (which have proved better predictors of forthcoming defaults than ratings). Instead of being told to invest in only triple-A securities, investors could buy bonds with low swap spreads. He also argues in favour of removing the protection that ratings agencies enjoy under US securities law from investor lawsuits relating to securities they rate before they are underwritten. At the moment, they are far more protected than banks or accountants.Last, politicians and regulators must take a long, hard look at the conflict of interest in agencies being paid by issuers, and so having an incentive to boost ratings. The subcommittee heard stories of analysts being placed under strong pressure to “maintain market share”.None of these reforms would be easy to implement. Some have been mooted in previous crises without any big changes to the status quo. But this crisis was of a severity beyond others in the past, and triple-A securities were at its heart. It is time to curb the power and influence of the agencies behind them.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/gapper
76;MCO;Moody's Corp;2010-04-24T01:17:53Z;Nixon moment for ratings agencies;Groups accused of ‘acting in favour of banks’;It was September 2007 and Standard & Poor’s, the world’s largest ratings agency, was about to send the global economy into a tailspin with the surprise downgrading of billions of dollars worth of mortgage-backed securities.In an e-mail to a colleague, one S&P analyst ruminated about how, even in the middle of a looming crisis that was largely due to S&P’s own failures, the company was sounding more like the “Nixon White House” than a reliable agency worthy of investors’ trust.“If this company suffers from an Arthur Andersen event, we will not be brought down by a lack of ethics …nor will it be by greed as this plays so little role in our motivations, it will be arrogance,” the analyst wrote.The Enron scandal ultimately felled Arthur Andersen, a fate that does not appear on the horizon for the rating agencies. But an inquiry by the US Senate’s permanent subcommittee on investigations has put the groups’ ethics in a harsh spotlight.The inquiry culminated in a full-day hearing on Friday, showing in minute detail the prominent role that S&P and its arch-rival, Moody’s, had in the financial crisis. The picture that emerged was of two companies engaged in cut-throat competition for market share and revenue, resulting in diminishing quality of credit ratings.The Senate panel’s 500-page dossier depicts agencies acting in the interests of those who paid them – the banks – rather than those who depended on them – the investors. In a hearing on Friday, Richard Michalek, a former senior credit officer at Moody’s who left in 2007, described how the company’s then-president, Brian Clarkson, pushed to make it a more “accommodative” agency to its bank clients.Because Mr Michalek was known for making conservative calls on deals, the executive said he was pulled off certain transactions by his superiors at the behest of banks, including CSFB and Goldman Sachs. “In my discussions with Brian Clarkson, his perspective was, we could produce perfect ratings, but we wouldn’t be on the deals,” said Mr Michalek.Coming just a week after US regulators charged Wall Street’s most prominent investment bank, Goldman Sachs, with defrauding clients as part of an ongoing investigation into the subprime mortgage bond market, Friday’s hearing could not be more politically uncomfortable for the rating firms. In 2007, Moody’s downgraded 8,725 ratings. S&P downgraded 6,300 on a single day, January 30 2008. Over 18 months, the two agencies downgraded more securities than they had done in their 90-year histories, the documents showed. The downgrades, said the Senate panel, wrought havoc on markets and marked the start of the financial crisis.Such a situation came to pass because of inaccurate models, inadequate staffing and competitive pressures that brought the supposedly independent rating agencies into an unhealthy proximity to the banks that paid them, said the committee.As one Moody’s managing director wrote to his superiors in 2007, the company’s errors, made it look “either incompetent at credit analysis, or like we sold our soul to the devil for revenue”.In 2002, Moody’s gross fees from the rating of mortgage-backed bonds were just $61m. S&P’s structured finance group brought in $184m. Over the next five years, both companies saw those revenues more than triple.For such explosive growth, the rating agencies’ chief executives were “compensated handsomely”, according to the committee. The average mid-level rating agency manager could expect to take home $400,000-$500,000 annually plus sizeable stock options. Such revenues and rewards depended on the rating agencies being able to win deals from banks.“They’ve become so beholden to their top issuers for revenue they have developed a kind of Stockholm syndrome which they mistakenly tag as customer value creation,” one S&P colleague wrote to another, referring to the company’s mortgage bond rating team. E-mails also show how employees at the agencies appeared willing to compromise rating methodologies to please the banks.“Jason is looking into some adjustments to his methodology that should be a benefit to your folks,” wrote a Moody’s employee to a Chase banker.The bankers seemed fully aware of the competitive pressures the rating agencies faced – and they knew how to play them. “Heard you guys are revising your residential MBS rating methodology,” a banker at UBS wrote to an S&P employee in May 2006. “Heard your ratings could be 5 notches back of mo[o]dy’s equivalent. Gonna kill your resi biz. May force us to do moodyfitch only cdos!”At the hearing, the agencies denied they were to blame for the crisis. “Potential conflicts exist, regardless of who pays,” Moody’s Mr McDaniel told the Senate committee. The pressure on the agencies is growing, however. While banks and bankers have so far dominated political efforts to regulate finance, the agencies are starting to feel the heat too – not least thanks to the SEC’s ongoing probe into the workings of the structured finance market. But a familiar paradox faces regulators and politicians – just as with the banks, the rating agencies are needed to help rebuild the system they helped bring down.
77;MCO;Moody's Corp;2009-10-23T19:38:22Z;Galleon’s reach;Case causes shock far beyond the financial world;Raj can mean king or princely in Sanskrit and, until last week, Raj Rajaratnam lived up to his name on Wall Street.Sent as a child from his native Sri Lanka to be educated in Britain and America, Mr Rajaratnam was among the most successful of a wave of US immigrants from the Indian subcontinent. At 52, the burly financier ran a hedge fund that had made him a billionaire and was admired for his intelligence and drive, in spite of a large ego.But his reign ended abruptly last Friday when agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation drove up to his apartment on Sutton Place, a street on New York’s affluent Upper East Side, at 6am and led him away in handcuffs. Later, he was charged with running an insider trading ring, the biggest since the arbitrageur Ivan Boesky was jailed in 1988.Mr Rajaratnam, founder and chief executive of the Galleon group of funds, has denied the charges and told his 150 employees he would defend himself “ with the same intensity and focus” that he brought to running his financial empire. But a man declared by Forbes magazine to be one of the richest 400 people in the US is in personal and financial turmoil.He is winding up his US funds and returning $3.7bn (€2.5bn, £2.3bn) to investors – an action that has won praise on Wall Street, since other fund managers facing legal investigation have clung obstinately on to investors’ money – so he can concentrate on defending himself against the extraordinary charges.The fact that Mr Rajaratnam, and not a junior banker or fund manager, has been bailed for $100m is striking enough. Even more shocking is the status of the five other defendants who are accused of being part of his insider trading ring. They include a partner of McKinsey, the blue-chip consulting firm, as well as a high-ranking IBM executive and an executive at Intel.The FBI and officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who are basking in the arrests after their failure to catch Bernard Madoff, the fraudulent financier, tapped the mobile phones of Mr Rajaratnam and others for more than two years. They gained extensive evidence of alleged insider trading involving technology companies including Google and IBM.Although the defendants assert their innocence, the charges have thrown a light on how hundreds of hedge funds in New York and London fight to get an edge over rivals – and gain millions of dollars for investors and themselves – by using private information to trade in shares.Some of this information gathering – for which Mr Rajaratnam and Galleon were renowned – is legal and above board. Indeed, it is the mark of the best analysts that they penetrate the fronts companies put up.But prosecutors allege that Mr Rajaratnam went beyond this, pressing his team of 45 analysts and others to produce tips from employees, consultants and the like – even one ratings analyst at Moody’s was allegedly involved – on how companies were faring financially. He would then trade in the shares to make money, or limit Galleon’s losses, before the companies made public announcements.The scandal threatens further to tarnish the hedge fund industry, which is just starting to recover from the double blows inflicted by last year’s financial crisis and the Madoff affair. Stories of insider trading by hedge funds have circulated for years but these arrests are by far the biggest crackdown on suspected misbehaviour.“We need a better definition of what insider trading means,” says one investor who places money from wealthy families and pension funds into hedge funds. “It is tough legally, because there are a lot of grey areas, and it is tough for the industry because it is one more cloud.”US law says that not only company executives but also management consultants, stock analysts, public relations advisers, ratings analysts, lawyers, bankers and all others in possession of such data have a duty of confidentiality. If people who worked for such organisations were no longer trusted by companies with figures, it would be disastrous for how equity markets function. None of McKinsey’s 400 partners has faced such an accusation before – and when the California-based Anil Kumar was arrested in connection with the case, he fainted with shock.Dominic Barton, McKinsey’s new managing director, has spent this week reassuring the firm’s corporate clients. Meanwhile, Google suspended its dealings with Market Street Partners, an investor relations firm, after an employee of the latter allegedly disclosed information about the group’s results in 2007. The employee no longer works for the company.Mr Rajaratnam is a Tamil who attended school in the UK before studying engineering at the University of Sussex and then finance at Wharton business school in Philadelphia. He joined Needham & Co, a boutique Wall Street investment bank, as a semiconductor analyst, and was eventually appointed its president and chief operating officer.He started a fund for Needham that invested in technology companies and, in 1997, spun off this fund as Galleon and left Needham in order to run it. From early on, Galleon’s style was heavily research-oriented and Mr Rajaratnam pushed his team of analysts to prepare long, detailed reports on companies and to hunt for information about their finances.The culture at Galleon was intense and hard-driving. The fund even had a rap track commissioned – “It’s the good ship Galleon, when Wall Street has a rally on” runs one line. Another passage speaks to its prescience: “When the market flopped, they knew it would dip, that’s why they call it the good ship.”Analysts who failed to generate information to use in trading were squeezed out, say people who worked there. A presentation to investors last year described the team as its “eyes and ears on portfolio companies”.Mr Rajaratnam dominated. He ran the morning meeting of its traders and analysts, and alienated some Galleon portfolio managers by countermanding them. He was known as a relentless networker and, as his firm grew, struck some other hedge fund managers as bombastic and self-satisfied. “Investors can confuse wealth with intelligence,” says one.As he became richer, he took more interest in Sri Lanka, contributing $5m to rebuilding homes after the 2004 tsunami. The Sri Lankan government regarded him with suspicion and accused him of providing cash to the rebel Tamil Tigers through front organisations, which he denied, saying he had merely funded legitimate charities.No one, however, contested his expertise on the technology companies of Silicon Valley, in which he invested for Galleon’s $350m technology fund. In late 2005, according to prosecutors, Roomy Khan, a former Galleon analyst who lives in California, called to ask for a job. He allegedly responded by asking her in what companies she had an “edge”.Prosecutors allege that Ms Khan, who later co-operated with the inquiry and is identified in the SEC complaint only as “Tipper A”, went on to supply inside information about Polycom, Hilton and Google, which Mr Rajaratnam used to make trades. But after suspicious trading was picked up by the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, she let her conversations with him be recorded.That led investigators to other people with whom he allegedly shared inside information, including Danielle Chiesi, a former analyst for a hedge fund called New Castle Partners. Ms Chiesi and Mark Kurland, who ran New Castle, were among those arrested and charged last week. Both deny wrongdoing. The complaint did not allege Ms Chiesi gave anything of value, her attorney has pointed out.She allegedly gleaned information from technology executives including Robert Moffat, a senior IBM official who is a confidant of Sam Palmisano, its chief executive. Mr Moffat, a friend of Ms Chiesi, is accused of giving her inside information about Sun Microsystems and AMD. He and Intel’s Rajiv Goel also deny the charges.Ms Chiesi provided some of the most colourful quotes in the tapped phone conversations that are cited in the court documents filed by the SEC. During one, she is quoted as saying to a “co-conspirator” that “I’m dead if this leaks. I really am and my career is over. I’ll be like Martha [expletive] Stewart.”The case is unusual not only for the seniority of the people involved but for the sheer amount of evidence gathered through tapping phone conversations over two years. The SEC and prosecutors hope this will be enough to obtain convictions and to deter others on Wall Street.But winning such cases, even when the alleged perpetrators are identified, is not easy. Mark Cuban, a billionaire technology entrepreneur, was recently cleared of insider trading despite having sold his stake in a company after being told by its chief executive of a planned share offering. Mr Cuban had argued he had no agreement with the company or fiduciary duty not to sell the stock.“Tracking down insider trading is tricky and then you must prove intent, that someone knew they had illegal inside information and went ahead and traded with it,” says Utpal Bhattacharya, professor of finance at the Kelley School of business at Indiana University.Even by getting this far, the SEC has impressed many people who believed that bringing charges for insider dealing at the highest levels was too hard. After two years of monitoring, the authorities swung into action when they found Mr Rajaratnam planned to leave the country.He had booked tickets to fly to London and then Switzerland rather than home to Sri Lanka, where he feared kidnap or assassination, according to a friend there. “He loved this place but he realised it was becoming too dangerous for him – he was dead scared they were going to kill him.”Mr Rajaratnam is safely out on bail in New York and visited his office this week to reassure his employees and to reiterate his innocence. But whatever happens now, his Wall Street reign is over.Additional reporting by Henny Sender, Sam Jones and Joanna Chung in New York, Brooke Masters in London and James Fontanella-Khan in Colombo
78;MCO;Moody's Corp;2009-04-12T19:24:28Z;Credit quality of global groups at 25-year low;;The credit quality of global companies has deteriorated to levels not seen for more than a quarter of a century, according to Moody’s Investors Service.The ratings agency said the ratio of companies having their credit ratings cut versus the number of companies being upgraded – an indicator of declining credit quality – had reached its highest level since 1983.During the first quarter of 2009, the rate at which borrowers were having their ratings cut reached 13.8 per cent, highlighting the negative credit climate in the first part of the year, analysts at Moody’s said.“This downgrade rate is higher than pre-economic crisis figures,” said Jennifer Tennant, Moody’s analyst. For the whole of 2006, the downgrade rate was 10.2 per cent, and the average rate from 1983-2009 was 12.5 per cent per year.The fall in the ratio of companies’ credit ratings being upgraded was also grim. During the first quarter of 2009 the upgrade rate was just 0.5 per cent, compared with an average upgrade rate between 1983 and 2009 was 7.9 per cent. There were only four upgrades for every 100 downgrades.The ratings agency warned that its watchlist for potential downgrades also reflected the “severe credit and economic environment”.At the end of the first quarter of 2009, 9.7 per cent of rated corporate issuers were on review for downgrade, compared with 1 per cent on review for upgrade. Similarly, a larger percentage of issuers held negative outlooks on their credit ratings than positive ones.If a rating is on review for downgrade it means it may be cut much sooner than if on “negative outlook”.There were both more investment-grade and junk-rated borrowers facing rating cuts than upgrades, although “investment-grade issuers show more stability, while speculative-grade issuers were more likely than investment-grade issuers to experience downgrades and upgrades in the first quarter of 2009”, said Ms Tennant.The US and Canada and Europe, Middle East and Africa were the regions with the largest percentage of borrowers showing greater signs of credit deterioration.On a more positive note, however, the US and Canada region also has the highest percentage of borrowers that may have their ratings upgraded. Finance, securities and leasing, automotive and hotels, gaming and leisure companies made up the majority of those that have had or face potential rating cuts.Moody’s said last week it expected default rates for US junk-rated issuers to jump to 13.5 per cent at the end of 2009, while the European junk default rate was expected to rise to 21.2 per cent.
79;MCO;Moody's Corp;2008-12-16T22:20:26Z;Coface calls for tougher ratings control;;Coface, one of the world’s biggest credit insurers, has called for tougher European regulation of the credit rating market, on the eve of setting up the UK’s newest credit ratings agency.The company said the EU had not taken a tough enough line in legislation currently being drafted to prevent the kinds of problems that arose when agencies gave top ratings to packages of subprime debt.“The main factor in the present financial crisis was the failure of the ratings agencies and the present regulation in Brussels will not prevent a repetition of the subprime crisis,” Jérôme Cazes, Coface’s chief executive, told the Financial Times.Mr Cazes said there should be statistical analysis of how accurate ratings had been, data that could then be used as a quality control for the industry.The company has called for detailed statistics on how many ratings are changed the year after they are made, as a way to analyse the ratings’ long-term validity.“If 70 per cent of your ratings are downgraded just a year after being made, it is a problem,” Mr Cazes said. “The figure should be closer to 20 per cent.”Coface will launch its ratings service on Wednesday, which it says will avoid the potential conflict of interest inherent in other ratings services, which rely on high fees from the company being rated for much of their revenue.It intends to use information garnered through its credit insurance business to create the ratings. They will be paid for either by the company being rated or by any company seeking the information.Coface said it would charge £4,000 ($6,100) for a spot rating on a medium-sized company. It said this would be much lower than a traditional agency, which would charge a percentage of the debt being issued.Coface will hope the new product can help it deal with the worst of the fallout that credit insurers are feeling from the steep increase in companies going bust.Credit insurers provide insurance to suppliers against the risk of their purchaser failing to pay their bills, and at least one big insurer, Euler Hermes, has suffered heavy losses from the collapse of Woolworths, the UK retailer.
80;MCO;Moody's Corp;2008-07-21T17:30:46Z;Reputations to restore;;"When Michel Prada started openly raising concerns about credit rating agencies early last year, he drew parallels with the accounting industry in the early part of the decade. The head of the AMF, the French financial regulator, saw the potential for conflicts of interest akin to those that emerged in the audit profession when it moved into consulting.The demands of winning and retaining clients in the more lucrative consultancy business came to threaten the integrity of audit work. It was a conflict that helped bring down Arthur Andersen following the collapse of Enron, the Texas-based energy trader whose books the accounting firm had audited. “I do hope that it does not take another Enron for everyone to look at the issue of rating agencies,” Mr Prada told the Financial Times in March 2007.The global credit collapse has since prompted regulators around the world to shine an increasingly harsh light on ratings agency practice. A damning report this month from the US Securities and Exchange Commission uncovered “serious shortcomings” in the rating of securities related to subprime mortgages, the products that triggered the crisis. Such findings have cranked up the regulatory pressure on both sides of the Atlantic and the ratings agencies face a very uncertain future.Regulators are also focused on the industry because of the dominance that the three leading operators enjoy. They act as financial market gatekeepers by deciding on the riskiness of various kinds of debt. In addition, the judgments of the big three – Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings – have become “hard-wired” into the global financial system, through the inclusion of their ratings as standards in investment mandates and banking rules, for example.Like auditors, the business of agencies is to give their opinion – and so the credit ratings they award are only as good as the integrity and procedures of the agencies themselves. The credit crisis soon brought protests that they had failed to warn investors early enough about the risks of complex securities.Confidence in the three main agencies – which are paid not by investors but by the sellers of securities, such as big Wall Street banks – has been dented before. In the wake of Enron, the agencies had to defend lawsuits brought by debt investors who claimed the agencies that rated the company’s debt did not do enough to spot Enron’s increasingly dubious financial condition. Using a first-amendment defence under the US constitution, the groups successfully argued that grades handed out on debt were merely an opinion. Thus they could not be blamed if that turned out to be based on false information provided by a client.But recent events have thrown the systems, processes, resources and – most of all – the integrity of the agencies into sharp relief. The SEC’s report into the three main agencies was the result of a 10-month review in which more than 2m e-mails and instant messages, as well as other documents including deal files, were examined. Christopher Cox, the SEC chairman, said: “We’ve uncovered serious shortcomings at these firms, including a lack of disclosure to investors and the public, a lack of policies and procedures to manage the rating process and insufficient attention to conflicts of interest.”Although the SEC, which gained authority over the ratings business only last September, did not link specific agencies to any of the findings, it gave examples of behaviour found at one or more of them. “At one firm, internal communications appear to expose analytical staff to [a] conflict of interest by indicating concern or interest in market share when employees were discussing whether to make certain changes in ratings methodology,” the report said. While each agency had policies and procedures restricting analysts from participating in fee discussions with issuers, it added, these policies still allowed key participants in the ratings process to participate in discussions about fees.“When the firms didn’t have enough staff to do the job right, they often cut corners,” said Mr Cox. The review also found weaknesses in documentation and internal audit processes.Also, in a worrying echo of the practices of some dotcom-era investment bankers and analysts, agency employees also cast doubt on the quality of some ratings given to products such as collaterised debt obligations (CDOs). One credit rating analyst said in an e-mail that she believed her employer’s model did not capture even half of the risk inherent in a deal – but that it “could be structured by cows and we would rate it”. Another e-mail from one analytical manager to a senior manager said the ratings agencies “continue to create an even bigger monster – the CDO market. Let’s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.”The SEC report came just days after Moody’s announced disciplinary proceedings against some of its staff and admitted it had incorrectly rated about $1bn (£501m, €631m) in complex debt securities due to a computer error, as revealed in an investigation by the FT (see below). The SEC’s own inquiry into the issue continues. Meanwhile, S&P recently told regulators it had found an error in the computer models underpinning the credit ratings of complex debt products but that the glitch did not affect the ratings given to the debt.At least in part, the revelations reflect growing stresses at the ratings agencies as the market for complex debt securities boomed. The rapid increase in workload stemming from the increased number and complexity of subprime-related securities put burdens on employees quickly to analyse ever more sophisticated products. As a result, analysts sometimes deviated from their own models and procedures, the SEC found.Indeed, at the heart of these problems has been the explosion in complex debt products this decade, which in turn fuelled a massive expansion in risky mortgage lending by appearing to chop and disperse that risk among investors around the world. S&P, Moody’s and Fitch have been crucial to the credit bubble by giving their stamps of approval to the alchemy of securitisation, the financial technology used to turn difficult-to-sell individual loans or bonds into tradeable securities.That repackaging allowed top-class triple-A ratings to be awarded to bonds made up of risky mortgages, or even of risky slices of other bonds backed by those mortgages. Without the agencies’ ratings, many investors would never have bought these bonds in the first place. But all the big three argue that their ratings are meant only as a starting point for due diligence by professional investors. They maintain – as they did after the failure of Enron – that they cannot help that their original opinion turned out to be wrong or based on false information from clients. All they can do is monitor the performance of rated debt and keep investors updated when that performance makes downgrades necessary.In the case of the mistaken ratings for the products involved in the recent Financial Times investigation, Moody’s stressed that there was no evidence that its staff had deliberately manipulated the overall ratings methodology to conceal the bug. But it conceded that “some committee members considered factors inappropriate to the rating process” when looking at the products. Raymond McDaniel, chairman and chief executive, said: “The integrity of our rating process is core to Moody’s values and is essential to the market.”According to one investor in Moody’s shares, this integrity is vital. “I think people understand that making mistakes is one thing and that Moody’s can’t be sued for a wrong rating,” the investor says. “But if someone can prove either malfeasance or reckless disregard, that is a different story.”Deliberate wrongdoing, malfeasance or reckless disregard is far from proved for any of the agencies. In addition, after co-operating with the SEC examination, each of the agencies has agreed to take “remedial actions”, according to Mr Cox.But a wider rethink is also under way. Groups such as the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision and regulators including the New York Federal Reserve are also looking hard at whether they can reduce their own dependence on ratings. The SEC, for instance, wants to strip references to ratings in rules so that money market funds and other investors can make greater use of their own discretion.Yet reducing the degree of “hard-wiring” in the system would be difficult to achieve quickly. Thus one big regulatory focus is on changes to restore confidence in the agencies. In both the US and Europe, conflicts of interest, a muddier but more palatable idea for all involved than outright dishonesty, are being aired as a central concern, as is the ability of the industry to regulate and monitor itself.In the US, concerns about conflicts of interest and oversight that were levelled at auditors in the wake of Enron’s collapse led to the forced separation of audit from other services including consulting and tax work. It also brought the creation of an independent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, designed to supervise a self-regulatory system for auditors.Ratings agencies insist there is no parallel and that, for instance, they do not perform consulting work of any kind when it comes to rating new products. But the SEC has proposed new rules to govern the industry, such as prohibiting an analyst who has helped structure a product from giving it a rating, or banning analysts who give ratings from participating in fee discussions. “These examinations clearly indicate that more needs to be done at credit ratings agencies to ensure that investors can have confidence in this system of ratings,” said Mr Cox.In the European Union, where the agencies are not yet subject to oversight, Charlie McCreevy, financial and markets commissioner, has called for a system that would force policymakers to scrutinise the agencies’ business models and practices. Last week, the 27 finance ministers from EU member states endorsed that view. Mr McCreevy says the recently beefed-up code of conduct for agencies from the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, a grouping of regulators, is “toothless”, in part because it is voluntary. Christine Lagarde, finance minister of France, which currently holds the EU presidency, says: “We reached agreement on the principle of registration of ratings agencies and, second, on the need to monitor ratings agencies.”Yet while European agreement on a principle may be simple, establishing how any direct monitoring or oversight will work is far more difficult. For a start, regulators do not have the staff to check all the models that ratings agencies use.For the agencies, one of the biggest problems is the prospect of dealing with regulatory demands on at least two fronts. “It’s important that any new external oversight of rating agencies follows a globally co-ordinated approach in order to ensure consistency for investors and issuers operating in international markets,” says S&P. While this regulatory uncertainty prevails, the collapse of structured product business in the financial markets has already cut a big chunk from the agencies’ revenues and profits. (The main three each report financial results differently but Moody’s, the only one with its own stock market listing, drew 40 per cent of its total revenues from the structured product ratings business in 2006.) They have already been cutting staff to adjust.Unfortunately for the agencies, the big questions over their integrity come just when their business has weakened. Their ability at such a time to fight the forces of political whim and regulatory zeal on two continents is among the biggest tests the industry has faced.How Moody’s blues began with a bugAs structured finance boomed, the inner workings of the credit rating agencies, much like those of the complex products they appraised, went unquestioned, write Sam Jones and Gillian Tett.Ratings agencies are some of the most powerful forces in the market. A rating can make or break a deal; a downgrade can sink a bank or even bankrupt a country. Now, in the wake of an unprecedented number of downgrades and the collapse of many structured financial products, ratings agencies are coming under intense scrutiny. Questions are being asked not just about the ratings they issue but also about the management systems and computer models used to assign these ratings.Take the case of Moody’s Investors Service. Until recently, the agency’s constant proportion debt obligation rating committee was unknown to most who work in finance, not least because CPDOs were some of the most complex products to emerge from the credit boom.However, last month the agency admitted for the first time that the way this committee had rated a batch of CPDO products in 2006 was flawed. The committee originally issued coveted triple-A ratings to the CPDOs – leading some to label such instruments the holy grail of structured finance, since they also promised high returns.As a Financial Times investigation this year showed, however, a computer bug in Moody’s mathematical codes had distorted the CPDO ratings by about four notches. The CPDO rating committee discovered the error in early 2007 and fixed the bug but, as a result of other changes made to the model, the products kept their triple-A ratings until early 2008.Moody’s said following an internal investigation that, while there had been breaches of internal guidelines, there had been no attempt to cover up the error. The saga nevertheless illustrates a much bigger issue, which cuts to the heart of the problems worrying financial regulators: the degree to which ratings agencies are equipped to double-check the highly complex – and, for investors, highly significant – decisions they have had to make in recent years.In the case of CPDOs, for example, the bug occurred at a time when the agencies were all badly stretched. Last year Paul Mazataud, a senior managing director at Moody’s, told a conference of bankers that the agency was “working night and day to rate CPDOs”. Client banks say there was a backlog of issues waiting to be rated.The Moody’s CPDO committee was chaired by the same executives, Gareth Levington and Anne Le Henaff, who were in charge of rating CDOs – a much larger product class at the heart of the current mortgage bond crisis. Membership of the CPDO committee itself was spread around the world and ratings were discussed briefly and at short notice.Moody’s now says disciplinary procedures have been initiated against staff on the CPDO committee, although it has not identified which committee members and would not comment on the identities of people involved in the ratings process. The action comes after Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm hired by the agency to investigate the CPDO rating process, delivered its findings to Moody’s executives last month. Noel Kirnon, the agency’s global head of structured finance, left in the wake of the report – though Mr Kirnon was never involved in the rating of CPDOs.The bigger question that dogs the industry is how to ensure that resources keep pace with banking innovation – as the current US regulations require.One of the only comforts to regulators now – of a sort – is that the collapse of the structured finance market does at least mean ratings agencies are no longer overwhelmed by deals. Indeed, many are quietly redeploying specialist staff from asset-backed structured finance to healthier market areas."
81;MCO;Moody's Corp;2008-03-13T00:53:04Z;Ambac keeps Moody’s and S&P top grade;;Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s on Wednesday affirmed the top-notch credit ratings of troubled bond insurer Ambac, ending weeks of uncertainty around the outcome of their long-awaited reviews.Both credit rating agencies had previously threatened to strip Ambac of its crucial triple-A rating because of concerns about the strength of its capital base.“Ambac’s recently completed $1.5bn capital raise was a critical factor leading to the confirmation of the Aaa insurance financial strength ratings at the company,” Moody’s said.Analysts at Standard & Poor’s echoed this sentiment, saying the fund-raising and the company’s decision to stop insuring risky structured products “provides the company with capital in excess of the minimum necessary to support its ‘AAA’ rating.”Fitch Ratings also on Wednesday affirmed its “AA” ratings on the bond insurer. Fitch cut Ambac from “AAA” in January.Ambac’s claims-paying resources are $4bn-$5bn Fitch’s target for an “AAA” rated company, the bond insurer is unlikely to regain its top rating until it can re-establish momentum in the bond insurance market, Fitch said.The news was less favourable for smaller bond insurer CIFG, which S&P downgraded by four notches to A+ from triple-A.The downgrade reflected CIFG’s “scaled-back underwriting activity, turnover of senior staff, and recent other rating downgrades,’’ S&P said.S&P’s move follows similar downgrades by both Moody’s and Fitch.CIFG said it was working with all the rating agencies to address their concerns.“It is difficult to work within a process in which the agencies continue to modify their methodologies and capital requirements,’’ chief executive officer John Pizzarelli said. “We are committed to maintaining CIFG as an ongoing concern and are exploring all of our options that protect our policyholders, enhance shareholder value and build CIFG’s franchise.’’
82;MCO;Moody's Corp;2008-03-10T21:16:05Z;Agencies’ differences add to confusion;;As bond insurance companies battle to keep their key triple-A ratings, disparity between the assessment methods of the big three rating agencies has become a sticking point.The problem prompted MBIA to ask Fitch to stop rating its insurance business. It also contributed to uncertainty for Ambac during rescue talks. And last week, CIFG lost its triple-A rating from both Moody’s and Fitch, just days after its top-notch credit status was affirmed by Standard & Poor’s. CIFG chief executive John Pizzarelli said: “Because each of the rating agencies is using a different methodology, it is very difficult for financial guaranty companies, like CIFG, to satisfy the divergent rating agency requirements.”The subprime mortgage crisis has forced Fitch, S&P and Moody’s to revise loss estimates for mortgage bonds which the insurers have guaranteed and to re-evaluate insurers’ risk profiles. Losses on complex subprime mortgage securitisations have far exceeded rating agencies’ initial estimates. However, the agencies’ reviews have produced markedly different outcomes, meaning that the bond insurers have to steer a careful path to keep triple-A ratings from all three.A five-year plan at MBIA to split its municipal bond and structured finance business lines into two separate insurance businesses is a case in point. MBIA said if it followed Fitch’s capital model then the bond insurer’s municipal business would hold approximately half the capital required by Moody’s and S&P. However, Fitch would want the structured finance business to hold up to three times the capital demanded by Moody’s and S&P.MBIA cited this disparity as a key reason for asking Fitch to stop rating its insurance business. The insurer’s triple-A rating from Fitch is on watch for downgrade. The agency said it was assessing whether it can rate MBIA without the insurer’s co-operation. Uncertainty over rating reviews has contributed to volatility for the bond insurers’ stock and bond prices but it has also affected the broader market.In its letter to Fitch requesting the removal of its rating, MBIA said: “In the 24/7 information-driven markets of today, the mere rumour of a potential change in ratings methodology or a rating committee meeting can drive the equity market, the CDS [credit default swap] markets, and cause wild speculative pricing in the extremely low frequency-of-loss US public finance market.”
83;MCO;Moody's Corp;2007-05-16T18:44:54Z;Failing grades?;;For decades, three large credit rating agencies have together sat in judgment over the financial soundness of governments, multilateral organisations and, crucially, companies that borrow in the international capital markets to fund their activities.The pronouncements of these high priests of finance, along with a few smaller rivals, affect the cost of funds for issuers of debt, and are often enshrined in the regulations that govern what securities can be bought by insurance companies, pension plans and mutual funds. Ratings can single-handedly create or render obsolete particular kinds of securities. A downgrade can even tip countries towards recession or companies towards bankruptcy.But are the big three – Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings – up to the job, particularly in the huge, fast-growing and complex market for “structured finance”?In this world, mortgages, car loans, corporate bonds and many other types of debt are packaged and repackaged by investment banks and sold on to all sorts of investors, from pension funds and insurance groups to hedge funds and bank trading desks. The key to a successful deal is securing the right credit rating.How these ratings are decided upon is the subject of growing anxiety, with concerns hinging on the relationships between the agencies and big investment banks on Wall Street and in the City of London. Some worry about the potential for conflicts of interest, given that investment banks rather than investors pay for ratings. Others simply think the agencies can be confused by the complexity of the deals they are asked to rate, and are not equipped to keep up with the creativity and resources of the banking world.“The credit rating agencies have got a little more sophisticated but they are way behind the investment banks,” says Frank Partnoy, a professor at the University of San Diego’s School of Law and a former Wall Street banker.Moreover, with structured finance deals now created using derivative instruments as well as bonds and loans, some investors who cannot keep up with the complexity are relying on the rating agencies’ opinions more heavily than ever before.“Insurance companies are much more dependent on ratings, as are people like us,” says Sabur Moini, head of credit strategy at fund manager Payden & Rygel. “The non-traditional buyers [such as hedge funds] are a lot less ratings-reliant.”Confidence in the ratings agencies to get it right has been shaken recently by a number of missteps and controversies. Moody’s and S&P, for example, have had to downgrade dozens of newly-issued securities backed by US subprime home loans as late mortgage payments and defaults by borrowers have spiked more severely than the agencies initially expected – suggesting the assumptions underlying the ratings might have been flawed.Meanwhile, in an unusually public spat, Fitch and another smaller agency have questioned Moody’s and S&P’s rating methodologies for the first of a new breed of highly structured and potentially volatile derivative products called constant proportion debt obligations (see right).Moody’s was also forced into an embarrassing U-turn in March when a new method of rating banks – taking into account the likelihood of government bail-outs – met with ridicule from analysts and investors.In the rarefied air of structured finance, coming up with a rating is fraught with challenges. A typical mortgage-backed securities deal, for example, involves repackaging thousands of mortgages – worth hundreds of millions of dollars altogether – with each borrower having a different credit history.An investment bank undertaking such a deal issues batches of new securities backed by this portfolio. Investors who buy the riskiest of these are the first to suffer from losses if any of the borrowers default. These bonds may get no rating at all. Investors who buy the least risky securities do not lose anything until all the other investors are wiped out, meaning that these securities, often three-quarters or more of the total deal, usually carry triple-A ratings.Rating such instruments requires complex analysis and sophisticated computer modelling, making the task a daunting one. As a result, many investors say, ratings in structured finance are hard to corroborate independently. Some also complain that it is hard for them to reach the agencies’ inner sanctum and speak directly to analysts.Yet with almost $9,000bn (£4,500bn, €6,600bn) of structured securities outstanding in the US alone – more than double the size of the US government bond market – the agencies now make the bulk of their profits from rating such products.Moody’s, for example, made 44 per cent of its revenue last year from structured finance deals. Such assessments also command more than double the fee rates of simpler corporate ratings, helping keep Moody’s operating margins above 50 per cent.The potential for conflicts of interest in the agencies’ “issuer pays” model has drawn fire before, but the scale of their dependence on investment banks for structured finance business gives them a significant incentive to look kindly on the products they are rating, critics say.One regulator taking the fight to the rating agencies is Michel Prada. From his office in Paris, the head of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the main French financial regulator, is raising fresh questions over their role and objectivity.Mr Prada sees the possibility for conflicts of interest similar to those that emerged in the audit profession when it drifted into consulting. Here, the integrity of the auditing work was threatened by the demands of winning and retaining clients in the more lucrative consultancy business, a conflict that ultimately helped bring down accountants Arthur Andersen in the wake of Enron’s collapse. “I do hope that it does not take another Enron for everyone to look at the issue of rating agencies,” he says.Mr Prada is not the only official with at least private misgivings about structured finance ratings. The Bank for International Settlements, the Basel-based “bank for central banks”, has also studied structured products and is understood to be alarmed by the speed with which they have sometimes been downgraded in the past.Larry White, an economics professor at New York University’s Stern business school, also cites the example of Arthur Andersen. In general, he says, the rating agencies’ standard contention that its reputation for objectivity is too important to be jeopardised by conflicts of interest is a reasonable one.“But that’s what Arthur Andersen told us as well,” he says. “You have to keep those words ‘Arthur Andersen’ in your mind.” Prof White thinks that on balance, however, the big agencies have “a pretty good track record”.The rating agencies themselves emphasise that preserving the credibility of their ratings is crucial to their success. In structured finance, as elsewhere, they say they manage their businesses carefully to avoid conflicts and to maintain objectivity.Gloria Aviotti, head of global structured finance at Fitch Ratings, points to evidence that structured finance ratings are statistically comparable with, and at least as stable as, corporate ratings.She also says rating methods for structured products – a class that includes mortgage-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations, or CDOs – are among the agency’s most clearly and publicly defined. That transparency, she argues, helps avoid conflicts because it gives investors the opportunity to see that Fitch treats all similar structures in the same way.Noel Kirnon, a senior managing director at Moody’s, adds that “investors have the ability to challenge our work constantly”. He says there are plenty of tools available to help investors evaluate independently the securities they are offered.Beyond the scope for conflicts of interest, however, there are also concerns that the rating agencies are simply out of their depth. With new deals piling up daily, people such as Mr Moini at Payden & Rygel need to be confident that the agencies can cope. But he worries that they struggle to retain experienced staff.Richard Stein, head of the capital markets practice at recruitment firm Korn Ferry, says that structured finance rating experts are very valuable to investment banks. “It’s not unusual for banks to offer analysts compensation packages that are three or four times what they’re earning at the rating agency,” he says.Prof Partnoy concurs: “Wall Street rarely finds someone smart at credit rating agencies, but when they do they hire them.” He says that this brain drain makes it difficult for agencies to keep up with changes in the market.Partly because of such challenges, Mr Prada at the AMF worries that structured finance ratings might be more vulnerable to rapid downgrades than ratings for more traditional debt such as corporate or government bonds, something that could lead to a dramatic fall in the value of an investor’s assets.Rating agencies dispute the concern, claiming that the ratings in structured finance are no more volatile than those in simple bonds, based on an analysis of historical data.But Dan Fuss, vice-chairman and bond fund manager at Loomis Sayles, shares some of Mr Prada’s fears. In structured finance, he says, investors are more exposed to low probability but dramatic events that “knock the liquidity out from under a market”.In other words, he thinks structured instruments are potentially more vulnerable than traditional corporate debt to a rush of selling by investors in the event of a downgrade. “[The prices of the two types of instrument] would behave in different ways, even with the same rating,” he says.The agencies highlight that their ratings explicitly do not address market pricing or trading liquidity for the security in question, but rather focus on the likelihood of default. However, some investors may not appreciate that distinction and could be surprised by volatile prices. Mr Fuss also notes that many newer structured instruments have not been through a serious, broad-based market downturn, making their behaviour hard to predict.The benign borrowing conditions of recent years have been punctuated by a series of events that has rattled, but not derailed, markets. In spite of the ongoing turmoil in markets with exposure to US subprime mortgages, those smooth conditions appear to be continuing for now.Yet most investors and analysts believe a change in credit conditions is coming and could be severe. Rating agencies are already under fire in the subprime mortgage world, although the final extent of defaults and downgrades is not yet known.When the tide does turn and a broader range of companies and structured deals are downgraded, the agencies are likely to feel more heat for their apparent lack of prescience. “I think our ratings are going to look good, but we are still going to be criticised,” says Ray McDaniel, chief executive of Moody’s.Officials at some of the big agencies are already looking for ways to head off any regulatory action – particularly in Europe where, as one such official puts it, “bureaucrats have a long history of meddling if things go wrong”.It is far from clear whether US or European officials have the appetite to ramp up their monitoring of the agencies beyond the current light supervision, which is in the process of being revamped in the US. They have previously backed away from such moves.Whether regulators do act may depend on the severity of what happens next in the structured finance market. Many observers share the outlook of Sylvain Raynes, a former Moody’s analyst who is now a partner at advisory firm R&R Consulting.“Some big thing – negative – is going to happen. They will all blame someone. The names they will see will be Fitch, Moody’s and S&P.”How S&P put the triple A into CPDOLast summer a team of financial whizzkids at ABN Amro, the investment bank, developed a new debt product that has since taken the markets by storm. Using complex mathematics, the designers had wanted to create an instrument that would pay the same high interest rate as a “junk” bond but be as free from risk as a bank deposit, writes Paul J. Davies.The new credit product was not a bond, nor a stock, nor anything anyone had seen before. A fantastically complex instrument that used a mathematical strategy to make a highly leveraged bet on a pool of credit derivatives, it was given the ungainly title of a constant proportion debt obligation, or CPDO.It pays an interest rate two percentage points above returns on government bonds, similar to a risky junk bond, but it is supposed to be virtually risk-free, possessing a triple-A rating against default.The only controversy is exactly how it got such a rating. Before releasing it, ABN Amro held months of discussions with Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, about how the new instrument might work and what rating it could earn.ABN Amro wanted a triple-A, the highest there is, which it saw as critical for the marketing of the CPDOs. Securing such a rating meant the investment bank could sell the instruments to a wide pool of investors, including pension funds and others that are often barred from holding assets with lower credit ratings.S&P eventually reached the conclusion that the chance of default on a CPDO was very low indeed. The decision shone a light on the close interaction between the agencies and investment banks, which is now triggering questions from regulators and investors.The agency was also paid handsomely for its work. Although the precise figure is confidential, rating ABN Amro’s CPDO deal, worth €1.35bn ($1.8bn, £900m), could have paid anywhere from €500,000 to €1.62m or even higher, according to typical pricing models.Moody’s, the rival agency, later also awarded top ratings to similar deals. But some observers were surprised by the high ratings and thought the agencies had been duped. “Credit rating agencies are not well qualified to assess the market risk combined with leverage presented by these products,” says Janet Tavakoli, an independent consultant on structured finance.Fitch Ratings and DBRS, two rival agencies, said last month that such first-generation CPDO deals deserved a single-A rating at best. After taking a step back to reassess their models, both Moody’s and S&P have pronounced themselves comfortable with the triple-As and have not downgraded any deals – though some bankers whisper that similar instruments would never get the same ratings now.“These are new and extremely complex products, therefore it is no surprise that regulators feel concerned,” says Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at S&P. “But the market has always known that the business model of rating agencies is to be paid by the issuers. In that way structured finance is no different from corporate bonds.”He adds: “Banks come to us with a proposed transaction and we explain how it might be rated under our criteria. In many cases, the transaction is then restructured by the bank in order to meet our criteria. There’s nothing sinister about this process – we don’t advise on how deals should be structured or arbitrate on which deals can proceed or not.”
