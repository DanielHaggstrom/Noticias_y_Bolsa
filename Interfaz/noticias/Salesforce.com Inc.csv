Marc Benioff, the company’s chief executive, had personally asked her to lead the software business as a service provider in the UK.She will leave after a broader reshuffle of the company’s management announced in February that promoted former BT chief executive Gavin Patterson to president and chief executive of Salesforce International, based in London. He had also joined only months before as Emea chairman of the group before his promotion.Ms Gadhia is one of the best-known bankers in the City of London and advises the government on gender and other diversity issues. She helped set up Virgin Direct in 1995, moving to RBS when it acquired the financial services group four years later. She returned to Virgin in 2007 and then helped oversee the acquisition of parts of bailed-out lender Northern Rock from the government in 2012.Ms Gadhia left Virgin Money after its £1.7bn takeover by CYBG in 2018 and has since helped launch a financial services start-up, Snoop.Salesforce said Ms Gadhia would return to her “role as a strategic adviser at Salesforce to give her time to focus on her new business Snoop”. Salesforce Ventures Europe is a lead investor in Snoop, which gives personalised financial advice and recommendations for consumers in the UK.“I would like to thank Jayne-Anne for her vision and passion in leading Salesforce UK and Ireland,” said Mr Benioff. “We look forward to continuing tor work with her in her role as a strategic adviser to Salesforce and wish Snoop enormous success.”Ms Gadhia said: “Snoop launched last month and has exceeded our highest expectations in all respects. As a result I am delighted to be able to focus my efforts on making Snoop an enormous success and on making all of our customers better off.”Paul Smith, executive vice-president and general manager for Salesforce in the UK and Ireland, will assume responsibilities for operations in the region reporting to Mr Patterson.

Being side-by-side with Marc has been amazing and I’m forever grateful for our friendship and proud of the trajectory the company is on,” Mr Block said in a statement published on Salesforce’s investor relations website.“It’s been my greatest honour to lead the team with Marc that has more than quadrupled Salesforce from $4bn of revenue when I joined in 2013 to over $17bn last year,” he added.In a statement that appeared aimed at dispelling the suggestion of any disagreement between Mr Block and Mr Benioff, the remaining chief executive said he was “grateful to Keith for his service to Salesforce over the last seven years”, adding “Keith’s strategic thinking and operational excellence have deeply strengthened our company, and our close friendship endures”.Separately, on Tuesday the company announced better than expected adjusted quarterly earnings and the acquisition of Vlocity for about $1.33bn.Salesforce shares fell 2.6 per cent in after-hours trade.Salesforce named Gavin Patterson, who joined the software maker last year after being sacked by BT Group in mid-2018, as president and chief executive of Salesforce International.
2;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-12-06T05:01:16Z;Book review: Trailblazer by Marc Benioff;Salesforce chief paints himself as progressive but reveals little about his motives;"The search for spiritual enlightenment is hardly an unfamiliar concept for Silicon Valley pioneers. But few have taken the idea as far as Marc Benioff.He abandoned a successful career at software giant Oracle to go on a soul-searching journey to India in 1996, which later inspired him to establish Salesforce as a company to channel his values.Since then, he has gone further than most peers in putting some of these values into practice as an “activist CEO”: speaking out against discriminatory state legislation threatening LGBT rights; lobbying for a “big tech” tax in San Francisco to tackle homelessness; and buying the Time media company to support “a free and open press”.At Salesforce, he has pushed for equal pay for minority and female staff, and pioneered a “1-1-1” model to donate 1 per cent of the company’s products, equity and staff time to philanthropic causes.He has installed mindfulness rooms on every floor, provided baristas producing gourmet coffee, offered paid time off for staff volunteering, and appointed a chief ethical and humane use officer.All of that is easier against a backdrop of growth, of course. As he describes it in Trailblazer, Salesforce was a pioneer in customer relationship management, offering even small organisations access to transformative technology, using cloud-based servers and software, liberating them from endless costly upgrades.Benioff describes how he “flipped his organisation upside down and inside out”: allowing the development of software applications by non-employees; empowering external “Trailblazer” advocates inside his customers’ organisations; and creating Dreamforce, the sprawling festival-like extravaganza he hosts for staff and customers in San Francisco every year.He explains potentially risky communication practices, including livestreaming executive off-site meetings to all staff; launching Chatter, an internal social network that became a vehicle for staff grievances; and sharing problems with customers.It is easy to mock exotic initiatives: calling the corporate culture “Ohana” (the Hawaiian concept of shared family values) seems facile. Starting management meetings with silent mindfulness is perhaps easier for the boss than more junior employees. Staff might have welcomed longer paid holidays more than paid volunteering leave.The book lacks detail on the wisdom dispensed by his spiritual counsellorsMore importantly, there is little discussion in the book about whether the values he embraces have driven Salesforce’s success or have been an indulgence its profits have permitted. There is, for example, scant data on recruitment or retention, figures that could provide significant evidence of the effectiveness of his approach. Nor is there much introspection. He claims in a few throwaway lines that his father’s honesty and his grandfather’s $20 handouts to homeless people were fundamental inspirations. There is little detail on the wisdom dispensed by his Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese spiritual counsellors, or how he interprets their advice.To his credit, Benioff acknowledges the contributions of fellow executives and concedes personal errors. He describes, for example, his initial determination to buy Twitter despite others’ advice, and Salesforce’s periodic inertia in responding to clients’ changing needs.However, the former registered Republican-turned-independent scarcely dwells on the development of his views of progressive social causes. They are presented briefly as faits accomplis without description of any internal turmoil or external resistance.He describes his decision in 2018 to step back from daily corporate operations but does not explore the background to the highly contested decision to share his chief executive position with a colleague.This book highlights some of Benioff’s more impressive progressive actions but only scratches the surface of the motives behind the values he practises.Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change, by Marc Benioff, Simon & Schuster, RRP£20"
3;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-09-05T18:54:54Z;CYBG pays the price for not knowing its share of £50bn PPI bill;Uncertainty over how many claims may be upheld sent shares down 20%;Payouts to bank customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance have been a feature of the UK economy since 2011, when the first major claims were made. So how is it that CYBG, owner of the Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Virgin Money brands, still cannot accurately model the cost?Its latest estimate of an additional £300m-£450m charge, based on somewhere between 5 and 12 per cent of claims being upheld, contrasts with the apparent precision of economic analyses. In 2013, when PPI payouts had reached £18bn, against today’s almost £50bn, the BBC confidently calculated the stimulus as “1 per cent of GDP”. One year and another £4bn later, research by VoucherCodesPro showed 88 per cent of recipients had recycled the money into holidays, cars and household goods, with only 12 per cent adding to their savings. CYBG’s uncertainty over how much its customers will receive, let alone what they might do with it, sent its shares down 20 per cent on Thursday.CYBG also admitted it will be costly finding out. An eightfold increase in customer information requests in August, to 340,000, ahead of the claims deadline, will lift processing costs by £100m, which suggests £300 per request. An extra 42,000 complaints will add another £100m, which is £2,300 per complaint. But as CYBG noted, “the key sensitivity in relation to information requests is the conversion rate into an upheld complaint and it is not yet possible to accurately determine . . . this variable until the group has processed more of the outstanding requests.” So it could be 5 per cent or 12 per cent, and it won’t know until it knows. That leaves CYBG’s shareholders not knowing what its full-year loss will be, and having to assume analysts are right to say that its core tier one capital ratio will now fall below a target of 13 per cent, and its forecast dividend will fall from 6p a share to 3p, or zero.How could they all have missed a PPI charge equivalent to a fifth of the bank’s market value? Two reasons suggest themselves.First, CYBG’s smaller scale exacerbates a modelling error made by all UK banks. Royal Bank of Scotland was barely more precise in estimating a further £600m-£900m PPI charge, but its vagueness is more easily absorbed into a larger cost base. As JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said: “CYBG is more impacted due to lower scale and hence higher cost of processing claims”.Second, CYBG’s lesser experience makes it more cautious. Lloyds — the most claimed-against bank — has found that the later the PPI enquiry, the less valid it tends to be: its conversion rate has fallen from 13 to 10 per cent. As Citigroup analysts suggested: “It may be the case that this late surge in information requests is primarily a ‘fishing expedition’ prior to the final deadline . . . so uphold rates could potentially be far lower.” CYBG shares — now 20 per cent cheaper and trading on an earnings multiple 10 per cent below rivals’ — might yet prove an equally speculative punt. Gavin Patterson, former leading man at British Telecom, has switched channels for a starring role at Salesforce, writes Kate Burgess. The one-time investor heart-throb will chair the US software group’s European business, spending his time on strategy and regulation. He knows something about regulators. The friction between the Poldarkian Mr Patterson and Sharon White, leading lady at Ofcom, kept viewers agog for most of his five years at BT. Salesforce appears to be a broad church. It recently hired Jayne-Anne Gadhia, former boss of Virgin Money. No doubt, the other top bosses who have been canned this year will be beating a path to the US group’s door. There is John Flint of HSBC, Véronique Laury of Kingfisher, and, as of Thursday, Philip Bowcock of William Hill. But the competition is hotting up. CEO turnover is rising and average tenure is sliding. AJ Bell analysts reckon bosses at 16 of the UK’s top 100 groups left their posts in 2018, against a long-term run rate of 12. And turnover is set to be higher this year. That said, few can pull off the open-necked sales look of the telegenic Mr Patterson. His ex-boss once opined “one button undone was fine, two was a bit racy and three was Gavin”.In the UK retail sector, an unscheduled trading update usually means much wailing and gnashing of teeth — unless it already begins “Boohoo . . .”. Because the online fashion group of that name is almost the only retailer still able to report double-digit sales growth and margins. It says sales will rise by 33-38 per cent and the margin will be held at 10 per cent, as operational gearing can fund investment. But investors will need to keep a dry eye on how much investment is needed to keep its existing brands growing at that pace and get its Karen Millen acquisition up to speed. Higher marketing and technology costs could bring margin pressure, if not tears before bedtime.matthew.vincent@ft.comCEOs: kate.burgess@ft.com
4;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-09-05T09:36:39Z;Salesforce hires ex-BT boss Patterson to lead European business;Decision follows appointment of Jayne-Anne Gadhia to run UK unit;Salesforce.com has hired Gavin Patterson, the former BT chief executive, to helm its European business.Mr Patterson, who was sacked as BT chief in June 2018 after shareholders lost faith in his leadership, was appointed as chairman of Salesforce in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.BT was among Salesforce’s largest customers in the region as Mr Patterson sought to improve the telecoms group’s customer service. He will spend several days each week at Salesforce, bolstering its strategic oversight and advising on regulatory issues.He follows another well-known British executive, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, to the San Francisco-based business software group. Dame Gadhia, the former chief of Virgin Money, stepped away from a potential position at the Bank of England last month to lead Salesforce’s UK business.Salesforce has pledged to invest almost $6bn into its UK and French businesses over the coming years. Europe is its fastest-growing region, with revenues up 30 per cent in the second quarter ending in June. The company reported better-than-expected sales in August and raised its guidance for the rest of the year.“Gavin is a highly respected leader and innovator, and we’re thrilled to welcome him to Salesforce as our Emea Chairman,” Salesforce’s co-chief executives, Marc Benioff and Keith Block, said in a joint statement. “His extensive experience in digital communications, customer engagement and systems delivery makes him a powerful addition to our Emea team as we head into the next phase of growth and customer success in the region.”A pioneer of cloud-based software, Salesforce’s stock rose by a third in 2018 but its shares have wavered throughout 2019 as some investors fret about its spending. In June, it unveiled a $15.7bn bid for Tableau Software, after it paid $6.5bn for Mulesoft last year.Mr Patterson, 51, led BT for five years, overseeing a tumultuous period that saw the group move more aggressively into TV sports rights, buy mobile operator EE and face an investigation into its Italian unit.After having to cut thousands of jobs last year, he left BT at the beginning of 2019, when he was succeeded by Philip Jansen, the former chief of Worldpay.“Salesforce is a special company with an enviable track record and phenomenal future opportunities in Emea,” said Mr Patterson.
5;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-08-25T04:00:27Z;Software sector braces for a split among leading companies;Predictions of IT downturn leave investors hunting for who is best placed to ride it out;Fresh from a powerful three-year surge, the software industry is entering a new period of uncertainty. But for companies that look as if they can stay the course, Wall Street’s enthusiasm is undimmed.Shares in Salesforce, the leading software-as-a-service player, surged more than 6 per cent on Thursday after a quarterly earnings report that dispelled recent worries about flagging growth. Meanwhile, tax and small business software company Intuit, which has seen its stock market value jump nearly threefold over the past four years, to $71bn, forecast another solid year of growth, sending its shares up 5 per cent.On the same day, however, shares in data centre software company VMware fell more than 5 per cent, as it reduced its key licence revenue forecast for the rest of this year and unveiled the two largest acquisitions in its history, for a combined $4.8bn. Meanwhile, data analytics company Splunk, which reported earnings the day before, dropped 8 per cent on a disappointing cash flow forecast.The divergence points to a growing separation in the expected fortunes of leading software companies, as Wall Street searches for those best placed to ride out what many fear will be a broader downturn in IT as big customers pull in their spending.With valuations in the sector looking highly stretched after the long rally, recent slips have been punished severely. Shares in Zoom — the video conferencing company that debuted on Wall Street earlier this year — currently change hands for nearly 50 times this year’s expected revenue, a symptom of sky-high expectations for many of the new cloud-based players.The software industry has just been through “a once-in-20-years infrastructure cycle”, said Brad Zelnick, software analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. That has been capped by a surge in sales over the past 12 months, he added, driven by a number of factors, including a US tax cut, a shift to “hybrid cloud” platforms that has seen many companies overhaul their basic IT infrastructure to combine their existing facilities with new cloud services, and a new urgency to accelerate their “digital transformation” to make their businesses more agile.After that burst of growth, year-on-year comparisons are starting to look challenging. According to Mr Zelnick, infrastructure software companies like VMware are losing momentum compared to cloud services that are seen as critical to how businesses are repositioning themselves in the digital age. Along with Adobe, Salesforce is “one of the first two cars on the digital transformation freight train,” he said.Two things are complicating the picture as the software industry faces more uncertain times. One involves the business model changes the sector has been going through as it adjusts to a new reality in which cloud-based subscription services come to represent a bigger share of sales.Splunk, for instance, said that its disappointing cash flow forecast reflected a move to a new way of charging which will see more payments delayed into future periods. VMware, meanwhile, blamed a disappointing licence revenue forecast for the rest of this year on an accelerating shift to subscriptions in part of its business, which also results in more revenue being deferred until later periods. Perhaps inevitably, however, Wall Street chose to see the disappointing forecasts as partly a sign of the dark economic clouds that are starting to gather. Pointing to the economic uncertainty, Pat Gelsinger, VMware’s chief executive officer, conceded: “There is uncertainty, and nobody is immune from that.”The second factor complicating the picture has been a rise in mergers and acquisitions, as software companies look for new avenues of growth. This week, VMware — which is majority owned by Dell — announced two purchases for a total of $4.8bn — security company Carbon Black, for $2.1bn, and cloud tools developer Pivotal, which had been majority owned by Dell, for $2.7bn.According to Mr Gelsinger, the deals reflect a shift to “hybrid cloud”. But VMware’s purchases received a mixed reception from Wall Street analysts, who questioned why it was acquiring the minority in Pivotal when Dell already controlled the company, and whether Carbon Black was too small a company to make VMware a real player in the security market.“The organic growth is starting to slow down, so they’re starting to turn to acquisitions,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at IT research firm Nucleus Research. Growth in Salesforce’s original sales software fell to 13 per cent this quarter, compared to the 22 per cent growth in its newer customer service business. “They’ve dominated the market for quite a while and it’s starting to get tapped out,” Mr Elman added.The acquisitions have also weighed on Salesforce’s profit margins — contributing to long-run unease on Wall Street about the company’s failure to boost margins more as its business has grown. Announcing its latest quarterly figures this week, however, Salesforce predicted a further boost to the profit margins on its “organic”, or existing, businesses in the coming months, even as it steps up the acquisitions.“We do make trade-offs between our organic growth and margin,” said Mark Hawkins, the company’s chief financial officer. “We’ve made considerable progress over the years, but we know there’s more to be done.”Central to Wall Street’s optimism about Salesforce, along with other software companies that continue to trade close to all-time highs, is a belief that they will weather harder economic times better than most other parts of the tech industry. Salesforce, for instance, reported revenue growth of 30 per cent in Europe this quarter, and singled out a new contract with a bank in Italy as evidence that demand for its software can withstand political upheaval.“Whatever is going on around the world, we see a buying environment, we see CEOs investing,” said Keith Block, Salesforce chief operating officer. “Top of mind for this is digital transformation.”The question now is whether this sort of spending will continue to hold up in a slowing economy — and how many other software companies will prove resilient when broader IT spending takes a dip.
6;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-07-25T13:45:26Z;Salesforce expands Chinese presence by partnering with Alibaba;US company looks to gain foothold in China’s $12bn cloud computing industry;US cloud software company Salesforce has partnered with Chinese technology giant Alibaba as it seeks to gain a larger piece of China’s booming $12bn cloud computing industry.The tie-up is a validation of Alibaba’s leadership in cloud services, particularly in China, and a key example of the ecommerce company’s sharpening focus on the business side of its internet ecosystem and international growth.Under the terms of the deal, “Alibaba will become the exclusive provider of Salesforce to customers in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, and Salesforce will become the exclusive enterprise customer relationship management (CRM) product suite sold by Alibaba,” Salesforce said in a blog post.Cloud services have become big business as companies accelerate moves to the cloud globally. Salesforce has pioneered the use of CRM, which uses software to analyse sales and drive top-line growth. The alliance with Alibaba means Salesforce has an instant head start in terms of feet on the ground to pursue sales in China. The country requires foreign groups to work with a domestic company in processing and storing data from Chinese users.Alibaba, meanwhile, can now provide this service to the numerous businesses selling through its ecommerce platforms. Total spending on public and private cloud infrastructure in China reached $12bn in 2018, up nearly 75 per cent year on year, and accounted for 12 per cent of the global market, according to IDC, a market research provider.That is set to increase as Chinese companies become more sophisticated in using cloud technology and data to provide services to customers as well as for their back office needs, such as human resources, said Jerry Liu, head of Hong Kong and China internet research for UBS.“China is getting closer to an inflection point in the adoption of software as a service (SaaS) by businesses,” Mr Liu said.The partnership comes as a number of the company’s main competitors blame US-China tensions for denting software sales in Asia. SAP, Europe’s largest software company, blamed the trade war for its disappointing second-quarter profits this month. Oracle, which Salesforce competes with in providing business software to companies, made 900 employees from its China team redundant in May, with some staff blaming tensions between the US and China for the cuts.Salesforce, which has market capitalisation of $124bn, previously had a limited presence in China but said on Wednesday “more and more of our multinational customers are asking us to support them wherever they do business around the world”.Alibaba’s cloud business was ranked number three in the global cloud market and number one in China’s public cloud market in 2018, according to reports from Gartner and IDC. Tencent is also pouring millions of dollars into its own cloud arm as it seeks to catch up with its rival.“Generally we see that Alibaba and Tencent are increasing their focus and investments in cloud,” Mr Liu said.“This is a platform business so [it] will need a lot of partners to get on board. Tencent previously invested in Weimob and Youzan. And Alibaba moved the DingTalk business into the cloud unit. I’m sure there will be more.”Alibaba, which has grown to a market capitalisation of $450bn-plus and last year generated revenues of $56bn, last month unveiled a succession plan that saw Maggie Wu, chief financial officer, take on strategic investments.The Chinese company opened its business-to-business online marketplace to sellers in the US this week in a direct challenge to US ecommerce player Amazon, as it attempts to expand internationally.

Cloud computing has become a booming business and Salesforce has been ramping up its investment amid fierce competition in the industry. The company is targeting between $26bn and $28bn in total revenue by fiscal 2023, roughly double the group’s fiscal 2019 revenue of $13.3bn.Total spending on public and private cloud infrastructure in China reached $12bn in 2018, up nearly 75 per cent year on year, and accounted for 12 per cent of the global market, according to IDC, a market research provider.Alibaba's cloud arm was ranked number three in the global cloud market and number one in China’s public cloud market in 2018, according to reports from Gartner and IDC.

8;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-06-11T02:57:01Z;Salesforce: vision quest;A $15.7bn bid for Tableau is an expensive way to manifest its vision of a data-driven future;San Francisco-based Salesforce visualises a data-driven future that will make its sales software an indispensable repository of client information. A $15.7bn all stock mega-deal for the data analysis company Tableau Software is a bold and expensive way to manifest that goal.Tableau offers simple charts and maps that can be used by anyone, not just specialists in IT departments. Marc Benioff, Salesforce co-chief executive, claims that his largest customers already like Tableau and that it will add $400m to revenue next year. It will enable Salesforce to offer a broader range of services, which could boost subscriptions and discourage customers from leaving. The catch is that this is not Salesforce’s comfort zone. Plus, on a sales multiple it looks a costly acquisition. Before the purchase was announced, Tableau’s enterprise value was a generous eight times expected sales this year. Salesforce has priced the company at 11 times sales and is paying a 42 per cent premium.High prices are, however, par for the course at Salesforce. Tableau may be the company’s largest acquisition but it is not the most expensive. Last year it paid close to $7bn for Mulesoft, a price tag about 20 times higher than the company’s trailing revenues. And Tableau is a better fit than the company’s attempted purchase of Twitter. But if Salesforce wants to hit its goal of almost tripling revenues by 2023 it will need to keep on making pricey acquisitions.Buying Tableau is all part of Salesforce’s plan to join Google, Amazon and Microsoft in offering cloud-based data graphics tools. See Google’s recent $2.6bn purchase of data analysis company Looker.For Tableau this is a great deal. The company struggled three years ago as competitors slashed prices. Even if its share price has recovered, helped by new chief executive Adam Selipsky from Amazon Web Services and a switch to selling more software subscriptions, Microsoft looms in the background. Microsoft’s data analytics service is a well-regarded competitor to Tableau, and is wrapped into package deals for clients. With Salesforce, Tableau will not need to battle Microsoft alone.Lex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers. Wednesday: Lex Letter From London, New York or San Francisco.

9;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world.

Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-06-10T16:49:11Z;Salesforce to buy data analytics firm Tableau in $15.7bn deal;Acquisition will bolster dominance in managing information and analytics of blue-chip companies;Salesforce has agreed to pay $15.7bn for Tableau Software, in the biggest deal to date for the highly acquisitive cloud software group run by Marc Benioff.It said on Monday it would buy Tableau, which makes data analytics software that turns raw data into visualisations, in an all-share deal. The valuation is net of cash.Salesforce has bought dozens of companies since it was founded in 1999 by Mr Benioff, a former Oracle executive. Last year, it paid $6.8bn for Mulesoft, a data integration platform.Mr Benioff has attracted attention for aggressive acquisitions, even mulling a bid for Twitter. Outside Salesforce, he and his wife bought Time Magazine for $190m last year.Salesforce’s move comes at a time when the San Francisco-based cloud computing company has been forced to ramp up investment because of mounting competition from Oracle, Microsoft and other large rivals.Tableau’s data visualisation tools rank alongside Microsoft’s Power BI as the leaders in a new wave of “business intelligence” software designed to put big data analytics into the hands of front-line workers, rather than confining them to IT professionals.Mr Benioff has stepped in to buy “the best in class asset” at a time when the cloud computing giants are all crowding into the market, said Rob Oliver, an analyst at Baird. Google last week paid $2.6bn for competitor Looker, while Amazon Web Services also has a rival product.The news prompted a hunt for the next acquisition candidate in a market with few remaining independents. Shares in Domo, a business intelligence company that went public last year, rose 14 per cent, while Alteryx climbed 6 per cent.The acquisition is just the latest multibillion-dollar deal in the enterprise software market, after IBM paid $34bn for Red Hat and SAP bought Qualtrics for $8bn late last year.The tech giants’ use of acquisitions to cement their power has brought calls for intervention from regulators, though the cloud computing market is competitive enough to make deals there less of a concern, according to analysts.Tableau, which was born on the campus of Stanford University, has more than 86,000 customers, including telecoms group Verizon, US airline Southwest and streaming video service Netflix. The company’s products allow organisations to visualise big data in chart or map form without writing any code.Salesforce said it expected the deal would bolster its revenues in fiscal 2020 by as much as $400m. Tableau last year reported a loss of $77m on sales of nearly $1.2bn.“Tableau helps people see and understand data, and Salesforce helps people engage and understand customers,” said Mr Benioff. “It’s truly the best of both worlds for our customers — bringing together two critical platforms that every customer needs to understand their world.”The company said it would give class A and B stockholders of Tableau 1.103 shares of Salesforce, worth $177.88 apiece based on the closing share price of Salesforce on Friday.Shares of Salesforce fell 4 per cent to $154.15 in pre-market trading on Monday. Tableau rose more than 30 per cent to $168.42.Once the deal is completed, Tableau will continue to operate independently from its Seattle-based headquarters under the leadership of its existing chief executive Adam Selipsky. The transaction is expected to close by the end of October.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction. As part of the all-stock deal, Salesforce will offer to buy all outstanding shares of Tableau. The three founders of Tableau — Christian Chabot, Patrick Hanrahan and Christopher Stolte — have agreed to sell their shares as part of the deal.“Tableau is widely viewed as the gold standard in the next generation [business intelligence]/visualisation market and has driven share gains against legacy [business intelligence] vendors,” said Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citi who follows the stock.Bank of America provided financial advice to Salesforce, while law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Morrison & Foerster provided legal counsel. Goldman Sachs and law firm Cooley advised Tableau.

12;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2019-03-04T22:12:29Z;Salesforce outlook falls short as spending climbs;;Cloud software giant Salesforce.com delivered guidance for the current quarter that disappointed investors, sending shares down after hours on Monday.The San Francisco-based company expects to record a first-quarter profit of 60 cents to 61 cents a share excluding one-time items, while revenue is on track to hit $3.67bn to $3.68bn. Analysts polled by Refinitiv are looking for adjusted earnings per share of 63 cents on revenue of $3.7bn.For the full year, Salesforce forecast earnings of $2.74 to $2.76 a share and revenue of $15.95bn to $16.05bn. Wall Street had projected $2.76 a share and $16bn.Shares fell 3.2 per cent at $153.50 in after-hours trading.Salesforce has seen significant revenue growth, with sales in the quarter ended January 31 surging 26 per cent to $3.6bn and topping Wall Street’s forecast. Adjusted earnings of 70 cents a share also beat expectations by 15 cents.But the $121bn software company has also ramped up investments amid fierce competition from Microsoft, Oracle and others in the cloud computing industry. Operating expenses in the latest quarter jumped 32 per cent to $2.52bn, reflecting an increase in spending on research and development as well as marketing and sales.Salesforce earned net income of $362m, or 46 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, up from $206m, or 28 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.The company reported that revenue from Sales Cloud was up 11 per cent during the period, while Service Cloud registered growth of 22 per cent.Salesforce is targeting between $26bn and $28bn in total revenue by fiscal 2023, roughly double the group’s fiscal 2019 revenue of $13.3bn.
13;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2018-09-28T03:00:28Z;‘Alexa, are you a help or a hindrance at work?’;Amazon, Google and others are yet to find many uses for voice-powered AI in the office;“Smart speakers” such as Amazon’s Echo and Google Home can be an annoyance in the office. They sometimes spring to life unexpectedly, even when no one has spoken the “wake up” word.Nor are there many obvious applications for voice-powered artificial intelligence at work yet. One customer listed by Amazon is WeWork, the shared office space company, which conducted a pilot using a voice-powered reservation system for its conference rooms. But WeWork doesn’t seem to consider it much of a priority: it says it put the project on hold after a new chief technology officer arrived at the company and questioned its importance.The devices also tend to sit, dumb, waiting in vain to be woken up. “The most vexing thing is, people don’t know what questions to ask these things,” said Javier Soltero, head of Cortana, Microsoft’s AI personal assistant. “How do you query this thing about its capabilities?”Yet for all the reasons to be doubtful, some of the biggest technology companies are suddenly in a hurry to bring voice-enabled AI into office life.The surprise consumer success of Amazon’s Echo speaker — and Alexa, the voice service that sits behind it — has sparked “mainstream curiosity” in the technology, says Mr Soltero. “People have got very curious about how a computer without a display can be a useful tool” at work.Amazon, for one, is betting that the same “consumerisation” trend that brought smartphones and other consumer technologies into work life will do the same for voice.“The enterprise world is looking to offer the same level of experiences to their workers that they are getting in their private lives,” said Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer. “Voice is a very important interface to digital systems.”That said, some of the main uses that have fuelled its adoption at home do not exist at work. Popular consumer applications include playing music and controlling “smart home” functions. Many workers also sit in front of screens and keyboards, reducing the need for a new, hands-free form of computer input.I think the leap will come when these things wake up and tell us useful stuff proactivelyOne result is that using voice-based systems for work may take off first outside the office. Software company Salesforce, for instance, this week showed off two features it plans to release soon: a way for salespeople coming out of meetings to quickly update their records by speaking into their smartphones, and a daily voice briefing about upcoming meetings and other work issues that people will be able to listen to over their home smart speakers.The use of voice AI in the office is also being held back by a technology lag. While computers these days are good at identifying spoken words, they often stumble over discerning meaning, due to the ambiguities in language and the heavy dependence on context in human conversation.“We call it ‘voice’, but the crux of it, and the hard research area, is below the voice, the natural language processing — actually understanding what is being said,” said Richard Socher, head of AI at Salesforce.These limitations have led to only rudimentary attempts so far to bring voice AI to work life. But the tech companies working on the problem see these as merely the first steps in a transformational new workplace technology, and are pushing on three main fronts.The first involves turning the issuing of simple voice instructions into more complex, two-way conversations with machines. For now, voice commands are useful mainly for “simplifying a multi-step function into a single utterance,” said Mr Soltero, making the technology “very task-oriented”.Interactions with business software applications often fall into this category — such as updating a Salesforce record without needing to open the software. Amazon earlier this year added a feature to its Alexa for Business service to schedule or move meetings with a spoken command.As natural language processing improves, say the experts, the machines will start to respond more intelligently, leading to a dialogue in which more complex tasks are handled. “Nobody in the next couple of years will want to use a system they can’t have a chat with,” predicts Mr Socher at Salesforce.A second front involves linking the voice-input and language understanding technology to a company’s other intelligent systems, so that machines can start to offer more useful responses.If you’re building a platform, you have to be willing to be surprisedFocusing only on the voice component of the technology was “a head fake”, said Mr Soltero: what really matters is the intelligence working in the background to make workers more productive, with voice only acting as one of the ways people will connect to these systems. They include full “personal assistants” such as Cortana and Siri that seek to replicate the kinds of support a human assistant would provide — a role that Amazon’s Alexa is also growing into.For now, the assistants can be invoked by voice for only basic tasks. Microsoft has linked Cortana to its office chat system, called Teams, so that workers can start a video conference with a voice command, for example. But they could eventually develop a mind of their own.“I think the leap will come when these things wake up and tell us useful stuff proactively,” says Mr Soltero — such as warning of a scheduling conflict or nudging a worker about something they need to finish ahead of a meeting.The third frontier lies in listening in to meetings, or conversations with customers, and putting the information to better use. Some voice applications are already doing this in narrow contexts, such as call centre software used to train workers in how to deal with customers better.This could be extended to monitoring more general work meetings, taking notes and suggesting items to follow up on later — or even to tracking all conversations that happen in an office.“Eventually it will be much more seamless and will always be there, as long as privacy and trust allows it,” says Mr Socher. “It’ll just keep track of everything that’s going on.”That may sound far too intrusive for most office settings. But for now, said Mr Vogels, the use of voice AI at work was only at a very early stage: the real question is what use developers will make of the new capabilities that companies such as Amazon are building. “If you’re building a platform, you have to be willing to be surprised,” he said.
14;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2018-09-21T17:49:51Z;Marc Benioff tries out life as a legacy media baron;For Salesforce chief, deal for Time magazine is about taking on wider responsibility;On Tuesday evening, software billionaire Marc Benioff will celebrate his 54th birthday with a party high above San Francisco. Provided the evening fog does not roll in across the hills from the Pacific, guests at the top of his Salesforce Tower will get a twilight view of the city spread out below.This might represent the pinnacle for a modern tech mogul. Some 170,000 people are due to converge on San Francisco that day for his company’s annual conference, testing the infrastructure of a city that is already failing to deal with a historic tech boom. They will rub shoulders with an army of the homeless that is a stain on San Francisco — and a problem that Mr Benioff has pledged personally to solve.This week, though, the Salesforce co-founder has been trying on the very different role of press baron. Along with his wife, Lynne, he started the week with the $190m purchase of Time magazine, a somewhat faded symbol of 20th century media power.Locked in preparation for the Salesforce conference — and seemingly cautious about flaunting his position as the latest tech boss to lord it over old media — Mr Benioff has not been his usual accessible self. Asked to talk, he responded with the kind of email brush-off that speaks volumes about his easy salesman’s charm: “You know I love you and would like to make this work but I’m not sure how?”He’s brilliant at PR and marketing, it feels like there’s a lot of schtick. But when you peel everything away, there’s real authenticityHe did find a moment for an email exchange with the Financial Times — shortly after swapping text messages with the New York Times from a massage table — while jetting to Aspen for an intimate think-in with a group of business leaders.“I strongly believe in a multi-stakeholder [sic] as the path forward, and especially at a time (in the 4th industrial revolution) that everyone and everything is connected,” he wrote. Short translation: technology is turning society upside down, and the only salvation lies in companies taking a wider view of their responsibilities to workers and the communities they rely on, not just shareholders.“We have no choice but to preserve and promote our vehicles of engagement,” he added, of the role that media plays in a world under stress.It has been a week of pure Benioff, characterised by equal parts high-mindedness, incessant networking and canny self-promotion. For the software industry’s top salesman, it often feels like the main product is himself.After writing his first software program at 15, Mr Benioff interned at Apple and took a job at database software company Oracle after college. He was quickly singled out by co-founder Larry Ellison, who used him as a personal emissary to sort out problems around his company.Mr Benioff quit at the end of the 1990s after suffering what he described as burnout. Two other start-ups he tried failed but a third, Salesforce, took off, and Mr Benioff soon took over as the chief executive.These days, Mr Benioff seems to be slotting easily into his new role as tech industry statesman and chief agitator for fixing the problems of San Francisco, his family’s hometown. Yet he still has the look of an interloper, with a mischievous grin and a habitual twinkle in the eye. His bulky, 6 foot 5 inch frame is often clad in Hawaiian shirts, a reminder of the island bolt-hole where he frequently retreats. His personal philosophy combines meditation with a philanthropic zeal he tried to bake into the Salesforce culture from the outset, all of it stirred up with a heavy dose of marketing.There has always been a lingering question about how much of his high-mindedness is deeply felt, and how much is self-promotion. As Mr Benioff reaches the apotheosis of selfhood, can the two any longer be separated?Tien Tzuo, an early employee at Salesforce, recalled how, when the company’s computers kept crashing — a disaster for a business that delivers a service over the internet — Mr Benioff branded his response the “Trust initiative”.“The engineers and product people were getting really mad, they thought it was disingenuous we were calling it ‘trust’,” said Mr Tzuo, now chief of Zuora, a cloud-based software company. But he credits the Salesforce chief with a deeper insight: rather than just a marketing pitch to disguise his company’s failings, “trust” became an aspirational goal, part of a culture that stretched beyond hype.“He’s brilliant at PR and marketing, it feels like there’s a lot of schtick. But when you peel everything away, there’s real authenticity,” Mr Tzuo said.If that highly polished authenticity is the currency Mr Benioff trades in, then there are signs that he is freeing up more of his time to put it to wider use. Five years ago, he appeared ready to step back when he flirted with selling out to Microsoft. That deal did not happen, but last month he split his chief executive role with fellow former Oracle executive Keith Block.Mr Block brushed off the suggestion that Mr Benioff is ready to step back. “Marc’s strengths are in the vision and the product and the messaging, and using the company as a platform for change,” he said — a job he will continued to advance full-time. But for the newly-minted press baron, there are pressing problems of the world to solve.

Meredith formally put Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money on the block in March.The Benioffs are buying Time in a personal capacity unrelated to Salesforce, where Mr Benioff serves as chief executive, and “will not be involved in day-to-day operations or journalistic decisions”, Meredith said in a statement. The deal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is expected to close within 30 days.“We have deep respect for their organization & [are] honored to be stewards of this iconic brand,” Mr Benioff said in a tweet on Sunday. He praised the magazine as “a treasure trove of our history & culture”.In a note to staff about the sale, Edward Felsenthal, Time magazine editor, welcomed the Benioffs’ “guidance and mentorship as we set out to build a new company”. He added: “One of the first challenges Marc and Lynne gave us is to think big, really big. Beyond the five-year plan, what will Time look like in 2040? What will it mean to people decades from now?”The Salesforce chief executive, whose net worth is estimated at $6.7bn by Forbes, is the latest wealthy technology figure to try out media ownership at a time when the publishing industry is under severe strain from tumbling print advertising revenues and a digital market dominated by Google and Facebook.Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, bought The Washington Post for $250m in 2013. Chris Hughes, Facebook co-founder, bought The New Republic in 2012, but sold it four years later after finding it difficult to adapt the US political magazine into a digital media company. In July last year Laurene Powell Jobs, the philanthropist, investor and widow of Steve Jobs, took a majority stake in The Atlantic magazine.The Benioffs are taking over Time following a difficult period leading up to the sale to Meredith. Time Inc had limited success transforming itself into a digital media business amid declining revenues and $1.2bn in long-term debt, and undertook sweeping cuts to jobs, circulation and frequency of its titles as it tried to turn the operation round.Meredith is in the process of shedding 1,200 jobs this year as part of efforts to trim $400m to $500m in costs. It said it would use the proceeds of the sale to pay down debt, which increased with the assumption of Time Inc’s obligations. The publisher is aiming to cut its net debt, which stood at $2.7bn at the end of June, by $1bn in the current 2019 fiscal year and have net debt below $2bn by the end of fiscal year 2020.Meredith is still seeking buyers for the other three former Time Inc magazines: Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated.The sale is the latest reshuffling in the publishing industry as media owners scramble to cut costs and consolidate. Vogue owner Condé Nast has put three of its titles up for sale; New York Media has hired advisers to explore offers for New York magazine and its websites; and the Chicago Tribune publisher Tronc has held negotiations to sell the company to a private equity firm.The consulting and accounting group PwC forecasts print advertising sales for consumer magazines would more than halve between 2012 and 2021 in the US, falling to $6.7bn."
16;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2018-08-29T21:09:18Z;Salesforce slips after lowering Q3 guidance;;Salesforce shares dropped after the bell on Wednesday as the company posted a gain in revenue but lowered its guidance for the current quarter.Salesforce’s revenue for the three months ending July 31 was up 27 per cent from last year at $3.28bn and earnings per share hit 39 cents, as per Thomson Reuters data.For the current quarter, however, the company adjusted its guidance to project earnings per share of 1 to 2 cents. Analysts were expecting that figure to be closer 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data.Still, Salesforce raised its earnings projections for the full year to a range of 97 to 99 cents a share and lifted its revenue projections to $13.125bn to $13.175bn. Last quarter it said it was expecting $13.075 to $13.125 billion on the year.Keith Block, co-chief executive, attributed the company’s revenue growth to “excellent performance across our clouds, industry segments and geographies”, noting that the company was on pace for its target of $23bn in revenue by fiscal year 2022.Revenue from subscriptions made up more than $3bn of the company’s total haul, and income from its flagship sales cloud division grew by $113m to eclipse $1bn.Salesforce has been acquisitive this so far this year, buying Mulesoft in March for $6.5bn, its largest acquisition to date. While the news of that acquisition was not well received by the market when it was announced, the company is counting on using Mulesoft’s technology, which connects applications, data and devices to one another, to supplement its own cloud-based systems.Salesforce shares are up 51.4 per cent this year. They slipped 1.6 per cent post-market after the earnings release.
17;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:02+0000;Do the right thing: the counsel driving diversity and inclusion;Achieving more diversity in the workforce is moving up the agenda for in-house teams and law firms;When the US state of Georgia tried to pass a law in 2016 that many believed would legalise discrimination against LGBT+ people, Marc Benioff took a stand. The founder and chief executive of Salesforce, the sales tech software company, joined 500 other companies in opposing the bill. He warned on Twitter that if Georgia’s governor did not veto the bill, which would allow vendors to deny services based on a “sincerely held religious belief”, Salesforce “would have to reduce investments” in the state. It worked.This was an echo of an earlier effort in Indiana by the San Francisco-based Salesforce and other businesses with operations in the state, such as Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly, to amend a 2015 bill that employees were concerned would lead to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Salesforce takes such actions, he later told the Financial Times, “because they are what our employees demand”.Companies have public platforms in ways they never had in the past . . . Indiana was a bit of a watershed moment for corporations, and seeing what they can doAmy Weaver, general counsel of Salesforce, flew to Indiana to rally support from other concerned business leaders. By the end of the week, she says, they had drafted an amendment that would prevent the law being used for discrimination. Mike Pence, now vice-president of the US, who was at the time Indiana’s socially conservative governor, came under pressure to protect the state’s business interests and signed the amendment.“Companies have public platforms in ways they never had in the past,” says Ms Weaver. “[Indiana] was a bit of a watershed moment for corporations, and seeing what they can do.”As businesses find their feet in driving policy changes in districts where they have interests, as well as within their own organisations, general counsel are taking on a bigger role in supporting this evolution.Ms Weaver says the move towards large-scale social responsibility has been the biggest shift during her career as a general counsel. “In law school when they ask you, ‘What’s the role of a corporation?’ [The answer] is just ‘do no harm, give a little back to a little-league [baseball] team.’ There was no concept of companies stepping up the way they are today.”Much of the change, she says, is driven by employees. “People are seeking a purpose.”Companies looking to attract top talent to their legal teams are taking note.Lucy Ricca, a lecturer at Stanford Law School and executive director of the Stanford Center on the Legal Profession, says a company’s culture “matters a lot to the vast majority of our students, who are some of the most elite students in the country . . . They have high expectations for institutions prioritising diversity and recognising that it makes a better and more competitive workplace.”Employers are familiar with the argument that diverse workforces improve the bottom line. A 2017 McKinsey study, called Delivering Through Diversity, found a statistically significant relationship between a company’s diversity and better financial performance.Diversity is a broad term that encompasses gender, ethnicity, socio-economic background, as well as physical and developmental disabilities. Achieving more diverse legal talent is on the minds of both in-house teams and law firms: how to attract it, keep it and best accommodate it.Meaningful change involves going beyond minimum regulatory standards, says Chad Jerdee, general counsel and chief compliance officer at Accenture. Mr Jerdee lost a leg in a head-on crash with a drunk driver and, after a long recovery, wears a prosthetic.“Usually diversity policies are loosely affiliated with employee resource groups,” he says, referring to initiatives for staff around a shared interest. Mr Jerdee, however, wanted to build a programme that was more consistent and strategic in how the consultancy governed initiatives and recruitment for employees with disabilities. Accenture’s Persons with Disabilities programme helps accommodate employees with physical and cognitive impairments through specialised software, workstations and mentoring, and has become a model for others.Mr Jerdee’s team takes its lead from those it serves: 60 per cent of the team involved in developing and implementing the company’s adaptive technology have a disability.He emphasises that making an organisation’s culture more inclusive requires buy-in at the very top, with senior leaders setting and managing measurable targets for disability inclusion. Accenture’s global legal team relies on data to track how they are meeting diversity recruitment targets and retaining talent. “You don’t achieve things if you don’t measure them.”GCs can play a vital role, he says: “Whatever general counsel does needs to be a part of the general culture of the company. Focusing just on compliance is selling the function short.”As the way companies work evolves, the role of the general counsel in increasing diversity is changing, too. At Salesforce, Ms Weaver says: “We are in uncharted waters. The role of a company as a platform for change is evolving rapidly. For general counsel, we constantly have to be focused on the values of the company. We have to do this with all of our stakeholders in mind — our shareholders, our employees, our customers, our partners and our communities.”$3mAmount Salesforce paid to close gender pay gap — more than onceSometimes the challenge for a company is to look inwards to ask where problems may exist, even if they do not know what the outcome will be. After a public announcement in 2015, Salesforce commissioned a company-wide study into salaries of its employees to understand its gender pay gap. The legal and human resources teams worked to analyse the results of the survey, and the company found that 6 per cent of employees earned less than peers of the opposite gender for the same work. The company paid out $3m to even the gap.The next year, Salesforce added a new set of criteria to the survey, broadening the definition of diversity. Again, it paid out $3m. The initiative was repeated again this past year, revealing a gap of $2.7m. “It shows that there isn’t a finish line on this,” Ms Weaver says. “You can’t just do this and declare victory. You have to keep setting goals.”“Thinking, ‘we’re not just going to do a one-off’ is so important,” says Gretchen Bellamy, a former assistant general counsel at Walmart who now works as a diversity and inclusion consultant and chairs the commission on Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the Profession for the American Bar Association. Finding solutions that are sustainable is a business imperative, she adds. “If you have a company that operates in 28 different countries around the world, if you have a diverse customer base and you want to carry the products that people want to buy, diversity has to touch every bit of the business.”“Sustainable businesses have healthy cultures. They’re ethical, they’re diverse,” says Mr Jerdee. For a company to be sustainable in today’s market, its culture must be healthy across the organisation.Mr Jerdee says: “We are competing for talent in the marketplace. The nature of what we do is provide clients with thoughtful creative ideas to solve their business problems. If we don’t have a diverse workforce we can’t provide quality solutions to our clients. It’s also just the right thing to do.”The interaction between general counsel and law firms is an essential component of helping both reach their diversity goals, says Gretchen Bellamy (pictured above), chair of the commission on Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the Profession for the American Bar Association (ABA).General counsel, eager to work with more diverse groups of lawyers, can press law firms to develop diverse teams or risk losing their contracts. But GCs need to be careful not to set unrealistic goals at the expense of minority lawyers at firms, who are often in short supply and high demand. They risk being put on a single client account, warns Ms Bellamy. Only a quarter of Fortune 500 general counsel are women and 10 per cent are from minority ethnic groups, according to a 2018 ABA survey.Ms Bellamy advises firms to communicate with GCs about their diversity goals, rather than reaching them by restricting the options of diverse lawyers, which can hold them back in their careers. She says retention of diverse staff remains a challenge for firms, as lawyers become frustrated with the lack of options and leave.
18;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Salesforce/Mulesoft: stubbornly acquisitive;The cloud computing group’s biggest deal yet is no reason for US stock market cheer;"Public investors starved of opportunities will be glued to Dropbox’s initial public offering on Thursday. If successful, the cloud storage company could encourage other private unicorns to take the plunge.However, a bigger factor in the wretched state of the US stock market — whose members have shrunk by half in 20 years — is heightened acquisition activity. More instructive than Dropbox, therefore, is Salesforce’s pricey $6bn acquisition of Mulesoft, announced on Wednesday evening.Mulesoft itself went public a year ago this week. Its ticker MULE is already slated to disappear into the ravenous maw of Salesforce, whose critics say is a “roll-up”, puffing up revenues with constant acquisitions.This deal, Salesforce’s biggest yet, was not cheered by shareholders — the stock fell 3 per cent after-hours — despite an accompanying boost in its 2022 revenue target from $21bn to $23bn. But that is a far smaller tantrum than in 2016 when an attempt to acquire Twitter spread real alarm. At least Mulesoft, which enables sprawling software applications to communicate with each other, is closer to Salesforce’s core product.The pricetag looks extravagant at 20 times Mulesoft’s $300m revenues; the target lost $80m last year. However, Mulesoft’s revenues are increasing at a fearsome rate of 60 per cent a year. Only a handful of tech companies can match that pace. Mulesoft believes that there is plenty of scope for continued growth, claiming that companies spend $400bn a year on custom-made code to connect disparate systems. It is not the stupidest acquisition attempted by Salesforce.For Mulesoft, it was a short but lucrative stint as a public company.

They gained a further 4.4 per cent to $43.81 in after-hours trade on the Nasdaq. Confirmation of the deal came after closing bell.Salesforce shares closed 0.1 per cent higher to $125.12, but were down 2.3 per cent in after-hours trade.Marc Benioff, Salesforce chief executive, said: “Together, Salesforce and Mulesoft will enable customers to connect all of the information throughout their enterprise across all public and private clouds and data sources — radically enhancing innovation.”Greg Shott, his opposite number at Mulesoft, said: “With the full power of Salesforce behind us, we have a tremendous opportunity to realise our vision of the application network even faster and at scale.”Mulesoft counts Coca-Cola, Barclays and Unilever among its biggest clients.The cash component of the acquisition is expected to be funded via existing cash on Salesforce’s balance sheet, with about $3bn expected to come from borrowing.
20;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2018-02-23T23:15:15Z;Dropbox plans for IPO raise ire over share structure;Cloud storage group eyes dual-class listing that concentrates power with top management;"Dropbox, the cloud storage company, plans to go public with a dual-class share structure that concentrates power with executives, even after the S&P and FTSE Russell said they would stop adding companies with more than a single share class to their benchmark indices.San Francisco-based Dropbox published its initial public offering filings on Friday, showing it has chosen to follow in the footsteps of other technology companies including Facebook and Snap, which have given significantly more voting rights to their founders and sometimes early investors.That structure has enraged many corporate governance campaigners, who persuaded index providers to revise their rules for newly public companies, but Silicon Valley executives argue it is vital to insulate management from a pressure to produce short-term financial results.Dropbox warned that the share structure could hit its valuation as a result of being ineligible for inclusion in widely tracked indices including the S&P 500, Russell 200 and S&P MidCap 400. People familiar with the offering say the company could be valued at between $7bn-$8bn, below its last fundraising round which was set at $10bn.[The bad governance structure] speaks to excessive self confidence. People make mistakes and need to be accountableDropbox Class B shares — which are mainly owned by Drew Houston, co-founder and chief executive; Arash Ferdowski, co-founder and director; and investors Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners — will hold 10 times more votes than the class A shares being sold in the IPO. The company has also allowed for a potential third class of shares with no votes at all.Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said it was “disappointing” that companies, particularly in technology, persisted with the “bad governance” structure.“It speaks to excessive self confidence,” he said. “People make mistakes and need to be accountable.”Dropbox is the first big US tech company to go public since Snap last spring. Its growth has slowed, which may deter some potential investors. Revenues of $305.5m in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 28.4 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier; in the third quarter revenue growth was 29.7 per cent and in the third quarter it was 32.8 per cent.Dropbox advisers are set to argue investors should compare it with other software-as-a-service companies such as Salesforce, which is growing at 25 per cent a year. However, Salesforce is 10 times bigger. If valued at a similar sales multiple to Salesforce, Dropbox would go public at only $9bn, below its last private fundraising.Box, the most obvious public competitor, which also sells cloud storage, is valued at about $3bn with prior year sales of about $500m. If Dropbox received a similar multiple from investors, it would be valued at only $6bn in what would be a “down round IPO”.On the positive side, although Dropbox is still losing money at the bottom line — to the amount of $112m last year — the losses are narrowing, from $210m in 2017 and $326m in 2016.Unlike other heavily lossmaking tech companies, Dropbox enjoys positive free cash flow. That rose from $137m in 2016 to $305m in 2017, although the biggest part of the improvement came from slashing capital expenditures from $115m to $25m.The company has 500m registered users, 11m of whom pay for the service. Underlining the scale of the competitive threat to its business, Dropbox’s regulatory filing named the four biggest companies in the world as its rivals: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, along with more niche competitors such as Box and Atlassian.Goldman and JPMorgan are the lead underwriters for the IPO."
21;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2018-01-22T04:00:48Z;Marc Benioff: taking on Silicon Valley’s noxious culture;The Salesforce chief talks a good ethics game at Davos — but is the tech world listening?;"From the 61st floor of the new Salesforce headquarters in San Francisco, you really can see forever. Floor-to-ceiling windows and a 360-degree view shows the Presidio national park, the Golden Gate bridge, Alcatraz, and even the traffic on Highway 101 — Silicon Valley’s main artery — to their best advantage.It is the sort of space that most companies would keep for corner offices. But Marc Benioff has set aside the “Ohana” floor, which means “family” in Hawaiian (he has a vacation home on the Big Island), as a company-wide hang-out and venue for non-profits to use in the evening and at weekends.“When I was a kid in San Francisco there was a room like this on the top of the Bank of America building, the Carnelian room, but it was really hard to get up there to see it,” says Mr Benioff, 53. “I just want this to be something more open — this can’t be just one person’s experience, everyone needs to be able to come here.”The Salesforce Tower, the tallest building west of Chicago, is a symbol of what Silicon Valley has become over the past three decades: home to the world’s richest and most powerful companies, and many of its wealthiest individuals.Salesforce, the cloud-based software company co-founded by Mr Benioff in 1999, has revenues of $8.4bn and is projecting more than $10bn in 2018. It employs nearly 30,000 people. Mr Benioff is worth about $5bn, his wealth soaring as he turned an unsexy back-end tech company into a recognisable brand.He presides over an empire filled with the stereotypically attractive and preternaturally eager millennials who have come to the city to make their millions. Yet just a few blocks away, hordes of homeless people, who have been displaced by the city’s soaring housing prices, panhandle in front of the local Starbucks.It reminds me of a Star Trek episode about a bifurcated civilisation where some live in the clouds while others toil underground. Mr Benioff gets the irony, but points out that San Francisco (he is the fourth generation of his family to live here) is a city that knows how to do change and optimism. For techies like him, the glass is always half full.I mentor a lot of CEOs and entrepreneurs and when I see that product is . . . the only thing that matters, that’s a real red flagWith his baseball cap, custom sneakers, ridiculously tall headquarters and meditation paraphernalia, Mr Benioff is at risk of being a Valley cliché. Yet, at a time when most tech titans (think Travis Kalanick, Eric Schmidt or Mark Zuckerberg) are blowing up, stepping down or laying low, trying to avoid a wave of bad PR over everything from social media’s role in election meddling  to sexist “bro” cultures, Mr Benioff is the rare Teflon CEO in the Valley. He looms large in places such as Davos where he espouses stakeholder capitalism, sustainable growth and diversity (his lunch is a must-attend on the Magic Mountain).Salesforce tops lists for good corporate leadership and is among the most diverse of the Big Tech companies (35 per cent of employees are minorities). Mr Benioff’s 1-1-1 model — in which the company donates 1 per cent of equity, 1 per cent of employee time and 1 per cent of products to non-profits in communities where they operate — has been in place since 1999 and is lauded and much copied. Yet Mr Benioff himself has the big and rather controlling personality of a typical founder; it is tough to get a word in edgeways, and meetings begin and end at his whim. As a company, Salesforce is as rapacious as they come — Mr Benioff has made 55 acquisitions.It is that blend that seems to allow him to float above the bad PR that surrounds much of the rest of the Valley. He is serving Wall Street enough to indulge his passion for do-gooding.Steve Jobs.A rabbi.To give back — he cites his grandfather giving to the homeless on the streets of San Francisco, and links to his own 1-1-1 campaign“Growth has to be one of your top values,” he says, noting that he admires the hard-driving innovation culture at Amazon, and the early Apple. “Steve Jobs once told me: “You’ve got to be 10 times bigger than you are today in 24 months.” Yet Mr Benioff is also critical of the focus on product to the exclusion of all else, which typifies many Valley companies. “I mentor a lot of CEOs and entrepreneurs and when I see that product is the number-one thing, the only thing that matters, that’s a real red flag,” he says, and adds this issomething that tends to go hand-in-hand with the more egregious behaviour in the tech world.Remaining open to criticism is another cultural lesson that Mr Benioff says more tech CEOs should learn. Consider the diversity issue.Two years ago, a group of female executives came to Mr Benioff, showed him data revealing that women as a whole were underpaid compared with men at the company, and challenged him to equalise salaries.“I said, what is it going to cost me?” The women did not know, but insisted he commit whatever the cost, which he did. It turned out to be $3m the first year, and a subsequent $3m in 2017.Mr Benioff also credits Salesforce workers for his tweet threatening to pull jobs out of Indiana following the introduction of legislation that discriminated against the LGBT community (the legislation was subsequently withdrawn). We are doing these things, he says, “because they are what our employees demand”.He is one of the few tech CEOs who is in favour of doing things that governments demand — Mr Benioff has argued publicly for more regulation for the tech industry.“I look at what happened in finance, with CDOs [collateralised debt obligations], or what’s happened in the food industry with sugar, and I don’t think that’s any different than what we’re going through,” he says, responding to recent complaints from investors and policy watchdogs about the addictive effects of social media.Should there be a Food and Drug Administration for tech? “Yes,” he says. “We’re moving rapidly into a new world where we know the government is going to have to be involved in these next-generation technologies — like AI [which Salesforce has put a lot of money into], biotech, etc — which are all so new, and could have unintended consequences.”Mr Benioff believes the next generation of millennial CEOs will be more likely than his generation to manage the cultural and social impacts of disruptive technologies. His advice to them is the same as that of his mentor, Jobs — another transcendental meditator. “Be mindful, and project the future.”A culture of machismo and bullying was exposed last year in some Silicon Valley companies. Allegations of sexual harassment at Uber, for example, revealed a hostile environment for women. How can technology companies find a better way?Jennifer Chatman, professor of management at the University of California, Berkeley-Haas School of Business, says to build a culture of respect companies must clearly articulate their values and norms, and be willing to enforce them. Doing so pays off, she says. In research conducted with three colleagues in 2015, Prof Chatman found that establishing “politically correct” norms — defined as a respect for others’ perspectives and a willingness to listen — improved creativity and novel thinking among groups of men and women. “People can simultaneously be thoughtful, reasonable and respectful, while at the same time being wildly creative,” Prof Chatman says.By Janina ConboyePortrait by Jason Henry"
22;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2018-01-21T04:00:39Z;Davos 2018: activist chiefs fill the vacuum left by government;Industry titans are willing to take an unusually public stand;"Each era seems to have its CEO stereotype. The 1990s were the time of the celebrity CEO (remember Jean-Marie Messier?). After the dot com bust of the early 2000s, and particularly following the financial crisis of 2008, CEOs that kept their jobs tended to also keep their heads below the parapet (even the higher profile CEOs of the era, like GE’s Jeff Immelt, for example, were much less flamboyant than their predecessors).But in the years that have followed, as governments have become ever more debt ridden and less inclined to respond to the crises of the day, a new kind of CEO has emerged. Call him (or much less frequently, her) the “activist chief executive.”Such industry titans are willing to take an unusually public stand. Think Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier’s resignation from President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council in response to the president’s lame handling of racial violence in Charlottesville. Or Unilever chief Paul Polman leading a charge around climate change as the US government was pulling out of the Paris Accord. Or any number of corporate leaders, from Apple’s Tim Cook to Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, threatening to move business out of US states that do not respect LGBT rights.Many of these activist CEOs and their brethren will be in force at Davos this week, where they’ll be plenty of talk about everything from #me-too (note the WEF’s own efforts on this score, with an entirely female chair board for this year’s event), to social justice and the environment, to populism and the continued pushback against the neoliberal globalisation agenda epitomised by the forum. Of course, discontent about such issues is a big reason that corporate leaders are getting involved. Their Millennial workforces, their increasingly “woke” customers, the media and governments themselves are all putting more and more pressure on them to take a stand, particularly at a time when the private sector holds so much wealth and power relative to governments (note New York City mayor Bill de Blasio’s new legal suit to try and force the world’s largest energy firms to pay for the impact of climate change in New York City). But what does their talk actually amount to? Are these corporate leaders effecting real change around the various social and economic issues they take on? And should they be “activists” to begin with?All this depends very much on the issue itself, and who you talk to. For starters, activism goes down a lot better with liberals. A Global Strategy Group study from 2016 that looked at various corporate actions from Pfizer signing the UN Climate accord to McDonald’s raising minimum wages to Delta banning the transport of big game hunting trophies showed that Democrats were wildly more enthusiastic about corporate activism (overt activism by CEOs on the right of the political spectrum is much more limited, the only memorable recent example being Hobby Lobby’s fight against mandatory birth control coverage by corporate insurance, and Chick-fil-A CEO’s opposition of same-sex marriage).Academics Aaron K Chatterji and Michael W Toffel, who summarised their research around the topic of corporate activism in a recent piece in the Harvard Business Review found that at Apple, Mr Cook’s fight against anti-LGBT legislation in Indiana made liberals much more likely to want to buy Apple products, but didn’t make opponents of his statements any less likely to buy them.Yet as Starbucks’ Howard Schultz knows all too well, it’s quite possible to mis-step when you take a stand. His calls for baristas to strike up conversations about race with customers following riots after the shooting of a black youth in Ferguson Missouri were widely panned. “The social and political environment right now is very turbulent and its easy for a CEO who speaks up to feel like a moving target,” says Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih.Which may be one reason that when a single chief executive is brave enough to take a stand, you see many following behind. Ken Frazier’s statement resulted in mass resignations from the Trump business councils, and Benioff’s threat to pull jobs from Indiana became a call to action for multiple chiefs. “Fear stops a lot of CEOs from stepping forward,” says Benioff. “They’re under a lot of constraints from their boards, and their shareholders and investors and they are walking on eggshells. But in some cases, if you can unshackle them, they’ll walk through the door. That was my big lesson after my tweet. All [the CEOs] just wanted to know that someone had their back.”Being an activist is easier if you are a big personality founder (like Benioff or Schultz), and it certainly helps to have a strong investor story before stepping into the fray on any social issues. Unless you can guarantee the Street that your earnings and share price are going up, it’s unlikely that you’ll be successful prioritising anything beyond that. It’s also telling that fewer CEOs have as explicitly taken on key economic issues like rising inequality, flat wages, money in politics or the effects of monopoly power in the same way they’ve tackled social issues. To be fair, numerous big and small companies alike are getting involved in the education and training space (IBM’s widely Pitch 6-year high school/community colleges and the various credentialing programs being done by businesses from Cisco to JPMorgan and Dow are cases in point). But training up a 21st century workforce is a key business issue; nothing too controversial about that. And raising minimum wages (a la Walmart’s recent announcement) is more about responding to labour market dynamics and increasing productivity than corporate activism.In any case, there are plenty who believe that whether or not the public sector is in disarray, the business of business really should be business, and not much more. Morris Pearl, a former managing director for BlackRock and the head of the board of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of high net worth individuals who’ve argued against tax cuts for the wealthy, says “We have a really good system for making the changes that we as a society feel are important. It’s called voting. I don’t think it’s the job of business to decide what issues to take on. It’s the job of the public to decide that, and then to tell business how to act.”"

24;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2017-11-21T23:06:55Z;Salesforce Q4 earnings outlook misses, shares slip;;Salesforce on Tuesday issued disappointing current quarter earnings guidance but posted better-than-expected quarterly results as demand for the company’s cloud-based services strengthened.San Francisco-based Salesforce said it now expects to post fiscal 2018 revenue of between $10.43bn to $10.44bn, up from its previous outlook for $10.35bn to $10.4bn. It also boosted its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to between $1.32 to $1.33 cents a share, up from $1.29 to $1.31 cents a share.However, for the current quarter, the company expects adjusted earnings of between 32 to 33 cents a share, shy of Wall Street estimates of 34 cents.The mixed outlook saw shares fluctuate between losses and gains in extended trade and accompanied third quarter results that topped analysts’ estimates. Shares initially rose as much as 3 per cent before reversing those gains to trade 1.7 per cent lower at $107.“Salesforce delivered a record third quarter, and we’re on a path to exceed $20 billion faster than any enterprise software company in history,” said chief executive Marc Benioff. In the three months ended in October, the company reported a profit of $51.4m or 7 cents a share, compared with a loss of $37.3m or 5 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 39 cents a share were 2 cents ahead of analysts’ estimates.Revenues of the company’s flagship Sales Cloud rose 17 per cent year-on-year to $906.5m. That helped overall revenues rise 23 per cent on a constant currency basis to $2.68bn, marginally ahead of expectations.Earlier this month, Salesforce forged an alliance with Google, alongside its existing relationship with Amazon Web Services, amid a realignment in the IT world driven by the rise of cloud computing. Lower costs have whipped up demand for cloud-based services and helped send Salesforce shares up nearly 60 per cent so far this year.

It is also looking to Google to supply new types of customer data to round out its own services.Microsoft explored an acquisition of Salesforce two years ago, in a deal that would have filled a gap in the software company’s portfolio and turned it overnight into a leader in both cloud applications and infrastructure.But by deciding on Monday to choose Google as a “preferred provider” of infrastructure — such as data centre capacity in foreign markets — Salesforce effectively has signalled that it is throwing its lot in with the internet company, alongside its existing relationship with AWS.The tie-up with Google, announced at Salesforce’s annual customer event in San Francisco, includes a promise to integrate Google Analytics with Salesforce’s online marketing tools. The link would make it possible for customers to see their marketing advertising and sales data in a single place for the first time, the companies said.Salesforce also said it would make it easier for users to access their customer data through Google’s online productivity tools, called G Suite.Salesforce named AWS as its first “preferred provider” of cloud computing infrastructure last year. It did not say on Monday what role the two internet companies would play in its network or how it would allocate work between them.

27;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2017-10-26T17:57:34Z;Gorillas in the mist await cloud players old and new;Traditional IT companies are struggling not to be picked off as laggards in new world;Sometimes, in the midst of a technology shift that takes years to play out, you have to stop the clock to see what is happening.Relative value has been seeping away from old-line IT companies as the cloud becomes a significant locus for computing. It is not a binary choice for tech buyers, who are facing massive sunk cost in their existing systems — as this week’s alliance of convenience between Google and Cisco Systems shows. But there is no disguising the direction of travel.Between them, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc, Cisco and VMware are now worth about $420bn — only 15 per cent more than this same group (before the HP break-up) was worth a decade ago.These companies, taken together, represent a large chunk of what, not so long ago, was thought of as the IT sector. The cloud has changed all that. To put it in perspective: their entire market capitalisation is equivalent to the extra value added over the past decade by Amazon, the leading cloud player.True, Amazon’s business still revolves mostly around ecommerce and logistics. But the solid profit margins of its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, are supporting the entire enterprise. The sheer scale of the addressable market — global IT spending should hit $3.5tn this year, according to Gartner — supports the analysts who argue that this will eventually become Amazon’s main business. That puts into perspective the messy transitional period the IT world is now in — and will continue to struggle through for a long time to come.When traditional IT companies first coined the term “hybrid cloud” — meaning the mixture of computing on their own premises and cloud-based services that is now the reality of life for most big consumers of IT — they were sounding a plea for continued relevance. But the pure cloud players are now making the same case, and building the relationships needed to work in this world. Amazon struck a deal with VMware last year, and now Google has allied itself with Cisco.The truth is, despite the tectonic shifts that seem to upend established tech companies with regularity, IT is a business with very long residuals. The heyday of the mainframe computer ended many years ago, but IBM is still reckoned to derive nearly half its profits from selling the machines, along with related software and services.However, that should not distract from where value — both in business and stock market terms — is shifting. The cloud is no longer just about buying extra storage capacity or processing capacity. Many of the most advanced development environments and higher level services for application developers are now being supplied from the cloud.With the partnership announced this week, Google will be creating many of those tools for Cisco’s customers. And machine learning is the not-so-secret weapon that will do much to drive the next round of cloud development: the chance for outside companies to plug into the artificial intelligence developed for the search giant’s own services could be a big draw in future.Some IT companies, at least in the stock market’s eyes, have already come through the Valley of Death represented by this transition. Microsoft has added $350bn in market value in the past 10 years. Oracle, after leading a wave of consolidation among traditional software companies, is finally getting a cloud lift that has added $120bn in market cap.The market value comparisons are pertinent. The IT sector has always gone through cycles, as periods of innovation give way to scrambles for consolidation. The winners are the ones best positioned when consolidation hits.After an incredible run as two of the winners from cloud-based software applications, Adobe and Salesforce are worth $85bn and $72bn respectively. That might make them look like survivors of the cloud transition. But it is all relative.When Microsoft toyed with buying Salesforce three years ago, for a reputed $60bn, it would have represented about 17 per cent of the larger company’s then-stock market value. Now that Microsoft has a much higher market cap, paying perhaps $80bn now would only represent 13 per cent of its present worth.The cloud is big enough to contain a multitude of software, services and infrastructure companies and more will emerge as it expands further. But there are already gorillas in the mist and — from the traditional IT players to the pure-play cloud services — no one can feel safe.richard.waters@ft.com
28;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2017-08-22T20:58:27Z;Salesforce shares dip despite earnings beat, boosted guidance;;Beating Wall Street revenue and earnings forecasts in its latest quarter while raising its revenue projection for the rest of the year was not enough to save Salesforce’s shares from a 2 per cent sell-off in after-market trading on Tuesday.The cloud software company had been expected to report a solid set of results on an easy comparison with the year before. On the face of it, the numbers did not disappoint: revenue jumped 26 per cent, to $2.56bn, $50m ahead of expectations, while pro forma earnings per share of 33 cents were 1 cent ahead.But after a 25 per cent bounce this year, Salesforce’s shares edged back on the results. This year’s gains followed a year of uncertainty about the effects of M&A on the company, as Salesforce digested a number of acquisitions and investors worried it would bid for Twitter.“I will leave it to the market to do the market’s thing,” chief financial officer Mark Hawkins said in an interview after the latest results were announced. The company is focused on its business and customers, and on that score the latest numbers were “pretty remarkable”, he said.In terms of growth and margin expansion, results for the second quarter showed that, in the latest three months, Salesforce more than met its targets. While Wall Street had been expecting an increase in deferred revenue — the best indication of new business booked in the quarter — to $4.7bn, Salesforce reported $4.82bn, a rise of 26 per cent.And compared to an expected 150 basis point improvement in pro-forma operating margins, the company saw gain of 195 basis points, to 14.9 per cent.

The proportion of African American NFL coaches jumped to 22 per cent in 2006 from 6 per cent before the rule. The 2017 season began with eight ethnic minority NFL coaches — seven African Americans and one Latino — or 25 per cent of the total.Candice Morgan, head of diversity at Pinterest, says the $11bn social media platform adopted the Rooney rule for all executive posts in 2015 because it was unhappy that its workforce had not become more diverse over the previous year. “We were certainly inspired by the NFL,” she says. “We needed to see better results.”The move worked. By 2016, Pinterest had doubled the proportion of under-represented minorities to 7 per cent of its workforce, beating its goals for hiring people from ethnic minority backgrounds for engineering and non-technical, business roles.The change affected everyone, from the most senior hires down to the junior ranks. The company hired Li Fan, former head of image search at Google and an Asian woman, to lead its engineering team, and Ruben Ortega, a Latino who formerly worked at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, to open its Seattle engineering office.The proportion of under-represented ethnic minorities in its 2017 new grad engineering class grew to more than 9 per cent from 2 per cent the year before. Meanwhile, 20 per cent of engineering interns in 2016 came from under-represented groups, up from 4 per cent in 2015.Ms Morgan says the company is expanding the rule to apply to all top managerial roles. This works because it encourages people to look beyond the applicants that have applied or been referred.“You have to source additional avenues of talent, find people even if they are passive. They [may not have] applied for the role, they are sitting at other companies,” she says.Pinterest is not the only tech company experimenting with a version of the Rooney rule to try to improve workplace diversity in an industry dominated by white males.Facebook ran a pilot in which recruiters interviewed at least one woman or person from an ethnic minority for every role. At Salesforce, the guidance is for managers to interview at least one woman or ethnic minority candidate for roles at vice-president level or above.Stephanie Lampkin, founder and chief executive of Blendoor, which has created a scoring system to rate tech companies’ diversity efforts, says about 15 per cent of companies in Silicon Valley have adopted the rule in some form.“It starts with the fundamental problem — we are where we are now because people are only hiring within their network,” she says.This is only one part of a much greater working environment that has to be inclusive. People should not be seen on the basis of their identity firstEven if companies do not end up hiring the minority candidate, it opens up their horizons as to where they look, from lists of women primed for boards to African American and Latino tech executives.Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of Ready Set, a consultancy that works with tech companies to improve their diversity, says at some of her clients, more than 80 per cent of candidates come from referrals, while others come mainly from elite institutions. She advises companies to search beyond the historically black and Hispanic universities to regional and smaller schools that have strong credentials for technical teaching.“I also advise clients to form relationships, grow their inbound pipeline, do outreach to [networks of black people in tech],” she says. “Even if [candidates] are not ready when they come out of a coding boot camp, they might be in a year.”Ms Hutchinson, a former human rights lawyer, says law firms are considering following the lead of tech companies on diversity recruitment. “The legal field is horrible, it has really, really bad numbers,” she adds.But both Ms Lampkin and Ms Hutchinson agree there is a downside to the Rooney rule. Some applicants do not want to feel they are the “diversity candidate”, Ms Lampkin says, and in some workplaces the perception is that people recruited in this way are “lowering the bar” to entry.Ms Hutchinson also advises that companies should be “mindful of tokenism”. “This is only one part of a much greater working environment that has to be inclusive,” she says. “People should not be seen on the basis of their identity first.”
30;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Salesforce: peering at clouds;Acquisition window is wide open but more price discipline is needed;There are flaws in Salesforce’s spin. Marc Benioff, chief executive of the cloud software group, says “the acquisition window has really narrowed”. It would be truer to say Mr Benioff has drawn the curtains under scrutiny from investors.Last year, Salesforce bought Demandware for $2.8bn, Quip for $750m, Krux for $700m, and tried to buy LinkedIn and Twitter for considerably more. Talk of narrowing windows suggests prices have risen and multiples inflated. That is certainly not the case with Twitter. The stock has fallen 40 per cent from last year’s highs, which coincided with a sales process. Salesforce was a vigorous participant in that — until its own share price sank when news of the talks leaked. The performance of the messaging site remains insipid and the company is now capitalised at $10bn, 3.5 times this year’s estimated sales. That is down from 5.5 times last year. The window is wide open.There is potential for more sober acquisitions in Salesforce’s own sector of enterprise software. Thanks, in part, to a stolen internal presentation from last May, we know some likely targets. ServiceNow is up 26 per cent since, so that window is closing. Salesforce’s own shares — which it would have to use, at least in part, for any big acquisition — have risen only 7 per cent in the same period. Tableau Software, however, which was also highlighted in the slide deck, is down 1 per cent. Leaked lists of takeover targets have form as self-fulfilling prophecies. As Janus Capital points out, most companies in a presentation published as a result of a 2004 court case involving Oracle were acquired — either by the database group itself or by someone else. Two other names from the Salesforce hit list, Qlik and Marketo, have already been snapped up by private equity firms.The spark for those deals was the crash in the sector in February last year. Another sell-off like that would certainly help Salesforce get back in the game. But more price discipline — whether as a result of rising valuations among targets, weaker share prices among acquirers or investor angst — would be no bad thing.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
31;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2017-03-16T18:08:31Z;Intel and Oracle sense the road ahead in tech;Latest acquisitions show old tech titans are searching for success in new directions;How many of tech’s old guard will make it into the new world? This week Intel and Oracle made their attempts for long-term relevance (the term that tech companies strive for above all else). Intel’s PC and server chips, and Oracle’s database software, will churn out cash for years to come. But the future of tech has always been defined by architectural shifts in computing — things that go under vague terms like the cloud, the internet of things and (most recently) artificial intelligence — that bring new companies to the fore.To judge by their share prices, it looks like the writing has been on the wall. Intel’s stock has missed a powerful chip sector rally, while Oracle’s shares had gone nowhere in the past three years, until a rally this quarter. The leaking of relative stock market value to a new generation is a clear sign that investors are looking elsewhere for the companies that will define the next era of computing.Yet even though tech disruption sometimes seems to happen with lightning speed, shifts in computing architecture play out in slow motion. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, has been talking about a coming shift of computing into the network for two decades. He may have ceded an early lead in cloud computing to Salesforce.com (started by a former Oracle protégé, Marc Benioff), but with the vast bulk of corporate IT budgets still tied to legacy technology, the battle has barely begun.It is tempting to see the sky-high price Intel paid this week for self-driving technology group Mobileye as the sort of desperate roll of the dice that companies make when they fear being left behind. After missing the smartphone boom, Intel clearly needs to stake out a place in the next big tech markets. The tech landscape for self-driving cars is quickly taking shape: Nvidia has been forging alliances to cement its processors as the most powerful “brains” for autonomous vehicles, while Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP and SoftBank’s purchase of ARM have positioned them to take a bigger slice of what is expected to be a rapidly expanding market for silicon in cars.It sounds extravagant for Intel to pay nearly 40 times revenue for Mobile, which provides just one component for the driverless cars of the future: the imaging technology that helps cars “see” their surroundings. But the company could turn out to be a key piece of the jigsaw for Intel, if it opens new supplier relationships in the automobile world, and if the Israeli company can turn its large market share in image-sensing into a fuller set of technologies for driverless vehicles.The real test will not be about technology nor strategy, but whether Intel can develop the skills and forge the alliances needed to compete in this new market. Carmakers are not like the computer manufacturers Intel has dealt with before, and the manufacturing prowess that has been one of its main competitive strengths will only take it so far in a market where success requires more than building faster processors.Oracle made what looked like a desperate gamble of its own recently with the $9bn purchase of NetSuite, a deal that appeared to be driven more by an urge to bulk up Oracle’s cloud revenues than a strong industrial logic.Delivering software and computer platforms as a service in the cloud requires a new approach, as well as a new business model. It takes time to prove that a company built around one way of selling technology can adapt its culture and processes — or that the new business will achieve the kind of scale and profit margin profile needed to sustain Oracle’s stock market valuation. An 8 per cent bounce in Oracle’s shares on Thursday after its latest earnings — taking this year’s rally to 21 per cent — is a sign that investors think it may finally have reached an inflection point.To Oracle’s advantage, there have been other examples of software companies making this switch. Adobe and, more recently, Microsoft have been through similar tortuous transitions and have emerged on the other side with a re-rating of their shares. Turning a supertanker still takes time, but a belief that the ship will actually respond can take hold remarkably quickly. Companies such as Intel and Oracle have been late to stake a more aggressive claim to a larger part of the new computing landscape. But there is still much to play for. The test for companies like these is unchanged: can they channel their formidable resources into competing against a different set of rivals — and how long will their shareholders stay patient?richard.waters@ft.com
32;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Salesforce says revenue growth to cool in 2017;;Salesforce said on Tuesday that it was on track to break through the $10bn revenue barrier this year, as it unveiled figures that showed it grew slightly faster than Wall Street expected in its most recent quarter.The forecast pointed to a slowdown from 2016 that would take revenue growth at the largest cloud applications software company down to 21-22 per cent in 2017, from 26 per cent in 2016.Speaking in an interview ahead of a call with analysts, however, Mark Hawkins, chief financial officer, said that the company was growing faster than any other software company of its size, and had raised the top end of its revenue guidance range for 2017, to $10.2bn.Shares in the company, which had jumped 20 per cent this year on a broader rally among so-called software-as-a-service stocks, slipped 3.5 per cent in after-market trading, despite quarterly earnings that topped analysts’ forecasts.Mr Hawkins also predicted a further 150 basis point increase in its pro forma operating profit margin for this year, after raising the margin by 400 basis points over the last three years. Salesforce has put more emphasis on profits in recent years as pressure has grown for it to bring more of the benefits of its scale to the bottom line, though the company’s CFO said growth remained its main priority.Revenue for the three months to the end of January rose by 27 per cent to $2.29bn, with a net loss, based on standard accounting practices, of 7 cents. On the non-GAAP basis the company prefers to be judged — and which most analysts use to assess it — Salesforce reported a profit of 28 cents, higher than the 19 cents forecast by analysts.
33;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2017-01-20T04:30:59Z;Tech leaders at Davos fret over effect of AI on jobs;Silicon Valley fears vilification like bankers for prospering at expense of everyman;Silicon Valley is starting to look worried that the march of the robots could be on a collision course with the populism of Donald Trump.Artificial intelligence has long fascinated attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Yet at this week’s global gathering, talk of AI was dominated not by the business benefits and lucrative efficiencies, but the consequences for the humans caught on the wrong side of technological progress.Stunned by the election of Mr Trump and Britain’s vote to leave the EU last year, Silicon Valley executives have been anxious to present themselves at Davos as more responsible and sympathetic, in the hope of avoiding being vilified in the same way that bankers were after the financial crisis.IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty said “there is not one more important [topic] for all of us” than technology creating inequality and concentrating huge wealth in just a few people, as she set out her “principles for the cognitive era”, an ethical rule book for AI.Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, warned sombrely of the “digital refugees” that would be created by AI. “This is the moment, I think, when we have the highest level of anxiety because we can see advances in AI that are beyond what we had expected,” he said. “It’s happening at a rate and a capability that we are worrying about how it will impact the everyman, the broad range of workers around the world . . . There is no clear path forward.”After 2016’s political backlash against jobs being lost to globalisation and automation, Silicon Valley executives are rushing to propose potential solutions before they are blamed for the next wave of problems.Ensuring that the feelings of affected workers were not inflamed against technology companies by populist politicians was the “biggest lesson of last year”, said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, at a Davos panel hosted by McKinsey. “If we don’t get it right, we are going to go into a vicious cycle.”Both IBM and Microsoft’s chiefs were eager to suggest that AI would “augment” rather than replace people, with employees using the technology to automate certain data-intensive tasks while preserving their jobs.With jobs and equality so central to the political agenda, “technology companies have to view how do they help, like improving education, or how might they be viewed as hurting, in terms of shifting the job market”, said Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist, in an interview with the Financial Times.Last year, Davos attendees were “much more cavalier” about automation and job destruction, according to one senior technology company executive and Davos regular. Now that “the world has changed”, Silicon Valley leaders are modifying how they talk about AI to acknowledge that “real people are involved”, not just robots, this executive said.At the same time, however, a clear message from the many panels devoted to AI at the WEF is that the technology is advancing much faster than anticipated.“The speed at which AI is improving is beyond even the most optimistic people,” said Kai-fu Lee, a venture capitalist with Sinovation Partners and a former Google and Microsoft executive in China. “Pretty much anything that requires 10 seconds of thinking or less can soon be done by AI or other algorithms.”That is making the debate about how to handle the huge profits generated by the elimination of millions of jobs more urgent as well.“Is the surplus that is going to be created because of breakthroughs in AI . . . only going to the few or is it going to be more inclusive growth? That is a very pressing challenge,” said Mr Nadella. “Clearly the thing that is top of mind for all of us given the political cycle, is if surplus is going to get created [by AI], I think we’ve got to talk about how the surplus is distributed.”Just as the last industrial revolution led to the emergence of the labour movement and the welfare state, “we need to think about what are the equivalents of that”, he said.As AI advances, concern is growing that it is not just low-skilled workers but white-collar jobs that could also be displaced.In response, many in Silicon Valley are latching on to the idea of “universal basic income”: the state will pay people the minimum that they need to live. Mr Nadella said that was “one idea I welcome”, while Mr Benioff and Vishal Sikka, chief executive of IT services group Infosys, also voiced their support during the week.“A fraction of the cash that the top 10 or top 50 tech companies have could solve a big part of the basic income problem,” said Mr Sikka.With several big tech companies locked in legal battles over their tax bills in Europe amid concerns about their increasing influence, that would be an idea many politicians would get behind.In an onstage interview on Thursday with Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, now called Alphabet, the WEF founder Klaus Schwab said one prime minister of “quite an important country” had told him at lunchtime: “There are three or four powers left in the world — one is the US, one is China and one is Alphabet.”
34;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-11-17T21:52:17Z;Salesforce shares rise on upbeat outlook;;Salesforce.com’s shareholders were floating on air after the cloud software company lifted its full-year outlook as they overlooked a wider net loss in the third quarter.Shares in the San Francisco-based company jumped 5 per cent in extended trading after the company lifted its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of 97 to 98 cents a share, from 93 to 95 cents previously. That topped Wall Street estimates for 95 cents.Moreover, its sales outlook climbed to a range of $8.37bn to $8.38bn, from the $8.28bn to $8.33bn it had previously forecast. That also topped analysts’ expectations for $8.31bn.Moreover, chief executive Marc Benioff, said the company expects to deliver its first $10bn in sales in fiscal 2018. He said:I’m delighted to announce that we expect to deliver our first $10 billion year during our fiscal year 2018, which puts us well on the path to reach $20 billion faster than any other enterprise software company.That accompanied upbeat third quarter revenues. Salesforce said sales in the three months ended in October rose by 25 per cent to $2.15bn, above expectations.However its loss widened to $37.3m or 5 cents a share in the same period, from $25.1m or 4 cents a share in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 24 cents a share, topped the 21 cents analysts were looking for.Shares in Salesforce, which earlier this year ruled out a bid to buy social media site Twitter, are down 4.1 per cent so far this year.
35;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-10-24T23:04:06Z;Salesforce chief who took on Bible Belt is ranked top LGBT ally;Marc Benioff led Silicon Valley in standing up for gay and transgender rights in US;Marc Benioff, the boss of cloud software company Salesforce.com, is forthright about why chief executives like him have been drawn into political battles in the US over LGBT rights: “Well, the politicians aren’t looking out for our employees any more, so we have to.”And when it comes to protecting the rights of minority workers, he adds: “Our country is still a long way from people abiding by the Constitution.”A former Oracle salesman who went on to become a pioneer of the “software as a service” industry, Mr Benioff has always put a social conscience close to the centre of his business and personal dealings. He made philanthropy a part of Salesforce’s operating principles when he founded the company in his home town of San Francisco in 1999 and his name adorns the city’s UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital. It is good business as much as anything, he says: today’s workers want to feel they are part of something with a greater purpose.It was almost by accident that he came to take a leading role in the US battle over sexual freedoms that has raged at a state level for the past two years. While he was returning home one evening on Interstate 280, a scenic highway that connects San Francisco to Silicon Valley, he was surprised by the news that Indiana governor and now the Republican party’s vice presidential candidate Mike Pence had signed a law that threatened to limit gay rights. Mr Benioff says he decided, there and then, to take a stand.Two years before, Salesforce had acquired Indiana’s biggest tech company, another cloud software concern called ExactTarget. A big fan of social media, he pondered a takeover offer for Twitter before pulling out this month — it was fitting that Mr Benioff’s initial intervention came in the form of a tweet: “Today we are cancelling all programs that require our customers/employees to travel to Indiana to face discrimination.” This set the ball rolling on a very public campaign among businesses.Other chief executives joined the protest and Indiana quickly passed an amendment to its new religious freedom law explicitly barring anything that would limit anyone’s rights based on their sexual orientation. “I really think it just took one person to come forward to do it — [other chief executives] wanted to but they were afraid,” Mr Benioff says. “For whatever reason, I was the one who went first. I’m from Silicon Valley, so it’s not a problem for me.”Being brought up in the politically liberal San Francisco Bay area, and with much of his workforce in the region, he was a natural leader for this cause. The company has more than 1,000 LGBT employees among its workforce of 20,000. “Our employees expect that,” Mr Benioff says of his willingness to take a public stand. “It’s enhanced our culture”.Mr Benioff has gone on this year to take on other state-level battles over sexual freedoms, including in Georgia — where his company is a large employer — and North Carolina.Despite this public stance on LGBT rights, Salesforce and the tech industry still have plenty of social issues of their own to put right. High among these is an acute racial inequality in the industry’s workforce.1 Marc Benioff chief executive, Salesforce2 Mark Zuckerberg founder and chief executive, Facebook3 Andrew Liveris chairman and chief executive, Dow Chemical Company (pictured)4 Julie Shirley managing director, Asia-Pacific business operations, Credit Suisse5 Paul Polman chief executive, Unilever6 Jes Staley group chief executive, Barclays7 Karin Cook group director, operations, Lloyds Banking Group8 Peter Grauer chairman, Bloomberg9 Hannah Grove executive vice-president and chief marketing officer, State Street10 Harry van Dorenmalen general manager Benelux, country general manager IBM Netherlands, IBM11 Jim Cowles chief executive, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Citi12 Greg Case president and chief executive, Aon13 Howard Ungerleider vice-chairman and chief financial officer, Dow Chemical Company14 Michael Cole-Fontayn executive vice-president and chairman of Europe, Middle East and Africa, BNY Mellon15 Andy Maguire group chief operating officer, HSBC16 Steve Varley chairman, EY17 Chris Grigg chief executive, British Land18 Eileen Taylor global head of regulatory management, Deutsche Bank19 Noel Quinn group managing director, chief executive officer global commercial banking, HSBC20 Ed Carolan president, Campbell Fresh, Campbell Soup Company21 Jenny Dearborn senior vice-president and chief learning officer, SAP22 Iain Conn chief executive, Centrica23 Paul Geddes chief executive, Direct Line24 Richard Kirkman technical director, Veolia25 Dino Trevisani president, IBM Canada, IBM26 Sharon Thorne managing partner, global markets, Deloitte UK27 Estelle Brachlianoff senior executive vice-president, Veolia UK and Ireland28 Rhian-Mari Thomas managing director, Barclays29 Harry Odenhoven group director customer experience and operations, Vodafone30 Sarah Morris chief people officer, Aviva31 Martin Egan global head of origination and primary markets, BNP Paribas32 Dan Klein general manager, OEM operations, Microsoft Ireland33 Georgina Philippou chief operating officer, Financial Conduct Authority34 Marty Rodgers managing director of Metro Washington DC and executive director of Accenture’s Nonprofit Group, Accenture35 Mark Barnett president, United Kingdom & Ireland, Mastercard36 Matt Elliott people director, Virgin Money37 Danny Harmer chief people officer, Metro Bank plc38 Peter Harrison group chief executive officer, Schroders39 Heidi McCormack chief executive, Emerald Life40 Jim Herbert chief development officer EMEA, Aon41 Andy Milnes chief executive, BP IST Eastern Hemisphere42 Janine Chidlow managing director EMEA & AMER, Resource Solutions43 Annette King CEO, Ogilvy & Mather Group UK44 Jean Mouton senior partner & managing director, Boston Consulting Group45 John Tomovcsik executive vice-president & general manager, North American R&IM, Iron Mountain46 Matthew Layton managing partner, Clifford Chance47 Laurence Bret-Stern senior director, Marketing, LinkedIn48 Simon Eaves senior managing director, Products Operating Group, Accenture49 Alex Hoctor-Duncan managing director, Head of EMEA Retail, BlackRock50 Francesco Bianco regional HR director, Europe, Vodafone Group Services

It wasn’t the right fit for us,” Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, said in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter’s shares tumbled more than 5 per cent on the news. Salesforce shares were up 5.2 per cent to $74.27 at the close of trade in New York.Salesforce had been the only serious contender left in the race after Twitter opened itself to takeover offers, two people briefed on the sale process said. However, Twitter’s advisers are still seeking other potential bidders, those people added. The sale process is virtually dead, said a person close to Twitter’s senior management. Twitter’s management could still explore the option of a buyout backed by wealthy investors or an activist could try to unseat chief executive Jack Dorsey and force the board back to the negotiating table. But both seem increasingly unlikely.Mr Benioff’s decision to drop his pursuit will help put an end to speculation of a sale and will help Mr Dorsey focus on a strategy to bring back user growth at the company, said a venture capital investor close to the Twitter chief.The Salesforce boss came under pressure from his own shareholders over the potential deal, as investors questioned why a company that sells sales software to companies would want to buy a consumer internet company in need of repair. Mr Benioff tried to calm his investors at an analyst meeting late last week by saying he considered a wide range of deals that he did not end up pursuing, though he pointedly stopped short of ruling out a Twitter bid.However, Salesforce was still considering a bid for Twitter as recently as Wednesday of this week, a week after Mr Benioff publicly tried to calm his investors, said a person familiar with the company’s thinking.“It’s not the right fit for us for many different reasons,” Mr Benioff said in the interview. Asked if price was the deciding factor, he added: “You’re going to look at price, you’re going to look at culture, you’re going to look at everything.”Wall Street expectations of a bid for Twitter had already faded as other potential buyers backed away. The news late last month that the company was considering a sale boosted its stock price by more than a third, though the shares had given up all of those gains by the beginning of this week.“Now we all know that [Mr Dorsey] tried selling the company and nobody can be accusing him of not exploring that option,” the venture capital investor said. “This has been a distraction for him and the company . . . The failure of the sale process is a blessing in disguise.”It’s not the right fit for us for many different reasons. You’re going to look at price, you’re going to look at culture, you’re going to look at everythingThe Salesforce pursuit of Twitter followed its loss to Microsoft in a $26bn bidding war for LinkedIn, and left shareholders worried that Mr Benioff was considering large acquisitions that did not fit naturally into his company’s business.“I want to have a look at everything, conceptualise, be free to think creatively,” Mr Benioff said. He told shareholders last week that getting access to Twitter’s data, which could have been used to enhance Salesforce’s services for its marketing customers, was not in itself a reason to buy the company.
37;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-10-04T23:33:08Z;Salesforce: sleepless nights;Restive investors are worried about the software company’s acquisition ambition;“Dreamforce” is the name Salesforce gives to its annual customer jamboree, which has taken over San Francisco this week. It is apt given the state of mind of many shareholders, who have had to pinch themselves when seeing, first, the confirmed news that the enterprise software company attempted to pay about $30bn for LinkedIn, and now the news that it wants to acquire Twitter, which has an enterprise value of $15bn.Even though Microsoft won the takeover battle for LinkedIn in June, the participation of Salesforce caused some of its large investors to sell out. Salesforce, which is obsessed with revenue goals, has pushed up its annual target from $10bn to $20bn (over an unstated time period). If it plans to get there by buying companies, then those revenues will be considered lower quality than if achieved organically. Witness Autonomy which, its acquirer Hewlett-Packard belatedly realised, was constructed by “rolling up” other companies.To Salesforce’s credit it has so far shown rare amounts of organic growth for a software company of its scale. In the US, only Facebook is both bigger and faster growing. And on Tuesday at Dreamforce, executives promised they could get to $20bn without acquisitions. Shares rose 3 per cent. They refused, however, to discuss the logic behind the huge deals that have been contemplated, batting away questions on the subject for Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive, to answer when he takes the stage on Wednesday.Exceptions can be made for midsized cloud software deals such as June’s $3bn acquisition of Demandware. LinkedIn and Twitter do not fit that mould. Salesforce makes about $500m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and has $1.3bn of net debt. Leverage it to the hilt and you are well short of the purchase price of even a Twitter. The only recourse — as was the case in the LinkedIn bid — is to pay in stock, which, at present, adds up to $49bn. If Mr Benioff believes in the shares, he should be less keen to give so many of them up.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Mr De Silva said “the time is right for me to move on to new professional opportunities”.Mr Campanelli previously served as chief executive of Par Pharmaceutical and joined Endo after the company bought Par in 2015. Some analysts were unsurprised by Mr Campanelli’s appointment as Endo’s generic drug business is expected to account for about 65 per cent of its sales in 2017.“He is well regarded by investors and is largely credited with salvaging Par Pharmaceuticals from a potentially ill-timed strategic sale in 2007-08 and orchestrating a climb up the generic value chain through a series of savvy product deals,” Elliot Wilbur, analyst at Raymond James, said.“Endo’s generics business has been the primary trouble spot in a series of recent setbacks versus internal and external expectations, and while changing the quarterback in the second half doesn’t always ensure a come-from-behind victory, it will no doubt reinject some optimism back into the Endo story.”Friday’s rally however belies a difficult year for Endo, which unveiled a massive cut to its full-year outlook in May, leaving it the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 so far in 2016 with shares down nearly 62 per cent.Endo’s advance came alongside a sell-off in US stocks. At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent to 2,164.7, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined 0.7 per cent to 18,261.5. The Nasdaq Composite edged 0.6 per cent lower to 5,305.8.Elsewhere, Twitter shares jumped 21.4 per cent to $22.62, after CNBC reported that the social media site known for its 140-character tweets was moving closer to a sale and that suitors included Salesforce and Google. Microsoft’s purchase of professional networking site LinkedIn has renewed speculation that Twitter could also find a buyer.As of Thursday’s close, Twitter shares remained 28 per cent below the company’s IPO price of $26 as the company struggles to grow its user base. Salesforce was the second-biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on Friday, with its shares falling 5.6 per cent to $70.39.Meanwhile, shares in Valvoline, a maker of motor oils and car lubricants earlier climbed as much as 11 per cent to $24.51 in its market debut. The company had priced its offering of 30m shares at $22 apiece on Thursday evening to raise $660m. It gave up some of those gains to close 5 per cent higher at $23.10.Yahoo shares fell 3.1 per cent to $42.80 a day after the company said that data for at least 500m user accounts was stolen from the company’s network in late 2014. The internet group said it believed the hack was carried out by a “state-sponsored actor”.

Tim Cook has 3.5m and Satya Nadella counts 1m (Mark Zuckerberg prefers another social network). Even the irreverent founder of software upstart Box, Aaron Levie, has 500k. On Friday came reports that Salesforce was interested in acquiring Twitter, just months after coming up short in the bidding for LinkedIn. But like Mr Benioff’s twitter throng, Salesforce has some formidable competition. One of the mooted bidders in mighty Google.Salesforce offered $29bn for LinkedIn, $16bn of it in Salesforce shares. Microsoft bid $28bn all in cash, and won. Twitter’s shares jumped a fifth on Friday’s chatter, giving it a value of a mere $15.5bn. So Saleforce’s bid could be tilted more heavily to cash this time round.Twitter shareholders, however, should be cautious about taking even a modest portion of Salesforce shares. Since May, they have fallen 15 per cent. An organic growth rate above 20 per cent was still a mild disappointment. Integrating LinkedIn’s trove of worker data into Saleforce’s marketing software seemed plausible. The fit of Twitter’s “social graph” and Salesforce is not obvious. Salesforce shares fell 5 per cent on Friday.Mr Benioff’s company is one of the great success stories of the past 20 years in Silicon Valley. But its $50bn market value does not come with much in the way of free cash flow ($2bn) because it spends so much on customer acquisition. Its shareholders are willing to be patient on profits as market share builds. But in an auction, where other potential bidders command rivers of cash, coming to the table with a growth story and borrowed money is not a good start.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
40;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-09-23T16:25:11Z;Google and Salesforce hold talks to acquire Twitter;Social media group working with Goldman Sachs to explore a sale;Twitter has held preliminary discussions with Google and Salesforce about a potential deal to buy the social media pioneer, according to people briefed on the talks.The San Francisco-based company — known for its little birdie symbol and its 140-character tweets — has been working for several weeks with Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co to explore a sale of the company, valued at nearly $16bn on Friday, those people said.Goldman has also contacted a number of global media companies to gauge their interest in a potential deal but none have expressed serious interest.Technology analysts say media companies such as Fox, Comcast, CBS and Walt Disney could be potential buyers of the site, which recently reclassified itself as a news app in the app store.Twitter’s shares rose 20 per cent to $22.82 on Friday after CNBC reported that it was in early stage talks with Google and Salesforce. Before the report its market capitalisation was about $13bn. Salesforce shares were down 5.6 per cent by early afternoon Friday.Twitter, Salesforce, Google and Goldman declined to comment.Vala Afshar, Salesforce’s chief digital evangelist, said in a personal tweet: “Why Twitter? 1 personal learning network 2 the best realtime, context rich news 3 democratise intelligence 4 great place to promote other.”Speculation about a sale has swirled around Twitter for several months as the company has struggled to meet expectations for user growth. Beloved by journalists, professionals and celebrities, the site has struggled to win over a broader audience who have been reluctant to chronicle their own lives and stuck to rival social media platforms.Goldman helped the company go public two and a half years ago and Anthony Noto left the US investment bank to join Twitter as its chief financial officer. It is unclear whether the adviser has an official mandate from Twitter to sell the company.Robert Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said a deal could be necessary for Twitter as the company struggles with slowing user growth.“If the current trend of meagre user and engagement growth remains, we think it’s inevitable that Twitter will need to pursue M&A alternatives,” he wrote in an analyst note.Twitter’s stock has tumbled since it hit an all-time high of $69 a share in January 2014, a few months after it went public at $26.Back at the time of its initial public offering, investors hoped it would be the next giant social platform after Facebook. Facebook has a market capitalisation about 24 times larger than Twitter, while social app Snapchat also has a higher valuation on the private market.Twitter is struggling to attract new users despite bringing back co-founder Jack Dorsey as chief executive, a reshuffle of management and a shake-up of the product that included abandoning its signature chronological timeline.Although Twitter’s user base will continue to grow, its share of worldwide social network users will remain virtually unchanged at about 12 per cent, according to eMarketer, a digital research company.

That was the first rise in revenues since May 2014 and followed a 4.5 per cent decline the previous month.The protracted slump in Macau’s gaming revenues was driven by a Chinese crackdown on corruption and weakness in the wider economy.Shares in Wynn Resorts jumped 4.3 per cent to $93.17. Shares in Las Vegas Sands climbed 7.2 per cent to $53.81, while shares in MGM Resorts International rose 3.2 per cent to $24.65. Melco Crown Entertainment shares increased 7.4 per cent to $13.94 and the Russell 3000 casinos and gambling index rose 4.5 per cent.Not everyone thought the bounce was justified.“We remain on the sidelines of the Macau gaming names [Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and Melco Crown] as estimates and valuations adjust to a ‘new normal’ of a weak Chinese economy and a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds, contributing to more muted revenue growth in Macau,” said Cameron McKnight, an analyst at Wells Fargo.The rally in casino shares came alongside softness in the wider market. Downbeat economic data showing that the US factory sector contracted for the first time in six months, along with productivity that was worse than initially estimated, dragged stocks lower in earlier trade.At the close, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,170.9 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.1 per cent to 18,419.3. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 5,227.2.Thursday also marked the arrival of an 11th sector, as real estate became a distinct sector in the Global Industry Classification Standard. Financials, the sector from which real estate has been removed, declined 0.5 per cent, while the newly launched real estate sector, slipped 0.1 per cent.Elsewhere, shares in Salesforce fell 4.4 per cent to $75.91, after the cloud services company issued a sales outlook for the current quarter that was shy of analysts’ estimates.The California-based company forecast sales in the range of $2.11bn-$2.12bn, just shy of the $2.13bn that analysts were looking for. The news accompanied better than expected second-quarter earnings and sales.Analysts also pointed to disappointing billings in the second quarter, noting that implied billings growth of 12 per cent in the third quarter would be “the slowest growth since the recession”,according to Brian Schwartz, analyst at Oppenheimer. However, he noted that the soft results were transitory and that the company was headed towards a stronger position.Meanwhile, shares in Campbell Soup fell 6.3 per cent to $56.91 after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and a full-year earnings outlook that missed analysts’ estimates.
42;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-09-01T09:56:51Z;Salesforce: restrained shopaholic ;Fallen share price will help prevent a buying spree and underline strong organic growth;"There is a pervasive idea that Salesforce is trying to buy its way to success. This is patent nonsense. The enterprise software company is producing organic revenue growth of more than 20 per cent a year. Out of 72 publicly traded US technology companies in the S&P 500, only eight are growing faster; of those, only Facebook and Broadcom, which has grown by acquisition, are bigger.Still it has been a busy year for Salesforce on the deal front and chief executive Marc Benioff’s voracious appetite is off-putting. During quarterly earnings on Wednesday, Mr Benioff essentially said Quip, bought for $750m last month, was an “acquihire” for chief executive Bret Taylor. He bid for LinkedIn, the professional social networking company, because it was “available for a great price” — despite selling for $26bn, or 31 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — but “for a lot of different reasons” Microsoft won that prize. A critical reason is that Microsoft, which had a net cash balance of $60bn and makes $20bn of free cash flow every year, was offering cash. Salesforce, whose net cash is 100th the size at $600m and whose free cash flow is $2bn, was offering its own stock.Now Salesforce’s only viable acquisition currency is being devalued. The shares fell 7 per cent on Wednesday evening, wiping $4bn from the cloud company’s market capitalisation, as investors fretted over a forecast of slowing growth.The panic is premature. Sales for the quarter beat the company’s target; the forecast for the rest of the year is not too short of the market’s. Currency headwinds are part of the drag. An enterprise value of more than 6 times 2016 revenues is high but Salesforce’s growth is a rare phenomenon. It is more organic than the critics acknowledge. Any temptation to change that with an acquisition spree will be curbed naturally by the lower share price.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
43;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-07-19T15:42:08Z;Salesforce and Expedia highlight valuation disparity;A look at the two companies’ business models reveals something in common;Do the obsessions of stock market investors make sense, in the eighth summer of a long rally for the S&P 500?Consider Salesforce, a company that has always been “expensive” thanks to excitement about the potential for its business: software sold as a subscription service, rather than a simple product which is licensed. Sales have quadrupled in five years, helped by a few acquisitions, so the company is valued at a cool $53bn, eight times the revenue it reported last year.Then there is Expedia, a travel agent. It too offers a fast-growing online service, doubling sales in the past five years, also helped by acquisitions. Yet the perception is that vicious competition for hotel bookings and car hire makes the business harder to expand and less valuable than software. At $19bn, about three times sales is the considered value judgment of the market, including debt.It does not help Expedia’s case that it actually make profits, $765m last year. Salesforce has lost money in each of the past five years, an accumulated deficit of more than $800m. Shareholders are free to imagine what might one day come, untroubled by the reality of profit margins.Expedia has also repurchased shares over the same period, a sign perhaps of diligent maturity. Salesforce has given away a fifth of the company, in takeovers and to its staff as a form of pay, a practice that seems to be treated as signal of its great future.Yet in one way the companies are identical. Both reported sales of $6.7bn last year, and spent half that amount on sales and marketing to persuade customers to show up, a greater proportion than any other member of the S&P 500, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.Salesforce also spent a dollar on marketing for every two it made in sales back when it was a quarter of the size. For a company with a great future, it appears to work very hard to find and retain customers. As Expedia fights Priceline and TripAdvisor, so must Salesforce surely battle larger rivals Oracle and Microsoft.As for the valuation disparity, perhaps it reflects a more general lack of fast-growing companies to buy, or a sort of investment muscle memory about the type of business that is supposed to excite.dan.mccrum@ft.com
44;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-07-01T23:30:38Z;Bidding war drove up Microsoft’s LinkedIn bill;Filing shows battle with Salesforce pushed deal price up nearly $6bn to $26bn;A bidding war with Salesforce.com forced Microsoft to pay nearly $6bn extra to seal its planned takeover of LinkedIn last month, according to new details released on Friday.The contest eventually led Salesforce to offer $500m more than Microsoft, at least on paper, though its cash-and-stock offer was heavily dependent on its own share price, in contrast to the all-cash bid from the software company.A month-long back-and-forth between the two rivals pushed the value of the all-cash deal to $26bn, making it the third-largest acquisition in the tech industry.Details of the frenzied bidding were revealed in a regulatory filing that LinkedIn made with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of a shareholder vote to approve the deal.The high price that Microsoft ended up paying could now lead to deeper cost-cutting at LinkedIn after the deal is completed. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella warned Jeff Weiner, his counterpart at LinkedIn, during the bidding that “a discussion of cost synergies in the transaction would be necessary” as Microsoft pushed its offer higher.The seeds of Microsoft’s giant bid were sown on 16 February, only 12 days after the professional networking site shocked Wall Street with a disappointing earnings report that wiped more than 50 per cent off its stock price. The idea of an acquisition was raised in a meeting between Mr Weiner and Mr Nadella, according to the report, though it did not disclose who broached the idea.It was only a month later, after two other, unnamed companies approached LinkedIn about possible bids, that Reid Hoffman, the company’s chairman and controlling shareholder, went back to Mr Nadella to ask if he was interested in making an offer.Four companies in all expressed potential interest in an acquisition though two dropped out before bidding began, according to the filing. It did not identify Salesforce by name, but Marc Benioff, the company’s CEO, has said that he was involved in the bidding for LinkedIn.Microsoft’s opening “indication of interest” envisaged a price of $160 a share in cash. It later won the right to exclusive negotiations with LinkedIn after lifting its offer to $182, making it look like a deal was close.However, a 10 per cent jump in Salesforce’s share price during a 12-day period in mid-May boosted the value of its rival offer and forced a renewed round of negotiations. Microsoft finally clinched a deal with an offer of $196 a share, compared to the notional $200 a share value of the Salesforce cash-and-stock offer.The bidding war boosted the premium that Microsoft paid for LinkedIn from 22 per cent to 50 per cent, eventually making up for the losses seen since the company’s February stock price collapse.
45;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-06-17T16:38:36Z;Salesforce considered a bid for LinkedIn;Competition helps explain why Microsoft agreed to pay a premium of nearly $9bn;Salesforce.com considered making a takeover bid for LinkedIn before Microsoft won the professional social networking company over with its own $26bn offer.The competition for LinkedIn helps to explain why Microsoft agreed to pay a premium of nearly $9bn for the company despite LinkedIn’s recent struggles.It also highlights the intensifying rivalry among a handful of giant software companies that are vying for leadership in the fast-growing cloud computing market.Marc Benioff, Salesforce’s chief executive, said he had hired Goldman Sachs to advise on a possible bid for LinkedIn and had given the company “a solid look”.Compared with Microsoft’s net cash and investments of $70bn, Salesforce only has net cash of about $2bn and a stock market value of $55bn, leaving it in a weak position to compete with Microsoft’s large, all-cash offer.Mr Benioff’s comments, made in an interview on Thursday with online news site Recode, were confirmed by the company.News of Salesforce’s interest in LinkedIn comes hot on the heels of the $2.8bn acquisition, announced earlier this month, of ecommerce platform company Demandware. The purchase was part of a recent spate of deals in the cloud software industry as buyers have stepped in to pick up companies whose shares were battered in a market shake-out since last autumn.Microsoft’s agreed offer for LinkedIn, announced on Monday, points to a new phase in the takeover wave as some of the giants of the tech world try to make up for lost time and move more quickly into the cloud computing business.Microsoft is hoping to use the information LinkedIn has on more than 400m professionals to supercharge its own online software business, for instance by helping salespeople who use its customer relationship management software to target potential leads more effectively.As the largest player in cloud software for salespeople, Salesforce attempted something similar on a smaller scale with the purchase of Jigsaw, a company with a database of business contacts, six years ago.It also has a loose partnership with LinkedIn, whose Sales Navigator product, designed for salespeople, is available on the Salesforce platform. However, it does not have the level of integration with LinkedIn’s data that Microsoft hopes to achieve after buying the company.Salesforce’s early lead in the software-as-a-service sector has made it a target for big companies whose traditional software businesses have come under pressure from a move to the cloud. Microsoft considered making a takeover offer for Salesforce last year, said one person familiar with the matter.Meanwhile, Oracle, which is also trying to boost its revenues from the cloud after a slow start, has set its sights on surpassing Salesforce. On Thursday, its executives said they believed they could overtake Salesforce to become the first company to reach cloud software revenues of $10bn — a milestone Salesforce has set for its own business.
46;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-06-13T18:10:06Z;Microsoft recruits help in strategy shift;LinkedIn deal an opportunity to propel growing services group;"With its disastrous acquisition of Nokia’s handset division three years ago, Microsoft was looking backwards as it sought to fight an old battle. In reality, it had already lost the smartphone wars to Apple and Google, leaving its Windows operating system out in the cold and leading to the ignominious writedown of the unit last year.Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in the shadow of that deal, is now placing a much bigger bet on what he hopes will be Microsoft’s future: not technology platforms like operating systems and handsets, but the applications and services that run on top of them.The result — the $26.2bn purchase of professional networking site LinkedIn — is by far the biggest acquisition in Microsoft’s history, dwarfing the $8.5bn it paid for Skype five years ago or the $7.3bn for the Nokia assets.Mr Nadella had already revealed a potential appetite for giant deals to make up for lost time, as he tries to accelerate the move from the old world of PC- and server-based software to the new world of cloud computing. A year ago, Microsoft briefly considered a bid for Salesforce.com, the leading seller of cloud-based application software, a deal that would have cost more than $60bn.But while buying LinkedIn reflects the same strategy of using acquisitions to build a faster-growing cloud services company, it was not the deal many financial analysts and technology experts had been expecting.The reaction of Gartner analyst Brian Blau sums up a wider sense of surprise: “Seemingly odd.” A company that makes most of its money from helping recruiters target people to hire is combining with one whose largest business involves creating much of the basic software workers use every day at work.Mr Nadella tells the Financial Times that access to LinkedIn’s data and its 433m individual users, along with their professional connections, will put Microsoft in a position to “reinvent business processes and productivity”.The professional profiles people create on LinkedIn, he suggests, could be fed into other Microsoft services, from Word and PowerPoint to Skype. Microsoft could inject information about users of its Office productivity tools, such as their upcoming meetings or projects they are working on, into a common news feed based on their LinkedIn network and interests. And salespeople who rely on Microsoft software could pull in data from LinkedIn to find out more about potential leads.In terms of finances, at least, Microsoft should be able to take the acquisition in stride. Even after allowing for $46bn of existing debt, the software company still has more than $70.5bn of net cash on its balance sheet. Almost all of its liquid resources are overseas, given the higher taxes it would have to pay if it brought the cash back to the US, and Microsoft said it would borrow the money needed to buy LinkedIn.But Wall Street’s confidence in Microsoft’s ability to pull off a giant acquisition has been hit by recent failures. Besides writing off most of the Nokia acquisition cost, the software company also wrote off the most of the $6.3bn it paid for online advertising company aQuantive nearly a decade ago. The company “has never done well” with large deals, UBS software analyst Brent Thill pointed out in a note to investors. Mr Blau put it more bluntly, calling Microsoft’s acquisition record “terrible”.One question is whether LinkedIn represents as strong a network as Microsoft claims. Used mainly as a site for recruitment, LinkedIn has been trying for years to turn itself into a more active network that users turn to more frequently in their daily jobs.Wake up the users

Offer of $196 a share represents a 50% premium to professional network’s closing price on Friday“There have been signs of slowing growth and engagement,” says Mr Blau. “They’ve been struggling.” He adds, however, that LinkedIn is still “a great brand, and they’re top of what they do. They have the world’s best collection of people at work.”Microsoft’s record in integrating large-scale acquisitions into its own software and services has also been patchy. The acquisition of social network Yammer, for instance — designed to help workers connect more easily with colleagues — has not yielded a breakthrough in the company’s wider set of collaboration tools. Nor has Skype’s internet calling become a key tool in other Microsoft products.“It’s done fine — but I don’t know if they’ve taken it to places Skype wouldn’t have gone to on its own,” says Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC.Perhaps even more significantly, Microsoft will have to prove that it can integrate a large-scale operation into a strong internal culture built around its historic PC software dominance. There could be a “culture clash” between LinkedIn’s younger staff, based in Silicon Valley, and Microsoft’s “grown-up culture” at its headquarters near Seattle, says Mr Thill.To lessen those worries and calm the nerves of LinkedIn’s workers, Mr Nadella says the professional network would continue to be run from its Silicon Valley headquarters. But that, in turn, will make it harder to get the claimed integration benefits from the deal, says Mr Blau.Mr Nadella’s response to such questions: “Of course we’ll learn from the past.”After all the pain from earlier acquisitions, Microsoft investors will certainly be hoping he is right."
47;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-06-01T20:55:25Z;Salesforce target surges after acquisition;Rally in Demandware shares comes on static day for US stocks;Cloud-computing company Salesforce announced a $2.8bn acquisition of Demandware, sending shares in the latter surging and signalling that the mergers and acquisitions market is looking healthy.Shares in Demandware, a company whose software is used to run ecommerce websites, jumped nearly 56 per cent to $74.81 after Salesforce said it would pay $75 a share in cash for the company.The offer represented a 56 per cent premium to Demandware’s closing price on Tuesday. Shares in Salesforce closed 0.3 per cent lower at $83.45.Demandware shares were down 11 per cent this year before the acquisition.The purchase brings Salesforce exposure to a digital commerce market expected to grow 14 per cent year-on-year to $8.5bn by 2020, according to research company Gartner — with brands including Lands’ End, L’Oréal and Marks and Spencer using Demandware software.The deal, expected to close in the quarter ending in July, is also expected to lift Salesforce’s fiscal 2017 revenue by between $100m and $120m.Moreover, with Salesforce’s move, analysts note that after a slow start to this year the M&A market looks healthy.Noting private equity bids for Marketo and SciQuest on Tuesday and the premium paid by Salesforce for Demandware, Tom Roderick, an analyst at Stifel, said: “It’s quite clear that the M&A market is wide open again and, seemingly, as healthy as ever.”He added: “The big premium and healthy revenue multiple suggests to us that Salesforce.com won an M&A bidding war against at least one other competing vendor [likely Adobe, in our opinion, but potentially also Oracle and others].”The rally in Demandware shares came alongside a US equity market that was little-changed.At the close, the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,099.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 17,789.7 and the Nasdaq Composite had crept 0.1 per cent higher to 4,952.3.Elsewhere, shares in Under Armour fell nearly 4 per cent to $36.25 after the sportswear maker lowered its sales outlook, citing the closure of Sports Authority stores.Baltimore-based Under Armour, riding high on the success of its NBA star Stephen Curry’s shoes, said it expected revenues of about $4.93bn for the year, below analysts’ estimates for $5.02bn and its own outlook for about $5bn.It also expected to incur a $23m impairment charge tied to Sports Authority’s bankruptcy.“We view this event as largely one-time, and believe the brand is still in the early innings of growth,” said Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies. “Our main concern here remains high expectations, valuation and the potential rise of Adidas back into the US market.”Meanwhile, shares in Michael Kors rose 6.6 per cent to $45.55 and were the biggest gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 after the fashion retailer reported a full-year earnings outlook alongside quarterly sales and earnings that exceeded analysts’ expectations.Whole Foods Market shares jumped 4.9 per cent to $33.94 after analysts at Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “neutral” and raised their price target on the stock to $40 from $30.Whole Foods’ shares are down nearly 50 per cent since their peak in 2013, providing investors with an attractive entry point, said Edward Kelly, an analyst at Credit Suisse.With Whole Foods cutting prices, lowering costs, investing in technology and introducing its Whole Foods 365 value stores, Mr Kelly noted that “this innovative management team’s aggressive response looks supportive of a return to growth”.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
48;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Salesforce: frenemies closer;The software company offers rare growth, but it is surpassed by Amazon;Salesforce earnings calls hark back to a more forgiving era, when preening chief executives could expect fawning comments. This time, analysts could not decide if the quarter had been “huge”, “great” or “extraordinary”.Marc Benioff, the chief, uses this congenial environment to disparage competitors, especially his former employer Oracle. “One of the reasons we’re doing so well is that Oracle and SAP are doing so poorly in the cloud.”Salesforce is doing well: revenues rose more than 27 per cent in the quarter to $1.9bn, beating estimates. It raised guidance. The shares rose 6 per cent after hours, skirting an all-time high. The stock is now 40 per cent higher than in January, when investors fled software-as-a-service companies on the belief that IT spending was drying up.Its multiple is back to an outlandish seven times forward revenues, despite negligible profits. But if you want to buy a software company that has scale, say more than $5bn in revenues, and fast growth of more than 25 per cent a year, the choice is pretty thin. Facebook or Tencent for consumer-focused internet companies, and Salesforce.What that screen does not uncover is Amazon’s computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, whose revenues are growing much faster, at more than 60 per cent a year.Happily, the two groups are great pals. Salesforce said so, repeatedly. Mr Benioff has agreed to run one of Salesforce’s clouds on AWS’s machines. Amazon also agreed to use Salesforce’s customer relationship management tools across its business.Hugging Amazon is wise. At the moment the two companies’ products mainly tackle different parts of the cloud. AWS provides the backbone infrastructure and Salesforce provides the software. But it does not mean the relationship stays amicable forever. Mr Benioff is yearning to hit $10bn in annual revenues, which he should achieve in the next couple of years. AWS is on course to get there sooner. Amazon, which has plenty of form at straying into adjacent markets, could yet challenge Salesforce with its great, extraordinary and bigger business.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
49;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-04-03T16:30:55Z;Business is right to use its superpowers for social change;Big companies protect values by resisting attack on LGBT community in US, writes Margaret Heffernan;In the US state of Georgia, the Orwellian-sounding Free Exercise Protection Act has been vetoed by the governor, Nathan Deal. He was overriding his state legislature’s vote to allow faith-based organisations to refuse to serve or employ anyone who violated their religious beliefs. The bill’s implicit target was the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.Similar bills have been passed or are under consideration in a dozen states, as part of a backlash against last year’s US Supreme Court ruling in favour of nationwide marriage equality.Georgia’s bill sparked a broad coalition of resistance from some of the most powerful corporations in the US: Apple, Unilever, Delta Air Lines, Salesforce, Hilton, Walt Disney and Coca-Cola. The proposal represented an immediate threat to their diverse workforces: Disney’s forthcoming Marvel movies — Captain America: Civil War and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 — were made in the company’s Georgia studios. Coca-Cola is headquartered in Atlanta. Meanwhile, the National Football League warned Mr Deal that the legislation could rule out Atlanta’s bid to host a Super Bowl.You could argue that, by lining up in opposition to the bill, these organisations were simply protecting their businesses. In fact they were doing far more than that. They were saying that their cultural values outweighed those of the state in which they did business, and that their support for sexual diversity was more important than the feelings and attitudes of the democratically elected representatives of that state.It is more than a purely economic argument and reveals a clear social agenda. The tactic, however, is not new. In the 1930s, IBM started hiring female college graduates and Thomas Watson Senior, its chief executive, said they should be paid equally with men. He was decades ahead of the legal requirement to do so. In the 1950s, the company wrote an equal opportunity policy, in the 1960s a supplier diversity policy, in the 1980s a sexual orientation policy and in the 1990s it provided benefits for employees’ partners.While IBM set a high bar for other tech companies, many of which struggled to catch up, it was not the only organisation advancing social causes in advance of legislation. In 1992, Levi Strauss & Co was the first Fortune 500 company to provide health insurance to unmarried partners. Today this is standard in many large companies.More recently, Netflix began to offer unlimited paid maternity and paternity leave to its employees, something that is (currently) unheard of in the US.One could argue that these apparent trailblazers are economically self-interested — and they usually are. But their policies are value statements that shape public opinion and business norms. They give protection, even an incentive, to other companies who follow suit. In other words, these businesses set out to change society. And for those who believe that the business of business is just to make money, this is troubling. By what right do they wield such influence?Were these company innovations characterised by religious bigotry rather than social liberalism, we would expect to hear a lot about the abuse of corporate power. Some small businesses in Georgia may complain about overweening corporate influence. But the successful challenge to the state’s discriminatory legislation has been widely applauded in business circles, and corporations are now fighting a similar law in North Carolina.What makes this case a cause for celebration is that the companies’ stance is in line with public opinion and with federal law.

50;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-02-25T21:51:59Z;Salesforce.com surges on sunny outlook;US energy sector rallies as crude oil prices bounce back from earlier declines;Salesforce.com, one of 2015’s high-fliers that has faced a sharp decline this year, rallied on Thursday after the cloud services company issued a sunny outlook.The company that provides business services through the internet said it expected to earn adjusted profits of 99 cents to $1.01 a share in the year through to the end of January 2017, above analyst estimates of 98 cents.Salesforce.com also posted financial fourth-quarter results that pointed to “broad-based strength across products, [geographies] and customer segments”, Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho, said in a note to clients.Mr Lamba added the company “continues to execute strongly” despite economic headwinds.Salesforce.com surged 32.2 per cent in 2015, but has tumbled this year as investors have shunned so-called momentum stocks and fretted that a slowdown in US economic growth could weigh on Salesforce.com’s customer base.The shares, however, rallied 10.6 per cent on Thursday to $69.17, cutting their year-to-date loss to 12.9 per cent.At the other end of the spectrum was Restoration Hardware. The upmarket US furniture chain warned on Wednesday that recent volatility in the equity and commodity markets would weigh on its profits.The company’s shares plunged 25.9 per cent to $38.49 after it forecast adjusted profits of 99 cents a share in the quarter to January 30, below the estimates of all Wall Street analysts in a Bloomberg survey.Gary Friedman, chief executive, said in a note to investors that Restoration Hardware continued to see “underperformance in markets affected by energy, oil or currency fluctuations”, such as Canada and Texas.At the same time, “increased volatility in the US stock markets, especially the extreme conditions in January” might have stoked a further pullback among high-end consumers, Mr Friedman said.The shares of Williams-Sonoma, which sells upmarket home goods, fell 6.1 per cent to $53.35 in sympathy with Restoration Hardware.The US energy sector rebounded after coming under renewed selling pressure as crude oil prices declined earlier in the day.Oil came back strongly, with West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, rising 2.9 per cent to $33.07 a barrel, while international marker Brent gained 2.6 per cent to $35.29 a barrel.The S&P 500 energy sector crept 0.2 per cent higher on the day.Williams Companies, an energy infrastructure group, slid 3.7 per cent to $16.01.By the close of trading, the S&P 500 was 1.1 per cent higher at 1,951.7, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 16,697.3, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 4,582.2.The financials, tech and healthcare sectors posted the biggest gains on Thursday.
51;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Tech finds a silver lining after the storm;Cloud software stocks prove resilient in the face of uncertainty;As the dust has settled from the rout in high-growth technology stocks at the start of the year, it has not taken long for the reassessment to begin.A market break like the one that hit with force in January is a natural time to cast a cold eye over companies — and new business models — that might not have been tested in a downturn.So it is no surprise that the growth sector that took the biggest pasting was cloud software. Shares in companies like Marketo, Hubspot, ServiceNow and Zendesk fell by more than 40 per cent, or four times the drop in the broader market. Tableau — a sexy cloud data analytics and visualisation company — plummeted 60 per cent after lowering its revenue guidance for the year.The sudden risk-aversion was apparent in the sharp contraction of revenue multiples for the so-called software-as-a-service companies, known as SaaS. Compared to roughly six times sales last November, the enterprise value of a basket of the leading SaaS companies had fallen to 3.5 times sales by the depths of the market rout earlier this month, according to an analysis by Barclays.How to account for the speed of the rebound that has set in since then?In little more than two weeks, companies like Workday and Zendesk have bounced by nearly 20 per cent, while Hubspot is up 31 per cent. There has been little in the way of actual news to drive this.The recovery in confidence was capped this week with a solid earnings report from Salesforce.com, the company that invented the category. Asked about the threat to new sales from global economic weakness, Salesforce’s executives gave barely a shrug. After falling by 31 per cent in the first five weeks of the year, its stock has rebounded by 26 per cent.The case for cloud software’s resilience in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty is made by chief information officers such as Stephanie von Friedeburg at the World Bank. Facing constant pressure to reduce costs, as well as a need to equip a globally distributed workforce with applications that run as efficiently as if they were hosted locally, Ms von Friedeburg is cutting the number of the bank’s data centres from five to two and pushing more services into the cloud, with its pay-as-you-go model.In little more than two weeks, some SaaS companies have bounced up to 31 per cent. There has been little in the way of actual news to drive thisNot that SaaS is completely immune in a downturn: at times of financial stress, customers cut back on most new projects — even ones that have a relatively short-term payback. And to the extent that smaller businesses or other tech companies are the main customers of newer cloud software suppliers, they are more vulnerable to the damage from a sharp downturn.Many SaaS companies are also at a relatively early stage of development and have yet to show they have the financial resilience to withstand a downturn. A more fundamental question is whether the business model of SaaS has been fully proven.With heavy upfront investment levels, cash flow profit margins at many of the younger companies are thin. As investors have become more wary of valuing these companies based solely on high multiples of their sales, that has left them vulnerable to a fall.At least in theory, the cloud software model has high attractions for investors. As Mood Rowghani, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, points out, it is relatively straightforward to model the cash flows of subscription businesses like these.Yet many companies have yet to show they can execute on this plan across the business cycle — let alone succeed in the more competitive markets that are likely as SaaS companies move out of their narrow niches.Age matters. Salesforce, which has faced no shortage of questions over the past 16 years, this week made its strongest case yet to be considered the first SaaS company to have made it into the mainstream enterprise software market. Its latest quarterly earnings included news of several giant contract wins. It is also finally showing consistent discipline on profit margins.Sales and marketing costs are still sky-high, at 49 per cent of revenues. But as long as growth rates also stay high, Wall Street has once again shown it is ready to stomach the SaaS model’s requirement for gratification deferred.richard.waters@ft.com
52;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Salesforce: diSaaSter averted;The software company has defied fears of a slowdown in IT spending and may even soon show profits;If there is one area in which Salesforce is the technology industry’s undisputed leader, it is superlatives. Quarterly results on Wednesday were described as “spectacular”, “unprecedented”, “tremendous” and “outstanding”.You might expect a side dish of profits with that main course of braggadocio, especially since another boast was “top and bottom line excellence”. You would be disappointed. Salesforce made a net loss of $25m on revenues of $1.8bn in the fourth quarter. Yet investors were content to embrace the hype: shares in the enterprise software company rose 9 per cent in after-hours trading.Relief is understandable. In the first five weeks of the year, Salesforce’s stock fell more than 30 per cent amid a sudden crisis of confidence in the prospects of “software as a service” — or SaaS — companies. The sell-off was premature. Some companies, such as Tableau Software, have indeed earned a lower multiple with weaker guidance. But any widespread collapse in IT budgets is not evident.As founder and chief braggart Marc Benioff is at pains to stress, not many companies of Salesforce’s size are growing at more than 20 per cent a year. Investors will still pay for growth — Salesforce’s enterprise value is back up at six times forward sales — they are just demanding more evidence that it is not going to fall off a cliff.One metric that provides some comfort is that 72 per cent of Salesforce’s customers tap it for only one product: there should be more opportunity to cross-sell. The company now crows about signing “nine-figure” deals. It also bumped up its revenue estimate to $8.1bn in 2017 from $6.7bn for the 2016 fiscal year. The bottom line has not shown a profit in five years but net cash from operations was $460m in the quarter and cash flow margins are strengthening. The top end of Salesforce’s 2017 profit guidance is a mighty $0 a share. If those targets are beaten you have to fear for Mr Benioff’s thesaurus.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
53;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-02-24T21:22:41Z;Salesforce shares pop on upbeat outlook;;Salesforce.com rallied seven per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the cloud services company posted a stronger-than-expected earnings outlook.The company, which derives the bulk of its revenues from an online customer management system, said it expects to earn 99 cents to $1.01 a share in the current fiscal year, topping Wall Street estimates of 98 cents. A full-year sales guidance of $8.08bn – $8.12bn also compared favourably with estimates of $8.08bn.Salesforce.com has seen its shares slide about 20 per cent this year, after a 32.2 per cent surge in 2015, as investors have shifted away from last year’s high-fliers.However, the upbeat outlook seemed to re-instill confidence, with the shares jumping 7.5 per cent on Wednesday afternoon.The company narrowed its loss to $25.5m in the quarter through January 31, compared to a loss of $65.8m in the same period in the prior year. Sales rose 25.3 per cent to $1.8bn, matching estimates.Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, came in at 19 cents, also matching estimates.
54;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Salesforce shares rise after analyst upgrade;US stocks weaker following global sell-off;Salesforce rallied on Tuesday after an investment bank said the company is gaining traction in the enterprise cloud services sector and that its stock decline this year may have run its course.John DiFucci, analyst at Jefferies, upgraded his rating on the stock from “underperform” to “hold”, adding that it is now fairly valued after a near 30 per cent fall this year.The company, which derives much of its revenue from fees related to its online customer relationship management products, was a top performer last year, soaring 32.2 per cent.Mr DiFucci said he reckoned the company’s sales to enterprises, or large companies, are “improving”.“We attribute this improved performance to exceptional sales leadership,” said Mr DiFucci in a note to clients.He also said sales to smaller mid-market companies had been “solid” and were gaining momentum. Salesforce is set to report its quarterly earnings later this month.The stock jumped 6.1 per cent to $57.36 by the close of trading on Tuesday.Elsewhere, shares in Sears Holdings, which also owns Kmart, fell 8.9 per cent to $15.25 after the retailer warned that sales in the fourth quarter would be shy of Wall Street’s forecasts.The Illinois-based company said it expects sales of $7.3bn in the fourth quarter as “the holiday season proved to be challenging” and warm weather and competition from other retailers weighed on its performance. That was below the $7.43bn that analysts were looking for.Meanwhile, comparable sales, a key industry metric, were down 7.1 per cent for the quarter.The retailer, which recently announced that it would close 50 stores, said it plans to accelerate the closing of unprofitable stores.Sears added that it is taking actions to lower its costs by $550m to $650m this year.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shares fell 6.3 per cent to $365.97 after it reported disappointing fourth-quarter results and said sales of its key eye treatment would slow this year.The New York-based biopharmaceutical company reported profits of $155m, or $1.34 a share, in the three months ended in December, compared with $90.1m, or 78 cents a share, in the year-ago period.Sales rose 37 per cent to $1.1bn, missing analysts’ estimates of $1.2bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $2.83 a share were also shy of expectations of $3.37 a share.The company said sales of Eylea, its biggest drug, would advance 20 per cent next year compared with 54 per cent growth in 2015.Gap, the retailer behind Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand, revealed a better than expected full-year profit outlook but reported declining same-store sales across all its brands.“While the company was able to deliver slightly better than expected fourth-quarter operating earnings per share guidance, we believe the earnings will be of low quality,” said Betty Chen, analyst at Mizuho.Shares were up initially before trading down 3 per cent to $23.27.By close of trading, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were trading 0.1 per cent lower at 1,852.21 and 16,014.38, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 4,268.76.
55;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-02-07T18:01:30Z;Tech sector: curses;Fear of declining growth is stalking companies from LinkedIn to Salesforce;"Forget “Fang”. Technology investors are relying on other f-words. The 2015 outperformance of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google is in the past. On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell more than 3 per cent; the tech-heavier Nasdaq Internet index had its worst day since 2011, falling 5 per cent, and neither of those indices contains the true horror stock: LinkedIn.It looks increasingly like a recession mindset has taken hold and caught executives and analysts unawares. Going into this earnings season there was talk that macroeconomic fears gave something of a “freebie” to companies setting guidance — they could perhaps dial down those targets a little.Not a bit of it. When defensive securities are suddenly prized, the only growth tech stocks that will survive a portfolio cleanse are those whose revenues do not miss a beat. LinkedIn reported results on Thursday evening, which met expectations, and guidance for 2016, which did not, with revenue growth of 22 per cent compared with an expected 30 per cent. Before Friday’s opening, the stock fell more than 20 per cent. Analysts said it was overdone. Then it fell 43 per cent on Friday.In many ways, the more shocking move was Salesforce. The cloud software has a longer record of growth than LinkedIn (though it seems to share the same contempt for profits). But it endured the worst one-day performance in its history as a public company, down more than 12 per cent, despite producing no news. Tableau Software had fuelled fears with weak results and a warning of “more caution in how [customers] were spending and how they were allocating dollars”. Workday, another cloud software company, also fell 16 per cent in its wake.It is possible to find relatively safe havens in tech. Mizuho points to CA Technologies, a software company that lacks the double-digit growth of more glamorous peers but offers strong cash flow and a dividend yield of 3.5 per cent. In the top 50 international software companies, only IBM offers a bigger coupon.Yet it is also worth considering that the evidence of nosediving IT spending is slim. Salesforce, whose shares are down a quarter this year, and is now priced at a less frothy six times sales, reports its own quarterly earnings in two weeks. That will be a better moment to decide what sort of four-letter words will define 2016.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
56;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-01-31T09:21:09Z;US companies forced to disclose pay gap;Obama administration in new push to crack down on income inequality;The Obama administration will require companies to disclose what they pay employees by gender, race and ethnicity in a new push to crack down on workplace inequality.The White House said the US needed to catch up with its international peers as it released data showing the wage gap between American men and women is 2.5 percentage points bigger than the average for rich countries.In the UK the gender wage gap has come down by 9 percentage points since 2000 and in Belgium, Ireland and Denmark it is down by about 7 percentage points over the same period, the White House found.President Barack Obama said a typical full-time female worker in the US earns 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, with black women earning just 60 cents and Hispanic women 55 cents.“What kind of example does paying women less set for our sons and daughters?” he said on Friday.Mr Obama is seeking to make a push against discriminatory pay practices part of his economic legacy and called for “equal pay for equal work” in his State of the Union address earlier this month.The disclosure requirement, which was unveiled as a proposal, would apply to businesses with 100 or more employers and cover 63m people — or about 40 per cent of the US civilian workforce — the White House said.The White House move mirrors steps taken in the UK, where prime minister David Cameron’s government is this year forcing companies with more than 250 employees to publish the difference between the average pay and bonuses of male and female staff.In the face of an intransigent Republican-led Congress, Mr Obama is again using his executive powers to make the move without lawmakers’ help. But as with unilateral policy steps he has taken on immigration, climate change and guns, it faces the risk of a legal challenge.The US Chamber of Commerce, corporate America’s main lobby group and a regular Obama critic, said it supported non-discrimination in pay, but cited studies suggesting the White House had exaggerated the size of the pay gap and criticised the president’s move.Randy Johnson, a Chamber senior vice-president, said: “[The] type of reporting proposed by the administration today would place unnecessary and onerous burdens on employers while providing no meaningful insight as to whether employer pay practices are discriminatory.”“Clearly the administration has embarked on one more fishing expedition to support a political agenda divorced from the facts. Soundbites don’t make sound policy.”The White House put forward Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, as a corporate ally on the proposal. He said that he never wanted pay discrimination to creep into his company but that two female leaders showed him it had, a problem he was spending $3m to fix.“We’re never going to solve this issue of pay inequality if CEOs like myself and others continue to turn a blind eye to what’s happening right now in their own organisations,” he said on a call organised by the White House.A number of other European countries require employers to publish gender pay data. In Sweden, companies with more than 24 employees have to publish an action plan for equal pay every three years, including information on gender pay gaps within grades.One of the biggest gender pay gaps among OECD countries is in Japan, where it is around 9 percentage points wider than in the US. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, is seeking to narrow the gap as part of his “womenomics” programme.Tom Perez, the US labour secretary, said: “We can’t deliver on the promise of equal pay unless we have the best, most comprehensive information about what people earn . . . We expect that reporting this data will help employers to evaluate their own pay practices to prevent pay discrimination in their workplaces.”
57;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2016-01-03T15:54:42Z;Equities: And then there were nine;Apart from a few stocks, the US markets are in a slump with fears post-crisis rally has run its course;"Had it not been for a small group of nifty companies, 2015 would have entered the history books as a terrible year for the US stock market. As it was, stocks were almost exactly flat, as were bonds and cash, meaning that US bonds and equities had their second-worst collective 12 months since 1995 — outstripped only by the disaster year of 2008.“It’s the world of low numbers,” says Andrew Milligan, chief investment strategist at Standard Life in Edinburgh.Yet there were some very high numbers for a group of four companies that have come to be known as the “Fangs” — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — and for a slightly wider group that added Microsoft, Salesforce, eBay, Starbucks and Priceline to create the “Nifty Nine”. Both groups gained more than 60 per cent for the year.Away from the excitement generated by these hot companies, things were dire. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, where each of the 500 companies receives 0.2 per cent of the index, was down, and underperformed the S&P weighted by market capitalisation.Such a “narrowing” of the market is a classic symptom of a lengthy rally — this one has lasted almost uninterrupted since 2009 — that is coming to an end. Investors run out of ideas and instead pour money into a few companies with a positive story to tell. The underperformance of smaller companies is a sign that investors are growing more cautious.The dominance of the Nifty Nine recalls the late 1960s and early 1970s, when a long bull market petered out into a period dominated by a “Nifty Fifty” of companies such as Xerox.“Technically this feels very bearish,” says Jim Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management. “The closest feel is the Nifty Fifty era when much of the market peaked in the late ’60s but the Nifties carried on until 1972.”He said the performance of Amazon, which is revolutionising consumer industries, is particularly distorting, and that of the wider consumer discretionary sector — which was the best performing sector of 2015 — had a “night and day difference” without it.Part of the reason is that profits are in decline, mainly due to the problems falling oil prices have created for energy companies. “We shouldn’t be surprised, because there’s a profits recession, and in profits recessions markets become very Darwinist,” says Richard Bernstein, an investment consultant. That Darwinism means that money flocks to the companies that can show strong revenue growth, such as Netflix — whose profits halved in the third quarter but continues to show subscriber growth — or Amazon. Both saw their share prices more than double, as funds flooded out of companies perceived to be losing out to them and registering disappointing profits, such as Viacom and other mainstream television media groups or Walmart and other retailers.According to Peter Atwater of Financial Insyghts, who analyses market psychology, narrow participation is a symptom of extreme nerves, as last seen during the 1990s internet bubble. Writing before the US Federal Reserve decided to raise rates last month, he pointed out that for 2015, “the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 are up 13.9 per cent while the other 490 are down 5.8 per cent — the largest spread since the late 1990s!”It has also grown more important to pick winners, while there are plenty of losers to choose from. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat says that he had seen Fang-like concentrations in the past, but usually the top and bottom 10 cancel each other out. In 2015, the winners far outperformed the losers.Mr Lee warned that “Fang likely ends with a Dang!” as top movers in one year have a strong tendency to underperform in the next.Valuation trends suggest that the next move is more likely to be downwards. US stocks endured a correction during 2015, dropping more than 10 per cent in August as the Chinese currency revaluation sent tremors through the financial world. But, to quote Mr Paulsen, it was “not a pause that refreshes”.“We did not reset valuations or refresh the profit cycle,” he says. Instead, the S&P 500 had almost regained its highs by the end of October, and US share prices, judged by a multiple of earnings, ended the year as expensive as they began it.Telling indicatorsThe two critical measures that should set the market’s direction are earnings and interest rates. In the third quarter, S&P 500 earnings dropped by 0.8 per cent year on year, and the consensus expectation is that they will be down 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, mostly thanks to energy. Meanwhile, Europe may have hit the bottom of its own profits recession, with earnings for the Stoxx 600 companies falling 5.1 per cent year on year in the third quarter.The renewed fall in the oil price has raised concerns that energy companies will be forced to write down the value of the assets more sharply. Once this damage is done, hopes on Wall Street are high for a rebound from a low base; brokers’ analysts now forecast 7.9 per cent earnings growth for the S&P 500 as a whole in 2016. However, equity strategists and asset allocators, who take a more top-down view, expect these numbers to be marked down considerably as the year continues. Further, earnings tend to move in cycles, and in the US the cycle appears to have turned.As for rates, the Fed has told markets to brace for four more rate rises this year, while the Fed funds futures market is implicitly only pricing in two. All else equal, lower rates would aid share prices. But all else is not equal. Lower rates would imply a sickly US economy, which would hit hopes for earnings.So the great hope that a narrow US market will not tip over into a bear market this year is the US economy. There are few signs of a recession — and without a recession, equity bear markets are usually not severe. Indeed, outside of manufacturing, which is in a global downturn, the economy looks robust. The hope is that services will start to benefit as US consumers at last begin to spend the money they have saved on oil.“Profit margins are not going any higher, and rates aren’t going any lower, and there’s a lot of things used up,” says Mr Paulsen, whose best guess is that another flat year is in the offing. “But it’s hard to see a recession.”Excitement around a few big new-economy stocks was intense during 2015. Netflix and Amazon both more than doubled, while Facebook and the Google companies also enjoyed a great year. Put these stocks (known as the Fangs for their initials) together with Ebay, Priceline, Salesforce, Microsoft and Starbucks, to create a “Nifty Nine” and they beat the rest of the US market by more than 60 per cent.That is worrying. Dominance by a few big companies – or a “narrowing” market – is a symptom of the end of a bull run, as it was in the early 1970s (dominated by the “Nifty Fifty”) or the late 1990s (dominated by the dot-coms). The biggest 50 companies rose last year, but the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell, showing concerns about the economy, while an equal-weighted version of the S&P also fell. Most stocks were down, and interest is restricted to a few.S&P 500 companies saw earnings decline slightly in 2015. This was in large part due to falling revenues at energy companies, driven by falling oil prices. But the strong dollar, which hit overseas earnings, was a factor. So was declining margins, as wages started a slight recovery. Both earnings and margins tend to by cyclical, implying both could have further to fall. Meanwhile, earnings in Europe fell by even more, raising hopes that European companies have reached the bottom of the profits cycle.Valuing stocks is and will always remain an imprecise science. Many Wall Street analysts now make technical criticisms of Prof Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings multiple, which compares to prices to average earnings over the previous decade. But a simple multiple of the previous twelve months’ earnings, which is much noisier and leapt to extremes during the earnings recession of 2009 when investors universally assumed that earnings would recover, gives a similar conclusion. Prices are not extreme, but clearly look expensive by historical standards.The US stock market has vastly outperformed the rest of the world (including both developed and emerging markets) since the 2008 crisis. Lenient monetary policy helped this, as did the strength of the US economy, while the strong dollar amplified the outperformance. But the strong dollar should hit US companies’ overseas earnings, while strengthening the rest of the world, and other central banks are now aggressively easing monetary policy while the US Federal Reserve has just started to raise rates.2015 was dominated by speculation over when the Fed would raise rates. There is every reason to expect this to continue. This chart shows the “dots” issued by the Fed, in which each dot represents the prediction of a different Fed governor for where target rates will be at the end of 2016. The median forecast is for four rises of 0.25 percentage points. The market expectation, derived from the Fed Funds futures market, is for two rises. This gap will have to be reconciled during 2016.This article was updated on January 4 to correct yearly references in the information on the first chart, and on the X axis of the fourth chart"
58;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces?

59;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2015-12-03T19:16:45Z;The fall and rise of technology juggernauts;Most investors in tech companies lose vast sums reacting to short-term jitters, writes Michael Moritz;"The San Francisco-based buyout firm Francisco Partners recently published a delicious analysis relevant to anyone wondering about what the future holds for technology stocks. It is a bulletin in which both pessimists and optimists can find hope and it offers a helpful perspective for those wondering about the current valuations of technology companies.First, the bad news. The 15 technology companies with the largest market capitalisations in 2000 have been decimated — losing about $1.35tn, or roughly 60 per cent, of their combined market value.Only one, Microsoft, has a market capitalisation that is higher than in 2000. One extraordinary aspect of this meltdown is that it did not occur, as some might suspect, in the much ballyhooed dotcom wonder companies of yesteryear. Instead it was a blight that affected most of what were once considered blue-chip technology holdings.In 2000, Nortel sported a market value of $209bn that, like those of its classmates, had been bloated by the enthusiasm of the era; it has since gone bankrupt. While other members of this corporate bracket have avoided that ignominy, their long-term stock charts present bleak pictures. Cisco’s market value has faded from $403bn to $144bn; Intel’s from $288bn to $161bn; and EMC’s from $218bn to $51bn.For the class of 2000, the sharpest property price declines have been in the deteriorating neighbourhoods of systems, hardware and semiconductors. This is because of the continuing decline in the cost of computing, the rise of open-source software, the move to the “cloud” and the emergence of huge datacentres where companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook are designing their own approaches.Now a word from sunnier climes. Fifteen companies that were together worth less than $10bn in 2000 are now among the world’s 50 top technology companies as measured by market capitalisation, with a combined worth of $2.1tn. (Had Amazon been included, rather than being classified as a retailer, this number would have swollen by another $250bn). Apple, which even in 2000 was viewed as little more than a curiosity, has risen in value from $6bn to $659bn. A few themes jump out of this listing: the power of novelty, the shift towards China, the benefits of patience and the virtues of capital efficiency.Several of today’s most valuable technology companies did not even exist in 2000. Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter together have a collective corporate history of only 33 years. Even Google and Salesforce were barely smudges on the horizon in 2000. These companies now have a combined value of about $850bn. Beyond some of the customised systems they operate in their own datacentres, and in Google’s case, some sideline activities such as its Nexus phones and Chrome notebooks, none of these companies sully their hands with anything as taxing as hardware. They have thrived from the artful deployment of software, in particular the “cloud based” variant, and — for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter (and Google’s YouTube service) — organising and collating the contributions of their users.Perched in a clump as the fourth, fifth and sixth most valuable technology companies of the day are Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. This threesome is now worth $409bn — testament not just to how much China has progressed in a decade and a half but a harbinger of the next several decades as the country places increasing emphasis on spawning its own technology.Woe betide the management of any western technology company that underestimates the challenge posed by the vast number of emerging Chinese competitors, fuelled by an ambition and work regimen that is hard to match in Europe and the US.Finally, a note about two other themes that jump out of this listing: patience and profits.Most investors in technology companies squander vast sums by reacting to short-term jitters or global jolts rather than concentrating on the staying power of those emerging enterprises on the right side of history.And for the founders and chief executives of all of the current billion-dollar “unicorns” there is another abiding message. Almost all of today’s technology juggernauts formed before about 2008 required smallish amounts of capital. Google, for example, consumed only $8m before turning profitable. Maybe this means that sooner or later a new class of company will come into vogue — a rare species known as the profitable unicorn.The writer is chairman of Sequoia Capital and co-author with Sir Alex Ferguson of ‘Leading’.

It would be, he promised, a German cloud for German customers, based in Germany and run by Germans.Amazon Web Services, which runs the biggest cloud platform for other companies to do their computing on, had a similar message when it unveiled a data centre of its own in Frankfurt weeks later. Like other so-called “public cloud” companies which have emerged as an alternative for companies that do not wanting to build and run their own data centres, it had operated from a single location in Ireland. Now, European customers would be able to back up their data elsewhere in the region and never see it cross the Atlantic, the company said.Microsoft has given the lie to such arrangements. The message from its announcement on Wednesday of a new, local cloud service, in partnership with Deutsche Telekom’s T-Systems division was: what really matters is not where the data are located, but who controls the information.The service may still be branded as Microsoft’s and be part of the global cloud services it offers to its biggest customers, but anyone who wants to ringfence their local data will have the reassurance that only the German company will have access to it.The arrangement is intended as a bulwark against intrusions that a US company could not otherwise repel. Microsoft is already challenging a subpoena from a New York court to hand over data from one of its servers in Ireland.American tech companies are not even allowed to reveal when they have been ordered to hand over information by the secret FISA court, charged with homeland security. Also, as the Snowden disclosures showed, US spies have sometimes penetrated their systems, further eroding trust in American internet services.The Microsoft-Deutsche Telekom deal taps into deep-seated demand. According to a survey by Bitkom, the German digital trade association, 83 per cent of German companies expect their cloud provider to have its data centres exclusively in the country, with 74 per cent wanting them to be located in EU countries.As with all new legal approaches, we don’t know its watertight until it is challenged in courtOther US tech companies have resorted to different methods to protect their foreign customers’ privacy. They claim that they come up with their own workable results.Since early this year, for instance, IBM has let customers encrypt the data they hold on its mainframe computers and keep the keys themselves, meaning that only they — and not the company — can unscramble the information and make sense of it.Dropbox, a consumer cloud storage company that is moving into the business market, also lets customers bring their own encryption to its service.Scrambling data in this way, however, could limit the usefulness of cloud services, since it is harder for service providers to process when the information consists of unintelligible bits.Instead, Microsoft has turned to a legal rather than a technological solution. By putting the data under the control of Deutsche Telekom, a separate German company, it has tried to take itself out of the loop completely when it comes to accessing German data, even though it is still technically providing the service.One can’t blame Americans for complaining about European hypocrisy, writes Evgeny MorozovRead moreMicrosoft insiders are braced for a court challenge. But they hope that a simple, practical limitation built into their new arrangement will amount to a cast-iron defence: even if a US court orders them to hand over data stored in Germany, they simply will not have the physical ability to comply.“As with all new legal approaches, we don’t know its watertight until it is challenged in court,” says Paul Miller, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Microsoft and T-Systems’ lawyers are very good and say it’s watertight. But we can be sure opposition lawyers will look for all the holes.”The Microsoft gambit could also answer a second European concern about the growing power of US tech companies as cloud and internet services assume a bigger part in business and personal life. The continent’s own, under-developed tech industry has found it hard to compete.The Microsoft-Deutsche Telekom arrangement signals a new detente, dividing the responsibility — and the rewards — between US and German companies. The two would not provide details of their commercial relationship. But it could provide one way for European companies to get a foot in the door.Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin

The outlook topped Wall Street forecasts for $6.55bn.The San Francisco-based company also raised its earnings outlook to range between 70 and 72 cents a share, up from 69 to 71 cents a share previously and in contrast to consensus expectations of 71 cents.The news accompanied second-quarter results that eclipsed Wall Street expectations. Salesforce reported a loss of $852,000 in the three months to the end of July, compared with a loss of $61.1m in the year ago period.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 19 cents a share, eclipsed forecasts by a penny. Sales rose 24 per cent to $1.63bn, also ahead of analyst forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, which have gained nearly 17 per cent so far this year, gained 2.3 per cent to $69.36 in midday trading before settling to close at $69.15.Deere was among the worst performing stocks on the benchmark S&P 500, after the world’s largest maker of agricultural equipment cut its full-year profit outlook and said third-quarter sales fell amid lower demand for agricultural and construction equipment.The Illinois-based company now sees net income at $1.8bn for the year, compared with its previous guidance for $1.9bn. This was shy of analysts’ estimates for $1.93bn.Deere reported third-quarter adjusted profits of $1.53 a share, ahead of expectations for $1.44. Meanwhile, sales fell 20 per cent to $7.6bn. Shares in the company fell 8.1 per cent to close at $83.29.Shares of Ross Stores fell 9.5 per cent to close at $50.00 after the retailer raised its full-year outlook but missed analysts forecasts.The California-based company now sees full-year earnings in the range of $2.40 to $2.45 a share. The lower end of its revised forecast missed analysts’ estimates for $2.45 a share.The company projected that same-store sales, a key industry metric, would be flat to up 1 per cent in the fourth quarter, below forecasts for a 1.7 per cent gain.The news came alongside second-quarter adjusted earnings of 63 cents a share that beat expectations by 1 cent. Sales rose nearly 9 per cent to $2.9bn broadly in line with forecasts.Shares of Hewlett-Packard rose more than 5 per cent to $28.86 in midday trading after the PC and printer manufacturer delivered mixed third-quarter results. Hewlett-Packard settled to close at $27.47.The Palo Alto, California-based company reported an 8 per cent year-on-year drop in third quarter sales to $25.3bn, shy of analysts forecasts. Adjusting for one-time items earnings of 88 cents a share, topped forecasts for 85 cents a share.US stocks declined for the fourth straight day as disappointing manufacturing data out of China raised fresh concerns about the health of the world’s second-largest economy.The S&P 500 slid below the 2,000 level, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite suffered technical corrections.The S&P 500 declined 3.2 per cent to 1,970.89.

62;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2015-07-22T16:59:34Z;Sage and SAP: software shake-up;Two payments companies face a common conundrum in different ways;"One serves predominantly small businesses, the other large corporations. Both UK-based Sage and Germany’s SAP face a common conundrum. Companies such as Salesforce and NetSuite are winning market share by selling subscription-based software, while users increasingly prefer remotely hosted “cloud” applications that require less internal IT support. Both trends are a threat to licence-based software that users run on their own networks.Sage and SAP are adapting to this new world in very different ways. SAP has spent big, acquiring $18bn worth of cloud-related companies since 2011. This has had a predictable impact on cloud revenues; they rose 130 per cent in the first half. But at a price. Adjusted for exchange-rate movements, operating margins fell 2 percentage points to 28 per cent and net profit dropped too — partly because of interest charges on the €10bn of debt taken on to pay for acquisitions.Sage is pursuing an internal transformation, gradually migrating customers to subscription-based products. A trading statement on Wednesday showed more sedate revenue growth; subscription revenue was up 9.7 per cent and overall revenue grew 7.5 per cent. Operating margins were maintained at 28 per cent.Subscription is the more attractive long-term business model, providing steadier and more predictable revenue and more growth opportunities. The superior growth rates and higher share price ratings of cloud-based software groups attest as much. But business transformations on this scale are tricky and entail short-term pain in return for promises of jam tomorrow.Of the two, Sage is in the stronger position. Small business customers are conservative, giving it more time to complete the transition; meanwhile, it can fall back on other self-help measures such as cost cutting to maintain profitability. It is also small enough to be a potential takeover target.There is hope for SAP, though. Adobe’s push into the cloud was painful at first, but its latest results show sales picking up strongly. Its shares have outperformed both SAP and Sage over the past three years.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
63;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Salesforce: tree, meet sky;Subscription seller spends its way to growth;Grow! Grow! Grow! So runs the refrain of the Silicon Valley fight song. Few companies chant like Salesforce, which has increased revenues at 30 per cent annually — without a penny of profit — for four years. The market approves: Salesforce’s enterprise value is $47bn, seven times its sales.A seller of subscriptions for customer service software (among other things), Salesforce growth flows from sales and marketing dollars — $2.7bn last year, just over half of revenues. The problem with this model is that it is hard to see the end of it. If Salesforce were to stop spending eye-popping sums on marketing, its growth rate would be likely to slow, cash flow would fall, and it would start feeling its natural customer attrition rate, which is around 9 per cent a year (by value).Salesforce prefers to focus on other financial metrics, especially non-GAAP operating margins. These rose to 12 per cent in the most recent quarter, from 10 per cent a year earlier. That is encouraging, but once Salesforce’s generous stock-based compensation plans are factored in, operating income drops to almost nothing. Some prefer to look at margins before stock compensation, as it is a non-cash expense and it affects earnings per share anyway, by increasing the diluted share count. Perhaps — but look at that share count: it increased 7 per cent during the past fiscal year. In the past five years, it has risen by a quarter. The company’s obsession with growth clearly extends to its share count.The Salesforce model can keep going as long as growth and confidence are present in good measure. The company has another tailwind, too: its software is replacing older, often outdated, licence-based software. But eventually the easy gains in market share will be taken, and Salesforce will have to compete with other modern products. The company says that if sales growth were to slow, it would focus on improving margins. Such discipline would require an entirely new skill set. The fight is just starting.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
64;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2015-06-10T17:39:58Z;Salesforce shareholders protest vote against Benioff pay deal;Almost half of shareholders vote against $39m package for software group head;Marc Benioff, head of Salesforce.com, has become the latest enterprise software executive to become the target of shareholder unrest over high pay levels, following criticism of long-time rival Larry Ellison at Oracle.Mr Benioff, whose 6.5 per cent stake in the cloud software company is worth $3bn, received a remuneration package of $39.9m last year, making him one of the highest paid executives in the technology sector.While unhappiness with Mr Ellison’s pay package has spilled out in a series of outright rejections from shareholders, the opposition to the Salesforce chief’s pay has been more muted but steadily increasing.Mr Benioff’s remuneration package barely won the backing of a majority of investors in a so-called “say on pay” vote, according to a regulatory filing made late on Tuesday.About 47 per cent of Salesforce’s shareholders voted against the arrangements when it came up for a vote at the company’s annual meeting, which was held last week.That is up from the 24 per cent who voted against executive pay levels last year and 17 per cent the previous year.Mr Benioff, a former top Oracle salesman who co-founded Salesforce at the end of the dotcom boom, has seen the value of his stake rise tenfold since the depths of the financial crisis.The company has benefited from a wave of change that has brought cloud computing to the heart of corporate IT. Reports that it has been the object of preliminary takeover discussions have also helped to boost its stock price — and the value of its CEO’s stake — in recent weeks.Mr Benioff and Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, who made $42.1m, were the only two tech executives on a list of the ten highest paid US chief executives in 2014 calculated by Equilar, the executive pay company.Mr Ellison, who was paid $67.3m last year, has handed over the chief executive title to two lieutenants but remains Oracle’s executive chairman.$3bnValue of Marc Benioff’s 6.5 per cent stake in SalesforceShareholder objection to Mr Ellison’s pay has led to a majority voting against the company’s pay arrangements for three consecutive years. His remuneration package last year was down from $79.6m last year and $96.2m the previous year.Despite the reduction, two of Europe’s largest pension funds, PGGM of the Netherlands and Railpen, the UK’s Railway Pension Trustee Company, protested earlier this year about the company’s “excessive” remuneration and failure to engage more with investors.Besides Mr Benioff, Salesforce’s most highly paid senior executives last year were former head Oracle salesman Keith Block, who was paid $12.5m, and chief financial officer Mark Hawkins, who made $9.9m.Salesforce defended its pay policies in a statement on Wednesday. “We describe our pay practices in significant detail in our proxy statement, including our compensation philosophy and the rationale for those decisions.”

This was ahead of Wall Street estimates for $6.5bn.“Our current outlook puts us on track to reach a $7bn revenue run rate later this year,” said Marc Benioff, chief executive.Salesforce, which has a near $50bn market valuation, was the subject of takeover reports earlier this month.Shares of Lumber Liquidators fell 17 per cent to $21.10 after the flooring company said its chief executive Robert Lynch unexpectedly resigned.The Virginia-based company has come under scrutiny since a 60 Minutes segment earlier this year alleged that some of its laminate flooring supplied from China had excessive levels of formaldehyde — a chemical compound that has been linked to cancer.NetApp was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, falling 10 per cent to $31.77, after the data storage maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter results and issued first-quarter earnings and sales guidance that missed Wall Street estimates.The company also said it would reduce its global workforce by about 4 per cent.Analysts at JPMorgan, Needham & Co and Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded the stock following the results.A rally in oil prices lifted energy stocks with the S&P 500 energy sector rising 0.8 per cent and leading the benchmark index higher.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to a record high at 2,130.82 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 18,285.74. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4 per cent to 5,090.79.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
66;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2015-05-08T12:05:16Z;Salesforce: licence to foam;Such acquisition rumours can only be taken seriously in a market prone to excess;Drop a Mentos Mint into a bottle of coke and a geyser of foam erupts. A similar result comes from combining fast-growing software companies: extreme froth. One example is the recent furore over Salesforce, a $50bn company that sells subscription software. Its shares shot up 10 per cent when unconfirmed acquisition rumours swirled. But such rumours can only be taken seriously in a market prone to excess.Forget, for a moment, everything you know about Salesforce. Consider a faceless entity, NewCo, with $5.4bn in revenue that grew by a third last year and is expected to grow by a fifth this year. NewCo’s sales and marketing costs are on the high side at a little more than half of revenues and it has not turned a profit since the 2011 financial year.On the plus side, selling subscriptions provides plenty of operating cash flow as well as visibility of near-term growth. But NewCo’s attrition rate (the value of contracts that are not renewed) is roughly 10 per cent a year, meaning that it needs to keep up the marketing to maintain growth. The company is also relying on success in new areas, such as analytics, to drive its next phase of growth.Perhaps more concerning is that NewCo hands out generous stock options to retain talent. Its share count rose 7 per cent last year, which would have been dilutive to earnings, had there been any.How much should this business be worth? Today’s market prices put Salesforce’s equity at $48bn, more than 45 times forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Nomura analysts think a takeover could happen at about $64bn. That is just above the enterprise value of BlackRock, which produced net income of $3.2bn last year. For mature tech companies with lots of cash (we will not name names), Salesforce’s growth may look enticing. But it is hardly a value proposition.Froth is exciting, but it leaves a mess.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
67;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2015-05-07T17:50:47Z;As rivals join it in the cloud, Salesforce faces need for reinvention;Founder Marc Benioff must switch from chasing growth to chasing profits;When you have done as much as anyone to build a new technology market from the ground up, what do you do for an encore?That is a question for Marc Benioff, Silicon Valley’s pre-eminent salesman of the past decade and a half. Salesforce.com, the company he founded at the tail-end of the dotcom boom, was the first to convince Wall Street that software-as-a-service, or SaaS, was a business worth backing. Now he needs a second act.A sign of Mr Benioff’s success is the catalogue of tech giants that have been talked about as potential buyers of Salesforce since Bloomberg reported a week ago that the group had been approached about a deal.Top of most Wall Street analysts’ lists have been rival enterprise software companies Oracle and Microsoft, with IBM and SAP also featuring. But it does not stop there. Amazon and Google have also been mentioned.After all, they have built cloud platforms for other companies to run their businesses on, so why not also sell cloud services that sit on top, like Salesforce’s customer management and marketing products?However, the sheer size of any deal — it would probably cost upwards of $60bn, based on the kind of revenue multiples seen in other SaaS deals — makes an acquisition unlikely. A person close to Oracle, the company that could achieve the biggest savings and revenue benefits from absorbing Salesforce, dismisses the idea, and the high price would make it financially challenging for others.All of this has confirmed the enviable position that Mr Benioff has staked out in the cloud — at a time when the old IT order is racing to catch up. But it has also highlighted the challenge he now faces.Salesforce’s financial model has got it this far, but it is reaching the end of the road. To join the ranks of the software giants will require taking the next step: moving on from being a hyper-growth lossmaker to a profit machine with above-average growth prospects.It was Mr Benioff who persuaded Wall Street to turn a blind eye to the losses of SaaS companies such as his. Salesforce keeps its spending on sales and marketing at slightly more than 50 per cent of revenues, fuelling growth but leaving plenty of red ink. True, it did squeeze out profits totalling $240m in the eight years to 2011, but that is dwarfed by the $780m of losses in the past four years.Growth is expected to fall below 30 per cent for the first time this year. That is still enviable for a company with more than $5bn of revenues. But with Microsoft, Oracle and SAP finally getting serious about the cloud and starting to show results from their internal investments, Salesforce has begun to appear in a different light. It is no longer the biggest fish in a small pond. Cloud revenues at Amazon and Microsoft are larger — and growing much faster.As growth moderates, Wall Street will want to see profits. To deliver steady gains in earnings per share, Salesforce will have to find a way to moderate its sky-high sales and marketing costs, while at the same time weaning itself off large stock grants to employees.It will also have to find new things for its own sales force to sell as it reaches for its next annual revenue target of $10bn. Forrester Research warned last month that the pressures of growth are likely to add to strains on its relationship with customers: it said that Salesforce would have to lock them into more — and bigger — contracts to meet its financial targets.Increasing sales efficiency in this way — by channelling more products through its existing sales organisation — will make the company look increasingly like Oracle, the company where Mr Benioff cut his teeth, and whose former top salesman, Keith Block, he recently hired.In another sign of how different the next phase of growth will be, Mr Benioff forged a partnership last year with Microsoft, a company that he had previously never hesitated to ridicule as the symbol of a dying software industry. Like Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s recently installed CEO, he now seems ready to look past the industry’s old battle lines.It is still a stretch to see this as the prelude to full-scale consolidation as the software world realigns around the cloud. But it does show that, for one of the industry’s most successful mavericks, the pressure to join the IT establishment is forcing an intriguing reinvention.richard.waters@ft.com
68;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2015-03-19T14:16:45Z;Public investors seek private tech deals;Fidelity and BlackRock are backing fundraising rounds but valuations remain a murky area;"Some unusual names have been appearing on the investor lists of up-and-coming private technology companies.Take a spate of investments made over the past week or so in companies that are in (or very close to joining) the $1bn valuation club— a group whose exclusivity has faded somewhat as its ranks have swollen.Among the investors lining up in recent days have been: Wellington Management, a mutual funds group that took a lead in new financing rounds for business intelligence company Birst and Zuora, the billings software firm; the family investment office of Swiss businessman Ernesto Bertarelli, which led an investment in data centre technology company SimpliVity; and business rivals Salesforce.com and Microsoft, which buried their differences to join a funding round for analytics company InsideSales.Investors that normally limit themselves to the public stock markets have been among the most prominent newcomers to this game. Wellington, along with four other US funds groups — T Rowe Price, Fidelity, BlackRock and Janus Capital — participated in venture capital rounds that raised $4.7bn last year, according to CB Insights. That was nearly twice as much as the previous three years of tech funding rounds combined.These conventional funds groups have had little choice. In the US, the Jobs Act made it easier for companies to stay private for longer. And if Silicon Valley will not come to Wall Street, then Wall Street has to come to Silicon Valley.An optimistic interpretation of this trend is that it is good for all concerned. Public investors get in on the ground floor of the next Googles or Facebooks, while the private companies get access to large amounts of capital and a gentle introduction to the rigours that will eventually come from a full initial public offering.For example, Scott Dietzen, chief executive of Pure Storage, which has raised nearly $500m privately, says his mutual fund investors are educating him about what life will be like when he has to run a public company. Brad Peters, founder of Birst, says his company now holds public company-style quarterly earnings calls with investors. And Tien Tzuo, boss of Zuora — who calls his latest fundraising “a private IPO” — says that having public market investors around forces a discipline that will stand him in good stead when he finally takes the plunge.What is not clear yet, however, is how well the private markets will handle the quasi-public responsibilities they are taking on as they channel much larger amounts of money to businesses that could just as easily do an IPO.Is a company really worth $1bn if the investors at that valuation have put a floor under their holdings?Valuation is one very murky area. According to Mr Tzuo, public investors have been pushing for lower valuations to leave room for some upside — much as they would in a traditional IPO. But that push is not apparent from the soaring valuations being achieved in the late-stage private market.Some tech IPOs have even been made at substantial discounts to private valuations, and companies such as Box and Hortonworks still trade below their earlier valuations in private fundraisings.Investors in the private markets can often insulate themselves from losses in situations such as these by insisting on downside protection — which means they are handed more shares as compensation. But that makes a mockery of the stated valuations. Is a company really worth $1bn if the investors at that valuation have put a floor under their holdings? It also creates confusion for would-be employees who are offered stock awards to join the company — or, indeed, anyone else trying to work out what an up-and-coming company is really worth.A second question is what happens when investment is channelled into private venues where the disciplines of the public markets are absent. Venture capitalist Bill Gurley has warned, loudly, of the heightened risks from backing companies that have not developed the full financial controls of public corporations.There may also be deeper distortions to the capital markets. Access to private deals is highly restricted: only a handful of big investors have the influence to get in on the most sought-after financing. Most investors will be left in the cold, forcing them into lower-quality deals.This runs counter to the principles on which public capital markets operate. But, in the absence of a more active IPO market, it is the reality many tech investors must face.richard.waters@ft.com"

Social media companies like average revenue per user; Google likes cost-per-click; and so on. The metrics preferred by software-as-a-service or “cloud” companies — which provide access to applications over the internet — are revealing.Salesforce and Workday, for example, do not look great on standard accounting measures. The companies reported GAAP losses of 5 per cent of revenues and 30 per cent of revenues, respectively, last year. Marketing costs are high: 51 per cent of sales at Salesforce, 40 per cent at Workday. Thus the SaaS-specific metric bandied about by analysts: net income ex-marketing. The idea is that because SaaS companies sell long-lived subscriptions, marketing costs will drop while revenue keeps coming. This depends, of course, on clients sticking with their subscriptions — low “churn”, in the jargon.SaaS companies are reluctant to talk about churn. At Salesforce, attrition is between 9 per cent and 10 per cent a year (measured in dollar value of contracts lost). Workday does not disclose attrition, but says renewals were less than 10 per cent of billings in the last quarter. (This number is low because Workday is growing fast and its average contract length is four years.) Could these companies withstand a cut in marketing? Hard to say given the limited evidence. More robust churn disclosures would help.Other SaaS metrics are more helpful though. Unearned revenue (cash paid by customers on contracts not yet fulfilled) shows revenue in the near future. Total billings indicate growth rates a bit further down the road. A Nomura analysis shows prior year billings at Workday tracks almost perfectly with current sales growth.Paying up for unprofitable companies — as investors in Workday and Salesforce do — is not a bet on a year of growth, though. It is about the next five or 10 years. Watch the churn.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Analysts had expected full-year sales at the high end of its earlier guidance.The outlook, which accompanied the company’s fourth-quarter results, sent its shares 12 per cent higher, adding roughly $4.7bn to the company’s market valuation.In the three months to the end of January, sales climbed 26 per cent to $1.4bn, in line with consensus expectations. The company’s net loss narrowed by 44 per cent to $66m, or 10 cents a share.Billings at the end of the quarter jumped by nearly a third from a year earlier to $3.3bn as Salesforce.com ventured into new product segments, including managing marketing campaigns, analysing data and controlling social network activity.“Propelled by replacement and expansion cycles across business-to-business and business-to-consumer implementations, we expect the [customer relationship management] market to offer the greatest incremental revenue growth opportunity for software vendors over at least the next three to five years,” said Philip Winslow, an analyst with Credit Suisse.Rival vendors rose following the report. Adobe Systems advanced 1 per cent to $78.96 and NetSuite rose 1 per cent to $100.48.Shares of Mobileye, the Israeli technology company whose investment story centres around self-driving cars and the automated vehicle, climbed as much as 6 per cent after its fourth-quarter results eclipsed Wall Street expectations.The company said sales in the final quarter of 2014 advanced 26 per cent from a year earlier to $39.7m.Profits slipped 82 per cent from the prior year to $2.4m, or 1 cent a share. Adjusting for certain items, Mobileye said it earned 6 cents a share, a penny ahead of forecasts. By the close of New York trading, Mobileye shares had pared back gains to 1 per cent at $35.79.SeaWorld shares slid 6 per cent to $19.17 after the US theme park operator’s loss widened in the final three months of 2014 as attendance continued to slip in the wake of the negative publicity generated by the 2013 documentary Blackfish.Sales in the three months to the end of December fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $265m. The company’s loss nearly doubled from a year earlier to $25.4m, or 29 cents a share, in the period.Seaworld, which was floated in New York by private equity group Blackstone in April 2013, said: “The decrease in total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily driven by the decline in attendance.”Overall, US equity markets hovered near record highs as economic data showed steady core inflation and a better than expected rise in durable goods orders in January.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2,110.74 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 18,214.42. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 4,987.89.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

Addressing the same panel, Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, agreed a consensus was important.Vittorio Colao, chief executive of Vodafone, said it was vital to “re-establish a positive trust environment” between technology companies, governments, “plumbers” such as Vodafone and customers.But in an earlier session on the issue of trust in technology, there was little consensus between executives from Yahoo, the US technology group, US cable company Liberty Global and cloud computing company Salesforce.com about how to get the balance right.Michael Fries, chief executive of Liberty, said there was “a disconnect” between data privacy and the issue of legal interception of data by governments. While all the executives favoured increased transparency about how customers’ data were used, Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, agreed with Günther Oettinger, EU digital commissioner, who proposed a “public-private partnership” between countries and industry to reach a common understanding on data legislation.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo chief executive, pointed out that since the Paris attacks, public opinion had swung back towards a desire for security and away from privacy concerns.She said she preferred a market solution in which customers owned their own data and only allowed companies and applications they trusted to use the information.Tim Berners-Lee, the web pioneer who spoke in the same session, said he was championing the idea that users would favour companies and applications that were “beneficent”.Separately, Mr Schmidt said the spread of smartphones and dedicated applications was making it hard to judge which companies would dominate the market in future. The Google chairman, who has recently had to defend the search group against European calls for it to be broken up, said: “You now see so many strong technology platforms coming and you’re seeing a future reordering of dominance or leaders because of the rise of the app on the smartphone. All bets are off as to what the smartphone app infrastructure will look like.”

This has not stopped Box, which provides file-sharing services for enterprises. It is taking a second shot at a public listing (after a previous effort last spring), despite nearly $500m in cumulative losses and no profits in sight.In many ways, Box is typical of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies: It spends heavily on sales and marketing to secure contracts that are lossmaking at first (because of the sales costs) but become profitable after several years (one hopes). At Box, sales and marketing costs exceeded revenues in all three of the last fiscal years. But customers acquired five years ago are profitable. Without any sales and marketing costs, Box would have an operating margin of 20 per cent, on revenues of $154m in the nine months to October. Another faint silver lining is that Box’s sales efficiency (the ratio of S&M expenses to billings) has improved over the past three years.The argument for profitability in SaaS is that customers, once acquired, tend to stay. Direct comparisons for Box are hard to find: competitors are either unlisted (Dropbox, ShareFile) or small pieces of much bigger businesses (Google Drive, Microsoft SharePoint). Comparisons with other SaaS companies do not bode well though. Salesforce and NetSuite are both unprofitable even though they are more than 15 years old. The “land grab” lasts a rather long time.The IPO price range seems to reflect these concerns. With an initial range of $11-13, the company seems likely to price below its most recent private valuation round of $20. Its enterprise value at the middle of the range is six times sales; less than Workday or NetSuite. Regardless of when, or whether, Box becomes profitable, in the near term it is certain to consume a lot more cash. It burnt through $92m last year. The IPO proceeds will last less than two years at the current rate. Box is not the package for everyone.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

This result was broadly in line with analysts’ expectations for about €2.15bn.The stock rose 4.6 per cent to €57.05 but remains some 7 per cent below its level of a year ago.SAP’s customers are increasingly demanding to rent software from the cloud rather than having it installed on their own machines.For investors, this changes how software companies book revenue. Instead of receiving the bulk of it upfront, SAP increasingly relies on rental payments from customers for cloud software which are more spread out.This is disrupting the business software industry, as it requires new sales and support operations and investments in new data centres. It also opens the door to greater competition from cloud-based rivals such as Salesforce.com.SAP has responded by embarking on an acquisition spree, including the $8.3bn takeover of Concur, a travel expenses software company, which it completed in December.Luca Mucic, chief financial officer, said that “with the powerful shift to the cloud and our growing support revenues we are building a larger, more predictable business over the long term”.Thomas Becker at Commerzbank told clients that “it seems that SAP was able to keep the balance between cloud growth and a stable software/support business”.He added: “We note that SAP was able to generate solid software revenue despite ongoing macro-challenges and the transition to the cloud.”Traditional sales of on-premises SAP software declined 3 per cent in 2014 but cloud subscriptions and support revenue increased 45 per cent to €1.1bn, exceeding its target of between €1.04bn and €1.07bn. Operating profit rose 3 per cent to €5.64bn.The company unsettled investors in October when it lowered its full year 2014 operating profit forecast to between €5.6bn and €5.8bn, compared to the 2013 total of €5.5bn.Investors expect the company to unveil new long-term sales targets when it reports full-year results on January 20.
74;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2014-12-11T16:38:53Z;Strong dollar hits US corporate profits;Euro weakness had the biggest impact, followed by yen and rouble;A strengthening dollar is proving a costly headache to companies across the US and Europe.The rising greenback shaved $8bn off North American and European third-quarter sales, with more than 275 companies warning of negative foreign exchange impacts in the period, data from currency consultancy FiREapps shows.The dollar, which climbed nearly 8 per cent against the euro and yen in the quarter to September 30, has proved an added hitch for companies dependent on foreign sales, particularly as economic growth in Europe and Asia disappoints.“The top and bottom line are heavily impacted by foreign exchange,” said Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FiREapps. “This problem of currency exposure is not just 220 currency pairs — the dollar between each country, etc — but rather to a much higher power as companies move currencies between different countries.”The total currency effect on revenues increased 196 per cent from a quarter earlier, the report found, as FX volatility rose. FiREapps, which analysed the earnings calls of 1,200 publicly traded companies with at least 15 per cent of revenues derived from a foreign market, says that trend will probably continue.US companies that quantified the foreign exchange impact on profits said earnings were on average reduced by 3 cents a share due to currency swings.Diverging monetary policy in Europe and the US has driven a wedge between one of the most active currency pairs, with strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasting the euro to weaken by another 10 cents against the dollar by the end of 2016.“Fundamental issues including the rollback of stimulus in the US and eventually rising US interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe, devaluation in Japan, falling oil prices and geopolitical turmoil will continue to drive turbulence in the currency markets well into 2015,” Mr Koester says.More than two-fifths of S&P 500 sales were generated abroad in 2013, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows, presenting a challenge to a vast majority of the index’s constituents.The euro was most often mentioned as a culprit in the 846 US corporate earnings calls analysed by FiREapps, followed, in order, by the yen, rouble, Brazilian real and Venezuelan bolívar.Executives with Hewlett-Packard, Campbell Soup and Salesforce warned recently that currency headwinds would weigh on results, while Philip Morris International chief executive André Calantzopoulos said his company had “been hammered by currency this year to a much higher degree than we possibly could have anticipated”.General Motors called the rouble “a headwind for us, no question”, with the Turkish lira and UK pound also key to the company’s European results.“The rouble has a big impact and then you have to see how much are we able to price against it. But then of course you see a corresponding volume impact,” Michael Lohscheller, chief financial officer of GM’s Opel Group, said last week at a conference.Strategists on Wall Street note a stronger dollar and weaker pricing power could curtail profit gains, with S&P 500 year-on-year earnings growth expectations currently sitting at 9.3 per cent. That, in turn, could hit stock performance.“Given the unanimous global optimism on US financial and macro leadership which follows massive US outperformance, US EPS disappointment would be very damaging for risk appetite,” said Michael Hartnett, a strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
75;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2014-11-17T12:46:14Z;Radical change that starts with small steps at big companies;Only ‘top-down leaders’ are comfortable enough to liberate people to develop new ideas;"Gary Hamel still talks and writes with the passion of a revolutionary. In a recent blogpost, the management writer played with his own theory of the “core competencies” of companies, conceived with the late CK Prahalad, by pointing out their core incompetencies of inertia, incrementalism and insipidity.Last week, I listened to him telling the Global Peter Drucker Forum that the corporate bureaucracy plaguing companies such as Delta Air Lines, Tesco, Samsung and Salesforce.com must be “put to death”. Managers need to shed vestigial beliefs handed down by “long-dead CEOs, ego-polishing consultants” and dry scholars, he said.Stirring stuff. But while there is plenty of idealism on tap at gatherings of management thinkers, it increasingly comes with a refreshing chaser of realism.It is no disrespect to idealists and firebrands to point out that an “Arab spring” of populist management reform is unlikely. At large companies, incremental change may be one of the best ways to achieve a radical transformation. Speaking in Vienna, birthplace of management thinker Peter Drucker, Professor Hamel said change should not come only from small greenfield start-ups; their older, larger “brownfield” cousins also need to find a new way of managing.One prerequisite, as I said in my last column, is that companies should stop appointing “default managers”, who are content merely to fit in with the old framework. “Organisations are hiring great people and turning them into average performers – and they’re doing it very, very fast,” warned Bill Fischer of IMD business school. Another is to stop assuming that change in corporate structure – say, from publicly listed companies, to employee ownership – will automatically put an end to mismanagement or reignite innovation. It is more important to ensure there is no dominant monoculture of one corporate form.“Brownfield” corporate leaders also need to see, and even experience, new models of organisations similar to their own that are successfully changing management systems. However, favourite examples of flat-hierarchy or super-transparent companies such as Ricardo Semler’s Semco, the Brazilian engineering group, WL Gore, US manufacturer of Gore-Tex fabric, or Morning Star, the self-managing Californian tomato processor, are in danger of overuse.In any case, it is hard to convince a conventional manager that peer-based pay and mutual “understandings” between colleagues, which replace conventional compensation policies and contracts at Morning Star, could transfer to a traditional organisation.Examples cited in Vienna could expand the canon of management innovation a little. Professor Fischer has been studying DSM, a Dutch coalminer that has turned itself into a life sciences and materials science group. It has overcome the blight of centralisation that often afflicts innovation projects by running them in parallel – what it calls a “bowling alley” approach – on a platform that allows innovators a greater say in how innovation as a whole is pursued. Haier of China, already something of a pioneer in the use of self-organising units that compete internally for opportunities, has spun off its logistics arm – “de-Haierising” itself, in Prof Fischer’s words – so it can offer its China-wide expertise to competitors.The next step must be to take such cases out of the classroom and present the practical advantages to interested companies. Steve Denning, the veteran management writer, is launching a “learning consortium” of such organisations. Members arrange site visits to highlight to the others the practical benefits and risks of applying emerging management practices.Contradictions will have to be overcome: Salesforce, which Prof Hamel castigates as a bureaucratic monster, is an exemplar of “agile” management for Mr Denning. Some paradoxes must be embraced: Prof Fischer points out, for instance, that only “self-assured, courageous, top-down leaders” will be comfortable enough to liberate people to develop new ideas and change management practice. These are the same leaders that sometimes balk at abandoning the power they have built up.But by opening up and testing new ideas from across their companies and beyond, far-sighted leaders could achieve a more radical transformation than they ever anticipated – even if it starts with small steps.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill——————————————-Letter in response to this column:Digitally savvy CEOs who are striving to keep bureaucracy at bay / From Gary Hamel"
76;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2014-07-07T14:04:31Z;Salesforce: mind the gap;Software company generates lots of cash, but not all cash is created equal;Yes, but look at the cash. That is the response from Salesforce.com bulls when some spoilsport notes that the software-as-a-service company makes no net profit. And indeed, in the past 12 months, the company had a net loss of $260m, and free cash flow (cash from operations less capital spending) of $760m – a $1bn gap.A happy feature of the Salesforce model is that the company gets paid largely in advance, when a contract is signed, while revenues and profits are recognised over the life of the contract. As long as the company is signing up new customers, cash outruns accounting profits.True, but not the whole story. Once the cash from new contracts is netted against the commissions paid to Salesforce’s sales force, the cash impact is $465m – less than half of the gap. A larger contributor to the gap, at $519m, is the fact that while employee compensation paid in stock is expensed on the income statement, there is no cash impact.The spoilsport is quick to point out that all those stock options have a real economic cost. The company is taking equity from its shareholders and giving it to its workers. So the cash benefit is an illusion. Not so, comes back the bull: the stock options are reflected in an increasing share count (Saleforce’s diluted shares grow at about 5 per cent a year). So if we are valuing the company on a per-share basis, treating stock compensation as a real expense would be double-counting. But here is the rub: if what we care about is cash, and we measure it on a per-share basis, we see something unsettling. Free cash flow per share went down in 2013, and over a longer period, it is growing more slowly than revenues.Salesforce is managing to finance its rapid expansion internally. That is admirable. Whether it is increasing profits – even in cash terms – is less clear. So yes, look at the cash. Carefully.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
77;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2014-07-07T10:35:22Z;Beware what wearable technology tells the market about CEO health;Jamie Dimon’s curable cancer disclosure was textbook but gadgets can make transparency problematic;"While waiting in a big Manhattan hospital about 15 years ago, I glimpsed the chairman of one of the world’s biggest banks in a consulting room. I never found out why he was there. If he was ill, his employer never said and the man is now enjoying a long and apparently healthy retirement.But the statement by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, that he has curable throat cancer reminded me how companies have improved disclosure of their leaders’ physical health since.One pioneer of honesty as the best policy was Warren Buffett. In early 2000 Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company he heads, dismissed market-moving rumours that Mr Buffett was in hospital in a critical condition. When the billionaire did go in for treatment later that year, to have benign polyps removed from his colon, he had to disclose more. Two years ago, revealing he had prostate cancer, Mr Buffett was positively bumptious, describing his condition as “not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way”.Mr Dimon modelled his statement on that declaration and Mr Buffett was on hand to wish the banker well and praise his transparency.Since at least 2009, when Steve Jobs and Apple equivocated publicly about the reasons for his leave of absence, investors and corporate governance experts have agreed with Mr Buffett that when “it’s a material fact . . . you get it out fast and you get it out accurately and if there is any big change [then] you get that out there subsequently”.The demand for openness can only increase. People such as Mr Buffett and Rupert Murdoch (who was similarly frank about his prostate cancer in 2000) are at the vanguard of a generation of older business leaders, some of whom will hold executive power well into their 80s.Even after their executive careers, veterans go on to serve on boards, manage other people’s money, and advise on critical areas of public policy and private enterprise. Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman, was in the running to be Barack Obama’s first Treasury secretary at the age of 81, at which point, according to his biography, he was still working “as though he was a 30-year-old”.The political world remains a last bastion of secrecy. Cover-ups shielded the ailing John Kennedy and cancer-stricken François Mitterrand from rumour. But had Mr Volcker taken the job, markets would rightly have wanted to know about the octogenarian’s physical health.The type of message Mr Dimon issued to staff and investors is, however, starting to look old-fashioned in a world of digital and shareable health and fitness data.At the Davos World Economic Forum this year, Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, recounted how fellow technology entrepreneur Michael Dell had called him the week before to ask if he was feeling all right. Online data that Mr Benioff and Mr Dell were sharing from their Fitbit fitness monitors had alerted the computer magnate that his friend was not working out.The desire to track such data is unstoppable. Jawbone, a Fitbit rival, was distributing its monitors to Davos delegates this year in return for the right to analyse their collective fitness during the forum. (It discovered, unremarkably, that Davos man and woman walk and sleep less than non-Davos users.) I am still compulsively logging step and sleep data via my wristband, but I am wary of sharing them. Many users, including lots of driven technology executives, are not.As wearable health monitors become more sophisticated, some companies, rather than sending their CEO to a public hospital for a check-up twice a year, may choose to monitor them remotely. What is good enough for high-performance teams of athletes could come to be seen as essential for executives looking for an edge over rivals.Shared data will then become tradeable insider information, as Mr Benioff pointed out. The answer to Mr Dell’s query was that Mr Benioff had had a cold and decided to skip his workout. But imagine if, instead, the interruption to his regime had signalled to his network of high-powered friends and investors that he had suffered a stroke.Mr Dimon’s openness is laudable. Transparency must be the norm for material problems. But as more managers track their every breath or heartbeat, they will eventually have to draw a line about how much they tell the world – or even their own peers – about how great they feel.andrew.hill@ft.com

78;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2014-06-30T22:29:09Z;Salesforce.com at the crossroads;;Salesforce.com, the company that did more than any other to invent the software-as-a-service industry, is reaching a turning point.After years of rapid growth, it has a pressing need for the more evolved infrastructure, processes and rounded management team of the large company it has become. And with growth starting to slow, it is coming closer to a seminal moment: when investors will start expecting it to report real profits, and not just on a pro-forma basis. The appointment of a new chief financial officer on Monday is the latest sign that is preparing for the changes.Mark Hawkins, CFO of Autodesk for the last five years, made it clear that he thinks changes will be needed as Salesforce looks beyond the $5bn in revenues expected for this year. As a veteran of Dell and Hewlett-Packard at a time when those companies went through significant growth, he made much of his experience during an interview on Monday.“I am not new to scaling,” he said. “What works at $500m doesn’t work at $5bn – and what works at $5bn doesn’t work at $10bn.”Mr Hawkins, 55, replaces Graham Smith, 54, who announced his retirement earlier this year. It’s a smooth transition, but hard to escape the conclusion that this is the latest step in assembling a management team with more big-company experience to back up CEO Marc Benioff.Keith Block, a former head of Oracle in North America, was brought in last year to head sales. As one person familiar with Salesforce’s internal workings puts it: when a company gets to be this size, the CEO can no longer double as its salesman-in-chief – something that Mr Benioff has done admirably in his company’s first 15 years.Harder to handicap is what Mr Hawkins’ arrival means for the company’s financial strategy.Salesforce has thrived on the “jam tomorrow rather than jam today” principle: that it could deliver bottom-line profits at any time but there’s more value to be had from investing for rapid growth. Mr Hawkins wasn’t giving anything away on Monday, pledging “continuity” with the existing approach.“It’s difficult to grow fast and expand margins,” said Mr Smith, while claiming that the company has a “clear line of sight to [revenues of] $10bn” based on the markets it is already in.Some investors, however, have started to ask when this will translate into profits. And according to a person familiar with the board’s thinking, this is also a question that has been on the minds of the company’s directors.Lower stock-based compensation expenses in the coming years will help, said Mr Smith. But with acquisitions expected to play a big part in its continued expansion, he also warned that amortisation costs from deals could delay the move into profit under formal US accounting rules.“I would certainly be hopeful that by the time we get to $10bn we’ll be GAAP profitable,” he concluded.Whether investors will be prepared to wait that long is starting to loom as one of the big questions facing the company.

He said a chief information security officer at a large bank told Skyhigh that his highly regulated workforce only used 42 applications, but Skyhigh had found more than 1,000 in use.Cloud computing came under scrutiny after Edward Snowden, a former US intelligence contractor, revealed the US National Security Agency had been tapping into services provided by big internet companies. US technology groups that offer cloud services, including Cisco, say last year’s revelations damaged the growth of the sector.But Mr Gupta said most potential customers of cloud providers, which include investors Salesforce.com, had other worries.As online threats race up national security agendas and governments look at ways of protecting their national infrastructures a cyber arms race is causing concern to the developed world“In general, [in the US] they are more concerned about insider threats, hackers and third-party nation-states than the US government looking into their bank accounts, the NSA looking into their affairs,” he said.In Europe, companies were also worried about the potential fines they could face if Brussels passed a more comprehensive data privacy act, he said.Asheem Chandna, a partner at Greylock, said venture capitalists were becoming more interested in cyber security as boards woke up to the potential risks their company could face from cyber criminals. Early stage funding for the sector soared by almost 60 per cent last year to $244m worldwide, according to data from PrivCo, the research firm.“There’s a strong investment climate right now for cyber security companies. Security has always been a top priority, but at this point in time, particularly for large companies, the security budget is growing even if the IT budget is flat or declining,” he said. “I think it is driven by an increasing sophistication of attacks, targeted attacks and cloud and mobility further complicating the situation.”Mr Chandna pointed to the resignation of Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, as a seminal moment for executives. Mr Steinhafel stepped down following a security breach at the US retailer, reflecting how companies must be better prepared for the risks and consequences of cyber attacks.

Despite the economic wobbles in Argentina and emerging markets, the world economy feels more stable than for some years. But the Davos elite has a new cause for worry – that rapid advances in automation and artificial intelligence may take their jobs away.Leaders of Silicon Valley technology companies formed the most optimistic faction in Davos. Marc Benioff, chief executive of the cloud computing company Salesforce.com, evangelised about how the rise of mobile smartphones and sensing devices could transform entire industries. “The technology we have been given is unbelievable,” he said.It has also renewed fears about the impact of technology on employment. When computers are capable of advanced-pattern recognition and beat humans at chess; when cars drive themselves and robots perform intricate tasks, what jobs will be left? Will machines take over work, causing a blight of unemployment among the university educated?Growth in trade and changes in technology over the past three decades have damaged employment in advanced economies. As low-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services have been automated, or moved to lower-wage economies, manual and clerical workers in wealthier nations have struggled.The beneficiaries are the world’s consumers, who buy goods and services more cheaply, and the managers and professionals whose jobs have so far been secure. Entrepreneurs and the “one per cent” have gained most from the rise of the highly unequal labour market. Now, the chill wind of automation may blow on the peaks.Some tasks previously carried out by professionals – such as scanning documents for relevant information – have been turned over to software programs. Pessimists argue that services such as consultancy, accounting and the law, in which professionals analyse information, are broadly vulnerable to automation.Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google – a company that is working on emerging technologies such as self-driving cars and robots – is worried. “The race is between computers and people and the people need to win …In this fight, it is very important that we find the things that humans are really good at,” he said.If so, policy makers have hardly begun to adjust to the implications for society. In Davos, Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, called for a new policy response. “We don’t yet have the Gladstone, the Teddy Roosevelt or the Bismarck of the technology era,” he said.It is not time to panic. First, the world has lived – and economies have prospered – through similar changes in the past. As Mr Summers noted, fortunes accrued to tycoons such as Andrew Carnegie and John D Rockefeller in the late 19th century phase of globalisation and technological advance, but the benefits later spread.Second, humans have a remark­able ability to adapt to technology. The race against automation pushes them to improve education and to create new jobs requiring human interaction, and the ability to innovate. In the late 20th century the educational emphasis was on science and technology; in the 21st, it may turn to a combination of technical and creative skills.Third, a reduction in the amount of work done by humans need not be a bad thing. Economists have predicted an age of leisure before; in practice, many people work longer hours than a generation ago thanks to instant communications and globalisation. A greater sense of balance would be welcome.If automation does eliminate higher-level jobs – still a big if – societies will have to adapt. It would mean thinking in new ways about how to distribute the benefits of technological advance, as well as the hours that humans spend at work. The nations that get the equation right will be the wealthiest and the most stable.——————————————-Letter in response to this editorial:Let’s not be Luddites on automation / From Mr Malcolm Harker"
81;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-12-20T18:17:48Z;Oracle to buy Responsys for $1.5bn;;Oracle has announced an agreement to pay $1.5bn in cash for marketing technology company Responsys, in its latest bid to become a more substantial force in the fast-growing cloud software business.Shares in Oracle and SAP, the leading suppliers of traditional business software applications, have underperformed this year at concerns that they are losing out to new software-as-a-service companies like Salesforce.com and Workday, leading to a round of recent acquisitions.Oracle said this week that its bookings from selling cloud services had risen 35 per cent in its latest quarter and would be one of its important sources of growth in 2014.The Responsys purchase also reflects rapid consolidation in online marketing software, as some of the biggest software companies race to add new technologies that support their customers’ social media and mobile marketing campaigns. Other deals this year have included Salesforce’s $2.5bn purchase of ExactTarget and Adobe’s $600m acquisition of French-based Neolane.Shares in Marketo, another cloud marketing firm that went public this year, jumped 9 per cent after the Oracle deal was announced on Friday, valuing the company at $1.4bn, as Wall Street anticipated more consolidation.Responsys automates marketing efforts for companies that sell direct to consumers, with most of its revenues coming from email campaigns. The field has become one of the most competitive in the field of software-as-a-service.Rob Brosnan, an analyst at Forrester Research, said that Responsys could face pricing pressure in the email marketing business in future. However, he said the deal would add an important element to Oracle’s existing “capable but otherwise moribund” marketing technologies.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive, has earned a reputation for avoiding high-priced deals during a decade in which he has been the software industry’s most active acquirer. By contrast, the $27-a-share in cash he has agreed to pay for Responsys represents a relatively large premium of 38 per cent to the company’s closing share price the day before.That is roughly double the premium that Oracle paid in its other big cloud software purchases, such as the $1.5bn acquisition of RightNow, a call-centre automation company bought in 2011, and the $1.9bn purchase of human resources company Taleo in 2012.Shares in Responsys had already more than tripled this year before news of the Oracle deal broke, echoing a broader rally that has turned software-as-a-service companies into some of the most highly valued tech companies on Wall Street. The deal valued Responsys at seven and a half times its expected revenues this year, below the 10-12 times revenue at which many SaaS companies are trading.
82;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-12-10T11:39:24Z;Corporate social networking takes advantage of captive audience;;From taste tests on a new burger to making the sprawling arms of the European Commission work together, organisations are using internal social networks to boost productivity, flatten management structures and monitor who makes the real decisions.San Francisco-based companies such as Yammer, acquired by Microsoft for $1.2bn last year, and Jive, as well as Salesforce.com’s Chatter service, are connecting up employees around the world while allowing managers to watch who is talking to whom and what the conversations are about.The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that companies could save $900bn to $1.3tn each year by using social technologies. Up to 80 per cent of the value of social media may not have yet been captured as people focus on targeted marketing on consumer networks such as Facebook and Twitter, rather than the transformative data that can be gleaned from employees using networks at work, according to Deloitte.Adam Pisoni, co-founder and chief technology officer at Yammer, said corporate social networks would lead to a “fundamental rewiring of companies” to look more like networks.“The world has formed a giant network and companies are struggling to keep up because they have remained rigid hierarchies,” he said. “While the way we share and interact has been revolutionised in our personal lives, companies have not changed since we designed them a hundred years ago for an industrial revolution.”Red Robin, the US fast-food chain, used to take 18 months to create a burger, waiting for sales figures to come in from small trials, he said. But by putting the servers in a Yammer group with the people who developed the burger, they could quickly share customer responses in the restaurant, cutting the gestation period to four weeks.Mike Grafham, head of customer success at Yammer, said even the European Commission, the “ultimate bureaucratic institution”, had embraced internal social networking. “Something like 100 people need to be involved in a conversation on fish farming or the common agricultural policy. This is a fantastic mechanism to finding people that have the knowledge.”Maria Podlasek-Ziegler, the commission’s directorate general for education and culture, was so excited about building networks across the 38,000-strong organisation, she wrote a blog post comparing using Yammer to falling in love.Westfield, the shopping centre company, uses Yammer to plan its annual X Factor live tour around Australia, making employees watch in real time how the centre planned the event and challenged them to improve it at their site. During the London 2012 Olympics, Gatwick airport introduced Yammer to make sure everyone from the chief executive to the security staff knew how the airport was operating in real time.Nathan Rawlins, vice-president of productivity at Jive, said companies see an average of a 15 per cent increase in productivity when using his service.“A group in the UK may be trying to solve the same problem as a group in Mexico – bringing the conversation into a social network means it can be shared and discovered and people are less likely to reinvent the wheel,” he said, adding problems could get solved in other time zones while staff were sleeping. Some of the most useful interactions can be tapping the knowledge from people’s past jobs, he said.While executives get excited about having a bird’s-eye view of the company, some employees are reluctant to join such services, preferring email or even talking face-to-face – and worrying about the lack of privacy.To encourage them on to the network, Jive gives out ‘reputation points’.“There is very, very deep gamification which can give people the incentives for very specific activities you want them to perform,” he said. “It is amazing how people are driven by this capability.”Salesforce.com estimates use of its Chatter service has reduced email volume by a third, as it integrates everything from approval buttons to machines on the factory floor into the social network.Peter Coffee, vice-president of platform research at Chatter, said General Electric was using the service to cut the time spent responding to machine errors. “A machine doesn’t need to turn on a red light, it just updates the right conversation,” he said.“This takes it from a one week response time in a case surrounding a jet engine to bringing it down to single minutes as Chatter could swarm the appropriate expertise immediately,” he said.Once enough employees are communicating on the platform, it can become a rich data set for managers to spot how the most effective individuals and teams operate, which will eventually become a deep history of communication in the company.DataSift, which has focused on analysing data from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, sees corporate social networks as the next big opportunity. After raising another $40m this week, Nick Halstead, founder, said he believed DataSift could become a $1bn company by analysing enterprise data.“We have a huge number of customers desperate for us not only to process and understand customers on social media but to integrate data from their business,” he said. “Internal forums, instant messaging networks, wherever there is discussion going on . . . we can analyse it.”
83;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-09-29T22:28:36Z;Evernote targets businesses with Salesforce partnership;;Evernote, the cloud storage company that styles itself as its customers’ “second brain”, is partnering with Salesforce.com to provide its note-taking applications to businesses.Salesforce customers will now be able to access Evernote on the popular corporate management platform. Evernote allows users to access and organise notes, audio and pictures stored in the cloud from any device, and share them with others.Phil Libin, Evernote chief executive, said selling the service to businesses could end up contributing up to half of the company’s revenue. Evernote has 75 million users, up from 40m this time last year, and has signed up almost 8,000 companies to Evernote business.“It is a very big deal for us,” he said. “We provide what end users want to fall in love with and Salesforce knows what IT departments need, how to talk to them and how to sell to them.”By the time the company goes public – in 2015 or 2016 at the earliest – the distinction between tech companies focusing on the consumer and on enterprise would be “really irrelevant” as employers realise providing enjoyable technology is key to keeping the best workers, he said.“Our investment hypothesis is that knowledge workers rule the world and companies will bend over backwards to make sure they have the same great experiences as they have in their personal lives,” Mr Libin said.Evernote is deliberately targeting Wall Street banks as customers to get potential investors using its service as part of its preparation for an initial public offering in the coming years. It is also working with government to try to change rules that restrict what employees in regulated industries are allowed to store in the note-taking application.But Evernote suffered a security breach earlier this year when hackers accessed user information, which could have compromised confidential corporate data and intellectual property.Mr Libin said it had “very dramatically” increased Evernote’s investment in security this year but it was hard to guarantee the service could not be hacked. “When it comes to attacks by criminals, there’s no magic. You just have to wake up every day and work on it,” he said.Clarence So, an executive at Salesforce, said it takes time to win the trust of businesses. “I think people love their apps, consumers love using it and it is super convenient. They’re going to have to work on becoming a trusted brand with Evernote business,” he said. “They are going to have to earn that trust every day.”
84;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-06-23T14:57:27Z;Oracle moves to embrace cloud upheaval;;Oracle will this week lay out plans to move deeper into the cloud-computing market, as Wall Street worries that the US software company’s traditional business is being disrupted by a technology transition that is bringing a new wave of start-ups to the fore.The announcements are set to include partnerships with Microsoft and Salesforce.com, two of Oracle’s biggest rivals, in a sign of how extensively the upheaval caused by the move to cloud computing is changing the tech landscape.Oracle’s stock price fell more than 9 per cent on Friday after it revealed that growth in its sales of new software licences had all but stalled. Claims by Oracle executives that macroeconomic issues had caused the shortfall were widely dismissed, even by analysts who retain positive forecasts for the company.“Oracle has a growth problem with its core licence business” as the technology market moves to new suppliers of cloud technologies, Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura who rates the company a “buy”, wrote in a report to investors.Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief executive officer, promised news this week of what he said would be a “startling” series of partnerships, including those with Salesforce and Microsoft, to put Oracle technology at the heart of their own cloud operations.Mr Ellison claimed that Oracle was already second only to Salesforce in the market for cloud-based applications. However, he said that a more important feature of the cloud business for his company would involve selling a new version of its database software to act as the platform for other companies that sold cloud applications or infrastructure.Some analysts questioned whether Oracle would be able to rekindle its slumping growth by moving into these newer markets, since this would mean abandoning the high upfront revenues from traditional sales of software that customers run on their own computers in favour of the lower prices and drawn-out subscriptions of selling a service over the internet.“There are equivalent or better technologies out there at much lower price points,” said Peter Goldmacher, an analyst at Cowen in San Francisco. As a result, Oracle is facing one of the inevitable transitions in the tech world “where the young disrupt the old,” he said.The outspoken Mr Ellison has claimed in the past that the rise of cloud computing, which involves the centralisation of computing functions, does not represent anything new for the tech world. By last week, however, with his company announcing disappointing earnings, the rhetoric had changed completely and Oracle executives were at pains to stress the headway their company had made in the cloud market.Commenting on the deals that he hopes will show that Oracle is repositioning its business, Mr Ellison said: “These partnerships in the cloud …will reshape the cloud and reshape the perception of Oracle technology in the cloud.”
85;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-06-14T18:47:51Z;Social intelligence;;Many people might think that social media constitute little more than a cacophonic background commentary on modern life. But for some companies they are proving a goldmine.Buried among the trivia of online conversations are valuable hints and tips on what is happening in the corporate world - the challenge is spotting them. This is the aim of “social intelligence”, which combines “listening” software with powerful data analytics, to help find the hidden insights.Social intelligence enabled an outsourcing company to discover that a big contract was likely to become available soon. The clues came in a handful of informal tweets from people working for the incumbent provider, and responses from others, which suggested it was up for renewal.The tweets were so few, and so buried among the background of other online conversations, that they would not have been noticed by the outsourcing provider, says Nathan Sage at PA Consulting. “But social intelligence identified a ‘microtrend’, which signalled that a new contract was likely,” says Mr Sage.“It was nearly two months before the company officially went out to tender, giving the outsourcing provider much longer to prepare its bid than its rivals.” The foreknowledge helped win the deal.Listening software, which lets companies find out what is being said about them in cyberspace, has been available for several years from companies such as Salesforce.com, Sysomos and Brandwatch. It is mainly used by marketing and customer service teams for monitoring brand image via social media in the public domain, such as blogs, forums, Facebook and TwitterSocial intelligence takes the technology a stage further by combining it with clever algorithms that can interpret dynamically huge numbers of online conversations, and issue alerts and signals based on its findings.“It lets you quickly and accurately identify new markets, customers who are ready to buy now, and people you should be talking to,” says Mr Sage. “It’s a good way to innovate and prototype very rapidly, giving you first mover advantage.”Sentiment analysis is a key component of social intelligence. This involves looking at words and phrases in their context to understand sarcasm and wit. It is aware that words such as ‘like’, ‘love’ and ‘good’ are not always positive.One company that has used social intelligence effectively is UK-based Medical Research Network (MRN), which helps pharmaceuticals companies recruit patients for clinical trials.Finding people to take part in clinical trials is difficult and time-consuming, especially for rare diseases, says Stuart Redding, vice-president global business development and marketing at the MRN. “We wanted to focus on hospital sites with a large enough population of potential participants living within travelling distance.”Databases on patient demographics already exist, but can be expensive to acquire and are not always detailed enough for MRN’s purposes. So in March this year, it began working with PA Consulting to use social intelligence tools to help identify geographic areas with sufficiently large populations of Hepatitis C sufferers to warrant focusing on them.The initial search looked for conversations containing the term ‘Hepatitis C’ or similar descriptors, such as Hep C, HCV, and Hepatitis. Some 180bn conversations were analysed and within half an hour 25m people potentially interested in the disease were identified.This group contained a lot of people who didn’t actually have the disease including some who mentioned it in jokes. So the team narrowed the search by selecting those who used the key terms in conjunction with “I have” or “I’m suffering from”, and applied sentiment analysis to spot the jokers. This reduced the number to 500,000 globally.Because Twitter is location-based, the team was also able to eliminate people living in countries not included in the trial, further reducing the number. Ruling out those who had previously been treated reduced the total to 2,000 people.This was achieved within five days of starting the project. “Previously, it would have taken months,” says Mr Redding.“Now we have a group of people whose approximate age and location are known, so we can analyse exactly how to target them through their key influencers – the blogs they are reading, the hashtags they are following, and the adverts that Google channels to them.The detailed and sophisticated searching that social intelligence offers has allowed MRN to find a much higher density of potential trial participants than by other means. This means that individual hospitals can have larger numbers of people taking part in the trials, increasing the economies of scale.It reduces the number of hospitals needed, cutting costs for the pharmaceutical companies and boosting revenue for the hospitals.“Social intelligence gives you great insight into what’s going on in the world, and helps you track down where people are located and find paths to communicate with them,” says Mr Redding. “It is a very powerful way to get the message across.”Social intelligence lets organisations exploit the fact that consumers often reveal their intent to buy in online conversation. Using this as the basis for promotions enabled one hotel chain to boost annual sales by £200m.Regulators, meanwhile, can spot criminal behaviour, such as people spreading rumours via social media conversations and using it to profit from stock market movements ahead of official announcements.It looks like the providers of social intelligence have a rich seam to mine.
86;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;The cloud builds up steam;;The three major acquisitions by large business software companies this week highlight the shift away from “on-premise” IT systems toward cloud computing and service-based offerings.But the three transactions, involving IBM, SAP and Salesforce.com, also reflect the fact that although these trends have been apparent for several years, they are only now beginning to be embraced by many companies leaving lots of “headroom” for growth.As IBM, which is paying an estimated $2bn for SoftLayer Technologies, the world’s largest privately held cloud computing infrastructure provider, noted that although cloud computing is growing rapidly, in terms of adoption it is still in its infancy.Underscoring this, Erich Clementi, senior vice-president of IBM Global Technology Services, says IBM’s cloud related revenues will grow to about $7bn in 2015. To put that in perspective, he expects industry-wide cloud computing will account for about $250bn out of a total $3.5tn in IT spending that year.In addition, while some companies are leaping straight from operating their own IT infrastructure to the public cloud, many are taking a more cautious mix-and-match approach and adopting hybrid cloud models aimed at capturing the cost and flexibility advantages of cloud computing, while continuing to operate their own IT infrastructure.As the world’s largest provider of dedicated hosting, SoftLayer which specialises in providing ‘bare-metal’ dedicated servers to its 20,000 mostly small and medium sized business customers, will enable IBM to bridge the on-premise/public cloud divide.“As businesses add public cloud capabilities to their on-premise IT systems, they need enterprise-grade reliability, security and management,” said Mr Clementi explaining the SoftLayer deal. “With SoftLayer, we can eliminate the barriers to cloud adoption for the enterprise.”Despite the hefty $2bn price tag, analysts say the deal makes sense for IBM and should provide its business customers with a wider choice of cloud partners. “We believe this is a solid deal strategically in helping bolster IBM’s positioning in higher-growth cloud services and providing a stronger alternative to more established (infrastructure as a service) vendors, for example Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, Microsoft Azure,” said Brian Marshall of ISI, a technology research firm.Matthew Casey, a software analyst with Technology Business Review, agrees. The SoftLayer acquisition will “greatly aid IBM’s aggressive expansion in cloud”, he said. He added: “Although the public cloud services market is dominated by price-focused vendors like Amazon, IBM will leverage those services to expand both into new customer segments (small and medium sized businesses) and provide a ladder up into more complex and higher margin cloud services.”Meanwhile, in the largest of the three enterprise software transactions announced this week, Salesforce, already a pioneer in the subscription-based subscription-as-a-service (SaaS) market, is paying about $2.5bn in cash for ExactTarget, an Indianapolis-based digital marketing company that helps companies run effective email marketing campaigns and whose customers are typically chief marketing officers.The ExactTarget deal reflects the impact of the increase in consumer and business use of social networks and mobile devices, and the shift in marketing as budgets previously spent on traditional media move to digital campaigns.Gartner estimates that by 2015 consumer technology companies will have switched one-third of their traditional marketing budgets to digital. Significantly, Gartner also predicts that by 2017, marketing officers will outspend chief information officers on information technology.Similarly, SAP’s purchase of Hybris, a Swiss-based customer relationship management (CRM) company, reflects the changing IT market dynamics and the growing importance of the consumer.“Hybris puts SAP on the leading edge of the consumer economy,” said Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executives. “With hybris, SAP has made a decisive move to raise the stakes in customer relationship management and define the next generation customer experience.”SAP, which paid $4.3bn last year for Ariba, a cloud-based business-to-business network, plans to link Hybris to its Hana in-memory computing technology to help companies spot purchasing trends and target sales incentives in real-time.The spate of billion-dollar enterprise software deals over the past two years in part reflects the high level of cash sitting on many established software companies’ balance sheets.“With corporate cash at all-time highs, many vendors are willing to pay high premiums to acquire specific technologies and expertise in an increasingly dynamic and competitive CRM market environment,” said Joanne Correia, vice-president at Gartner.But it also reflects a scramble among them to expand their push into the fast growing cloud computing and pay-as-you-go anything-as-a-service (XaaS) markets, and offset any potential declines in the future from sales of licensed software.So for example, since the start of 2011, IBM itself has made 19 acquisitions (excluding SoftLayer) most in the cloud, SaaS and analytics markets. Meanwhile in the cloud-based Human Capital Management software market Oracle, which once decried the cloud, has purchased Taleo. SAP acquired Success Factors, Salesforce bought Rypple and IBM acquired Kenexa.The latest deals could, say analysts, be the start of another “land grab” as enterprise IT providers position themselves to take advantage of the expected move by the business mainstream to the cloud and internet-based service models.
87;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-06-05T20:28:35Z;Salesforce’s revenue rain from marketing cloud;;Salesforce.com shares were back in positive territory on Wednesday – closing up 0.5 per cent at $37.95 – after an 8 per cent fall the previous day caused by its decision to spend $2.5bn on its biggest acquistion to date – ExactTarget.Salesforce, whose CRM ticker name is an acronym for its business – customer relationship management, came to the market nine years ago as the leading exponent of a new way of working. Companies would subscribe to its online service through the internet cloud rather than run traditional software on their local machines.Anyone who invested in Salesforce in June 2004 will have few concerns about Tuesday’s fall, with the shares still at more than three times its $11 IPO price.Businesses quickly took to the idea of software-as-a-service and revenues boomed, rising from less than $100m in its 2004 fiscal year to an expected $4bn for the 2014 year.Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive, has moved the company beyond helping salespeople follow up leads online, making Salesforce a platform for other services and adding social elements such as the Skype-like Chatter service.His latest buy will help Salesforce compete in another area: “ExactTarget gives Salesforce almost immediate leadership within the e-mail marketing arena as well as strong footholds within growing segments including marketing automation and mobile marketing,” said Stifel Nicolaus analysts in a note on Wednesday.Mr Benioff says the marketing cloud is a $100m business that could become a $1bn business and few will doubt his assessment based on the former Oracle executive’s ability to grow Salesforce’s revenues exponentially to date.
88;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-06-05T16:12:16Z;SAP snaps up Hybris in customer-relations coup;Company seen to act decisively to raise stakes in customer relations;Germany’s SAP added to a blistering week for business technology acquisitions by agreeing to acquire Hybris, a Swiss e-commerce software company, in order to boost its competitiveness in customer-relationship management.SAP conceded it had paid a transaction multiple “consistent with other high-growth assets”. Two sources close to the deal put the transaction value at a high triple digit million euro amount, or roughly $1bn. However, the two parties declined to confirm that figure.Hybris has more than 600 employees and had more than $100m estimated revenues in 2012.SAP’s further push into e-commerce applications takes place after rival Salesforce.com passed the German company last year as the leading vendor of customer relationship management software, according to Gartner, the consultancy.SAP’s lacklustre growth in this sector was a potential problem for the company as it views helping businesses to analyse consumer behaviour and to process vast quantities of customer data via the web and mobile devices as an important source of future growth.Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP co-chief executive, said: “It’s not about [playing] catch-up. It’s about defining the next generation CRM.”SAP plans to link Hybris to its Hana in-memory computing technology to help companies spot purchasing trends and target sales incentives in real-time.Bill McDermott, SAP’s other chief executive, described the Hybris acquisition as a “game changer”. “We are here to talk over the CRM marketplace,” he added.Last year SAP paid $4.3bn for Ariba, a cloud-based business-to-business network that helps companies collaborate in areas such as sourcing, invoicing and payment.“With corporate cash at all-time highs, many vendors are willing to pay high premiums to acquire specific technologies and expertise in an increasingly dynamic and competitive CRM market environment,” Joanne Correia, vice-president at Gartner, told clients in a recent report.SAP has long been considered a potential suitor for Hybris but the possibility of a quick transaction seemed to recede in March when Hybris completed a $30m funding round.On that occasion Meritech Capital Partners and Greylock Israel joined as shareholders alongside Hybris’ main investor HGGC, a mid-market private equity firm based in California.Based in Zug, Switzerland, Hybris has grown rapidly in recently years and its customers include H&M, Starbucks and Nespresso. Ariel Luedi, Hybris’ chief executive since 2004, is a former senior vice-president of European sales at Salesforce.comThis week IBM and Salesforce.com made acquisitions totalling a combined $4.5bn to boost their cloud computing offering. The Hybris transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2013. Hybris will operate as an independent business unit of SAP and will retain its existing management team.
89;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-06-04T17:06:37Z;IBM and Salesforce strike cloud computing deals;;The race to buy up providers of business services over the internet intensified on Tuesday with two industry giants making acquisitions worth a combined $4.5bn, underlining how so-called cloud computing is reshaping the information technology industry.The acquisitions by IBM and Salesforce are the latest signs of a big strategic shift in the technology sector as businesses increasingly buy software and services over the internet from remote locations that were formerly run on in-house computers.IBM, which has made cloud computing a core part of its future strategy, paid $2bn for SoftLayer, a private company from Dallas, according to people familiar with the matter.Salesforce.com, itself one of the biggest of new breed of cloud services companies with a market capitalisation of more than $24bn, paid $2.5bn for ExactTarget, an Indianapolis-based provider of interactive marketing and social media services.Cloud computing has become increasingly important to IBM, which has moved from selling PCs and servers to providing information technology services to big companies and governments.IBM expects $7bn in annual cloud revenue by the end of 2015, it said. In 2012, IBM had revenues of $105bn.Frank Gillett, analyst with the Forrester Research firm, said the technology industry is betting that the cloud is where growth and hopefully the profit will be eventually.“Are they overexcited and overheated? Perhaps, but that’s what’s motivating their behaviour,” he said.The deals highlight the high valuations relatively unknown companies can now command.The San Francisco-based Salesforce will pay $33.75 per share in cash in its biggest ever deal, a 53 per cent premium above ExactTarget’s closing price on Monday. ExactTarget earned $292m in revenues in the last fiscal year.As a private company, SoftLayer does not release quarterly figures, but in the most recent full year it generated about $400m in annual revenues, according to people familiar with the matter. The valuations represent five and nine times annual revenues for SoftLayer and ExactTarget respectively.However, other software-as-a-service companies trade at much higher multiples. Workday and Splunk, two newly listed enterprise technology companies, trade at 16 and 24 times forecast 2013 revenues.Yet even with nearly $300m in revenues ExactTarget is not yet profitable, losing $21m in the last full year and highlighting the difficulty big companies will have making these splashy deals pay off.ExactTarget represents the latest marketing acquisition for Salesforce, which in recent years has acquired social media management company Radian6 and social media marketing agency Buddy Media. However, Marc Benioff, Salesforce chief executive, said his company would be “taking a vacation from M&A” during the next 12 to 18 months as it works to integrate ExactTarget.SoftLayer, founded in 2005, has taken on $30m in venture capital funding, according to Crunchbase, meaning its founders and investors could be in for a big payday if the $2bn purchase price is confirmed.Salesforce was advised by Bank of America. JPMorgan advised ExactTarget. SoftLayer was advised by Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.
90;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2013-01-23T18:21:57Z;Computing innovation powers SAP’s makeover;;The transformation of Germany’s SAP over the past two years has been nothing short of dramatic. Until recently, the world’s largest maker of business software by sales was seen as an unexciting if fundamental pillar of global commerce whose dominance was on the wane. Now investors are starting to believe that its best days lie ahead.More than 60 per cent of global transactions touch an SAP system. Yet by the time the economic crisis hit it was becoming clear that the company – one of Europe’s few global tech success stories – had failed to invest sufficiently in innovation. It risked irrelevance as applications moved into the cloud and on to mobile devices, a process that accelerated the rise of challengers such as Salesforce.com.The company responded in 2009 by raising fees, which enraged its customers, and by cutting jobs as profits declined. Morale hit rock bottom.Following the departure of chief executive Léo Apotheker in February 2010, a hydra-like leadership structure has refocused the company on innovation and customers. Twelve straight quarters of double-digit growth in sales of software and related services suggest they are doing something right.New co-chief executives Bill McDermott, a tanned media-savvy American salesman and Jim Hagemann Snabe, an introverted, intellectual Dane are supported by Vishal Sikka, an Indian whose technological expertise has made him a highly-influential figure on SAP’s board.Meanwhile, Hasso Plattner, SAP’s visionary chairman and the chief architect of its hugely successful flagship software system some 20 years ago, became more hands-on in developing products. He brought with him a new invention.Developed partly by a team of PhD and Masters students at a computer science institute that he founded in Potsdam, “Hasso’s new architecture” soon became known simply as “Hana” and is widely considered to be one of the main catalysts for SAP’s reinvention.“I said if SAP cannot do this then SAP will sooner or later vanish, SAP has to do it,” Mr Plattner explained.Hana is SAP’s solution to the exponential growth of complex data and the desire of organisations to exploit this information in fields ranging from banking to healthcare and retail.SAP claims Hana enables businesses to run complex reports which used to take several hours in just a few seconds, because Hana’s computing takes place directly in the ­memory chip of the computer, rather than on a separate hard disk.Originally sneered at by Larry Ellison at big rival Oracle, Hana is now being taken seriously by SAP’s competitors. Oracle has its own Exalytics in-memory product and Microsoft is expected to launch one by 2015.“I enjoy that [Mr Ellison is] not smiling and I know there’s a weekly meeting [at Oracle] that has the word ‘Hana’ in it,” Mr Plattner says. “Put yourself in the shoes of the CEO of Oracle. What would you do when you see this freight train Hana coming? You have to do something.”Mr Sikka, who helped steered Hana’s development and refers to the database as “my little girl” sees it as a springboard for the company’s “intellectual renewal”.He says: “This is more than a database, it’s a platform for our future, a platform for everything that we do.” But Mr Sikka is also clear that SAP needs to change the way it does business – not just its technology.“We deliver products now in 90-day cycles, and even in weekly cycles. In the past we used to have 18 months delivery cycle . . . The clock-speed on everything has been dramatically upgraded,” he explains.Earlier this month SAP announced that Hana would also support its ­business suite – the cash cow management software that still accounts for a big chunk of revenues.But SAP’s rapid growth last year came mainly from the three areas that it believes will help it to pass €20bn in sales by 2015: cloud, mobile and database computing.SAP was lagging behind its rivals in mobile and cloud but has made a series of acquisitions to snare talented personnel and catch up. In 2010 it bought Sybase, the mobile software specialist, for $5.8bn and has since spent a combined $7.7bn on SuccessFactors and Ariba to strengthen its cloud business.“[People] want information but we do not want to wait longer than three seconds. You do not start a ­programme on your phone and wait for 30 seconds, nobody does that,” Mr Plattner, said. “Now you understand why we acquired mobile technology, we have to be everywhere on every single device.In the short term, these huge investments, increased R&D spending and a big jump in the number of employees have crimped SAP’s earnings growth.Analysts describe Hana as a “potential game-changer” but argue it may take time for the company to convince customers it is worth buying a new database and that this process will not, as SAP promises, be disruptive.The company must also keep its foot on the throttle as it seeks to move into the cloud.“SAP can’t afford to be slow or ignore new technology. The question is will SAP become an IBM or another Hewlett-Packard?” asks Carter Lusher at Ovum, the consultancy, in reference to the executive turmoil at HP and its underspending on R&D.“There’s no guarantee that SAP or any technology vendor will be successful in five to 10 years, especially if it does not invest in innovation.”SAP’s Mr Plattner, as one might expect, is more optimistic: “We have made a major change that enables us to go forward at a much higher speed than the last 10 years.“I see now a clear future for SAP for the next five to 10 years”.

The stock tumbled 21 per cent to $30.76 for the worst performance on Wall Street.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity lowered their price target from $52 to $41, noting that sales trends are deteriorating. They also forecast a loss in the next quarter because of weaker sales and margins that stem from “serious problems in merchandising”.Matthew Boss, analyst at JPMorgan, put his $34 price target under review, echoing concerns about the outlook and the risky nature of Big Lots’ “close-out” retail business.“While the Big Lots model is historically more volatile, we believe increasing competitive pressures on the consumables side combined with rising discretionary pressure and online competition raises long-term structural concerns,” he said.The broader market closed lower on Thursday after an unexpected rise in initial jobless claims last week. The number of unemployment-insurance claimants rose to the highest level in a month, even as the US labour market has shown signs of improvement.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.8 per cent at 1,402.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.9 per cent to 13,057.46 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.7 per cent to 3,053.40.“It looks like markets are not trading on fundamentals of the economic data, which are deteriorating globally, but are trading on the likelihood of central bank stimulus,” said Channing Smith, equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“Traders do not want to miss the rally once the stimulus is announced. On top of that, the volumes have been really low, exaggerating moves,” he added.The broad-based sell-off was led by the materials and utilities sectors, down 1.7 and 1 per cent respectively.United States Steel was the worst-hit stock among materials, down 6.9 per cent to $21.19. Anthony Rizzuto at Dahlman Rose downgraded the stock from “buy” to “hold”, citing concerns about a drop in prices of domestic steel.Rival Nucor dropped 3.5 per cent to $39.14 and Cliffs Natural Resources shed 5.5 per cent to $37.32.Technology stocks remained in focus in the wake of disappointing results from Dell and Hewlett-Packard.HP shares dropped 8.1 per cent to $17.63 the day after the PC maker announced a record $8.9bn loss in the second quarter and narrowed its full-year outlook.Analysts at Credit Suisse said HP’s fundamental trends remained weak, with revenue declines in all five major divisions. “[The] shares are inexpensive, but given weak fundamentals, a low multiple is warranted,” they said, retaining their target price of $25.Dell lost another 3.7 per cent to $11.24 after sliding 5.4 per cent during the previous session on disappointing quarterly results.Intel, which manufactures microchips used in personal computers dropped 2.7 per cent to $25.04. Rival Advanced Micro Devices fell 2.7 per cent to $3.90.Banking stocks were among the laggards dragging the S&P financials index down 1 per cent.Citigroup shares dropped 3 per cent to $29.58, Morgan Stanley fell 2.4 per cent to $14.50 and JPMorgan lost 1.6 per cent to $37.23.Shares in Guess, which reported second-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, fell 25.6 per cent to $25.05. The clothing retailer missed consensus estimates and cut its full-year earnings projections, citing increased use of discounts and excess inventory.By contrast, Hormel Foods shares rose 1.4 per cent to $28.82 after the food processing company’s second-quarter profits beat estimates, and it reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast.Shares in Safeway, the supermarket group, dropped 4.1 per cent to $15.31 after analysts at Jefferies downgraded it to “hold” from “buy”.“Industry fundamentals are weakening, in part due to higher gas prices and an acceleration of competitive openings, which may be compounded by a spike in food inflation,” wrote Scott Mushkin, equity analyst.Salesforce.com shares dropped more than 5 per cent to $146.77 in the after-hours market despite its earnings report beating analysts’ estimates. The enterprise software provider reported $732m in revenue, topping expectations of $728.3m.Among the winners was money manager Federated Investors, up 4.3 per cent to $21.51, after news that the SEC chairwoman Mary Schapiro admitted defeat in her quest to impose tougher rules on money-market mutual funds.First Solar was up 2.8 per cent to $24.61. The stock has added more than 50 per cent since the beginning of the month but remains well below its pre-crisis high of more than $300.
92;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-06-27T21:29:00Z;Consumerisation of corporate IT accelerates;;"Microsoft’s $1.2bn acquisition of Yammer earlier this week positions the software group to add enterprise social networking features to its existing business collaboration tools including SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Office.It also represents another example of the consumerisation of corporate IT; after the success of consumer-focused services such as Facebook, social networking technology is finding its way into mainstream businesses. Young employees in particular expect to be able to use the same tools and technologies at work that they have become familiar with as consumers.“Many employees at the junior (and now senior) end of the workforce live aspects of their personal lives through Facebook and Twitter, so the idea of introducing similar kinds of tools into the workplace seems to make sense from a communication and collaboration point of view,” said Richard Edwards, principal analyst at Ovum, the market research firm.“It’s not just Microsoft eyeing-up the opportunities afforded by the Facebook-led social paradigm shift,” he said. “Established enterprise IT vendors, such as IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com and SAP are all busy bringing social capabilities to the workplace via a variety of ways and means.As Mr Edwards noted, Microsoft SharePoint Server already touts social capabilities but it was designed and built in the pre-Facebook, pre-cloud era. In contrast, Yammer, which was launched in 2008, belongs to the new breed of enterprise collaboration tools, designed from the ground-up to exploit social, mobile, and cloud technologies.“Microsoft has been slow to the game in enterprise social,” said Rob Koplowitz of Forrester Research in a blog note penned before the Yammer deal was confirmed by Microsoft. “Their primary delivery mechanism, SharePoint, is a very big product with a traditionally long delivery cycle. When you upgrade your enterprise social story every 3-4 years, you’re going to be constantly behind in a market segment that is rewarded for being forward thinking. Hence, they’ve not been a thought leader.”Yammer, which enables companies to offer their employees Facebook and Twitter-style functionality within the security of the enterprise firewall and integrates with other business applications managed by a company IT department, is well regarded by analysts who follow the enterprise social networking market.Employees can set up user profiles, send and receive the equivalent of “tweets”, take part in discussion forums and receive notifications about what their colleagues are doing.Proponents of enterprise social networking tools which aside from Yammer include Salesforce.com’s Chatter; VMware’s SocialCast and tibbr, the social media service of Tibco Software, claim they improve the way employees communicate and collaborate by complementing email, instant messaging and other more traditional tools.Yammer will also sit neatly alongside Skype, the communication product that Microsoft acquired last year for $8.5bn but has yet to integrate into its mainstream business applications.“Since Yammer is a cloud-based service, it probably makes sense for Microsoft to integrate its functionality into its web-based Office 365 collaboration and email suite,” said Mr Koplowitz."
93;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-06-05T22:47:09Z;Oracle agrees to buy Collective Intellect;;"Oracle stepped up its push into the corporate social media app market by agreeing to acquire Collective Intellect, a leading cloud-based social intelligence technology provider, for an undisclosed sum.The deal also highlights the race to acquire social media and cloud-based technology among the leading enterprise software companies including Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.Collective Intellect’s semantic and text mining technology allows companies and other organisations to monitor, understand and respond to consumers’ conversations on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.“Creating meaningful content based on a clear understanding of consumers’ conversations is the way brands will create stronger customer relationships,” said Don Springer, founder and chief strategy officer of the seven-year-old company whose customers include CBS, Barclaycard, Hasbro, Nestlé Purina, Walmart, Siemens and Pepsi.Just two weeks ago Oracle paid a reported $300m to buy Vitrue, a social marketing platform provider that has become one of the most popular solutions for big companies trying to win Facebook fans and push out marketing messages to consumers. Then on Monday Salesforce announced plans to buy Buddy Media for $689m.As Zach Hofer-Shall of Forrester noted in a blog posted on Tuesday, the Oracle/Collective Intellect deal comes a year after Salesforce.com purchased Radian6 and now gives both customer relationship management groups “the components they need to piece together something powerful. With social CRM in sight, this social technology arms race is the start of something very big to come,” he said.The flurry of recent mergers and acquisitions activity reflects the growing importance of both social media and cloud-based services to the corporate customers of the leading enterprise software companies such as Oracle and SAP, which has also made a string of recent acquisitions.“Why the acquisition streak?” asked Mr Hofer-Shall. “Because social start-ups hold the innovation that big tech companies need. As the thousands of social start-ups can attest, building social tools can be easy, but building successful social technologies is very, very difficult.“As my colleague Melissa Parrish pointed out in her Salesforce.com/Buddy Media post: ‘These acquisitions are not about adding immediate significant revenue. They’re about adding technology offerings.’ As always, Melissa is absolutely right. None of these acquisitions pick up wildly profitable companies; they pick up unique technologies that will help the tech giants meet future market demands.”The rapid growth over the past few years of social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter has presented companies with both new marketing opportunities and challenges for keeping pace with their customers, many of whom now use social media to comment on, recommend and sometimes criticise companies and their products and services.Oracle said it planned to integrate Collective Intellect and Vitrue’s technology with its own social data management and analytics capabilities to create “the most advanced and comprehensive social relationship platform”.“Gaining intelligence from consumer conversations across social media, and knowing customers’ intentions and interests helps organisations create better products and deliver better service,” said Thomas Kurian, executive vice-president of Oracle Development, explaining the deal.Integrating Collective Intellect and Vitrue with Oracle’s existing software-as-a-service, or SaaS, products will “enable marketing organisations to create more targeted marketing campaigns; help customer service teams respond quickly to customer feedback on social media; generate targeted leads and opportunities for sales teams; and strengthen how companies build more effective brands using the internet and social media”, Oracle claimed."
94;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-06-04T19:52:30Z;Salesforce.com invests in social marketing;;Salesforce.com, the business software developer, announced Monday a $689m deal to acquire Buddy Media, a company that helps more than 1,000 marketers including Ford Motor and L’Oréal, to manage their presence on Facebook and other social networking sites.It is Salesforce’s second acquisition of a social media marketing firm and comes nearly two weeks after Oracle announced that it was buying Buddy Media’s competitor, Vitrue, for an estimated $300m.Both deals highlight a field where Facebook has generated much traffic but no direct revenue.“I would call it a missed opportunity,” said Melissa Parish, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Facebook is monetising the advertiser. But there are all these other entities inside companies that are interested in social media, too, and Facebook has done nothing to monetise them.”Facebook allows companies to market on its platforms for free. As those marketers look for ways to manage an increasingly large number of Facebook pages and fans, companies such as Buddy Media and Vitrue have stepped in. Facebook calls them partners and allows them to access its platform at no charge, with the companies in turn charging marketers a fee to use their software.Now Salesforce.com and Oracle will be folding these companies into their suites of software offerings.The move comes as the line between marketing and technology companies is increasingly blurred.“The marketing industry is undergoing the biggest transformation it has seen in 60 years. Facebook has become the new corporate homepage,” Marc Benioff, Salesforce’s chief executive, said during a call with analysts.Founded in 2007 by husband and wife team Michael and Kass Lazerow, Buddy Media quickly emerged as one of the top firms to help marketers bolster their presence on Facebook, relying primarily on the free tools Facebook offers to interact with consumers, such as quizzes and games.Over the years, Buddy Media expanded its services to other social networking sites and developed tools to help marketers buy ads and measure the effectiveness of their social media marketing. The company has raised about $90m in funding from investors including advertising conglomerate WPP.Mr Lazerow said in an interview that he expects the sales structure behind Salesforce will help the company accelerate its business. “The only reason we didn’t grow faster is that we didn’t have the machine of a sales organisation that a lot of big companies have,” he said.
95;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-05-22T15:56:38Z;‘Co-sourcing’: Cloud fosters collaboration;Businesses poised for leap of faith;Few innovations in modern information technology have proved as controversial as the cloud.JP Rangaswami, formerly chief scientist for BT and now fulfilling the same role at Salesforce.com, a cloud software provider, has a radical view of its potential.He says: “It solves the problem of risk transfer. If we have solved the problem of providing a chief information officer with a service without the need for capacity planning, then we have solved the problem of risk transfer”.But Vineet Nayar, chief executive and vice-chairman of HCL Technologies, an India-based services company, takes a different line. “In my view, the cloud is overrated. Every time we [the IT industry] hype up a technology or hype up a trend and try to create a market out of something, the CIO is inundated with requests from the board in terms of ‘Why are we not on the cloud?’,” he says.And Pat Philips, practice director for UK-based professional services group Xceed and a former deputy CIO at the UK Metropolitan Police, takes a middle course: “It [cloud computing] is something we have been doing for many years.“The bit that makes it different from outsourcing is that in the past a company’s IT would have been hosted in a specific data centre. Now connecting up all those hosts makes better use of the infrastructure.”Steve Salmon, principal adviser at the CIO advisory practice of KPMG, the consultancy, agrees there is plenty of hype and confusion around the cloud concept. He comments: “From a sceptical standpoint, many leading cloud and traditional outsourcers are just re-badging existing services into cloud products simply to avoid appearing to be left behind”.It was ever thus. But, as Mr Salmon makes clear, the cloud model differentiates itself from a legacy outsourcing approach, making the most of open standards to provide stronger interoperability across platforms – not only from the same vendor, but from competitors.This interoperability, what Mr Rangaswami would call “fungibility”, is the key element that sets cloud computing apart from its predecessors in outsourced computing services.Eric Blum, chief technology officer, Europe, Middle East and Africa, for BMC Software, a US group, describes the change as a move from outsourcing to out-tasking.Mr Blum says large organisations are using cloud management technology to make the shift from large outsourcing contracts secured with a single supplier to multisourced delivery, possibly involving dozens of vendors. These he says, put a renewed emphasis on financial performance, quality of service, security and regulatory compliance.Mr Nayar of HCL agrees: “It is important to recognise that outsourcing as we know it is dead. ‘Co-sourcing’ – or working alongside businesses as part of an outsourcing relationship – is the only way to go. Customers have to be in control of their destiny.”.So is it a win-win situation for everybody?As Mr Rangaswami points out, the use of cloud services relieves CIOs of the responsibility for capacity planning – an activity which in good times can leave the CIO a hero but in bad times, with unwanted expensive hardware and software licences, the villain of the piece. “The risk has been shifted from the buyer to the vendor,” he says. “I never had that in 32 years in computing.”Furthermore, IT services to support new business developments can be turned on at the flick of a switch, saving costs and cutting the time to bring new products to market.But what about the software and services companies that have in the past depended on licence fees for their revenues?Mr Philips of Xceed believes the coming of the cloud is beneficial for companies such as Microsoft. “At present, it has little control over what people do with its software. Now it will have control over its licences – although the price points will have to change.”However, according to Mr Salmon of KPMG, the impact on traditional software licences has been a big challenge for the largest providers, “and it has not been solved in many quarters.“Some of the larger organisations have accepted that they need to be players in the cloud and, as a start, they may see a drop in traditional revenue numbers – but that is preferable to some of their products and services becoming obsolete.”The fact remains that no company has, as yet, moved all its IT to the cloud. Most big companies have large enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suites installed and will not want to upset the status quo.Mr Philips of Xceed says: “Companies are not coming to us saying ‘we want to move on to the cloud’. They are saying ‘we have a particular business problem and what in your view is the best way to address it?’”He adds: “The fear is [and here he echoes Mr Nayar] that people will not be in charge of their destinies. They will lose their data centres and their hardware. It is a leap of faith …but the rewards are potentially extremely significant.”
96;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-04-02T02:31:39Z;Oil price rise followed by collapse is a familiar cycle – but we never learn;;From Mr Peter Schwartz.Sir, Martin Wolf’s otherwise excellent column did not go far enough forward in time (“Prepare for a new era of oil shocks”, Comment, March 28). The current run-up in price is mainly political with diminished oil reaching the market from Libya, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan and Yemen. As that oil comes back into the market it will be added to major new oil production from the US, Canada, Norway, Africa, Latin America and even Russia.The previous peak of prices has led to a major expansion of new production from many sources: deep offshore, far north, oil sands and more. The result will be another price collapse within a few years, perhaps even this autumn.This is just one more commodity price cycle of high prices driving new supplies and weak demand, followed by excess supply, falling prices and a return of demand growth driving prices back up. We have been through this five times in the last 40 years with little apparent learning. The big problem is that this will both confuse energy policy and, especially, make climate change policy much harder.Peter Schwartz, Salesforce.com, San Francisco, CA, USFormer head of scenario planning at Royal Dutch Shell
97;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-03-05T23:16:59Z;In-car technology: Feel-good factors to the fore in the connected cockpit;Consumer demand is driving developments in comfort and ‘wellness’, writes John Reed;As car companies push the limits of what the communications and computing technology in their vehicles can – or might reasonably be expected – to do, a new frontier is emerging: “wellness” behind the wheel.Ford, for example, is developing as part of its Sync in-car system a feature for people with diabetes that uses a breath sample to test a driver’s or passenger’s blood sugar and warns them if they need an insulin shot.The company is developing another service for people with allergies that can warn drivers about areas with high pollen counts and route the car away from them, or automatically close the car’s external vents.“We see health and wellness as a big part of the future,” says Pim van der Jagt, Ford’s technical leader of active safety and driver assistance systems.That Ford is developing these features attests to the technological leaps being made in wireless communications and cloud connectivity, and the seemingly limitless new horizons that these are opening up in cars.It also reflects buyers’ changing expectations of cars. “Consumers are placing less value on some of the traditional areas of the automotive space, such as power trains, and more value on convenience and comfort elements,” says Sarwant Singh, a partner with Frost & Sullivan, the consultancy.Carmakers and suppliers are now trying to devise services that drivers will value and pay for, while forging partnerships with external suppliers and service providers that will keep them ahead of the game.Ford was one of the first in the industry to offer in-car communications and assistance systems with its Sync system, developed with Microsoft. The computing company says cars are becoming the third-most important computing device after smartphones and tablets.Ford says its focus on in-car technology reflects demand from younger consumers in particular.The emphasis on higher-end entertainment systems is increasing, says Mr van der Jagt. “There is a trend of a new generation coming up that has much less interest in the car itself.”Audi reached similar conclusions after conducting its “Future Kids” survey. Young people, says Peter Schwarzenbauer, Audi’s head of sales, “are saying they expect to be able to do in their cars whatever they can do with their handheld devices. They don’t care whether it’s part of the car, or the car just enables handheld devices to receive data out of the cloud.”At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this year, Audi showed a version of its forthcoming A3 in which the driver had a head-up display of traffic and other information, and his passenger another display to make video calls, surf the internet or watch movies. The projections could be manipulated with the swipe of a hand.The German premium brand’s “human-machine interface” team in Ingolstadt now has about 75 technicians working on in-car technology – experimenting with new features, testing them in customer clinics and overseeing translation into more than 20 languages.As “distracted driving” becomes more of a concern, the industry is mindful of regulations. US safety officials recently released long-awaited guidelines on what the industry should and should not offer in cars.Audi, like its German premium rivals BMW and Mercedes-Benz, already offers head-up displays in its top-end models to project vital information in front of the driver’s eyes while they focus on the road.To minimise distraction, Audi’s engineers have developed a touchpad system that allows drivers to enter letters into the car’s navigation and communications system at the touch of a finger.Audi devised the feature originally for its A8 in 2010 and is now introducing it across its range, with versions that recognise writing in Arabic, Cyrillic and Mandarin. The next step, the brand’s engineers say, will be a touchpad with “active haptic feedback”. This feature, normally used for blind people, will allow drivers to feel buttons or text lines without taking their eyes off the road.For carmakers, cloud connectivity in cars is also opening the way for longer and richer service relationships with customers – and the revenues that come from that.Nissan last year announced a strategic relationship with Microsoft to develop a dealer management system for use in its cars. Toyota said it was working with Salesforce.com, a US cloud-computing company, to offer a service on its plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles that will provide drivers with maintenance tips, or warn them if they need to recharge.As cars “know” more than ever before about drivers and passengers, the connected car will open up big new commercial possibilities, but will also raise privacy issues.Mr Schwarzenbauer says consumers will accept the new technology if the knowledge that carmakers acquire about them makes their lives easier but, he warns, “it’s a mistake to misuse this information”.
98;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-02-29T17:08:51Z;So near and yet so far;Technology is not only making remote working a reality, it is also altering the way companies recruit and manage staff;Eight months in, Jim Ware has still not physically met two of the founders of his business. The San Francisco-based business consultant founded Occupiers Journal, a global facilities management company, with a London-based colleague and two others living in Hong Kong.But thanks to video conferencing, email, and regular phone calls, their locations have hardly mattered. The business plan has been drawn up, the website designed and clients lined up just as efficiently as if they had all worked out of the same small office.“I don’t think we could have started the business in this way five or 10 years ago,” says Mr Ware.The company website was created in Alaska, while their part-time designer, Mr Ware’s son, was off duty from his other job as a helicopter ski guide.“More and more people are working like this, collaborating with people who are halfway across the world,” says Mr Ware. “There are two things we can be pretty sure of about the future of business. One is that offices will be more distributed with people working in many different locations. The other is that, paradoxically, people will be collaborating more than ever before.”It is not just small start-up businesses that are taking advantage of internet technology to set up in new and innovative ways. Many large companies are allowing employees to work flexibly from home or other locations.IDC, the market research company, estimates that more than 1bn workers worldwide were capable of mobile working in 2010, and it expects this to rise to 1.3bn by 2015.Ubiquitous internet coverage and mobile phone networks are making it easier to connect to the office remotely. Cloud computing, in which files are stored at a remote data centre and accessed anywhere, has made the physical office less necessary.“Before, when I would go on a business trip, I would have to decide which files I would transfer to my laptop. And I would always forget something. Now I have a PC, a MacBook, an iPhone and an iPad, and because of cloud computing, I can get the same files on all of them,” Mr Ware says.People are also expected to handle more information and respond to it much quicker, effectively changing the way they work. More sophisticated and faster analytical tools are now available to help managers track everything about their businesses in real time, from the number of cups of coffee being served across a beverage franchise, or the exact location of every pallet of goods ordered.Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods group, has given 58,000 employees business intelligence dashboards showing current information about the company’s performance, so that they can instantly see issues as they arise, such as a drop in market share or sales. It is also working on a video platform that will allow staff to collaborate faster to solve problems indicated by the dashboards.The importance of these systems is underscored by the fact that, at a time when P&G is cutting back on its manufacturing workforce, the company is planning a fourfold increase in the number of staff with business analytics expertise.Companies are also starting to manage their employees through online tools. In future, the CV and the performance appraisal may disappear as companies not only attract and hire staff with the help of social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter, but manage people throughout their career using social tools.Young internet companies such as Facebook, Mozilla and Spotify, for example, have taken a new approach to managing employees by using an online social networking-style system called Rypple. Designed almost like a game, it allows people to quickly and informally send each other feedback on a daily basis that can then be collected together for an overall career assessment.“No one really liked traditional career reviews, which they just saw as filling in forms. The world has really changed. It has become social, it has moved to the cloud and there has been a massive generation shift with 90m generation-Y employees coming in to offices in the US with new expectations. You can’t use a 50-year-old process for managing these people,” said Daniel Debow, the co-founder of Rypple, which was acquired by Salesforce.com at the end of last year.Mr Debow says customers report they get up to 10 times as much feedback through a social network-based system as with traditional human resources assessment methods, and have seen the time taken for career assessments halve. More traditional companies, such as GE Insurance, are also adopting the system, he said.“It is not just the hip young internet companies doing this. I get the same interest from drilling and insurance companies,” Mr Debow said. “There is a deep awakening that this is a societal shift in how people are collaborating and companies are realising that if they don’t bring these tools into their organisations, they will get left behind.”

That was the best close for the index since June 2008.The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly topped 13,000 for the first time since 2008, but ended the week at 12,982.95, for a weekly gain of 0.3 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,963.75, as Apple, which accounts for more than a tenth of the index, climbed 4 per cent to $522.41, just five dollars short of an all-time high. The world’s largest public company bowed to pressure from investors to give shareholders greater influence over the election of directors.Although all three major US indices are now at multi-year highs, investors were far from exuberant.Fund flow data continued to trend negative. Domestic equity funds suffered a second successive week of outflows, according to data from Lipper. Equity funds have seen net redemptions year to date, despite a rally that has now seen the S&P 500 climb 8.6 per cent.Investors of a statistical bent are focused on the transport sector of the Dow Jones, which has fallen 3.8 per cent in February, even as the broad index has climbed 2.2 per cent. Higher oil prices are weighing on the sector, but “Dow theory” suggests transport stocks are a leading indicator for the rest of the index, because they are the first to feel the effects of economic slowdown.“Sentiment is becoming more worrisome,” noted Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, who has advised clients to take profit.Tech stocks have been the driving force behind the rally in the S&P 500, significantly outperforming the broad index since last April. That trend continued this week, despite a poor performance by computer-markers.Dell shares fell 4 per cent to $17.43 over the week, and its larger rival Hewlett-Packard tumbled 10 per cent to $26.64. Both companies saw earnings fall for the quarter ended January 31, while HP also saw a 7 per cent decline in revenue compared to the same period in 2010.“In general, the easy margin expansion related to PC supply chain re-engineering is behind the company, suggesting more volatility in operating margins and earnings going forward,” Richard Gardner at Citigroup said in a note.Shares in Salesforce.com surged on Friday after the company, which provides cloud-based software to businesses, reported a jump in revenue in the quarter ended January 31.Shares climbed 11.2 per cent over the week to a nine-month high of $143.64. Shares had sold off in the final quarter of 2011, after the company’s previous quarterly results showed revenue momentum slowing. But the stock has now rebounded 40 per cent this year.“These…results undeniably refute the concerns in Q3 that momentum in the business is slowing,” Walter Pritchard at Citigroup said in a note.Walmart fell 5.9 per cent to $58.79 as a second consecutive quarter of US sales growth was not enough to drive profit growth. Fourth-quarter earnings fell steeply, as the world’s largest retailer by revenue discounted heavily to attract customers.Margin compression resulting from promotions and raw material costs was a feature across the consumer staples sector.Shares in Safeway fell 8.8 per cent to $20.93 over the week as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins, although investors were braced for poor figures and shares climbed 4.9 per cent to $55.22.First Solar share slumped 16.5 per cent to $35.58, approaching their lowest price since the solar panel manufacturer’s 2006 debut, after the German government announced plans to cut solar energy subsidies by 30 per cent.Sears Holdings rallied 25.3 per cent to $68.31, even as the department store chain reported a fourth-quarter loss of more than $2bn. Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and a significant shareholder, which is set to begin with the $270m sale of 11 stores in April.Netflix shares suffered their third consecutive weekly decline, having rallied almost 75 per cent in January. It fell 8.4 per cent over the week to $111.67, after Comcast announced plans for a rival video-streaming service. Netflix shares remain up 61 per cent for the year, however.MetroPCS climbed 16.2 per cent to $12.01 after reporting a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged larger rivals by offering customers attractive rates, but it also showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs.
100;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-02-23T21:44:25Z;Sears jumps on spin-off and sale plans;;Shares in Sears Holdings jumped after the department store chain said it would raise up to $670m from asset sales and other restructuring, as it published quarterly results.A fourth-quarter loss of $2.4bn had been expected after the company pre-announced disappointing holiday sales and said it would close stores in December. Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and chief investor. The process is set to begin in April with the $270m sale of 11 stores.The shares climbed 18.7 per cent to $61.80, $15 above their price before December’s announcement.That helped the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 to a healthy gain, although it remained in negative territory for the week, and was not helped by a 5.9 per cent fall for Kohl’s, the mid-market department store, which reported a decline in profits of nearly 8 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, high costs ate into margins for several companies.Shares in Safeway fell 7.6 per cent to $20.95, as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins. Analysts had forecast worse figures and the shares climbed 2.9 per cent to $54.50.Procter & Gamble investors responded positively as the company bowed to analyst pressure to streamline its business, by announcing it would cut 5,700 jobs and $10bn in costs over the next four years. Shares in the consumer goods maker climbed 3.1 per cent to $66.42.Elsewhere, stocks closed within 0.2 points of a post-financial crisis high, as the S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,363.46 points.Wall Street had opened lower but was given a shot in the arm by better than expected data from the Kansas Fed manufacturing index, a closely watched indicator of economic activity in the mid-western states of the US.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,984.69 points, its highest close since May 2008.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,956.98 points, as Apple shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $516.39, after the company bowed to pressure to give investors greater influence over the election of directors.Shares in Vivus gained 77.5 per cent to $18.73 after the drugmaker received backing from a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel for a new weight loss pill.Hewlett-Packard shares fell 6.5 per cent to $27.05 after the computer maker reported a 7 per cent fall in sales after the bell on Wednesday. Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, promised a multi-year turnround of HP’s large businesses, but analysts stressed the challenges.“[The turnround] will require significant investment in streamlining operations, regaining product leadership and positioning the company to benefit from key industry trends,” said Richard Gardner, technology analyst at Citi. “The company will have to make these investments while navigating a number of extremely competitive, mature end markets – not a journey for the faint of heart.”Shares in First Solar fell 8 per cent to $37.20, as investors reacted to the German government’s plans to cut subsidies for solar power generation. Analysts were expecting the solar panel manufacturer to report a fall in profits of more than 10 per cent when it released fourth-quarter results after the close of trading on Thursday.MetroPCS climbed 13.8 per cent to $11.70 as the company reported a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged large mobile networks by offering customers attractive rates. But the company showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs. The cost of acquiring new customers fell, while most analysts had expected it to rise.Oil and gas exploration and production companies continued to report fourth-quarter results and 2012 budgets, with two winners evident on Thursday.QEP Resources climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.03 and Denbury Resources was up 5.5 per cent to $20.71 as the companies responded to decade-low natural gas prices in different ways.Denbury saw fourth-quarter profits easily beat analyst expectations, thanks to strong oil output from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.QEP resources reported a fourth-quarter loss, but saw earnings from its field services operation, which is less closely tied to gas prices, almost double compared with the same period in 2010.Shares in Salesforce.com gained as much as 10 per cent to $144.33 in after hours trading, after the business accounting software provider reported revenue that exceeded analyst expectations.
101;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-02-22T19:20:53Z;Antidote to pessimism of post-crisis world;;"Standing on the Sun: How the Explosion of Capitalism Abroad Will Change Business Everywhere; By Christopher Meyer, with Julia Kirby; Harvard Business Review Press, $27.95/ £21.99You can probably work out what you will think of Standing on the Sun by gauging your reaction to this passage on the future of capitalism: “Firms that want to be part of fruitful collaboration will start behaving generously. And as a result, they’ll attract generous partners.” Naive idealism or visionary in­sight? If you think it sounds like the former, prepare to be enraged; if the latter, to be enchanted.Christopher Meyer and Julia Kirby argue that capitalism is being irreversibly changed by forces such as the spread of technology, the shift in economic power to emerging markets and the recent failures of a system that pits self-interested western companies against each other. An obsession with return on equity, shareholder value and “pseudo-competition” has blinded westerners to the opportunities available if they adapt to a more innovative, more collaborative form of business.To understand how the old system is evolving, they suggest, managers must shift their perspective, rather as Copernicus defied dogmatic scholars by putting the sun, rather than the earth, at the centre of the solar system.Meyer, a founding partner of Monitor Talent, part of the Monitor consultan­cy, and Kirby, an editor-at-large at Harvard Business Review, write with an American accent.This is understandable. The US represents the most entrenched and, un­til recently, most successful example of the type of capitalism the authors say will be left behind. But fascinating hybrid businesses are springing from the confusion of fast-growing markets and the authors argue compellingly that they will change the rules of business for the better.I could have read a little less about the likes of Salesforce.com, AT&T and General Electric and a lot more about organisations such as India’s Dial 1298 for Ambulance (which yokes a for-profit service to a non-profit foundation) or Israel’s Shekulo Tov (which sells decorative objects made by mentally handicapped people, for whom the work is also therapeutic).Standing on the Sun will irritate some orthodox economists with its claim that focusing on “gross national happiness” will change the world (yes, get ready for another trip to Bhutan). It will annoy some traditionalist executives with its advocacy for a strategy of “ shared value” that harnesses companies’ and society’s mutual self-interest.To my mind, the book also underestimates the political obstacles to the injection of more “socialism” into the market (in the US) and more market into social services (in Europe).Finally, as the authors state ominously, the greatest resistance to change is likely to come from “the big financial institutions [which] have an interest in keeping the game going”.But the prospect that innovation, collaboration and social value will take the place of “mutually assured consumption” is attractive. The book makes a strong case that many companies are already heading in that direction.Sometimes it seems as though the strongest def­ence of capitalism is the stifling, circular argument that it is the best of a bad set of options. This book is a well-timed, well-written antidote to such post-crisis pessimism. By pointing out how capitalism is itself evolving beyond its 20th century bastions, Meyer and Kirby open a window and let in some welcome fresh air.The writer is the Financial Times management editor"
102;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-02-09T21:48:57Z;Latest deal highlights cloud agenda;;Oracle’s proposed acquisition of Taleo for $1.9bn is the latest in an aggressive and competitive wave of market consolidation in the emerging cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) software field, which has also seen SAP acquire Success Factors, and Salesforce.com acquire Rypple.It also underscores the growing importance of cloud-based business software and the scramble among traditional enterprise planning software companies including Oracle and SAP to bolster their cloud offerings.“These acquisitions indicate the increasing enterprise acceptance of the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, with HCM following in the footsteps of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) as the next SaaS battleground,” said Tim Jennings, chief analyst at Ovum, the technology market research firm.“It also emphasises the urgency that the major enterprise application vendors attach to establishing a strong position in cloud-based software,” he said. “Both Oracle and SAP have existing on-premise HCM solutions, but both have been prepared to pay out large sums on cloud-based equivalents, rather than simply transitioning their existing solutions to the cloud.”Taleo will also further advance Oracle’s public cloud strategy, joining the recently closed acquisition of RightNow for customer service management, Oracle’s Social Network for collaboration, and Oracle’s own Fusion applications.Like SAP’s pending $3.4bn acquisition of San Mateo, California-based Success Factors which was announced in December, Oracle’s proposed acquisition reflects the increasing demand from customers for more flexible cloud-based enterprise software that can be accessed on demand.With cloud-based start-ups like Taleo, Success Factors and Rypple making inroads in the human resources area, the giants of the software industry have had to respond, said Paul Hammerman, an analyst at Forrester Research.This trend also reflects easing concerns among major companies about the availability and security of cloud-based software and a growing appreciation that on-demand cloud-based services can provide additional flexibility and agility.“The cloud offers new delivery styles and options that are industrialised in a value chain that renders on-premises IT systems and expertise as only part of the overall delivery of IT capabilities to the company,” noted Darryl Plummer of Gartner in the IT research group’s predictions for this year.Among business users, customer relationship management and human resource management have emerged as some of the first major corporate functions to switch from in-house software packages running on corporate servers to cloud-based services that run over the internet.As a result, tools that allow companies to track and measure employees performance – often called “talent management” suites – have become one of the high-growth areas in the software industry. IDC has estimated that the sector grew by 41 per cent between 2009 and 2010, and both Taleo and Success Factors are considered leaders in the field.This switch also underscores the rapid changes under way in corporate HR departments which once relied heavily on internal systems and costly external agencies, especially for recruitment. “Human resource information systems have altered how HR services are delivered and managed by organisations,” says the Washington-based Society for Human Resources Management.So why has talent management software as a whole fared so well in recent years? In an interview last year Michael Gregoire, chief executive of Taleo, explained that the functions it provides are in tune with board-level concerns in times of economic uncertainty.“When chief executives find themselves unable to invest in hard assets such as new warehouses or manufacturing lines, their attention tends to be drawn to the workforce as a source of competitive advantage,” he said.“That focus often triggers the realisation that they simply don’t have the transparency they need to identify the ‘stars’ in their organisation, the high-performers who make a measurable contribution to business results and who need to be nurtured, motivated and rewarded for their achievements.”
103;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-02-09T19:33:59Z;Oracle in online shift with Taleo purchase;;Oracle is set to take its biggest leap yet into the fast-growing world of cloud computing, announcing on Thursday that it would pay $1.9bn for Taleo, a US company which provides online human resources management software.The deal echoes SAP’s pending $3.4bn acquisition of a similar company, Success Factors, and reflects an acceleration in the shift of some key aspects of business software to the internet. With companies such as Workday, an internet-based start-up, making inroads in the human resources area, the giants of the software industry have had to respond, said Paul Hamerman, an analyst at Forrester Research.Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, once dismissed cloud computing as “gibberish” and a passing fad, but has recently embarked on a number of acquisitions of companies offering internet-based software. The agreement to buy Taleo tops the $1.5bn that Oracle paid to acquire RightNow, which provides online software for managing customer services.The shift to online delivery of software – known as “software as a service”, or SaaS – threatens to disrupt the traditional software business since customers pay through annual subscriptions, replacing the upfront sales that are central to Oracle and SAP.Mr Hamerman said: “Oracle has been very reticent about SaaS, preferring the revenue recognition associated with its original licensing model.”But he added that in human capital management – the name given to software from companies such as Taleo – and customer-relationship management, “the market has already voted” for online delivery, forcing Oracle to follow suit.Oracle’s latest acquisition will revive an old battle in the software industry. A decade ago, the world’s second-biggest software company triggered consolidation in the industry with an unsolicited bid for PeopleSoft, a company selling traditional human resources software. Dave Duffield, the entrepreneur behind PeopleSoft, and Aneel Bhusri, a long-time ally, went on to found Workday, opening a new front by shifting their focus to online delivery.Oracle, which has bought more than 70 companies in a $40bn buying spree over the past few years, is under pressure to lift sales growth after revealing in December that sales had only grown just 2 per cent in the three months to November.Tim Jennings, chief analyst at Ovum, called Oracle’s move “the latest in an aggressive and competitive wave of market consolidation” in human resources software, following the Success Factors deal and Salesforce.com’s acquisition of Rypple.Tools that allow companies to track and measure employees’ performance has become one of the high-growth areas in the software industry. An IDC study calculated a market growth rate of 41 per cent for the sector between 2009 and 2010. Taleo and Success Factors, both relatively young companies, were the leaders in the field.Shareholders at Redwood City, California-based Taleo will receive $46 a share, an 18 per cent premium over Taleo’s closing price on Wednesday.
104;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-01-24T14:39:47Z;New customers: Retailers experiment on ways to win loyalty;Jessica Twentyman says shoppers are much more ‘chatty’ than they were and looks at how to listen and respond;"In recent years, it has become fashionable among marketers to talk about “empowered customers”.As Robert Bloom, a former advertising boss, points out in his 2010 book, The New Experts, the internet has handed customers three powerful weapons: instant access to information on products and services; immense choice; and real-time price comparison tools.Brand loyalty is dead, Mr Bloom argues, and customers are now calling the shots.It may be more constructive, however, for marketers to think about today’s customers as “chatty”.The internet has changed advertising and marketing for good and digital media, in particular, have transformed the interactions of brands with target audiences from a one-way street of marketing messages to something more akin to a two-way conversation.To start that “conversation”, however, brands need to find a way to break the ice.At Belron, an international windscreen repair and replacement company, customer service agents are using social media tools from Radian6 (owned by Salesforce.com, a software company) to identify and approach potential customers.David Meliveo, marketing director of Autoglass, Belron’s UK brand, explains: “We monitor social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter for mentions of the Autoglass name.“But at the same time, we also search for people talking online in more general terms about vehicle glass. So if you post on Twitter and your update includes the term ‘broken windscreen’, it’s likely that you’ll get a tweet from us, asking if you need help,” he says.In this way, the company is able to initiate a conversation with customers who may not be familiar with the Autoglass brand but are likely to need its services.From that initial contact, customers are typically directed to the Autoglass call-centre or to its website, says Mr Meliveo.If customers choose the website to complete a transaction, that should not mean the conversation is over, says Ashutosh Roy, chief executive of eGain Communications.In addition to tools used by call-centre agents, the company sells software that enables online shoppers – on sites owned by retailers such as Asos.com, Gymboree and Timberland – to ask for help or advice in completing their purchase.“Shopping cart abandonment is a big problem for online retailers,” says Mr Roy.In fact, he adds, analysts at Forrester Research, an IT market analyst company, believe that as many as 83 per cent of online purchases are abandoned before the transaction is complete.“People get confused by the process itself or they simply get overwhelmed by choice,” he says.“In that situation, it’s vital that the business can jump in and guide them through the sales process – if that’s what they want.”But it is not just the conversations that take place between a brand and prospective customers that help convert browsers to buyers.At BT, the UK telecoms company, Bian Salins, the head of social media innovation, believes the conversations customers have with each other can be just as valuable as those they have with the provider.That is particularly true when it comes to service and support, she says.“Our social media strategy is two-fold. First, we take our conversations to where our customers are, such as Twitter.“Second, we host a community forum on our site, where customers can discuss the service and support they’re receiving.”While this community forum, based on software from Lithium Technologies and launched in January 2010, is primarily aimed at existing customers, she says, it has proved valuable in attracting new ones to BT.“Over time, the more prominent the community has become and the more word-of-mouth has spread, we find that people who aren’t currently BT customers are registering for the community to ask about service quality, pricing, that sort of thing,” she says.In fact, all companies should be thinking of doing more outside the confines of the traditional marketing department in order to engage chatty, empowered customers for whom traditional “push” advertising is increasingly irrelevant, according to a recent report from McKinsey, a management consultancy.“In today’s marketing environment, companies will be better off if they stop viewing customer engagement as a series of discrete interactions and instead think about it as customers do: a set of related interactions that, added together, make up the customer experience,” the report’s authors argue."
105;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-01-19T22:09:43Z;Tech stocks shine as S&P 500 consolidates gains;BofA climbs on fourth-quarter profit;A strong day for tech stocks helped the S&P 500 consolidate gains to close above 1,300 for a second consecutive day, hitting a five-month high.F5 Networks rose 10.6 per cent to $120, after the computer network provider narrowly beat analyst expectations for fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a strong start to 2012, despite falling revenues from government clients.F5’s market cap has now increased fivefold since the start of 2009, leaving some analysts cautious about the potential for further gains. “At over 24 times our full year 2012 expected earnings per share, we believe more earnings momentum is needed to keep the stock moving up,” said Rod Hall at JPMorgan.F5’s result provided a fillip to other networking and software companies. Juniper Networks advanced 6.1 per cent $23.88, while Cisco Systems was one of the best performers in the Dow Jones index, putting on 1.3 per cent to $19.79 ahead of results.Semiconductor manufacturer NetApp was up 8.3 per cent to $37.51 on reports it could be a subject of takeover bids.Cloud business software developer Salesforce.com rallied 6.3 per cent to $114.51 as Canaccord Genuity analysts said the company’s recent weakness on new billings, could prove temporary, “and not necessarily indicative of [the] firm’s outlook”.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,788.33, but Google, the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, plunged 10 per cent to $581.35 in after-hours trading, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a large margin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced just 0.4 per cent to 12,623.98. The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 1,314.50, a gain of 4.5 per cent for the year.The benchmark index is set for its best January since 1997, but analysts warned a disappointing start to the earnings season could weigh on the index. Of the 59 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday afternoon, only 49 per cent had beat expectations, the lowest level in 10 years, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“Investors are now faced with losing the catalyst that strong earnings growth typically provides during reporting season,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Bank stocks continued to rally, as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America beat analyst expectations with fourth-quarter results, but materials, the other star sector of this year’s rally, sold off as profit fell at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining lowered its 2012 copper production forecast.BofA eked out a fourth-quarter profit on strong loan growth, although a lossmaking quarter for its investment banking unit weighed on performance, continuing the trend set by JPMorgan and Citigroup.Morgan Stanley declared a loss, but one that was much smaller than expected by analysts, as the investment bank bucked the trend to report an increase in trading revenue.BofA closed up 2.4 per cent to $6.96, after breaching $7 for the first time since the end of October in the morning session. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $18.28. Other big bank stocks also rallied, except for Wells Fargo, which slipped 0.3 per cent to $30.15.Regional bank Huntington Bancshares fell 4 per cent to $5.79 as its average return on assets fell slightly despite a surge in lending, as the low interest rate environment appeared to take a toll.Freeport-McMoRan opened 2.5 per cent lower, before paring losses to end the day off just 0.2 per cent to $44.37. Fourth-quarter profit of $640m was less than half the figure for the same period in 2010. But many analysts had predicted worse results, after labour disputes hit production at its Indonesian mines in the fourth quarter. Newmont Mining fell 1.2 per cent to $59.60, after raising its forecast for gold output, but lowering guidance on copper extraction.Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies continued their torrid 2012, after natural gas futures, which have been plummeting for some time, hit a decade low.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 6.5 per cent to $63.09 and Range Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $54.06. Cabot is now off almost 17 per cent year to date.Ebay climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.51, as the company beat fourth-quarter estimates, thanks mainly to heavy usage of its PayPal electronic payments site. But some analysts focused on the less than stellar performance at Ebay’s core internet auction website business.“We continue to question the sustainability of the recent mid-teens core general merchandise volume growth rates heading to 2012,” said Brian Nowak at Nomura.Car parts manufacturer Johnson Controls slumped 8.4 per cent to $32.60 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 as the company lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing weakness in demand from Europe.But the aircraft part supplier Rockwell Collins climbed 5.5 per cent to $59.96 after the company said it was doubling production of parts for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner this quarter.First Solar slumped 10 per cent to $38.70, on reports the German government will cut subsidies for solar energy. The solar industry remains heavily dependent on support from eurozone governments for demand.Eastman Kodak, the company that invented the handheld camera, ended a prolonged share price slide by filing for bankruptcy. The shares were last trading at 36 cents.
106;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2012-01-16T23:20:57Z;Intuitive Surgical: cutting the mustard;It is very profitable but it is crucial the company steps up international sales;Intuitive Surgical has the key ingredients of a go-go growth stock: torrid revenue growth, a profitable business model, and robots. The company, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, makes systems that allow doctors to perform minimally invasive surgery while sitting at a video-game like console, using hand controls to manipulate a scope and tools within the patient’s body, by way of four mechanical arms.Revenue growth has averaged 40 per cent over the past five years. The business runs on a razors and blades model, with more than half of the revenue from recurring sales of accessories and from service contracts. It is very profitable, due in part to a near monopoly in robotic surgery, and has $2bn in net cash.All the excitement has left Intuitive shares selling at north of 20 times this year’s estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It has little company at this heady altitude, now that some of the biggest momentum stocks, such as Netflix and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, have cracked. A Capital IQ screen finds only eight other US companies (outside of real estate) valued at more than $10bn trading at 20 times ebitda or higher, including Amazon, Groupon and Salesforce.com.If Intuitive can maintain growth near recent levels, it merits the price tag. But despite being in a defensive sector, a sharp sales slowdown in 2008-2009 shows that the company is sensitive to hospitals’ capital budgets and, therefore, the economy. JPMorgan notes that many of the largest US hospital groups now own Intuitive systems, which, at $1m-$2m apiece, are harder for smaller hospitals to afford. So it is crucial that the company steps up international sales, now just a fifth of the total. If growth slows, the market will perform a very invasive procedure on Intuitive’s stock.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The S&P 500 closed at 1,277.3, less than a quarter of a point up for the day, with financials bearing the brunt of selling, off 0.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $15.94, while the afterglow from Citigroup’s $2.5bn bond offering on Tuesday, its largest such debt issue since 2009, did not last long. Its shares fell 0.6 per cent to $28.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2 per cent to 12,418,42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,648.36, although the Nasdaq had opened sharply lower as technology stocks suffered.Ebay, the auction website, fell 3.8 per cent to $30.16 after Yahoopoached Scott Thompson from Ebay-owned PayPal as its new chief executive. Yahoo investors were unimpressed however, sending shares down 3.1 per cent to $15.78.Data storage company Netapp fell 3.1 per cent to $35.64 after a downgrade from Credit Suisse analysts, who tipped the company’s rate of market share growth to slow in 2012.Shares in Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, slumped 3.7 per cent to $97.48. The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter. However Netflix did not provide comparative figures for previous quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas climbed 7.2 per cent to $82.32 after the company raised its dividend 33 per cent to 16 cents a share and announced that it had doubled production in the Marcellus Shale during 2011. Separately, Cabot announced a two-for-one stock split.Shares of car vendor AutoNation fell 6.8 per cent to $33.26 after Edward Lampert’s ESL fund cut its stake in the company to 52.5 per cent from 56.4 per cent. Mr Lampert also reduced ESL’s stake in car parts retailer AutoZone to 12.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent, but after falling sharply at the open, shares recovered to close 2.2 per cent higher at $326.96.Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 2.2 per cent to $348.75 after Goldman Sachs analysts added the fast food restaurant to its “conviction buy” list, tipping the company for earnings growth of 35-0 per cent this year as food costs fall, boosting margins.Shares in Chipotle rose almost 60 per cent in 2011 after more than doubling in value in 2010.Ford Motors rose 1.5 per cent to $11.30 as December sales rose 10 per cent, beating most analyst estimates. General Motors saw December sales growth of 5 per cent, which gave shares a 0.5 per cent fillip to $21.15. Both companies were left in the dust by Chrysler, which saw December sales leap 37 per cent compared with the previous year.Discount website Groupon fell 2.5 per cent to $18.79, significantly below the $20 offer price for its November IPO.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 3.1 per cent to $34.70 as the Commerce Department said a decision on additional tariffs for Chinese solar-equipment would be delayed by a month to mid-February.CF Industries was up 2.7 per cent to $157.99, after Citigroup analysts recommended the nitrogen fertiliser producer.""Given the recent slowdown in fertiliser sales, we now prefer nitrogen as our top nutrient – nitrogen cannot be stored in the ground so its application tends to be steady,” Citi analysts told clients. MasterCard, off 3.3 per cent to $356.25, and Visa, off 1.8 per cent to $101.15, both fell as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its buy recommendations from both stocks.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare slid 5.4 per cent to $4.69, as investors continued to fret about long-term government funding for Medicare after Citigroup downgraded the sector on Tuesday."
108;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-12-23T21:42:49Z;NYSE falls behind as S&P 500 solidifies gains;;Tech stocks sat out a good week for equities, as an earnings miss by Oracle led to a sell off in the software sector on Wednesday.Oracle ended the week down 10.8 per cent to $26.06 after revenues rose just 2 per cent to $8.8bn in the three months to the end of November compared with the 7 per cent growth that had been forecast, as corporate customers delayed purchases.“Management noted that IT budgets were not reduced, rather the sales cycle increased as additional levels of approval were required, which is typical of a macro slowdown,” said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund.“Cloud” software company Red Hat, which had lowered 2012 guidance earlier in the week, fell 12.7 per cent to $41.59 and Salesforce.com, a fast-growing software company, whose contract growth has slowed markedly in the past month, fell 8.4 per cent to $98.02.That meant the Nasdaq ended the week up just 2 per cent to 2,618.64, underperforming other US indices, and still in negative territory for the year.The S&P 500 climbed 3.7 per cent over the week to 1,265.31, putting the benchmark index into the red for December, historically a good month for equities, and, more importantly, just into positive territory for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 per cent to 12,294.00. That left the large-cap index up more than 6 per cent for the year, but analysts were quick to stamp on suggestions that meant US equities had enjoyed a good year.Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, pointed out that just two stocks – IBM and McDonald’s – had accounted for half of the Dow’s gains this year.“That’s a function of the way the DJIA is constructed – weighted by stock price rather than market cap – as well as the strong performance of these two stocks,” Mr Colas commented.The Dow has also been helped by the small number of financials in the index, and the low stock prices of the banks that are in the index. Bank of America has traded in a range of $4.92 to $15.31 this year and JPMorgan $27.85 to $48.36, meaning they do not move the price-weighted index significantly.On Friday, for example, BofA shares climbed 2.4 per cent to $5.60 for the best performance in the Dow, but that did not even shift the index 1 point, whereas a gain of just 1.5 per cent to $184.75 for IBM shifted the index more than 20 points.The Nasdaq and S&P 500, both market capitalisation-weighted indices, both lag the Dow by more than 5 per cent in the year to date.Shares in NYSE Euronext lagged behind the market up just 0.6 per cent to $26.38, despite receiving approval from US regulators for its proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Börse.Analysts at Raymond James said the deal was still likely to be blocked, as European regulators remain concerned about competition within the exchange space. Raymond James cut its 12-month price target for the exchange to $36 from $42, based on a 33 per cent probability the merger will go ahead.Akamai Technologies was a rare bright spot among tech stocks, climbing 19.8 per cent to $31.93 as investors in the internet services company applauded its $268m purchase of Contendo, a “cloud” services company.“This is a very positive move,” said Michael Turits, a tech analyst at Raymond James. “Akamai are doubling down on the cloud side of their business, which has seen faster growth and has higher margins than their core video acceleration business.”First Solar climbed 8.7 per cent to $34.70. lnvestors picked up shares in the world’s largest solar panel manufacturer by market capitalisation after Robert W Baird analysts said it could be subject to a takeover bid, after its valuation tumbled 75 per cent over the year.Takeover speculation was fuelled late in the week when Total boosted its stake in SunPower, a smaller panel maker, to 66 per cent. SunPower shares climbed 17 per cent to $6.00.TripAdvisor fell 13.3 per cent to $25.15, in its first three days of trading on the Nasdaq, after it was spun out from its parent, the travel booking website Expedia.Investors had shown strong interest in the travel review website as it traded in a “when-issued” market for two weeks before its formal listing, once Expedia shareholders had approved the spin off. But several analysts offered negative opinions once the stock was trading.A Morgan Stanley recommendation to sell the stock on Thursday, which citied expected margin compression and greater competition from online search engines, led to a 10 per cent fall.Mead Johnson Nutrition slumped 10.5 per cent over the week to $65.29, as it battled negative publicity after a newborn baby died in Missouri after being given one of its powdered products.Both Walmart, where the Mead product was bought, and Supervalu, the operator of Jewel-Osco supermarkets, pulled the Enfamil powdered baby food formula from their shelves, citing an “abundance of caution,” as investigations continued as to the cause of death.The CBOE Vix index of equity volatility continued to fall. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” has now dropped more than 25 per cent over the month and is trading at 20.88, meaning the price of options on the S&P 500 have tumbled during December.
109;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

The technology-heavy index fell 1 per cent to 2,577.97.Research In Motion was one of the few bright spots, climbing 10.1 per cent to $13.78 on hopes that it could be an acquisition target after reports that Yahoo had considered a bid for the BlackBerry handset manufacturer.RIM’s market capitalisation has fallen 75 per cent this year due to poor sales of its PlayBook tablet
and a failure of its BlackBerry network but analysts said the share price may fall further before a buy-out.“We expect to see further pressure on RIM’s share price,” said Stuart Jeffrey at Nomura. “While we believe that RIM shares could be worth $15 in a gradual wind-down scenario, we don’t see financial buyers bidding until the stock falls below $10.”Shares in Yahoo itself were on the move too, climbing 5.9 per cent to $15.99 late in the day on reports the internet portal will sell Alibaba Group and its Japanese affiliate back to their majority holders in a deal that could be worth $17bn.Tech stocks also weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ended the day flat at 12,107.74, with IBM off 3.1 per cent to $181.47 and Cisco Systems down 2.7 per cent to $17.92.The S&P 500 edged up 0.2 per cent to 1,243.72, turning positive late in the day, despite Moody’s warning of a possible downgrade to US sovereign debt in 2012.The S&P 500 had opened lower as European nerves returned, after strong demand from the continent’s banks for three-year loans from the European Central Bank.US bank stocks also reversed early losses to close in positive territory, with Bank of America up 1.2 per cent to $5.23.Oil producers showed firmness as the price of crude oil edged up for a second day, nearing $100 a barrel, after falling as low as $94 last week. Among the smaller explorers, Noble Energy was up 1.9 per cent to $94.56 while, among the majors, ExxonMobil rose 1.4 per cent to $83.12.Cintas Corp rose 9.3 per cent to $34.19 for the best performance in the S&P 500. The provider of bathroom supplies and entrance mats raised its fiscal year 2012 profit forecast to at least $2.16 a share, 13 cents higher than expected.Nike climbed 2.9 per cent to $96.35 after the world’s largest sports goods company reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates by 12 per cent on strong North American sales.Walgreen shares tumbled more than 5 per cent in early trading after the pharmacy missed earnings estimates on declining market share, but shares recovered to close down just 0.4 per cent to $33.37.Rival CVS Caremark ticked up another 1.7 per cent to $40.46 after surging 9 per cent on Tuesday, as it raised its dividend.The CBOE’s Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 fell to its lowest level since the start of August, closing at 21.63. It had consistently traded above 30 from August through November."
111;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-12-21T19:14:05Z;Oracle: big issue;Expectations must be trimmed for all business technology vendors;Stock market bulls have argued in recent years that, while spending by indebted consumers and governments is likely to remain sickly, big companies, which are enjoying record profitability and strong balance sheets, are in rude health and will spend to grow further. The 14 per cent fall in Oracle’s shares early on Wednesday after its weak earnings report suggests that this particular stool’s one good leg is becoming wobbly.Oracle sells more software to big companies across industries and geographies than anyone else. In the past quarter, new software licence revenues grew just 2 per cent, a 10th of the rate of a year ago. It appears that those robust global companies are feeling a bit cautious. The pressing issue is what this means for the earnings of other big business technology vendors. These fit into two camps: the slow-growing value plays, and innovative growth plays (Oracle falls between the two).Consider a representative sample of the former – IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, SAP, Dell and Xerox. Analysts expect near-term sales growth in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range on average. Even this may be a bit optimistic, but the reason to own these stocks is their cash generation and low valuations more than their revenue trajectory. For the latter group – EMC, VMware, Salesforce.com, NetApp – the outlook is for strong double-digit growth. If the slowdown reaches cutting-edge parts of data storage, virtualisation and cloud computing, look out.Oracle is not a perfect bellwether. Last week’s results from technology services leader Accenture were solid. Business technology spending has not simply stopped. But Oracle’s results are unsettling, not just for other technology companies but for companies and investors who have hitched their financial wagons to the fortunes of the world’s largest companies.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
112;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Oracle’s earnings miss chills tech stocks;;Shares in technology companies fell across the board on Wednesday morning after investors took fright at an unexpected slowdown in sales growth at Oracle in the latest quarter and earnings that fell short of forecasts.Oracle shares were down 8 per cent in pre-market trading, as two large brokerages cut their price targets for the stock. SAP, Oracle’s European rival, was down 4.3 per cent in morning trade, while Capgemini, Europe’s largest IT services company, was down 4.36 per cent. Atos, another IT services company was down 2.36 per cent and Software AG, the German software company, fell 2.8 per cent.“We have seen a dramatic deceleration in new business for Salesforce.com and slowing growth from Red Hat recently,” said analysts at JP Morgan. “This may be just the beginning of a long list of IT companies that struggle in the next quarter or more.”The world’s second-biggest software company after Microsoft, Oracle had previously proved one of the most resilient tech companies amid the recent financial crisis and ensuing economic headwinds.However, news on Tuesday that its revenues had grown by only 2 per cent to $8.8bn, compared to the 7 per cent growth that had been expected in the three months to the end of November, sent a chill across the tech sector.The sales weakness was caused by delays in finalising big purchases late in the quarter, said Safra Catz, Oracle co-president. This reflected changes by some companies in the way they approve big new tech purchases, leaving the final decision with their chief executive officers, she added.In the past, requiring more senior approval on purchases has often reflected growing caution on the part of customers and foreshadowed a broader sales slowdown in the tech sector. However, Ms Catz and other Oracle executives described the impact as temporary and said that tighter management of the sales process, along with the addition of 1,700 extra sales staff, would see the company bounce back.Despite the show of confidence, the maker of database and business application software also issued a cautious forecast for its current quarter, predicting that revenues would increase by 2-5 per cent from a year before, compared to the 8 per cent analysts had been expecting. Pro-forma earnings per share are likely to reach 55-58 cents, it added, compared to the 59 cents expected by Wall Street.As the first of the big tech concerns to report earnings and a bellwether for tech spending by big companies and governments, Oracle’s results were seen as a sign that falling confidence had eaten into tech spending at what is traditionally the strongest period of the year for IT suppliers.The sales weakness was reflected in growth of only 2 per cent in new software licences, compared to the 6-16 per cent that the company itself had predicted three months before. New software licences are seen as a key indicator of underlying business health, since the company’s future maintenance revenues are closely tied to the level of new sales.The company’s hardware division also registered another decline in sales, reflecting growing pressure on a business that Oracle assumed with its acquisition of Sun Microsystems a year ago. Sales fell by 14 per cent to $953m.On the pro forma basis on which Wall Street judges the company, Oracle reported net income of $2.8bn, or 54 cents a share, compared to the 57 cents analysts had expected. Based on formal accounting rules, net income rose by 17 per cent to $2.2bn, or 43 cents a share.
113;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-12-12T22:55:53Z;Semiconductors in sharp sell-off;;Semiconductor manufacturers sold off sharply after Intellowered fourth-quarter revenue guidance by $1bn to $13.7bn, plus or minus $300m.Intel fell 4 per cent to $24.00 while smaller rivals Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia fell 4.3 per cent to $5.30 and 2.5 per cent to $14.53 respectively.Intel said disruption to the hard drive supply chain, a result of Thai flooding, had led PC makers to run down inventories, hitting demand for its microprocessors. It said demand would return to normal in the first half of 2012.But not all analysts were convinced. “We believe Intel somewhat over-shipped real end-demand in the second and third quarters,” Tristan Gerra, a tech analyst at Baird, told clients.“Our field research points to 10 to 15 per cent excess CPU [Intel chips] inventories at PC manufacturers in the third quarter.”Mr Gerra said Intel could face low demand until the third quarter of 2012.Elsewhere, broad markets traded sharply lower as investors reassessed the eurozone deal announced on Friday. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,236.47, although the index had fallen as low as 1,227 before a late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 12,021.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,612.26.“Participants didn’t want to be short last week, because the risk was to the upside in case the summit came up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Now investors are more willing to exit, and they’re telling us European leaders didn’t do enough.”Cyclical bank and material stocks led the fallers, with Morgan Stanley off 6.1 per cent to $15.38 and Alpha Natural Resources falling 8.8 per cent to $21.39.Citigroup also fell 5.4 per cent to $27.22 and Bank of America fell 4.7 per cent to $5.45, even though Richard Ramsden, Goldman Sachs’ US banks analyst, was broadly positive on the sector after Goldman’s bank conference last week.Mr Ramsden told clients that conference participants had pointed to strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, and suggested all major US banks would pass tougher Fed stress tests.Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, fell 6.3 per cent to $116.07. Peter Goldmacher, a tech analyst at Cowen, said rapid sales growth, which has seen the market cap of the company explode since 2009, might be coming to an end.“Billings growth is the primary metric that drives Salesforce and we believe normalised billings growth is slowing faster than expectations,” Mr Goldmacher told clients. He also criticised management for offering low visibility on performance metrics, and said a move to annual rather than monthly billing would inflate revenue in the short term, but could drive away smaller customers who “prefer more favourable payment terms”.Diamond Foods’ prospective takeover of Pringles from Procter & Gamble appeared to be on ice again, as the group failed to publish its quarterly earnings report on schedule, as its auditor investigates allegations of inappropriate payments to walnut growers.Shares were down 22.8 per cent to $31.30.Vulcan Materials was the standout performer in the S&P 500. Shares rose 15.4 per cent to $39.48, after its smaller rival, Martin Marietta, launched a hostile takeover, offering half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share. Martin Marietta climbed 1.7 per cent to $74.61.M&A hopes helped Netflix to a 6.2 per cent gain. Shares climbed to $75.26 on chatter than Amazon or Verizon could make a play for the video-streaming website, which has seen its share price fall from more than $300 this year.Apple provided ballast for tech shares, falling just 0.5 per cent to $391.84, as Brian White, analyst at Ticonderoga, said the iPhone maker had its best November on record with sales up 17 per cent month on month.Lockheed Martin bucked the market, falling just 0.7 per cent to $74.61 after the Pentagon said it had placed a $4bn order for 30F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets.Edwards Lifesciences climbed 5.1 per cent to $67.85, on the back of upgrades from several analysts. A Morgan Keegan noted pointed to the group’s strong product pipeline and prospects in China.General Motors fell 1.7 per cent to $20.80, relatively unaffected by a decision to halt production of its Chevrolet Cruze at its Lordstown plant, which GM blamed on a supplier issue.
114;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-12-08T22:57:49Z;Big software groups buy into the cloud;Companies pay premiums for web-based start-ups;While companies are upgrading their IT infrastructure to take into account megatrends such as the shift to cloud computing and the growing importance of business analytics and “big data”, the enterprise software market itself is undergoing something of a metamorphosis.In the past few months, three premium-priced software acquisitions have highlighted the changes under way in the enterprise software market.First, Oracle agreed to buy RightNow Technologies, a leading provider of cloud-based call centre automation, sales force automation (SFA) and customer relationship management (CRM) services for $1.43bn.Then on Saturday, Germany’s SAP announced plans to buy SuccessFactors, a cloud-based human resource management service, for $3.4bn – a 52 per cent premium over the previous day’s closing price.Now, International Business Machines has agreed to acquire DemandTec for $440m. DemandTec’s flagship product analyses data to help retailers decide how much to charge for their wares. The company has added capabilities to track promotions and work with consumer products companies.All three deals highlight the trend of established big tech companies paying big premiums for relatively young companies offering web-based software to fill out their cloud-enabled product portfolios.For their business customers, these deals could be something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, they should enable the acquirers to provide a more complete “one-stop shop” for cloud-based business applications. On the other hand, some analysts fear they could reduce competition and perhaps even stifle innovation.Oracle in particular has been scrambling to assemble a full range of cloud solutions, including sales force automation, human resources, talent management and social networking, as part of its Oracle Public Cloud initiative.Oracle, seen by some as being a latecomer to the cloud party, and RightNow should be able to offer what Oracle describes as “a superior customer experience at every contact and across every channel”.The deal also represents an important counterweight for Oracle in its continuing battle with Salesforce.com, the market leader. RightNow, which has about 2,000 customers, is seen as something of an also-ran to Salesforce.com and will bring some customers into the mix, but more importantly it will bring a mid-market CRM solution to Oracle.Similarly, SAP’s purchase of SuccessFactors should help Europe’s biggest software group to expand its offerings of the cloud-based services many of its customers have been clamouring for.SuccessFactors provides software that helps companies manage their workforce, hosted in remote data centres or “the cloud”. With 15m subscriptions at more than 3,500 companies worldwide, it is believed to be the second-largest cloud-based provider of enterprise software after Salesforce.com.SAP’s own cloud-based offering, Business by Design, has taken longer than expected to develop and has seen a relatively slow uptake among customers. “The cloud is a core of SAP’s future growth, and the combination of SuccessFactors’ leadership team and technology with SAP will create a cloud powerhouse,” said Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive, when he announced the deal.IBM’s $13.20-a-share purchase of DemandTec – a 57 per cent premium over DemandTec’s closing price on Wednesday – follows a similar logic.The agreed purchase will help IBM build on its focus of providing its customers with the tools to extract value from the huge volumes of data that they are now able to collect from point-of-sale and other applications.DemandTec’s complex number-crunching applications help customers make business decisions based on near real-time data, and its purchase will extend IBM’s own push into cloud-based software and services.“DemandTec has unprecedented capability to improve customers’ price and promotion tactics,” Craig Hayman, general manager of industry solutions at IBM, said in a statement.DemandTec’s biggest customers are US retailers trying to make sense of the gargantuan volumes of data they collect from shoppers.In the fiscal second quarter, 23 per cent of DemandTec’s $22m in revenue came from Target. Walmart Stores is another big customer. The company reportedly charges its biggest customers about $2m a year for access to its pricing program, which is primarily designed to help them fine-tune their sales forecasts and predict consumer demand.The purchase will complement IBM’s “smarter commerce” portfolio, which it introduced earlier this year with DemandTec’s pricing functionality adding to IBM’s existing business analytics tools focused on marketing, mobile devices and other areas. IBM says the portfolio addresses a market opportunity the company that could worth $20bn or more by 2015.
115;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-12-05T15:28:17Z;Medical technology companies lead Wall St rally;Financial sector surges on possible Eurozone deal;Healthcare stocks bounced back from Friday’s big sell-off but analysts remained concerned that government healthcare schemes may limit expensive cardiovascular and orthopedic treatments.Hospital manager Tenet Healthcare jumped 12.4 per cent to $4.70, reversing nearly all of its losses from Friday, when Wells Fargo analysts had said 11 different states will study heart, knee and spine cases before agreeing to pay for hospital stays and treatments.Nuvasive, which manufactures equipment for spinal surgery, popped 13.3 per cent to $14.53, also recovering all of Friday’s losses.St Jude Medical, Medtronic and Boston Scientific rose 3.9 per cent to $37.21, 4 per cent to $35.98 and 1.8 per cent to $5.60, respectively, but were still several percentage points lower than Friday’s opening price.Analysts were struggling to understand the implications of a pilot scheme, announced in November by the Centre for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to conduct checks before authorising some treatments in states with high levels of improper payments.Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo’s hospital analyst, said all 11 states involved in the pilot would follow the example of Florida and begin pre-auditing a wide range of treatments, forcing hospital management companies to cut back on procedures to avoid falling foul off the audit schemes.“This will likely reduce procedure volume because hospitals will begin making sure that every patient meets the coverage criteria,” Mr Biegelsen told clients.But a Credit Suisse note, arguing that the procedures in question accounted for only 1 per cent of hospital revenues helped Tenet recover losses.The CMS also refused to confirm what shape the pilot scheme would take in states other than Florida, leading other analysts to conclude the sell-off in device makers was overdone.Elsewhere, US stocks were broadly positive with the S&P 500 closing up 1 per cent to 1,257.08. The benchmark US index had been us as much as 1.5 per cent before news the Standard and Poor’s is reviewing its sovereign rating on 6 eurozone sovereigns including Germany, knocked stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 per cent to 12,097.83.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.1 per cent to 2,655.76.“Positive news flow from Europe is driving stocks,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at ING.“But the S&P 500 is seeing resistance at the 200-day moving average above 1,260. If you were long from the November lows, it’s a good place to take profit and, if you have money on the sidelines, it seems a bit high to be initiating new long positions,” he added.Bank stocks led the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 handily outperforming all other sectors with a 2.1 per cent rise.Morgan Stanley climbed 6.8 per cent to $16.57. New York-based investment bank Jefferies continued to rally, rising 4 per cent to $12.90.As recently as two weeks ago, the bank had hit year lows of $9.50 on concern about its exposures to European sovereign debt and short-term funding needs.Citigroup climbed 5.9 per cent to $29.83.Goldman Sachs financial services analyst Richard Ramsden beat the drum for US banks ahead of a Goldman banking conference this week.“Fundamentals don’t appear nearly as bad as valuations imply,” he told clients, while acknowledging that hedge funds significantly reduced their weightings to financials in the third quarter.Newfield Exploration fell 3.4 per cent to $44.03 as investors reacted guardedly to its agreement to supply Tesoro Corporation’s Salt Lake City refinery with 18,000 barrels of oil per day from 2013 from planned growth in the Uinta Basin.“Management had been flagging this announcement for a week,” said Subash Chandra, an oil analyst at Jefferies, “but when it came it was underwhelming. There’s no revenue till 2013, and we’re still waiting for updates from new fields within the basin.”Time Warner fell 1.7 per cent to $62.71 on mixed reaction to its plans to make films available for consumers to watch on any platform through a cloud verification service.Gannett climbed 10.2 per cent to $13.13 after Lazard analysts recommended clients buy the stock, tipping the media company to raise its dividend soon.“Cloud” software provider Salesforce.com was the main beneficiary of a Standard and Poor’s note forecasting a round of acquisitions in the software industry. Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $125.01.MetLife rose 3.7 per cent to $32.92. The largest US life insurer said 2012 earnings may reach $5.20 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $5.08 a share.Staples rallied 5.6 per cent to $15.13 after positive coverage over the weekend, which suggested that the stock could rise as high as $22 in the next year if the economy improves and companies spend more on office supplies.
116;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-12-03T18:46:00Z;SAP buys SuccessFactors for $3.4bn cash;Acquisition boosts cloud computing services;SAP, Europe’s largest software company by sales, is to buy SuccessFactors, the provider of cloud-based human resource management software, for $3.4bn in cash, in an effort to make itself a “cloud powerhouse”.SAP will pay $40 per share for the California-based company, which represents a 52 per cent premium over SuccessFactors’ closing price on Friday.The deal will help boost SAP’s ability to offer software to companies as a service over the internet, something which the German company has been previously criticised for lacking.SuccessFactors provides software that helps companies manage their workforce, hosted in remote data centres or “the cloud”. With 15m subscriptions at more than 3500 companies worldwide, it is believed to be the second largest cloud-based provider of enterprise software after Salesforce.com.SAP’s own cloud-based offering, Business by Design, took longer-than-expected to develop and has seen relatively slow uptake among customers. “The cloud is a core of SAP’s future growth and the combination of SuccessFactors’ leadership team and technology with SAP will create a cloud powerhouse,” said Bill McDermott, SAP’s co-chief executive.Lars Dalgaard, the chief executive of SuccessFactors, will run SAP’s cloud business following the deal.The cloud is a core of SAP’s future growthThe transaction will be SAP’s largest since May last year, when the Walldorf-based company bought Sybased, its US peer, for $5.8bn. The deal also follows indications from Jim Snabe, SAP’s co-chief executive, said earlier this year that he was looking for further, big acquisitions after the company’s cash reserves had been boosted by nearly two years of strong trading.The deal will be funded from SAP’s cash pile and a €1bn term loan facility. It is dependent on getting agreement from a majority of SuccessFactors’ shareholders.SAP said the deal was expected to close in the first quarter of 2012 and would be slightly dilutive to SAP’s earnings per share next year.
117;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-11-18T21:25:27Z;Stocks slip even as euro rebounds;;Friday 21:05 GMT. A stronger euro and a decline in Italian bond yields helped European stocks pare losses but Wall Street slipped slightly as eurozone sovereign debt issues continued to drive investor sentiment.Charts of European bond yields and the single currency remain an important driver of trader psyche, with particular attention paid to the cost of Spanish paper ahead of the country’s general election this weekend.Madrid’s 10-year yield spiked 41 basis points to a euro-era record of 6.90 per cent following this week’s poor auction. The benchmark yield eased a bit by the session’s end, up 26bp to 6.74 per cent, though Rome’s paper fell 21bp to 6.63 per cent.Europe’s benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 index had initially tracked a poor showing out of Asia, at one point shedding more than 1 per cent, but ended the day down 0.7 per cent.Wall Street’s S&P 500 held firm, though by the close it had slipped fractionally, to 1,216. Sentiment was dominated by a poor quarterly result for Salesforce, a closely watched “cloud” computing business software group whose 10 per cent fall led a broad drop in S&P 500 tech shares of 0.7 per cent.This leaves the FTSE All-World index down 0.7 per cent, taking its loss for the week to 4 per cent.The US’s tepid trading comes despite the index of leading indicators coming in surprisingly strong on Friday, continuing the string of economic surprises that have put Citigroup’s index of better than forecast economic reports at its highest level in a year.But the less fretful tone has helped reduce demand for “core” debt, such as that sold by the US, Germany and the UK, where yields are nudging higher by several basis points. Ten-year US Treasury yields were up 5 basis points to 2.01 per cent.The mixed trading is evidence that – in spite of better than expected US macro data of late, such as Friday’s October leading indicator data – anxiety about the west’s budget crisis is affecting the worlds’s financial arteries. This in turn may potentially hobble commerce – especially business spending – and cause a “double dip” recession in some major economies, fear the pessimists.As banks become more nervous about doing business with each other the cost of swapping euros into dollars has jumped. The euro/dollar three-month basis swap hit minus 136 basis points on Thursday, the widest spread since the 2008 financial tremors. On Friday, the spread is minus 133bp.Investors are also beginning to pay more attention to the looming November 23 deadline for the US’s so-called congressional supercommittee to agree measures to avoid slashes to spending across-the-board.The budget talks have hit an impasse over tax cuts demanded by Republicans, and have been described as “floundering” and “deadlocked” in US reports. However, many investors have also shrugged off the importance of the talks, since it is unlikely they will trigger ratings actions on US sovereign credit, and will result in automatic deficit reductions if no agreement is reached.Even when European bourses were initially at their lows, intra-asset moves were suggestive of “risk”, but only mildly so, as traders headed in the weekend a day early.The euro, for example, was looking firm from the off, and is now up 0.4 per cent to $1.3514 – though below its highs – as traders talk of a short squeeze.“A strong gain for the euro currency came despite comments from ECB chief Mario Draghi that suggest he’s unwilling to divert its role from controlling inflation,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.“Investors today appear to have the bit firmly between their teeth in terms of growing hopes that the ECB will agree to draw upon IMF financing in order to stand behind Europe’s beleaguered government bond markets.”The euro’s strength is helping to push the dollar index lower by 0.4 per cent, which in turn is supporting buck-denominated commodities.Copper is up 0.6 per cent to $3.40 a pound and Brent crude is off 0.4 per cent to $107.70 a barrel. After its sharp sell-off on Thursday, gold is fractionally higher at $1,723 an ounce.Earlier, Asian shares fell for a fourth session in a row as growing concerns about property loans pressured Chinese financial shares, while a stronger yen weighed on Japanese exporters.The FTSE Asia Pacific index was down 1.7 per cent, with bulls battered after inheriting a 1.7 per cent fall for Wall Street overnight.China’s real estate sector came under pressure with weakening property sales amid government efforts to cool the once red-hot market. The National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that prices of newly built homes in 34 of 70 large and medium-sized Chinese cities it surveyed fell in October from the previous month.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed 1.7 per cent lower and the Shanghai Composite was off 1.9 per cent.Japanese exporters took an additional hit from a strengthening yen which is up 0.3 per cent to Y76.77 against the US dollar, having clawed back more than half its sharp fall following the Bank of Japan’s intervention at the end of last month.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul and Telis Demos in New York.

As investors in Netflix and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters have recently discovered, the share prices of companies with dizzying valuations can easily lose a third of their value in one day if they report slowing sales.Salesforce.com, a provider of customer relationship software, got off lightly on Friday, a day after it reported growth in billings (revenue plus increases in deferred revenue) that was below expectations. The shares were down just 9 per cent; they still trade at a hefty 70 times next year’s earnings. This gentle treatment makes some sense. Simply looking at sales, the only thing visible is momentum: 36 per cent growth in the latest quarter, accelerating from a year ago.As Bernstein points out, this growth would be more impressive if Salesforce broke out how much of it comes from acquisitions. The company has spent nearly $800m in the past two years buying other businesses. More pressingly, despite its growth, Salesforce is not delivering expense leverage, which should be one of the key features of the “cloud”, or “software as a service”, model. Gross margins on software subscriptions have contracted by 4 percentage points in the past year, raising the question of how acquisitions are changing the product mix. Sales and marketing expenses as a proportion of revenue have risen five points over the same time. As a result, the company has not made operating profits in a year.True, Salesforce has generated nearly $400m in free cash flow in the past year. But counting the company’s stock compensation expenses against this figure, it falls by half. If Salesforce cannot prove that it can control its costs before sales start to slow, investors will not stop and smell the flowers.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
119;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-11-14T21:56:18Z;Retail results fail to cheer Wall Street;IBM boosted by Buffett taking $10bn stake;Solid results from Lowe’s and JC Penney were not enough to prevent US stock markets from opening the week down, as analysts zeroed in on margins at the start of a big week for retail earnings.Lowe’s closed up 1.7 per cent to $23.50, as a 0.7 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales helped earnings beat analyst estimates. But overall income was 44 per cent lower than in the same quarter last year, as the home improvement retailer has been forced to close stores.JC Penney fell 2.8 per cent to $32.98, on a third-quarter loss of $143m. A loss had been expected, as the department store chain is implementing its own restructuring programme, but analysts were troubled that the company lowered fourth-quarter guidance.Bellwethers Walmart, Target and Staples are all set to report results this week, but analysts were downbeat on the retail sector on Monday.The past 13 weeks have seen double-digit percentage returns for eight of the nine consumer discretionary subsectors, signalling to investors of a statistical bent that stocks may be overbought.Company-specific analysts also expressed doubts that retailers could maintain strong margin growth if consumer spending eases.“With gross margins at near-peak levels, mounting headwinds from free online shipping, and ramped promotions and holiday marketing, we remain on the sidelines,” Adrianne Shapira at Goldman Sachs wrote to clients.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, did urge clients to buy more defensive consumer staple names, noting these had set expectations for 2012 margins lower than any other non-financial sector.Broad indices fell, with the S&P 500 down 1 per cent to 1,251.78, following European indices, which suffered losses despite a successful auction of Italian sovereign bonds.Banks again suffered most from investors' eurozone nerves. The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2 per cent, led down by Bank of New York Mellon, which fell 4.5 per cent to $20.55 after announcing it would take a $100m hit in the fourth quarter from restructuring costs.Bank of America dropped 2.6 per cent to $6.05, despite announcing it will pocket $1.8bn in after-tax gains from the sale of more than 10bn shares in China Construction Bank.Joe Morford, US bank analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the sale, which will reduce BofA’s stake in CCB to less than 1 per cent, was inevitable, “given management’s ongoing strategy to strengthen the balance sheet and divest non-core assets”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 12,078.91, given some ballast by Boeing, which gained 1.5 per cent to $67.94, as investors had their first chance to react to the company’s biggest ever civilian aircraft deal – an $18bn agreement to sell at least 50 jets to Emirates.Also in the Dow, Caterpillar was up 0.4 per cent to $96.53, after Goldman Sachs analysts declared the company a “conviction buy” in anticipation of strong margin growth at the earth moving equipment manufacturer.IBM closed fractionally down at $187.35 – a rare occasion when a Warren Buffett investment did not produce a bounce.The “sage of Omaha” revealed Monday morning that his Berkshire Hathaway company had accumulated a $10bn stake in IBM over several months, Mr Buffett’s first tech-centric investment.Unlike Mr Buffett’s previous financial crisis-era investments in the likes of Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, Mr Buffett has purchased common shares in IBM, rather than bargaining with management for guaranteed yields.Mr Buffett revealed the stake during a media interview on Monday morning, causing some consternation that Berkshire Hathaway had not been required to reveal its growing stake in SEC filings.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 2,657.22, given some support by Google shares, which gained 0.6 per cent to $613.00.Salesforce.com rose 2.8 per cent to $133.52 after a glowing “buy” recommendation from Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard for the provider of “cloud” software for businesses.While other analysts have been wary of Salesforce’s high capital spending on an ambitious growth project, Mr Pritchard told clients: “We believe it is nearly mathematically impossible for margins not to accrete meaningfully in the 2013 fiscal year and drive cash flow in excess of consensus.”Miner Titanium Metals was up 1.8 per cent to $15.88, driven by strong options activity, as some investors sought to profit from renewed takeover talk.QEP Resources tumbled 7.6 per cent to $34.21 after the gas explorer forecast 2012 earnings of $1.45bn to $1.55bn, compared to analyst expectations of $1.62bn.Computer Sciences, the IT outsourcing company, continued its precipitous decline. Shares fell 3.9 per cent to $25.46, leaving the stock off 22 per cent since the company slashed full-year guidance last Wednesday, citing weak demand from public sector clients.
120;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Oracle / RightNow;The $1.5bn purchase has some eyebrow-raising elements but Oracle can afford it;The description of RightNow Technologies in its regulatory filings is a tour de force of faddish, incomprehensible business rhetoric. The company sells a “comprehensive customer experience solution for consumer-centric organisations to enable interactions across web, social and contact centre touch points”. Give bosses of technology companies a choice between reading page after page of this to figure out what RightNow does, and simply buying the company blind at a staggering valuation, and they will probably pick the latter.Whether or not Oracle’s $1.5bn purchase of RightNow was done under such duress, it has some eyebrow-raising elements. Oracle is a prolific but usually disciplined acquirer. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chief, commented in June that small and mid-cap software companies were “wildly” overpriced. Yet he has paid 52 times 2012 earnings, and over five times sales, for RightNow.Has Oracle succumbed to the trend for all things “cloud”? RightNow’s software helps companies provide better customer support through their websites and call-centres. It is cloudy in that it is delivered over the internet, as a service, rather than by selling software licences. This distribution model is expanding fast. Average annual growth since 2005 at Salesforce.com, a larger pure-play on cloud software for businesses, has been 40 per cent.Before accusing Oracle of overpaying to grab growth or sex appeal, keep in mind the scale of the deal. Oracle generates $1.5bn in free cash flow every month and a half. It can take a periodic punt at deals such as this, hoping one of them will turn out to be a huge winner, without making a noticeable dent in its strategy or balance sheet. And Oracle’s sheer size means it can get a new product in front of more companies than anyone else. Expensive, yes, but not costly.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
121;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-10-24T17:44:18Z;Oracle to buy RightNow for $1.5bn;;Oracle has mounted one of its biggest acquisitions yet in the fast-growing field of cloud computing, a business that was once denounced by chief executive Larry Ellison as “complete gibberish” and merely the product of technology industry fashion.The US maker of database software on Monday announced an agreement to buy RightNow, a US company whose internet-delivered service is used by companies to manage customer services, for $43 a share in cash, or $1.5bn after taking RightNow’s net cash into account.The deal came on the same day that Workday, one of the best known among a group of private “cloud” software companies, announced it had raised $85m in a fundraising round that one person close to the company said had valued it at $2bn.Both companies are engaged in software-as-a-service, which involves providing a service to companies for a regular subscription rather than selling them software to run on their own computers.For Oracle’s outspoken chief executive, the RightNow deal represents the culmination of a rhetorical about-turn that has been under way in recent months. Mr Ellison denounced early talk of cloud computing as “idiotic” and claimed it was nothing more than the marketing hype that often accompanies new advances in corporate technology.“The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women’s fashion,” he said two years ago.Growing interest among companies in farming out parts of their computing needs to other companies rather than handle them all in-house, however, has led Mr Ellison to change tack and increasingly adopt the marketing language as well as the technologies of cloud computing, most recently with Oracle’s announcement last month of what it called its “public cloud” service.The purchase of RightNow will throw Oracle more directly into competition with Salesforce.com, the leader in selling salesforce and customer service software as a service and a company in which Mr Ellison himself was an early investor. It also puts more pressure on German software maker SAP to move more aggressively into cloud computing, according to Rick Sherlund, software analyst at Nomura.The high valuation accorded to Workday, meanwhile, marks the latest vindication of the course taken by Dave Duffield, an old rival of Mr Ellison, after Oracle bought his former software company, PeopleSoft, after a hostile battle in 2005. With Workday, Mr Duffield set out to reinvent the PeopleSoft applications software business as a cloud-delivered service.Oracle said its offer for RightNow, which represents a 19 per cent premium to the closing price at the end of last week, was expected to close late this year or early in 2012. The Bozeman, Montana-based company reported profits of $194,000, or 1 cent a share, in the second quarter on revenue of $58.4m.
122;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Burberry in step with digital age;;The luxury fashion brand Burberry has spurned glossy magazine adverts in favour of a Facebook campaign to promote the global launch of its latest fragrance, Burberry Body.The company has told the Financial Times that over 60 per cent of its annual marketing budget is now devoted to digital media – more than three times the market average.While bolstering its online presence through social networking sites, Burberry has reduced spending on traditional print advertising, which previously commanded the lion’s share of its budget.On average, digital makes up 15 to 20 per cent of media spending globally. Burberry’s strategy shows how quickly the fashion industry is moving away from magazines as it seeks to interact with consumers worldwide.Over the past week, Burberry has been offering its 8m Facebook followers the chance to receive an expensively packaged sample of its new scent through the post, a more extravagant promotion than a free sample glued to the pages of a fashion magazine. Over 250,000 people worldwide have already signed up, with the majority giving permission for their contact details to remain on Burberry’s database.The digital publicity stunt, backed up with a video message from Christopher Bailey, chief creative officer, has boosted the number of Burberry fans on the social networking site by 500,000 in a week.“You have to be totally connected to anyone who touches your brand,” said Angela Ahrendts, Burberry’s chief executive, addressing the audience at the Salesforce.com conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. “If you don’t do that, I don’t know what your business model is in five years.”A spokeswoman for Burberry conceded that the Facebook campaign was by no means a cheaper option than print, emphasising the investment value of engaging more deeply with customers.The brand has not abandoned traditional media. It has spent millions on making a TV advert, Burberry’s first, for the new fragrance, which will be broadcast in Asia, Europe and the US over the coming weeks. However, in a digital twist, its first airing will be on the brand’s dedicated YouTube channel. On the day of the launch, Burberry is paying an undisclosed sum to “take over” the YouTube homepage in 13 countries including Russia, Hong Kong and India, which it estimates will be seen by 60m viewers.

124;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-05-16T21:30:05Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;Shares in NYSE Euronext fell sharply after Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their bid, while in the wider markets the week kicked off in negative territory after a slew of disappointing economic data and some mixed earnings results.NYSE Euronext dropped 11.1 per cent to $36.36 after a joint bid from Nasdaq and ICE for the exchange was withdrawn. The $11bn offer had been higher than NYSE’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.The two exchanges, which had been threatening to go hostile with their bid after it was rejected by the NYSE board, blamed the move on a failure to secure regulatory approval from US authorities.Shares in Nasdaq lost 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while ICE was up 3.3 per cent to $122.22.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,329.147 as weak data on housing and manufacturing left investors feeling uneasy.Figures from the New York Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing growth in the New York area had fallen to its lowest level in five months.The Empire State manufacturing index fell from 21.7 in April to 11.9 in May, the lowest level since December and well below economists’ expectations of 19.9.Separately, the National Association of Home Builders’ housing market index stayed at low levels, highlighting the weakness of the US housing market.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4 per cent to 12,548.30 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,782.31.This follows a loss of 1.9 per cent on the S&P 500 over the past two weeks as commodity prices tumbled lower and investors worried about the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece.The retail sector lost ground in the session as a week of earnings reports from big industry groups kicked off in a mixed fashion after JC Penney surpassed expectations but Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, released disappointing results.JC Penney, the mid-range US department store, reported first-quarter earnings up 7 per cent, benefiting from cost reductions and from strong sales in its exclusive brand names.But sentiment in the sector was weighed on by Lowe’s lacklustre results.First-quarter net income for the home improvement store fell 6 per cent, as the weak housing market limited demand for remodelling projects.The company blamed the 1.6 per cent fall in sales on poor weather and the housing market. Lowe’s reported earnings of 34 cents a share on net income of $461m, short of the 36 cents a share expected by analysts.Shares in Lowe’s fell 3.6 per cent to $24.83 while JC Penney fell 3.2 per cent to $37.21, dragged down with the rest of the sector.The S&P retail sector was down 1 per cent, one of the worst performing on Wall Street. Last Monday, Macy’s reported strong results and later this week Home Depot, Walmart and Target will report their first-quarter earnings.The general ‘risk off’ trade hit technology stocks the hardest, with the S&P technology index falling 1.5 per cent.These losses were led by Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, was down 8.3 per cent to $14.99 while Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $15.81. Salesforce.com, which provides an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data, lost 4.4 per cent to $128.96.In deal news, Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, bought equipment maker LeTourneau Technologies from Rowan for $1.1bn. The news sent Joy Global up 1 per cent to $88.36, but Rowan lost 0.2 per cent to $37.96.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Siga Technologies added 2.3 per cent to $14.52 after the pharmaceutical company said it had won a $433m contract with the US Department of Health and Human Services to deliver 2m courses of its smallpox antiviral.The contract includes options that would raise the total value to approximately $2.8bn.Merck, another drugmaker, was up 0.6 per cent to $37.30 after it won approval to launch a new hepatitis C drug after the Food and Drug Administration evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in clinical trials.Iron Mountain, the US information storage company, was up 0.7 per cent to $32.67 after Autonomy, the UK software group, said it had agreed to buy selected assets of the company’s digital arm for $380m in cash.
125;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-03-16T20:31:52Z;Apotheker’s to the clouds with new HP vision;Chief attempts to rebrand the world’s biggest IT supplier;When he arrived to run a struggling IBM in the early 1990s, Lou Gerstner famously said the last thing the company needed was a vision.That is not how Léo Apotheker sees things at Hewlett-Packard. For fans of ambitious rhetoric, there was plenty on display this week as the new HP chief executive sought to reposition his sprawling tech conglomerate as an agile player in the world of “cloud computing”. The attempt to rebrand the world’s biggest IT supplier speaks volumes about the challenges of moving to a new computing architecture. The emergence of the cloud – really, just another way of saying that the internet is becoming a computing platform – is one of those seminal changes in IT that arrive every two or three decades to turn the tech world on its head.HP will certainly win no prizes for its slogans. Mr Apotheker summed up his three-part ambition in the leaden phrase: “Cloud, connectivity and software”. In trying to encapsulate how permanent connection to the internet would change work and everyday life, HP had this lame tagline to offer: “Everyone on”.But wrapping tech businesses in the cloak of a shiny new vision is part and parcel of how companies such as HP seek to persuade themselves (and their customers) that they really do have something fresh to offer. In HP’s case, that also means trying to persuade Wall Street that they can generate higher profit margins from much the same set of assets.Sometimes, spreading a little pixie dust is what tech chief executives are paid to do. Steve Jobs’ famous “reality distortion field” has a purpose: it is what you have to do to stimulate demand when you have just created a product for which your customers feel absolutely no current need.For Mr Apotheker, this has meant trying to reposition HP’s massive PC and printer divisions as the “on-ramps” and “off-ramps” to the cloud, and to repackage data centre hardware and software in a services business model. HP is late to this party, though that is not the biggest challenge it faces. A bewildering array of companies is converging on the idea of selling computing as a service online, rather than as hardware boxes and software code that need to be installed, integrated and (expensively) maintained. From Amazon and Google, to start-ups such as Salesforce.com and the heavyweights such as IBM and Microsoft, many have got there before HP and already put their own stamp on things.These transitions do not come easily. It is no coincidence that, with every big shift in computing architecture, new leaders come to the fore and old names fade (though the current renaissances of IBM and Apple stand out). Formerly successful ways of doing things no longer work, and new skills, processes and business models need to be found. Microsoft has spent years learning the skills it takes to shift its desktop and server computing business to the cloud – from running mass consumer online services such as Hotmail (no trivial task) to building the sort of heavy-duty computing platforms to which big companies are prepared to entrust their infrastructure.At the most basic level, that will mean selling access to server capacity and other resources in its own data centres, rather than just selling the servers themselves. This business, known as “infrastructure as a service”, attracts low profit margins, but HP at least starts with the advantage of being able to acquire servers at cost.Moving up the value chain from here is where things will get tough. Selling a higher level of computing resource to companies looking to run their applications in the cloud (called “platform as a service”) will require a new set of technology tools and a following among developers – not a constituency with which HP traditionally has ties.Making this task all the more difficult is the legacy of earlier ambitious visions with which Mr Apotheker is saddled. HP remains unusual among tech companies in the broad range of its businesses across consumer and business markets. For the new chief, that has meant coming up with a cloud narrative that takes in everyone from the most demanding corporate chief information officer to the most casual consumer, spanning everything from data centres to devices.The result, in the new HP vision, will be an online app store serving up both heavy-duty corporate IT and the latest version of Angry Birds. It will also involve extending the company’s new software platform to all the gadgets it puts out, from tablet computers to PCs and printers – although HP has yet to explain how this would work, or why users would want a second operating system on their PCs, let alone apps for their printers.As a strategist at one big competitor said of Mr Apotheker’s grand vision: it is one thing to lay out a big vision, but quite another to prove you can make it work.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com
126;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-03-08T17:33:03Z;The latest corporate technology news;;Salesforce.com launches Service Cloud 3Salesforce.com has launched Service Cloud 3 to help organisations respond to the customer service challenges posed by social media. This update to its cloud-based customer service offering lets companies manage customer interactions with their Facebook fan page, converting the comments posted there into cases which can then be managed as if they came via traditional channels. Service Cloud 3 also lets customer service agents join in on conversations that affect their company on Twitter. Salesforce.com emphasises that the real-time nature of social media requires that companies respond in equally rapid manner to issues or complaints that surface on Twitter or Facebook. However, customer service is a notoriously difficult area to automate and some organisations could be reluctant to switch agents from “front-line” customer support functions to spend their days answering tweets. Nevertheless, Salesforce.com argues that many customers now expect this type of “social customer service”. It says 15,000 companies have signed up for Service Cloud, and an independent survey that found that many of them have boosted agent productivity and obtained other benefitsNetSuite’s cloud-based ERP package to help subsidiariesNetSuite, specialist in cloud-based business software, is offering large enterprises the best of both worlds. They can run traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) software back at head office and deploy NetSuite’s cloud-based alternative to their divisions or subsidiaries. Many multinationals and large enterprises have tried to standardise on a single ERP package from the likes of SAP or Oracle. But cost and resource constraints mean that it can often take years to fully deploy the new software to all divisions and foreign subsidiaries. So deployments often stall once the most important divisions are running the new software. NetSuite argues that smaller offices need no longer be left out in the cold. Thanks to a deal with data integration specialist Informatica, NetSuite makes it possible for the ERP systems running at head office to exchange transactional data with regional offices running NetSuite’s OneWorld cloud-based ERP package. This type of “two-tiered” ERP implementation is not a new idea, but NetSuite argues its approach, which involves pairing cloud services with enhanced integration, makes the concept more workable.V3 pitches virtual PCs to businesses with limited IT budgetsDesktop virtualisation just got interesting, particularly if you are a business with a limited IT budget. US start-up V3 Systems has unveiled a Virtual Desktop Accelerator that supports up to 300 “virtualised” desktop clients — which can replace a traditional PC for most users — at an annual cost of just $200 for each desktop. For comparison, a traditional desktop PC gobbles $2,400 a year from your opex budget, while rival desktop virtualisation solutions cost around $1,800 a year to run, according to V3 Systems. The relatively modest difference in opex between a full-blown PC and a conventional virtualised desktops has been a big stumbling block for advocates of the virtualised desktop approach, which seeks to save money on hardware and software costs. V3 Systems argues its VDA device dramatically reduces running costs and, in addition, requires half the capex of rival virtualisation offerings. The idea behind desktop virtualisation is to shift the “heavy lifting” back to a central server, so allowing businesses to swap their PCs for cheaper “thin client” devices that consist of little more than a screen and a keyboard. The devil is in the detail, however, and die-hard PC fans argue that virtualised desktop devices offer inferior performance — an accusation V3 refutes. Gartner predicts that by 2012, 50m desktop PCs will be virtualised, or around 10 per cent of the desktop PC market.Egnyte offers solutions for enterprises wanting to use iPadsEgnyte solves the enterprise iPad dilemma. Many enterprises would like to use iPads, but they are worried about the security and IT management issues. Apple’s trendy tablet computer was conceived primarily as a consumer device and firms such as Silicon Valley-based Egnyte are rushing to address the shortcomings when using the iPad for enterprise computing. The Egnyte Enterprise for iPad app offers 256-bit encryption of data travelling to and from the iPad, and other “enterprise-class” security features designed to help IT security managers sleep at night. Egnyte is one of the companies to receive funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers’ iFund, whose portfolio consists of young technology companies hoping to piggy-back on Apple’s iPhone and iPad.
127;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-01-26T19:33:08Z;Tech groups outrun bulls in equity rally;Sector has been roaring ahead since August;When it comes to bull markets, technology stocks are renowned for running the fastest. This has been true since August with the sector roaring ahead of the broad equity rally.Stellar earnings from IBM, Google, Apple and Intel this month have vindicated the near-30 per cent rise in the Nasdaq Composite since the Federal Reserve indicated a willingness to buy more bonds in an effort to revitalise the economy.Currently the Nasdaq 100 sits at its highest level since 2001, while the Nasdaq Composite is just shy of its October 2007 high, outstripping the performance of the S&P 500.Tech mania extends beyond current listed shares. Investors are eyeing the bulging valuations for privately held Facebook, now seen at about $50bn, and Groupon, the cyber coupon company where some think an initial public offering could raise $15bn.Meanwhile, the gold standard for tech remains Apple, whose shares have tripled over the past two years to give a market capitalisation of about $320bn, making it the second most valuable company in the world behind ExxonMobil.The big question for investors is whether the rally has pushed valuations for tech companies too far, too fast. Since peaking last week, both the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 have edged back.The growth-oriented Nasdaq Composite trades currently at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28 times – versus the S&P 500’s 16 times – yet still way below its peak levels of 194 times achieved at the peak of the dotcom boom in March 2000.“The rally is getting long in the tooth, but it still looks good for tech and I would expect a pullback of no more than 5 per cent,” says Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNY ConvergEx.Indeed, analysts argue the latest tech earnings indicate there is plenty of scope for further gains.Barclays Capital says results from IBM and Intel “both provide support to our view that equipment and software spending will continue to be a significant positive contributor to GDP growth”.A standout sector within tech has been semi-conductor stocks, enjoying booming business as smartphones and iPads require chips. That backdrop has helped propel the Philadelphia semi-conductor, or Sox, index up 43 per cent since late August.Aggressive valuations for tech companies reflect businesses that are at the cutting edge of new innovations, and products that can sharply boost growth and thus justify booming stock prices.“The tech field is where you get most growth and innovation and it’s a sector that can advance very quickly,” says Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank.While tech can be a goldmine for investors as they bet big on the promise of innovation and growth, the margin for error in such a hot sector is very slim.Earlier this month, F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, missed estimates with its first quarter sales and revenues. Having risen 146 per cent in 2010 and peaked at $145.76 this month, the stock plunged towards $102 after the earnings result and is now down 16 per cent this year and trading at about $109.“Tech can be very volatile as high growth expectations can fall short and result in a large pullback for investors,” says Mr Lucas.Partly due to these fears, investors have been moving money away recently from the volatile “high-growth” players and into more established companies, many of which are sitting on massive cash piles. VMWare, Riverbed and Salesforce.com, which have seen up to 230 per cent growth last year have all fallen between 5 and 8 per cent in the past few weeks while IBM, Intel and Oracle have rallied further.“Almost every day you see a trade away from volatility within the sector,” says Michael Pytosh, co-head of US equities for ING Investment Management and senior technology analyst.Some $150bn of cash is held by the top nine US tech companies, prompting hopes that when it is spent this year it will add value to the stock rally.Historically, technology companies have been reluctant to use their massive cash holdings for either share buy-backs or higher dividends because it could be viewed as an admission that the company has limited growth potential.“The culture of the technology sector is very geared towards growth and so it is hard for them to admit they have run out of opportunities,” says Matthew Kaufler, portfolio manager at Federated Investors.
128;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2011-01-19T22:21:18Z;Wall St sees the light on cloud computing;Investors warm up to software trend;Stock market investors have finally been warming up to a software trend that has been more than 10 years in the making.That’s how it goes with big transitions in the underlying architecture of IT: there are many false dawns in what can appear to be inevitable long-term shifts – in this case, a new approach to information storage and processing, carried out remotely in large datacentres and delivered over the internet. The trick is not necessarily predicting what will happen next, but deciding which horse to back – and when to enter the race.So it has been with something that goes by the ungainly name of software-as-a-service (SaaS). Like many tech trends, this one surfaced under a number of different guises – application service providers was one name given to the early players, on-demand software was another – before taking its current form. Is this finally its moment?The pioneer in this market, Salesforce.com, has seen its shares jump by 70 per cent in the past year. It sells an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data. At nearly $20bn, it is now worth more than software companies such as Adobe, Symantec and Intuit – all of them much bigger and more profitable. Other SaaS names such as NetSuite and SuccessFactors have been caught in the updraft.Entrepreneurs and early investors usually blame accounting for the length of time it has taken Wall Street to get excited about SaaS.The argument goes like this: unlike traditional software companies, which book revenues upfront when they make a sale, these companies sell subscriptions – for instance, $50 a year per employee for a company that wants its sales staff to use an online application that manages their customer relationship data. Since those subscriptions often continue for years but all the costs of selling the service gets booked up front, SaaS companies can look unprofitable for many years, which makes investors cautious.That argument is hard to swallow. Sure, Salesforce only just scrapes out a profit, but its operating cash flow jumped nearly two-thirds in the first nine months of 2010. It doesn’t take a maths genius to understand the economics of this business.A more likely explanation is the length of time it sometimes takes Wall Street to get comfortable with a new market and a new business model. Like all subscription businesses, SaaS companies live or die on a handful of key measures: the money they spend finding new customers, the amount they can extract from those customers in each accounting period, and the rate at which customers fail to renew their subscription agreements and have to be replaced with new ones (known as churn).In a new market, it is not easy to tell how the dynamics of marketing costs, pricing and churn will settle down. Salesforce, which has been at this game for 11 years, spent 47 per cent of its revenues on marketing costs in the latest nine months, a higher proportion than the year before. Does that mean it is ploughing everything into growth, or that it has to spend more on marketing because the business is getting more competitive? What happens to pricing when there is a thriving market of companies vying to outsource the handling of business processes like this?Another factor is the capital investment and operational risks involved in building what amounts to a utility business. Make no mistake, these companies aim to reach huge scale. ADP, the big, boring payroll processing company that has been around for half a century, is the darling that many in this industry look up to.Start-ups, which often lack patient long-term investors and struggle to control breakneck growth, may not seem the obvious entities to which large companies would want to entrust their key data and business processes.That caution points to the other, overriding reason why SaaS has taken time to emerge as a stock market investment story. The early market has been fuelled by small businesses that cannot afford an IT department, along with departmental managers of large businesses who have enough autonomy to make decisions about how to handle non-core processes without involving the CIO. Getting to where the real money is – handling things like the financial processes and supply chains of big corporations – will take years.It’s all in the timing. Wall Street has finally decided that this is a business that’s here to stay – and that, in Salesforce, it has already thrown up at least one company that may emerge to stand alongside the big players in business software (if it isn’t bought by one of them along the way). But to live up to the new expectations they have created, it is time for the SaaS companies to prove that IT managers no longer fear the cloud.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com

Big businesses in mainstream industries not only use the open source operating system but are now happy to be seen doing so. To prove the point, British Airways, Cit and NTT Communications were among the businesses voicing their support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, the latest version of Red Hat’s high-end Linux operating system, which is a rival to Microsoft Windows Server. Red Hat knows that prejudices die hard, so while Enterprise Linux 6 includes hundreds of technical enhancements, the company is pitching its sales message less at IT folk and more at die-hard board-level executives who still can’t believe it is possible, let alone desirable to run a big business on Linux.Socialtext’s connectorSocialtext, specialist in social networking for enterprises, has announcing a new feature that claims to break down the information “silos” in organisations. The Californian firm has developed a “connector” that allows data from Salesforce.com, the popular cloud-based service for sales management, to be plugged into the Socialtext social software platform. The aim is to encourage employees from across the company – not just in sales – to discuss, collaborate and take action on sales leads and other events generated in Salesforce.com.Microsoft’s Dynamics CRM steps up competitionSalesforce.com gets a lot of publicity but it isn’t the only customer management system in town.

Most businesses have IT policies but they may be ill-suited to today’s “Martini workers” who want to be able to access information anytime, anyplace and anywhere. A survey by networking giant Cisco reveals that two out of every five employees who admit to breaking IT policies claim they do so in order to do their job better. Access to social media is one big bone of contention as two out of five employees say they are restricted from using Facebook at their job. Cisco claims the findings are a wake-up call for businesses, which should re-evaluate and update IT policies to accommodate the demands of today’s workforce.IBM aims to make clouds more intelligentIBM is out to make clouds smarter. It is leading a European research initiative to develop a “smart cloud storage architecture” and so address one of the biggest challenges in cloud computing, namely making sense of all the data that could potentially be stored in public clouds. At the moment, the data stored in clouds only have a meaning within the application that created them. The Vision Cloud initiative seeks to abstract that meaning and store it with the associated data, so potentially allowing many IT tasks to be done more cost-effectively in the cloud by third-party providers of computing power. While the cloud revolution may be a long time coming, this research initiative points to a day when big businesses could be run with very small IT departments and minimal infrastructure of their own.
131;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2010-10-27T08:25:23Z;Role of the CIO: Chief innovation officers are required;;After last year’s sharp decline in IT spending, there are signs that businesses are once again loosening the purse strings. According to Gartner, the industry research firm, spending on IT by end user businesses fell by 5.2 per cent worldwide in 2009.This year, the firm expects to see a modest return to growth, at 3.3 per cent. But the total business outlay on IT is set to remain below 2008.Total IT spending of $3,300bn – the Gartner figure for 2010 – represents a significant commitment to technology by global businesses. Yet the chief information officers and managers who control those budgets still feel under siege. The reason is that IT costs – and the returns on that investment – are under greater scrutiny than ever before.This is prompting some businesses to question how they buy IT services, and for some IT departments, to question their future.“Departments are feeling bruised,” says Nathan Marke, chief technology officer of 2e2, a UK-based IT services company. “We’ve had to become more savvy about how business spends on IT and more aware of the customer balance sheet. We are seeing demands for a much shorter return on investment, not even within 12 months but often just six months.”But it is not merely a tougher spending environment that is forcing departments to change. Businesses have more choice than ever in how to source technology services.They no longer need to choose just between building and running their own infrastructure or outsourcing it to a large services company.The growth of companies such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite that offer software-as-a-service (SaaS), and the emergence of cloud computing, where companies buy anything from raw IT capacity to complete business services from third parties, creates a range of options.Some industry observers believe cloud computing, in particular, could be as game changing as the personal computer in the 1980s.“Advances such as cloud computing are providing increasing choice and what you can do with that choice is increasing as [business] data is held in the cloud or elsewhere,” says Bryan Cruickshank, KPMG’s head of global IT advisory services.“That is pushing the CIO to have more of a business role. Rather than the supreme technologist who sits on top of an IT delivery organisation, the CIO becomes a broker of services to the business, managing a portfolio of service providers and becomes more of a business person as a result.”In some businesses, the CIO has reacted by broadening his or her role. At British Airways, for example, Paul Coby is also head of services for the airline, a trend he expects other technology-dependent companies to follow. But elsewhere, the CIO is falling back into a more conventional technical role, perhaps reporting to the CFO.“The more technology-minded CIOs are coming back under the CFO but the more forward thinking are being renamed as the chief customer officer or chief innovation or chief transformation officer,” says 2e2’s Mr Marke.The route they take will depend on how critical IT is to a business and its ability to increase competitive advantage, as well as the maturity of the technology base. “The fundamental thing about technology is it enables business. You don’t buy technology for its own sake,” says Mr Marke.Business unit leaders have also been driving the trend to decentralise IT, partially because of the option to buy flexible, easy to set up and apparently cheaper cloud or SaaS technologies and partly because in-house departments are often seen as expensive and unresponsive.“The real danger for CIOs is they lose control of IT, rather than give it up,” explains David Cappuccio, vice-president and chief of research for infrastructure and operations at Gartner. “Clients are looking at the cloud as an alternative to traditional IT, if that IT is not agile or cost effective.”The CIO’s response should be to bring the IT department closer to the business, but also to take a rigorous approach to sourcing technology. The days when the effectiveness – and power – of a CIO is measured by the number of servers they run, or the number of people they employ, are largely over. “IT is about services, not servers,” says Mr Cappuccio.Departments should be looking to the market to provide services, where those services are a commodity. In turn, this allows them to focus expertise and resources on areas of the business that provide differentiation and competitive advantage, says Frank Modruson, CIO at Accenture, the consulting firm.But the IT department should also be the technology advocate for the business and a co-ordinator of external services who ensures that IT functions as a whole.“E-mail, for example, is a piece of infrastructure that is important but not your secret sauce,” says Mr Modruson.“There has to be a very good reason not to buy it in.“What matters is having a good data model, understanding the data you are collecting, and how do you get to one version of the truth. That is the value of IT.”

But lift the hood on its new customer relationship management software and you find that it is “powered by” Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Infor’s decision to use Microsoft rather than a home-grown solution reflects the growing maturity of the CRM market but is surprising nonetheless. Infor already has a couple of CRM offerings including Epiphany, a fallen star of the CRM industry acquired in 2005. Infor says mid-sized businesses wanted a more “cost-effective” solution tailored to their size and needs, so rather than reinventing the wheel, it opted to resell Microsoft’s CRM product. The CRM software market once supported dozens of specialist vendors, but most have now disappeared and businesses increasingly opt to buy CRM software from a mainstream vendor such as Oracle or Microsoft, or rent their CRM as software-as-a-service from a provider such as Salesforce.comVMware unveils Zimbra DesktopCan VMware succeed where Yahoo! failed? VMware’s latest product, Zimbra Desktop 2.0, is based on the open-source Zimbra email software, which it acquired from Yahoo! earlier this year. Zimbra achieved modest success with businesses as a cheap alternative to Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Domino. But it struggled to make greater inroads while under Yahoo!’s wing. VMware hopes to do better and has reworked this latest Zimbra product so that it acts as a desktop portal to cloud-based collaboration and webmail services, as well as social networks like Twitter or Facebook. The big selling point of Zimbra Desktop is that users can access their cloud-based calendars or emails even if there is no internet connection – the Achilles‘ heel of cloud-based services. VMware, best know for its virtualisation software, is trying to expand outside the data centre with cloud-based services and applications.IBM buys PSS SystemsPSS Systems, a software house specialised in compliance, has been acquired by IBM. Using software to enforce compliance and corporate governance is a relatively new field but it has grown dramatically with the explosion of data that needs to be monitored and increasing complexity of legislation. The big problem with compliance is that chief legal officers, faced with the threat of possible law suits, often err on the side of safety and “over-retain” information that can safely be disposed – over 70 percent of information is needlessly retained, according to IBM. PSS Systems’ software enables businesses to define suitable policies for retaining information and help rein in data storage costs.Twitter followers can call you via Zin.toStill unsure what Twitter is for? Zingaya, a UK start-up, has launched Zin.to, a service that lets your Twitter followers call you via the internet. By clicking on the Zin.to link in your tweets, followers can be connected direct to a regular land line, a mobile phone or a Skype account. Zingaya suggests one possible apllication: marketing departments offering special Twitter-only promotions –”Click this link before Friday to talk to our call centre and get a 10 percent discount”. Zingaya lets you forward 30 minutes of calls each day free of charge but currently only to US numbers. The “click to call” service uses Adobe Flash, which means it will not work if the Twitter follower is using an iPhone or other device that does not suport Flash.Skype to intergrate FacebookSkype 5, the latest version of the popular internet telephony software, comes with built-in integration with Facebook. The development may seem arcane unless you regularly use Skype and Facebook, but for those that do, it is a big productivity boost. It means that you can now call or chat with any contact who has listed their phone number on Facebook from within Skype – thus saving call charges as well. You can also check out your news feed, update your status, and comment on posts directly within Skype.Windows 7 via Microsoft’s MED-VDoes your CIO refuse to update your business PCs to Windows 7 because of compatibility issues?

The film took in about $71m in US and Canada on its opening weekend compared with expectations of about $105m.Energy-related stocks were among the session’s heaviest fallers with Consol Energy leading the group lower as it dropped 4.3 per cent to $33.97.Murphy Oil lost 3.3 per cent to $50.57, Schlumberger pulled back 4.8 per cent to $57.60 and Smith International was 5.1 per cent lower at $38.31.US-listed shares in BP were 4.6 per cent down at $41.86 as anger continued to mount over its inability to stem the flow of oil from one of its rigs into the Gulf of Mexico.Halliburton and Transocean, employed as contractors on that rig, fell 4 per cent to $25.65 and 8.9 per cent to $53.96, respectively.Several oil drillers were downgraded or had estimates reduced at JPMorgan, who cited expected changes in the sector.“While many of the potential changes will likely be positive in the medium and longer term, we see a number of negative implications for offshore drillers over the next several years, causing us to reduce our estimates and price targets for the group,” JPMorgan analysts said.Affected stocks included Transocean, Diamond Offshore, which lost 4 per cent to $67.74, Noble Corp, which was down 3.6 per cent to $31.25, and Pride International, which pulled back 5 per cent to $23.90.Shares in Salesforce.com gained 1.3 per cent to $82.19 after the internet-based software maker said full-year profit was expected to be at the low end of analyst projections."
134;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2010-05-19T20:50:00Z;Google grows web store, video, cloud ambitions;;Google announced a web application store, a video standard and a cloud services initiative in the opening keynote of its developer conference on Wednesday – moves that rivals are likely to view as a threatening flexing of its web muscles.The new Chrome web store will rival Microsoft programs and Intel’s AppUp store and provide tablet makers with a useful weapon to fight Apple’s iPad and iTunes. Its WebM video standard presents a long-term threat to Adobe’s Flash technology and could irk Apple, which favours the H.264 standard. Its cloud services collaboration with VMware and its associated Google App Engine for Business will be studied closely by Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce.com and others involved in cloud computing.The Chrome web store will appear as an opening tab screen in its Chrome browser, which has more than doubled in active users over the past year from 30m to 70m plus, according to Google.Sundar Pichai, head of product management, showed applications such as Tweetdeck, photo editing and games to developers at its I/O conference in San Francisco. Magazines would also be available in the store and a version of Sports Illustrated was demonstrated.In video, Google announced it was opensourcing the VP8 codec it acquired when it bought On2 for $106m last year and putting it into a new video standard called WebM. YouTube was converting its entire catalogue to the new standard, Google said.“Many of these [existing] codecs are plagued with uncertainty about the royalties and licensing of video materials encoded with those codecs and we don’t think that’s a good thing,” Vic Gundotra (pictured), head of engineering at Google, told a press conference.” We want it to be free and open, the web needs that open standard … it’s a gift to the web and we think it’s part of our job.”Executives from Mozilla and Opera, creators of the Firefox and Opera browsers, came on stage to announce their support for WebM. They were followed by Kevin Lynch, chief technology officer for Adobe, who said VP8 would be incorporated in its Flash player, but he stopped short of endorsing the new WebM standard. Unsurprisingly, there was no Apple representation at the conference.Google’s partnership with VMware was presented as a new operating system for the cloud, with VMWare’s Springsource software supplying the back end and serving the private cloud and linking with Google Web Toolkit to cover the public cloud. Its open source layer would make applications portable across different clouds.Google App Engine for Business is designed to allow organisations “to build and maintain their applications on the same scalable architecture that powers Google applications, with added management and support features tailored specifically for the enterprise.”With both moves, Google’s push deep into the software infrastructure of cloud computing may alarm a host of players, including Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.com.Thursday’s keynote is expected to focus on Google’s Android operating system and its expansion into televisions, set-top boxes and yet more areas likely to cause high anxiety to existing players.
135;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
136;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Options open up for the minimalist business;;Twenty years ago, a laptop computer represented a significant investment for any business. Today, it costs little to buy an entry-level laptop capable of running day-to-day business applications, reasonably demanding graphics or computational software, and even entertainment applications.According to Eilert Hanoa, chief executive of Mamut, a Norwegian software vendor specialising in small and mid-sized businesses, the cost of providing an employee with a laptop and a phone is now as low as one pound a day – an historically low figure for equipping a member of staff with the tools of their trade.As a result, smaller businesses have also benefited from the way both the internet and mobile networks have changed their communications.Companies can set up their telephone links, as well as links to the internet, using inexpensive mobile phones and cellular data “dongles”.For more permanent set-ups, technologies such as voice over the internet (VoIP) have largely replaced conventional phone lines for a growing number of businesses. According to Forrester, the industry analyst firm, 14 per cent of all companies have deployed VoIP to the desktop, and a further 34 per cent are considering doing so.Cheap, ubiquitous and increasingly quick internet access opens up a further set of options to businesses when it comes to running their IT: moving to “cloud” services.Rather than hosting back office applications on their own computer hardware, businesses can rent space on remote servers, or even rent applications on a per-user basis from companies such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite.Even traditional desktop applications such as word processing are moving towards the cloud, through services such as Google Docs and Microsoft’s Office Web suite. It might not be going too far, to suggest that a functioning business needs little more than some bandwidth, a web browser, and a way to print documents.“It’s becoming rather like ordering a dish off an a la carte menu,” says Rob Lovell, chief executive and founder of ThinkGrid, a company that provides hosted desktop applications to SMEs over the internet. “You can have your e-mail, phone and desktop applications anywhere you want.”But the flexibility and productivity gains offered by information technology have to be balanced against the time, skills and money needed to manage the technologies.As Andy Mulholland, global chief technology officer at Capgemini, the consultants, points out businesses now spend, on average, just 5 per cent of their time on back office processes, mostly as a result of efficiencies brought by IT.But for smaller companies, and owner-managed businesses in particular, IT is also seen as a burden. ThinkGrid’s Mr Lovell says: “They are spending more time fixing it when it is broken. They don’t want to install or manage it.”This is leading to a new generation of companies taking a radically different approach to technology, seeing it less as an asset to be bought and managed, and more as a service to be rented or paid for as it is used.Companies such as ThinkGrid, Salesforce.com and NetSuite base their business models on the premise that companies want IT specialists to run their IT, so they can focus on running the business. Larger enterprises have long turned to outsourcing service providers to do exactly that.The cloud, though, breaks down IT services into bite-sized chunks that make them affordable to smaller businesses.“All applications will move to the cloud,” predicts Zach Nelson, NetSuite’s chief executive.” Businesses will move away from software applications that force them to buy, run and maintain expensive operating systems, Mr Nelson suggests.But not all businesses are moving at the same pace: “We do see traditional businesses migrate from on premise software to cloud, but we also meet entrepreneurs who would never run their own software,” he says. “They play games over the net, so they ask why they should run their own ERP (enterprise resource planning).”Independent analysts agree that today’s technologies allow businesses, especially smaller companies, to do away with a whole tier of IT infrastructure.“If the question is: ‘is it feasible to have a laptop with a net connection on tap and a range of services delivered over the internet?’, then that is the case,” suggests Joslyn Faust, an analyst in Gartner’s small to midsize business research group.At the same time, it is not yet the case that a business can move into an office with a broadband connection, plug into an Ethernet socket or connect up to a mobile broadband service and find all their applications and services on tap.One reason is that, according to Karl Boone, a Boston-based IT delivery expert at PA Consulting, it still requires a high degree of skill to pick the right cloud-based services. “There is still a view that IT is something that runs on boxes but what businesses need are applications. But they do need help with which applications to run,” he explains.Businesses might also need guidance on how to connect a range of cloud-based applications together – in itself a challenging task, and one that cloud service providers have only recently started to address, through hosted applications that can mediate between programs.Organisations also need to think about where their data is stored, and how well protected it is against virus attack or data theft, especially if they are handling personal or customer data.Then there is the question of data ownership, and what would happen if a cloud-based software provider were to fail, or ceased trading. Simply having a local copy of the data on a PC or laptop is of limited use, if the business is unable to access the application itself.A further concern is that access to a broadband connection cannot be guaranteed. While Mr Lovell at ThinkGrid points out that five or even 10 users could connect to his service over a conventional domestic or small business broadband link, even advocates of a minimalist approach to IT concede that businesses need a robust broadband service.This might need to include SDSL (symmetrical digital subscriber line) or redundant ADSL connections, especially if they also use their broadband lines for streaming media or telecommunications.As a result, some businesses might prefer to continue to run some applications themselves, or look at applications that work offline.“That’s why we’ve adopted a hybrid software and services model, with the application running locally but 100 per cent in sync,” explains Mr Hanoa of Mamut. “To play both horses you have to be able to access the software offline, but also still access it remotely.”None the less, the pressure on companies – especially smaller companies – to stretch their budgets further and reduce both the cost and complexity of IT, is set to continue through 2010.“Small business has two problems: a lack of access to capital, and a lack of access to skills,” says Sean Poulley, vice president of online collaboration services at IBM. “Anything you can do to restrict these two issues is welcome. And smaller businesses want to align their [IT] costs more closely with their business needs.”
137;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2010-03-02T23:28:20Z;SAP vows return to double-digit sales growth;;Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe, SAP’s new co-chief executives, promised on Tuesday that there would be a new culture of “fun” and “trust” at the embattled German software company.In their first public appearance after last month’s surprise announcement of their appointments, Mr McDermott and Mr Snabe pledged to return the German software company to double-digit sales growth by 2012 and to restructure the company to make it more innovative and entrepreneurial.SAP’s core software sales fell 16 per cent during the downturn and Leo Apotheker, its former chief executive, left after one year in the job. The company, which competes with Oracle and Salesforce.com, has been criticised for falling behind on new IT trends such as cloud computing.Speaking at the CeBIT IT trade show in Hanover, Mr McDermott and Mr Snabe said a key strategy would be reorganising the company’s more than 12,000 engineers into small entrepreneurial teams of 10 or so people, with more contact with customers and more control over their own projects.Mr Snabe believes this will enable the company to innovate more quickly and efficiently.He said: “We want to transform SAP into a lean organisation, doing more with fewer people. We want to unleash the creativity of our engineers.”He estimated that the company could make a 30 per cent efficiency gain through the new structure, allowing SAP to keep research and its development consulting costs flat while accelerating the pace at which it brings out products.He promised that SAP’s much delayed new software-as-a-service offering, BusinessByDesign, would start being shipped to the mass market in July. This is part of SAP’s effort to address the small and medium enterprise market better.Mr McDermott said that SAP was also open to making more large acquisitions and “would not hesitate” if the right opportunity came up. SAP has not traditionally made big acquisitions, but bought Business Objects for €4.8bn in 2007.Some industry observers suggest, however, that SAP could itself become a take­over target following its recent weak performance. Microsoft, for example, is understood to have considered buying the company in the past.Mr McDermott reiterated SAP’s targets for 4 to 8 per cent core software sales growth in 2010, and a 30 to 31 per cent operating margin. In the medium term he said the margin would reach 35 per cent.The toughest challenge for Mr McDermott and Mr Snabe will be overseeing a cultural change at a demoralised company. As the first foreign chief executives of the German company, this job is particularly tricky.They say they would like to adopt a highly approachable management style, in contrast to the more hierarchichal structure that they said existed under Mr Apotheker.Mr Snabe is Danish and the former head of product development. Mr McDermott was previously the head of field operations.Both insist that Hasso Plattner, SAP’s co-founder who stepped back in to the company during the crisis, will give them plenty of leeway in the day-to-day running of the business.“I believe that Hasso is the most brilliant mind in technology and he will play a role as a technology advisor,” said Mr McDermott. “But Jim and I run the company, and that is how Hasso and the board want it.”“We used to present complex solutions, tackling the most complicated problems in 25 industries. Now we are trying to give more of a citizen’s point of view and talking about how SAP is relevant to what is happening in your kitchen.”

This compared with a rise of 11.5 per cent in the Dow Jones World Technology Index.The strength of sterling masked the strong performance in Polar’s portfolio of global technology stocks in the middle part of the year as investors were drawn to the sector’s cheap valuations, strong balance sheets, and potential for growth.In local currency terms, the Dow Jones Technology index rose 24 per cent as smartphones emerged and the industry rapidly adjusted to the explosive growth of data.The fund, set up by former managers at Henderson, saw its own performance recognised in November when it won the FTSE TechMark award for statistically best performing technology fund in the year to September.Shares in Polar, which have risen 80 per cent in the last year, traded up 2½p at 236.3p on Wednesday. Analysts at brokers Killick & Co said the fund’s share price remained 14 per cent below its net asset value of December 14.But Ben Rogoff, the fund’s manager, said the quarter showed the industry was beginning to split between the old guard of technology companies, such as SAP, Oracle and Cisco, and newer companies whose business was based on cloud computing, such as Salesforce.com, and mobile internet.“The third-quarter earnings cycle saw a proper divergences between new cycle and old cycle stocks,” said Mr Rogoff.As a result Mr Rogoff increased his holding in Google and Apple, while his holding in Noka fell from 2.1 per cent to 0.8 per cent.However his holding in Microsoft rose from 4 per cent to 4.8 per cent in anticipation of a sales uplift from Windows 7.Investment income fell from £1.7m to £1.5m while it turned an interim pre-tax profit of £37.7m compared with a loss of £58m a year ago. Earnings per share were 29.46p from a loss of 43.34p a year ago.

Autonomy’s technology automatically finds ”shades of grey” in the meaning of data that traditionally would need to be spotted by human beings.New features from AsteraData integration specialist Astera Software has unveiled Centerprise Data Integrator 4.0. This latest release of its flagship Centerprise product is designed to take advantage of multi-core and multiprocessor Windows-based hardware. Among the numerous new features: connectors to extract data from Salesforce.com applications and, for traditionalists, Cobol programs.IBM and business intelligenceIBM has launched Cognos Express, a business intelligence solution tailored for mid-sized businesses.

As mobile computers get smaller users are more likely to look for alternatives to cramped built-in keyboards, argues Microsoft.Bluetooth-equipped peripherals have not had much success to date but Microsoft says 55 per cent of notebook PCs will ship with Bluetooth next year.EMC into the cloudEMC has jumped aboard the cloud computing bandwagon with a range of services aimed at enterprises that want to use virtualised infrastructure internally in so-called private clouds.Alongside virtualisation technologies from EMC, VMware and third party vendors, the storage giant is offering consulting, technology integration and education services to help customers build their own cloud infrastructures.Remote troubleshooting from Intel and AT&TAT&T has teamed up with Intel to offer remote access support to small businesses in the US. The deal extends AT&T’s existing virtual helpdesk offering, AT&T Tech Support 360, to allow AT&T technicians to troubleshoot troublesome hardware remotely using Intel’s vPro technology, which is standard on new Intel-based PCs. Pointedly, AT&T says its technicians are based in the US rather than offshore.Oracle combines analyticsOracle has launched a new line of enterprise performance management (EPM) software for financial institutions.

141;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2009-09-10T21:59:41Z;Tools for small business;;"For anyone planning to start a small business, getting the right technology solution – a low-cost, efficient and reliable IT system – can be tricky.Traditionally, many small companies without in-house IT expertise have hired external consultants to guide them or cobble together an IT system using off-the-shelf hardware components and software.More recently, web-based software suites such as Zoho, Google Docs and Spreadsheets, and online application providers like Salesforce.com have helped bridge the gap for companies without their own IT systems.But many small and growing businesses still want to operate and control their own systems (and data), so I have been looking at one option designed specifically for small businesses: Microsoft’s Windows Small Business Server (SBS).The basic building blocks of any IT system are the physical network and hardware including a server, a router, PCs and/or laptops, and at least one printer or multifunction device.I chose to set up a small business network at home built around a Hewlett-Packard ProLiant ML350 G5 server with 4Gb of Ram and two disc drives, a handful of desktop and laptop machines running Windows XP and Vista, a Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N Gigabit Router (WRT320N) and an HP Color LaserJet CP2025n printer (see box). To buy the equipment new would cost about $3,750 (€2,575, £2,250), excluding the PCs.If I had been looking for the lowest cost option, I would have then configured the HP server to run Linux’s open source operating system. I decided instead to build the system around the SBS 2008, because of its extensive features, flexibility and easy integration with Windows-based PCs.SBS is designed to be the software that sits at the centre of a small-business network providing access to the same core Microsoft applications like business e-mail, (Exchange Server), web-based collaboration tools (Office Live and SharePoint services) and security (ForeFront) that are available to big corporate customers.SBS mainly succeeds in providing easy and integrated access to these applications. For example, it features a redesigned “admin console” that requires less IT skills than previous incarnations, improved monitoring and management capabilities and a much easier way to set up and configure a website.Microsoft has attempted to address key small business concerns by building in anti-malware protection for e-mail, easily configured data storage and file sharing, and faster backup capabilities.Because small businesses are increasingly reliant on mobile workforces, SBS also provides remote access and enables easier collaboration between colleagues.Best of all, most of these features are easy to set up and manage through the admin console, which acts as a sort of hub for the system and helps enable tasks such as adding users, connecting to the internet and protecting against internet malware, including spam and viruses.In addition, a new pricing structure means Windows SBS is not expensive. SBS 2008 Standard (there is also a premium edition) costs $1,089 and includes licences for five users or devices. Additional user licences cost $77 each.According to Microsoft, most customers buy their small-business software pre-installed on a server or buy a system through a consultant or value-added reseller who helps to configure it.But as I discovered, Microsoft has significantly improved the SBS installation process since I installed an earlier version 10 years ago. Provided you have some basic PC networking understanding, there is no reason not to do it yourself. My installation went smoothly and only took about two hours.To install SBS on your own machine, you need a 64-bit processor, at least 4Gb of RAM, at least 60Gb free on the hard disc and a DVD drive.Setting up SBS 2008 involves stepping through a series of configuration questions such as language and time zone. Most of the time, the installation routine makes sensible “default” suggestions and all you need to do is to click “OK” repeatedly. Once the network connections are established, a series of “Getting Started Tasks” takes you through the rest of the process.The Internet Setup Task requires basic knowledge of your company web “domain” and registrar information, though if you do not already have a domain name, a wizard will connect you to a registrar and walk you through the process. Sensibly, the setup also guides users through the process of creating a backup on an external USB drive.SBS is not perfect, but overall, SBS 2008 provides all the basic features that a small business needs to set up and manage a sophisticated IT system – and does it without allowing technology to get in the way.Moreover, it is clear that the system’s designers have spent a lot of time trying to understand what small business users need and want.paul.taylor@ft.com

142;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2009-08-21T20:27:50Z;Wall Street surges to record highs for year;;US stocks rallied to new highs for the year on Friday after early optimism from Europe was boosted by signs of a US recovery.An unexpected jump in the sales of existing homes fuelled the market’s best day since late July, which was initially sparked by figures showing the German manufacturing and service sectors expanded.This gave investors further confidence that the recession is ending, after figures earlier in the week showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region and manufacturing in the New York area both rose impressively last month.Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave those hopes further credence when he told a conference: “The prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good,” although he admitted such growth may be sluggish.“We have had good signs this week on manufacturing and housing, as well as in key export markets such as the eurozone,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. “But of course, we are still missing the consumer, and that is the big problem.”The European data helped oil rise to a price not seen since last October.This fed into energy stocks, with Chevron rising 1.6 per cent to $69.73 and ExxonMobil picking up 1.9 per cent to $69.92.Metals stocks also showed strength as they extended recent gains made on the back of firmer commodity prices. Freeport McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, advanced 4.6 per cent to $65.06. US Steel picked up 2.6 per cent to $44.86.Homebuilders then joined those sectors at the forefront of the buying after the housing data, with Lennarrising 3.2 per cent to $14.52 and DR Horton climbing 3.4 per cent to $12.66.Financial stocks continued their recent winning run, with Citigroup building further on the 66 per cent rise in its share price since late July with a gain of 4.9 per cent to $4.70.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $17.46 and Wells Fargo climbed 1.7 per cent to $27.94.The rally took the benchmark S&P 500 to new closing highs for the year, up 1.9 per cent up at 1,026.13.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7 per cent to 9,505.96 and the Nasdaq rose 1.6 per cent to 2,020.90.This put the gloss on what turned out to be a positive week for the stock market, which took the S&P 2.2 per cent higher, the Dow up 2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.8 per cent better off.Friday marked the fourth straight positive session, following a sell-off on Monday after a big drop in Chinese equities.Wall Street soon gained its composure, however, with investors focusing on the positive economic news rather than more worrying data showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits unexpectedly rising.`“There has been a recent acceleration in the economic recovery, said Stanley Nabi, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. “The question is, is this a temporary turnaround and will there be a relapse, or is this for real?”Companies also continued to report encouraging earnings, and clothing retailer Gap rose 3.3 per cent on Friday to $19.48 after investors shook off disappointing sales and focused on rising profits .JM Smucker, which produces jam and peanut butter, also beat estimates, helped by stronger sales and improving profit margins. Its shares rose 4.3 per cent to $54.10.Salesforce.com, which makes software for managing customer data, jumped after reporting stronger quarterly revenues than expected.Its shares rose 16.2 per cent to $53.67.But businesses are apparently less willing to buy tax preparation software, with Intuit, which produces such software, saying continuing economic weakness would mean lower full-year profits than previously forecast. The shares fell 7.2 per cent to $28.62.
143;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2009-06-09T23:09:34Z;SAP reshapes strategy for online software;;A top executive at SAP is set to outline a new strategy on Wednesday for delivering software over the internet, as the German software group struggles to respond to a market that poses a significant long-term threat to its business.The early pace in the market for on-demand software, also known as “software-as-a-service”, has been set by newcomers such as Salesforce.com, which normally charge a monthly subscription fee for customers to access their software over the internet.Speaking at a conference in Amsterdam on Wednesday, John Wookey, who is driving SAP’s on-demand software push, will outline a new approach that ties the company’s online services far more tightly to its traditional software.“Until John got there, there was no strategy,” said Bruce Richardson, an analyst at AMR Research in Boston.“It’s absolutely essential for SAP – if they don’t make a viable play in the on-demand world, they will be completely overwhelmed by it,” said Josh Greenbaum, an analyst at Enterprise Applications Consulting.SAP’s first home-grown attempts to respond to the on-demand software revolution have failed to gain much traction. An online service for salespeople to manage customer relationships, rivalling Sales-eforce.com, has gained only “a couple of dozen customers” in its first three years, said Mr Wookey, though he said SAP was pressing ahead with a redesigned service.Meanwhile, Business By Design, a full suite of online applications aimed at medium-sized companies, which represents one of SAP’s biggest investments in recent years, has faced teething problems that have forced a protracted delay in its launch, and executives admit that their initial plans were over-ambitious.Acquisitions, including of software maker Business Objects, have since taken SAP’s number of on-demand customers above 1,000 and provided the foundation for it to lay out a broader strategy in the area, Mr Wookey said in an interview.The German company’s new approach will be to integrate its online services far more closely with its traditional business software, in a hybrid model that tries to take advantage of the big installed base of SAP’s business applications.Customers will be able to mix online services and traditional software without running into the sort of problems that currently bedevil the software-as-a-service business, such as balkanising a company’s data by holding it in different systems, said Mr Wookey.“It’s a problem that only we at SAP can solve,” he added.The simplicity of this hybrid approach is likely to have a big appeal to corporate technology departments, said Mr Richardson.Mr Wookey also outlined a vision that would eventually see SAP open up its technology to allow other developers to build on-demand services that would tie into its software.This more open approach represented “a bit of a cultural shift at SAP”, he added.“It’s a big shift for any company to open up in that way,” said Mr Greenbaum. “They get it, they want to do it, it’s taking a little time to turn the tanker.”
144;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2009-04-06T11:06:22Z;SaaS: it could fizzle out on the user desktop;;What is old is new again and hiring software – which has been around almost since computing’s “Day One” – is reinvented under names such as cloud computing, software-as-a-service, and others.All kinds of statistics are tossed around: we read, for example, that “35 per cent of companies by 2011 will be using SaaS”. Today, line-of-business SaaS applications probably account for less than 3 per cent of total enterprise desktop applications. If we assume that the ratio will grow in favour of SaaS, it still has profound implications for integration and productivity.For starters, there is little or no integration capability for existing end-user, desktop applications that are outside of SaaS – which means the whole pile of an enterprise’s legacy applications – mainframe, Windows-native, web, PowerBuilder, Java, even DOS. The list goes on and on….In evaluating integration needs, I have seen enterprises with 500-plus different desktop applications. I have seen as many as 40 applications on one user’s desktop. Sure, the average is around eight or 10.But “integration” often sits squarely on the shoulders of the user, in the form of cumbersome workarounds. Manual copying between windows, flipping and toggling between applications, getting lost, missing critical steps in workflows.This is disastrous for any service-oriented business, such as a contact centre, where time and customer satisfaction are paramount. Why, in 2009, do people think that copy-and-paste is an integration strategy?Regarding integration, I would not discount service oriented architecture, because exploiting services – opening any applications, including a desktop, as a service, or consuming services on the desktop, is a very real and desirable “last kilometre” of SOA. But pure SOA solutions tend to be based around the server, expensive, and often difficult and expensive to modify.Add SaaS, and integration is even more elusive. SaaS in a single browser window or virtualised bubble might solve some problems – upgrades, licence control, maintenance, for example – but creates others. How will it work with your other legacy applications? It could put you back to square one, productivity-wise.There are some bright spots. Salesforce.com, for example, has an application programming interface suite and I think it’s one of the best there is. Even then, integrating SaaS APIs with legacy applications may require significant IT skills that enterprises do not have – and users do not have the patience to wait two years for some kind of solution.But to use Salesforce.com as an example again, look at how it works with Microsoft Outlook. You can seamlessly integrate the two with a couple of clicks. If only you could do that between any applications, with universal APIs available at the desktop.This is why OpenSpan has spent seven years or more building a technology that can quickly mate and harness any application set, at the user level, where productivity, compliance and regulatory demands are greatest. It lets companies use what they have, so that SaaS or other cloud applications are a full asset, not a partial hindrance, to enterprise operations.With SaaS, businesses need to be very careful what they ask for. If they use other applications in the enterprise, then before they put a single SaaS screen on users’ desks, they should make sure it’s not a stand-alone application-in-a-box. The users might not thank you for it.
145;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2009-03-25T20:16:33Z;Cloud control;;A revolution that is sweeping through corporate data centres is the untold secret of modern business. The information factories of the digital age are going through a transition that is every bit as significant as the advent of the moving assembly line was to manufacturing nearly a century ago.Companies that master the new techniques of information processing, or make the right bets about when to hand over control of that operation to someone else with greater skills, stand to reap significant benefits in the form of lower costs and greater usability of their data. But this all comes with significant risks: not only of falling behind as information processing enters a new industrial-scale era but, conversely, of losing control of one of a business’s key assets – its information.The shift is happening largely out of view. Guarded by the priesthood of the IT department and locked away from prying eyes for security reasons, data centres operate beyond the average business manager’s realm of consciousness. The places where the inner workings of business are conducted – where invoices are processed, transactions recorded and corporate secrets stored – are often taken for granted.Every now and then, though, something happens to shine a light on this arcane world. Such a moment came last week, with signs of a realignment among some of the world’s leading technology concerns.Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest maker of networking equipment, said it would start selling servers, the back-room machines that are the workhorses of corporate computing, setting up a showdown with Hewlett-Packard and IBM. It also emerged that IBM was in the late stages of negotiations to buy Sun Microsystems, bringing together two of the biggest suppliers of servers and other technologies for data centres.The maturing of the IT industry and a steep slide into recession provided the immediate impetus for these moves. But something else is at work. After a technology era characterised by the rise of the PC, a new centralisation is taking place in computing and the biggest suppliers of technology are being forced to respond. A catchphrase has been coined to describe this new approach: “cloud computing”.If the past quarter-century was characterised by a decentralisation of computing, with information processing and storage placed on every desk- and laptop, the coming era is set to bring greater consolidation of computing power in “clouds”, or large-scale, distributed computing facilities. Even Microsoft, a company that came to dominate the PC era, is racing to create one of the world’s biggest computing clouds, although it insists this will co-exist with existing forms of personal computing for years to come.The economies of scale that come from consolidating computing in fewer places, and the availability of fast internet connections that make it easy to tap into this resource, account for the shift. As a result, data centres – whether run by large companies or by internet services groups such as Google – are assuming an increased share of the world’s information processing workload.There are striking signs of how this reconfiguration is taking shape. According to Rick Rashid, head of research at Microsoft, a handful of internet companies, including his employer as well as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Amazon.com, is already buying 20 per cent of the world’s output of servers. The massive new data centres these companies are building harness an amount of computing power that far exceeds anything assembled by private companies before, he adds.These companies use much of this brute computing power to run their own online services, including internet search and electronic commerce. Increasingly, though, they are also offering their capacity as a substitute for the data processing and storage that takes place on their customers’ machines.This comes in two forms. Some is made available in the form of services. For instance, rather than store documents and run a word processor on your own PC, you can now just access Google Docs, which mimics many of the functions that Microsoft’s Office software has carried out in the past. In the business world, this approach is known as “software as a service” and involves the provision of corporate applications such as accounting or customer relationship management by companies including Salesforce.com and NetSuite.Small companies in particular are turning to these services to escape the headache of maintaining their own technology. Patricia Seybold, founder of a small consulting business, is typical of those who no longer see any need to run their own IT: for e-mail, for instance, she relies on Google’s free Gmail service. “It’s much nicer getting something for free than having to pay Microsoft and manage a server,” she adds.The second new form of outsourced computing involves the provision of raw data processing power and storage capacity: companies buy access to someone else’s data centre to boost their own capacity at times of need, or even to replace it altogether. Amazon.com has emerged as the unlikely early leader in this business. More than half the online bookseller’s computing resources are being consumed by other companies, which run their own applications in its data centres, says Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer. Customers include the New York Times and Nasdaq.The same forces that are leading to the aggregation of computing power in the internet services companies are also prompting many big companies to centralise more of their internal computing resources, taking advantage of economies of scale that are bringing down the unit cost of information processing and storage. For instance, General Electric’s data centres now consume about 45 per cent of the company’s IT budget, up from 25 per cent three years ago, as it builds up a more centralised resource that can be used by all of its divisions, says Greg Simpson, GE’s chief technology officer.While internet companies are creating “public clouds”, many big companies like GE say they are creating private ones of their own, even as they weigh the benefits of shifting some of their computing to the outside services suppliers.There is a danger, however, in overstating the near-term impact of new developments of this nature. “The ‘cloud’ is definitely hyped right now,” says Dante Malagrino at Cisco. He describes the term as a “fancy way of saying ‘a network of resources’ ”. It is also the case that in IT, there is seldom anything really new under the sun. The centralisation trend is a return to life before the fragmentation brought about by PCs and the proliferation of department-level servers in business to handle tasks such as e-mail. Forerunners of the cloud have gone by names like “utility computing” and “on-demand computing”.Sweeping visions of this kind are easy to lay out yet take years to unfold. Companies do not abandon their earlier investments in technology but layer new technologies on top of old, creating a patchwork of information architectures. Most data centres resemble archaeological digs. Nor will change happen overnight. Companies are deeply cautious about how they handle their information assets and do not experiment with new IT systems lightly. Concerns about security and reliability will act as a drag for years.“Cloud computing” has become useful shorthand for a trend that has shown signs of accelerating as software-as-a-service and the outsourcing of raw computing power are adopted more widely. Yet there are reasons why some computing will continue to take place locally that go beyond a desire by users to keep more direct control of their own data. For a start, technological advances mean many companies will find they can come close to matching the scale economies of giant internet service companies, says Russ Daniels, chief technology officer of cloud computing at Hewlett-Packard. “There are fewer barriers to entry than there were two years ago,” he says.Much will depend on how companies use the new resources – and how they meet the rising expectations of customers who have been taught to expect instant gratification by modern internet services. “All the things Google and Amazon do so well, many of our clients need to do themselves,” says Irving Wladawsky-Berger, a former IBM executive who led that company’s early internet efforts. “In order to be able to scale to deliver large-volume services, you need an industrialised approach.”The idea of having to compete with Google, probably the most advanced engineering force on the planet, is likely to fill the average IT manager with dread. Yet the world of centrally delivered services has room for many players, says Mr Wladawsky-Berger. “Google is at the high end of scalability – not many companies will do that – but the world is full of other services.”Being able to tap into massive data storage and processing power at low cost – and, equally important, having access to it at the drop of a hat rather than waiting for an IT department to procure and provide it – could also add a new level of intelligence to how companies deal with their customers. By analysing everything they know about a customer and relating this to what they know about other customers’ behaviour, companies should be able to make smarter assessments in real time, says Mr Daniels at Hewlett-Packard. “You can make better recommendations to customers because you have better insights,” he says.For managers, that same plentiful supply of IT could make it economical to try out new business ideas that would have fallen by the wayside before. “How many ideas do business managers have where they say, ‘If only we could try this out’?” asks Pat Kerpan, chief technology officer of Cohesive Flexible Technologies, a cloud company that assembles automated software.Ultimately, the effects of this greater centralisation of computing power on business and society are hard to predict, says Microsoft’s Mr Rashid. Every shift such as this to a new computing architecture is accompanied by predictions that derive merely from past experience, he says: for instance, the idea that users will use word processing services “in the cloud” rather than software on their own PCs. Yet the most far-reaching effects of new technology are normally ones that were not anticipated.According to Mr Rashid, that might include the ability to amass much larger volumes of data on scientific topics and subject them to deep analysis, potentially yielding advances in science that were impossible before.As with many aspects of cloud computing, such visions are still more dream than reality. With economic as well as technological forces driving the new centralisation, though, they could take shape not only quickly but in surprising ways.INFORMATION PRODUCTION LINE STARTS VIRTUALLY TO ROLLBehind the rise of cloud computing lies a process revolution that has been taking place on the information production line. It has been compared to the impact on the automotive industry of Toyota’s manufacturing system, which brought a step change in quality and a reduction in costs.“The typical IT organisation is used to a highly customised way of doing things,” says Russ Daniels, chief technology officer of cloud computing at Hewlett-Packard. Adopting more standardised systems “will turn IT into more of a manufacturing process than an art”, he adds.In turn, that could lead companies to decide they no longer want to invest in staying on the cutting edge of the information processing business. The danger, says Mr Daniels, is that this could leave companies without the skills needed to understand and direct their IT.The catalyst for this new industrialisation of IT has been a simple but powerful idea: unchaining computing tasks from the physical machines on which they take place. Until recently, companies bought a new server each time they added a new application. The need to commission, house, maintain and power all those servers has become one of IT’s biggest costs.The antidote to this has been a technology known as “virtualisation”, which makes it possible to run more than one application on each machine. In essence, each application is tricked by the virtualisation software into thinking it is running on its own dedicated server: many new “virtual machines” can exist on a smaller number of actual servers.Breaking the link between a computing task and the hardware of individual computers does not only lead to more efficient use of capacity: virtual machines can be shifted between servers as they are running, or even between data centres, with no interruption.This virtualisation trend has taken hold quickly over the past two to three years. A year ago, says Greg Simpson, chief technology officer at General Electric, his company bought a new server in 85 per cent of the instances when it had a new computing task to handle: by the end of last year, that proportion had fallen to 50 per cent, with “virtual machines” making up the difference.It is a short step from there to shifting some computing tasks from a company’s own computers to those of an external service provider.

147;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-11-04T16:17:32Z;Individuals: Choices limited for those with disability;;"The biggest challenge for most IT system buyers is picking the right one, at the right price.The choice is far more limited, however, if they or their employees have sight problems and rely on “screen reader” technology to scan the text of a web page or application interface and present it in audio format.Roger Wilson-Hinds, co-founder of Screenreader.net, a social enterprise that distributes the software that does this free of charge to blind and visually impaired people around the world, is blind himself. He relies on Thunder, the product his company distributes, in order to run his business.He says of his search for a customer relationship management system: “It was performed slowly, clumsily but with all good intentions – it’s how I do everything online.” With some CRM packages, he found fields on forms that were not labelled in a way that could be read out by Thunder; with others, pop-up screens such as the calendar could not be accessed.Eventually, Mr Wilson-Hinds got in touch with Salesforce.com, the software-as-a-service application provider, and discovered that its CRM software worked well with Thunder, which has been downloaded by more than 100,000 users worldwide to date.Unfortunately, the problems encountered by Mr Wilson-Hinds are not unusual, says Chris Rourke, managing director of User Vision, a company that helps organisations such as the BBC, the Student Loans Company, Tesco Finance and Scottish Widows to ensure their websites and applications are usable and accessible. “It’s all in the way code mark-up is handled, because screen readers depend on code being labelled in a way they can understand,” he explains.“Systems developed in-house, in particular, tend to present problems, because the code isn’t written with the need of all users in mind. If they’re based on widely available Microsoft or Oracle technologies, there’s a better chance that a screen-reader can scan them effectively, but there’s no guarantee because accessibility demands extra talent and ‘duty of care’ from a programmer,” he says.Common obstacles for screen readers include drop-down boxes, image boxes that don’t contain “alt text” describing what they contain and applications that open new browser windows.The problems are not confined to people with sight problems, says Mark Wilson, director of interactive design consultancy Wilson Fletcher. His company is working with the British Dyslexia Association (BDA) to put together best-practice examples of how organisations might design applications to cater to the needs of people with dyslexia.“Mind mapping” software from companies such as Mindjet can be a valuable work tool, says Peter Abrahams, a practice leader in usability and accessibility at Bloor Research, the analyst company.“People with dyslexia find mind-maps easier to understand and create than linear text, especially when they include colours and images. People with limited vision who can see the overall structure of the map, find the electronic mind-map easier to navigate than linear text, as they can pick up on the visual clues of colour, image and structure,” he explains."
148;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-10-21T14:26:26Z;What do buyers REALLY want?;;"In the 1990s, the IT industry developed a reputation for aggressive sales tactics. One of the results of this was that many senior executives became disillusioned when significant investments did not appear to bring the promised benefits.Arguably, over-selling in the late 1990s made the technology downturn that followed deeper and longer than it might otherwise have been.Move forward a decade, and the technology sector could once again be reaching the end of a bull run.Analysts’ predictions have, so far, been mixed. Some reports suggest companies’ IT investments will hold up, even as wider corporate confidence cools. Others have predicted sharp downturns.The counter argument is that IT is now so deeply embedded in operations that to cut spending would be difficult, perhaps even impossible. This is supported by the assertion of industry analysts that most IT departments spend up to 80 per cent of their budgets on operations, or “keeping the lights on”; this spending cannot easily be stopped.If only 20 per cent of funds are being spent on new initiatives and other discretionary work, then it is this slice that appears most vulnerable to spending freezes in the short term. But IT leaders will also want to extract more value from the remaining 80 per cent.As enterprises and government departments have become more dependent on IT, they have also become more canny as buyers.“What people want to know now is what are the trends for the next few years, so they can use technology to support the core business goals,” says Peter Ryan, executive vice-president and global head of sales at Sun Microsystems. “What does it mean, for example, to run a business over the network?”Such questions could just as easily come from the chief executive or chief finance officer, as the chief information officer.A decade ago, IT purchasing decisions were still largely the preserve of the CIO and their teams. This is still the case in some areas, such as commodity hardware or networking. But in other areas, they are now more likely to work togther with senior management from the line of business that will ultimately use the technology or service.The traffic has not all been one way. In some companies, the role of the CIO is in real danger of being downgraded because line-of-business managers deal directly with external suppliers for services previously run by IT.The growth of hosted applications, or software as a service (SaaS), has made it possible for some business units to bypass the CIO altogether.Salesforce automation is one area where SaaS has largely expanded in spite of, rather than because of the CIO. This has led to rapid growth in vendors such as NetSuite and Salesforce.com.At the other end of the spectrum, truly strategic IT projects are being handled at board level, sometimes without involvement of the chief information officer.As Henning Kagermann, co-CEO of enterprise software company SAP, said in a recent interview with Digital Business, he more often meets CEOs than CIOs when large deals are on the table.But he concedes there are many more projects that are no less important, but which are not truly strategic. In most cases, the board will be happy to leave these decisions to the IT department.“It is an exaggeration to say the CEO is not involved [in IT purchasing] but that is still the exception rather than the rule. The majority of IT decisions, unless they are critical, are made by the CIO or their team,” says Peter Matthews, head of technology consulting for the UK and Ireland at Ernst & Young.But even where a decision needs input from the very top, interest from the CEO should not necessarily be seen as a threat.One of the most important discussions in the IT industry in recent years has been about the alignment of IT with the business. There is no doubt that CIOs have become more business literate since 2000. But the past few years have also seen the rise of the IT-savvy CEO.“Most of today’s managers have grown up with PCs,” says Paul Willmott, director of the London technology practice at McKinsey, the management consultants. “Companies realise the importance of marrying technology with business change. The business is very involved in sponsoring new technology.”Rather than causing the CIO’s role in enterprises to diminish, such interest often has the result of strengthening the buyer’s hand when it comes to dealing with suppliers.In the past, vendors might have used a technology-heavy marketing approach to impress a CIO who, like them, was probably a technologist by background. Such tactics are unlikely to impress the CEO. Nor will they win over the latest generation of business-focused CIOs.“It is a win-win situation,” says Mr Willmott. “It gives a lot more sponsorship [to projects] from the business people who will see the benefits, and it encourages the vendor to think through the benefit their technology can bring.”There is evidence that IT buyers’ priorities have also shifted.Features, functions and raw computing power are still important, but they are, increasingly, secondary to the long-term economics of a deal, and the ability of the vendor to take on work such as integrating its software or hardware with other systems, or even to provide advice and consulting services.Research by IDC, the industry analysts, found that IT buyers no longer appreciated the traditional marketing message of technical superiority.“Choosing a primary supplier means choosing a valued partner with which the company wants to keep a long-term relationship,” wrote IDC analyst Laura Converso, in a recent report on European enterprises’ IT buying.“At this point, a number of other non-technical conditions can become more important,” continued IDC. “Companies in which the IT manager dominates the decision process tend to have stronger emphasis on technical capabilities than companies involving a broader group of people in the decision process.”For the second group, the relationship and the cost of the deal were the most important factors.In some cases, businesses are looking beyond the basics of a deal for extras that will help them improve their IT systems or, at the very least, cut the cost of running them. This might mean using the vendor’s in-house consultancy arm to customise software or to integrate it with existing systems.Buyers might want access to the supplier’s engineering team, in order to make fundamental changes to the way a software application, or sometimes even a piece of hardware, works. And they are very likely to want a detailed overview of the vendor’s product roadmap.“It’s important for any large company to understand what changes are coming down the line,” explains Gary Curtis, managing director of Accenture Technology Consulting.“It might take more than a year, for example, to roll out the release of desktop software. The vendor is not that anxious to provide that roadmap, as it exposes work in progress, but it is often put into vendor master agreements. Vendors will give you that information if you are buying in quantity.”According to Mr Curtis, the most common request from IT buyers is for software or hardware that works first time, followed closely by fewer releases and updates. Both factors can dramatically affect the cost of running an IT system and, he says, rank ahead of both price and features for most CIOs.Some, but by no means all, vendors understand this. Some, for example, have cut the number of product releases, or made them easier to implement.SAP, for example, now allows customers to add new features as modules, rather than upgrading whole systems to the next version.IDC also found that IT buyers wanted more education and, often, advice from vendors. Smaller IT departments and the growing complexity of many systems mean that companies rely more heavily on vendors’ consultancy and integration capabilities.Vendors, for their part, have responded by bolstering their consultancy arms.But IT buyers should not confuse this with independent advice, cautions Stephen Pratt, head of consulting at Infosys. “You won’t get the straight scoop on their strengths or weaknesses. It is incumbent on us and on clients to step up and do their due diligence. It is very important to make sure you get, at least, a good second opinion.”“Vendors are trying to change,” says Ernst & Young’s Mr Matthews. “I think that people have recognised that it’s about trying to demonstrate something that solves business problems rather than supplying kit.”But for their part, IT buyers will also need to rein in their excitement about having the latest and greatest hardware and software, and focus instead on whether it pays its way in the business."

150;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-10-07T08:50:41Z;Mobility diary: It might just start with a virtual kiss;;Social networking sites such as MySpace, Facebook and Twitter are growing increasingly mobile and ABI Research is forecasting 140m users of mobile social networks by 2013.Inevitably, this mass-market juggernaut is also crowding into the mobile enterprise world.Enterprise-focused social networking sites, and companies that have built businesses on cloud computing models, where users can share documents and information in real time from any internet point, are working out their mobile strategies.This year, the enterprise social network LinkedIn launched a long-awaited mobile version of its site. And companies such as Salesforce.com and Google have continued to enhance access to their applications via mobile devices. In September, Google launched its own Android mobile phone, and Salesforce.com, which has been offering a mobile version of its CRM software since 2004, released an iPhone client to access the products.There are some complete newcomers joining the market, too. Within one week last month, a just-launched company called Yammer, and a group at an SAP developers’ event both offered unrelated enterprise-class versions of Twitter, the group instant messaging service.Yammer says that 50,000 users, from about 10,000 organisations, signed up for the service during the first two weeks it was in operation. Oracle also made a move, in September, into the enterprise-grade collaboration market, with a new platform called Beehive.Mobile technology has made it easier for business people to communicate, but anecdotal evidence suggests there is demand from business users for more flexible ways of staying in touch.Hussein Kanji, a partner at venture capital firm, Accel, reports that a friend of his who works in the Microsoft Live Server team says that the number one feature requested is a “Twitter-like” service built into the application.“I think there’s a lot of frustration among users because they go home and can communicate in different ways, but they don’t have that at work,” says David Sacks, Yammer chief executive.One area that might start to see activity, is that of enterprise applications running on consumer platforms, such as Facebook.Eitan Gelbaum, a vice president overseeing product marketing in advertising, commerce and entertainment at billing specialists, Amdocs, believes there could be an opportunity for developers to focus on applications for single tasks – in effect, widgets – that will run on an existing online framework, such as Facebook, or in the case of a mobile device, a carrier’s portal.“Developers can take the functions of typical Facebook applications, such as virtual kisses and pokes and develop them into enterprise applications,” says Mr Gelbaum. “I don’t think developers will create a full-blown CRM service like salesforce.com, but smaller lightweight applications like scheduling tools and appointment managers, or billing services, or even presence capabilities, could prove to be very popular.”Facebook currently has 15m mobile users, which is not many compared with the 100m plus that access it via PCs.Nevertheless, there are signs that a site such as Facebook could become a useful tool for business people on the move: the site already hosts dozens of third-party enterprise applications.Facebook usage also appears to be growing among “end users”: Jim Balsillie, co-chief executive of RIM, which makes the BlackBerry, recently noted that the Facebook application for BlackBerry devices has been downloaded more than 2.5m times, “the fastest take-up of any application we’ve ever had”.Developments such as these have their detractors. “The internet is still a bit like the Wild West,” says Adrian Burholt, chief executive of The Key Revolution, a cloud computing spin-off of Vodafone, which still has a controlling stake in the company. “If you use the internet to transport data, it needs to be managed, controlled and encrypted. But that is not what the likes of Facebook or others do today. A lot of applications on the web are just not trusted.”But the turmoil in the financial markets, may anyway curtail enterprise IT investment in areas such as mobile data services.Experimenting with services on bigger consumer platforms could be a good way for companies to dip their toes into the Web 2.0 water before investing in larger projects.

153;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-09-10T20:52:23Z;Rally in energy and tech stocks lift Wall Street;;Washington Mutual slid to its lowest level since 1991 on Wednesday as the wider financial sector took scant comfort from Lehman Brothers’ hurried update and failed to recover from the previous session’s heavy losses.The mortgage lender, which has been placed under special regulatory supervision, fell a further 29.7 per cent to $2.32 as the cost of insuring against the risk of its default rose markedly. Earlier this week, Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook on the lender from “stable” to “negative”.Also in focus was American International Group, which fell a further 4.7 per cent to 17.50 after the world’s largest insurer suffered a fall of 19.3 per cent in the previous session on the back of mounting uncertainty over Lehman Brother’s ability to raise capital.Citigroup, which cut its profit forecasts, nevertheless wrote in a note to clients: “Not similar to Lehman – we believe that AIG has plenty of less drastic options in its arsenal …before the impact of a controlling partner is even under consideration.”Investment banks Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch lost 3.7 per cent to 38.92 and 5.9 per cent to $23.30, respectively.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a sector note: “The bank operating environment remains challenging, amid slowing economic growth, contraction of credit and constrained capital.”E-Trade Financial fell 4.4 per cent $3.03 after it said three-year cumulative losses on its home equity loans would be greater than expected.Shares in Lehman Brothers, which disclosed its third-quarter earnings a week early to reassure investors, edged down 1.8 per cent to $7.95, after a 45 per cent fall in Tuesday’s session.On Tuesday, the financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as deepening uncertainty over the investment bank’s ability to strengthen its balance sheet prompted wider concerns over asset sales ahead of banks’ third quarter earnings season.However, a rally in energy and technology stocks helped lift the major indices into positive territory on Wednesday.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,232.04 by the close in New York while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 11,268.92 and the Nasdaq rose 0.9 per cent to 2,228.70.Outside financials, the mood was upbeat. In particular, an update from Fedex helped sentiment.The cargo group said first-quarter profit would exceed its forecasts on the back of lower fuel costs and its shares rose 3.7 per cent to $87.86.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments rose 0.6 per cent to $21.85 on the back of a positive update from the chipmaker that eased concerns over reduced mobile phone demand.Orders this quarter matched its expectations and the company did not cut forecasts. S&P raised its price target from $96 to $105.That gave a boost to technology stocks, which have been hard hit in recent sessions on fears of global growth slowdown.The sector boasted gains of 0.7 per cent while shares of technology bellwether IBM rose 2.61 per cent to $118.04.Research in Motion rose 5.4 per cent to $104.61 after unveiling plans to launch a new “flip” version of its BlackBerry Pearl phone.Yahoo edged up 0.7 per cent at $17.70 even after Sanford C Bernstein cut its price target from $26 to $24.But Google lost 1.1 per cent to $414.16 after Lehman Brothers cut its price target from $620 to $600.Meanwhile, energy stocks rallied following Opec’s decision to lower oil production.Among the top gainers were ExxonMobil, up 2.7 per cent at $75.25, Massey Energy, up 8.2 per cent at $42.10 and Hess, which which stood 7.5 per cent higher at $85.67.US Steel advanced 4.5 per cent to $35.23 after reaching an agreement with the United Steelworkers union.In other news, interdealer broker GFI Group fell 24.5 per cent to $7.26 after merger talks with Tullett Prebon of the UK fell apart as the two were unable to reach acceptable terms.Elsewhere, software maker Salesforce.com and Fastenal rose after the duo were picked to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the S&P 500. Their shares rose 7.7 per cent to $56.09 and 0.8 per cent to $52.58, respectively.
154;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-08-27T17:27:33Z;The end of a software gravy train;;"That parts of the software business are being reinvented as a service industry has become a truism in the technology world. Why face the hassle of loading and running software when you can go online and tap into some internet service that does the job just as well, at a fraction of the cost?Behind this glib observation, though, lies a world of hurt. One of the world’s most profitable industries is being turned into – well, it’s not quite clear what yet, but it is likely to be something that no longer commands profit margins fit to make Croesus jealous.This was brought home to me again this week when listening to the co-heads of SAP discussing the difficulties they have had breaking into this so-called “software as a service” market. The idea of Saas is that companies pay a low monthly fee based on the number of employees who access an online service. No need to buy customer relationship management software to keep track of clients, for instance: just plug your company’s data into a web service.An all-singing, all-dancing online service for medium-sized companies has been one of the most important initiatives for Europe’s biggest software company for the past couple of years, and it does not seem to be going well. Henning Kagermann, SAP’s cerebral boss for the past decade, and Léo Apotheker, who will take over the reins fully next year, say they are deliberately holding back while they perfect the system.They profess themselves patient: the technology and the business model work, they say; they just need more automation to squeeze out cost. Once they prove they can make money they will be ready to “scale up” fast.There is a distinct tone of sour grapes as they contemplate how Wall Street has embraced lossmaking or only marginally profitable Saas start-ups with open arms. “If you are a start-up and you burn money, the Street rewards you,” says Mr Kagermann; established companies do not get given the benefit of the doubt.One can sympathise – but only up to a point. This has all the hallmarks of a big, successful company trying to learn an entirely new business and floundering. The technology approach, the management skills and the financial incentives are all very different in the Saas business. SAP may eventually get the formula right, but it has high cultural, organisational and economic barriers to cross.Even most of the companies created from scratch to address this market are labouring to show they can make a decent hand of it. Consider the economics of Saas, which are very different from those of traditional software. Like all subscription businesses, these turn on three things: how much it costs to attract new customers (known as subscriber acquisition costs), how much money can be extracted from those customers in regular subscriptions (known as “average revenue per user”, or Arpu) and how often subscribers drop out and have to be replaced (the churn rate).Saas has punishingly high sales and marketing costs. The SAP executives say this is their biggest problem, and one they are working to address with automation. Pure Saas companies face the same challenge. Even Salesforce.com, the one company that has proved it can make a consistent profit from the business (albeit a small one), spends half its revenues on sales and marketing. For others, the figure is much higher.Of course, high sales and marketing expenses are not a problem if new customers end up supplying steady Arpu and sticking around long enough to yield a decent return on the acquisition costs. This is where the new online software industry has yet to prove itself. Most new customers of Saas companies are turning to the service for the first time. They are still learning the ropes, and have not yet learnt how to play rival suppliers off against each other. Tougher price competition and customer churn will be inescapable characteristics of a more mature, competitive market.That makes Saas very different from the old software business. The real gravy for companies such as SAP, Oracle and other “enterprise” software companies comes from the annual maintenance fees they charge their customers, not selling new software. Maintenance accounted for 58 per cent of Oracle’s software revenues last year, and 74 per cent of the profits.Customers usually have no choice but to pay up. They know that dumping their traditional software supplier and moving to a new one will leave them facing huge switching costs. That kind of customer lock-in does not apply to the online service business. As Marc Benioff, who built Salesforce.com, puts it: “It’s like your telephone service – if you don’t like it you can switch.”The companies that come out on top could end up looking much more like today’s telephone companies than the present generation of enterprise software companies. They will have systems for vacuuming up large numbers of customers cheaply, and will compete on their ability to guarantee high levels of service quality and availability.ADP, a big, boring computing utility that processes many companies’ payrolls, is one model for how this new business could evolve.Some traditional software companies will make the leap into services, but make no mistake: they won’t make software-style profits any more.richard.waters@ft.com"
155;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-08-13T01:11:43Z;Apple wages 3G war for BlackBerry core;;When Apple launched its touch screen iPhone 3G at its flagship London store, there was the predictable queue of people, eager to own a device which is equal parts phone, MP3 player and wireless web browser. Among the Apple aficionados and tech geeks, three besuited men stood together, all thumbing their BlackBerrys. When asked why they were lining up for an iPhone before 8am, one held up his BlackBerry and said: “Because this is damn ugly.”His friend, a consultant, from PA Consulting, called his BlackBerry “clunky”, while another said the iPhone would make it easier for him to communicate with clients. All disliked the BlackBerry’s “Qwerty” keyboard and web browser.Apple has launched its new iPhone decisively into BlackBerry’s business market, by improving security, e-mail and allowing third-party software to run on its platform. But this is not a challenge Research in Motion (Rim), maker of BlackBerry, is going to take lightly. Its most consumer-friendly phone yet, the Bold, could launch next week, while a multimillion dollar marketing campaign, “Life on BlackBerry”, sees it make a more determined push beyond its corporate core.Both are chasing the scale required for making the competitive smartphone business pay, with the stakes raised after recent results disappointed investors. BlackBerry is dominant in the larger end of the corporate market, but is facing tough competition among smaller companies that use Microsoft’s mobile operating system, which can be cheaper. Apple has set a target of selling 10m iPhone 3G devices worldwide, which could be tough in a weakening consumer environment.Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura, said BlackBerry’s attempt to crack the consumer market has “not been particularly competitive”. Unassailable in its e-mail handling, other BlackBerry functions such as media playing have even lagged behind many Nokia or Sony Ericsson devices. “The Apple experience on their device is second to none,” said Mr Windsor. “Rim has a lot of work to do to catch up” in scaling up its manufacturing and distribution capability as well as design, he addedNokia’s senior vice-president of devices, Søren Petersen, has been scathing about BlackBerry’s consumer push. “Selling to women is about more than making it pink,” he told the FT in June, referring to a colourful edition of the BlackBerry Pearl, its device that’s most like a regular phone. But he also dismissed the iPhone’s security and business features as “not worthy of discussion”.New models could help BlackBerry’s consumer push. BlackBerry Bold has a high-resolution screen, improved camera and slicker design. Like the iPhone, it boasts both 3G and wi-fi connectivity, making it better for watching video and surfing the web.That could leave software as the battlefront between the two smartphone behemoths, an area where Andrew Brown, analyst at Strategy Analytics, thinks Nokia has failed to capitalise. “Apple is in a good position to slaughter the lot of them because they’ve kept it pretty simple and accessible.”BlackBerry users have thousands of downloadable applications to choose from – if they can find them. BlackBerry relies on third parties to distribute compatible software and its consumer offering extends little beyond a Facebook application. Developers are put off by its strict security requirements – critical for corporates.After only a few months, more than 1,700 iPhone applications – around a quarter of them free – can be downloaded direct to the handset or iTunes. Importantly for developers, Apple customers have shown themselves willing to pay for digital downloads. Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, has claimed Apple made $30m (£15m) from 60m downloads in the first month that the iPhone was available.Enterprise software companies, such as Salesforce.com and Oracle, are making some applications iPhone-ready. But reliability problems with Apple’s MobileMe service – an online e-mail, calendar and file-sharing service – hit its credibility, especially compared with BlackBerry’s service.A survey of nearly 600 office workers by Dave, a London-based creative business consultancy, found two- thirds trusted the BlackBerry over the iPhone, while more chose BlackBerry as a consumer tool than iPhone for business use.Nomura’s Mr Windsor concludes: “It would be easier for BlackBerry to go consumer than it will be for Apple to go corporate.”
156;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-07-08T15:33:07Z;Valley view: The IT world pokes its head in the cloud;;Mixed with the usual fog rolling off the Pacific into San Francisco at this time of year, there has been a heavy haze and distinct smell of smoke caused by more than a thousand fires burning in northern and central California in the tinder-dry conditions.The atmosphere is being recreated in the tech world with a smoky haze hanging over the rolling concept of cloud computing – just a buzz phrase or perhaps the biggest thing to happen in computing since e-commerce?In a report published two weeks ago, Gartner, the research firm said cloud computing heralds an evolution that is no less influential than e-business.On the same day, Yahoo announced a reorganisation that included “developing a world-class cloud-computing and storage infrastructure” and Microsoft said cloud computing was behind its acquisition of MobiComp, which offers back-up technology for mobile data.Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the Structure ’08 conference discussed how the internet infrastructure needed to be renewed for cloud computing, and start-ups were told the technology offered them pain-free scaling, as they grew into the next eBay or Facebook.If cloud computing sounds a bit nebulous, here are a couple of definitions.Gartner defines it as “a style of computing where massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided ‘as a service’, using internet technologies, to multiple external customers”.Merrill Lynch, which published a 90-page report on “The Cloud Wars” in May, describes it more simply as “delivering personal and business productivity applications from centralised servers”.Sounds familiar? Yes, this is Application Service Providers (ASPs) and the Software as a Service (SaaS) model that we’ve been talking about for years.But cloud computing does not appear to be a new label pasted on an old bottle to generate fresh sales. What seems to be different this time is the far greater scale that is being attempted. Big companies are involved and they are offering not just services but platforms on which they are encouraging developers to create services and applications.What is being planned is expected to encompass everyone from major enterprises to small start-ups and individual consumers. Hardware companies will vie for the business of equipping massive data farms around the world, while fearing for their PC businesses.Merrill Lynch says the shift harks back to the days of centralised mainframe computing, implying the retreat of its successor, the client-server model.While it is easy to imagine enterprises replacing employees’ desktop PCs with dumb terminals running applications from the cloud, there are also signs of how consumers will opt for this model. Look at how everything can be done in the browser now and stored in the cloud, from e-mail to word-processing and photo and video editing and storage.Nicholas Carr, in his book The Big Switch, compares the rise of utility computing with electrification in the 19th century. Power production switched from in-house generating plants to centralised utilities.Google, with its web-based services and massive infrastructure, seems certain to be a cloud-computing leader, but there are also less likely candidates. The online retailer Amazon has shown others the way in cloud computing, selling its expertise in infrastructure through its Amazon Web Services for the past two years and developing its Elastic Compute Cloud, Simple Storage and database services.Gartner says a company such as Wal-Mart, with its supply chain expertise, could lease its core competencies as a cloud-computing service in similar fashion.Merrill Lynch says the economics are compelling, with business applications made three to five times cheaper and consumer applications five to 10 times cheaper. It sizes the market opportunity at $95bn for applications, with another $65bn coming from online advertising.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, believes a super-group of technology companies will dominate cloud computing. He expects his company to be one of them. It has its own twist on the concept with Live Mesh, where cloud data is synchronised with every kind of device.Apple, too, hinted at its cloud ambitions when it unveiled the new iPhone last month and a MobileMe web-based service.Merrill Lynch says that only Microsoft and Google have offerings in all three core categories of infrastructure, platform and applications, but other significant players in one or two are Amazon, EMC, IBM, NetSuite, Salesforce.com, Sun and Yahoo.Then others such as Akamai, Dell, HP, NetApp and VMware are enabling cloud technologies with their hardware and software.Fears about reliability, security and performance levels remain as barriers to adoption by businesses.They are likely to be the main arguments used by IT departments to justify their continued existence and to warn their bosses not to put their heads in the clouds too soon.
157;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-06-08T18:07:35Z;Information technology;;Who has not, when confronted by the daily exasperation of office technology, questioned the parenthood and purpose of information technology departments? Advocates of computing in “the cloud” hope to make them largely superfluous.Instead of going to the effort of installing and maintaining computing locally, all those tricksy applications, not to mention storage and data processing, can be provided centrally from shared infrastructure. Merrill Lynch estimates that more efficient management of resources – such as servers – could provide services at a cost five to 10 times cheaper than that provided by a more traditional in-house approach.The revolution has been a long time coming. Computing on tap as a concept was floated as far back as the 1960s. Sun Microsystems has been actively pushing grid, or utility, computing for almost a decade. What has changed is the rise of viable business models such as software-as-a-service. Salesforce.com is the most high-profile of these companies, but Oracle, Microsoft and SAP are all investing in subscription-based services aimed at small businesses – typically those with fewer than 1,500 employees.So there are some valuable niches to exploit. On current growth rates, Saas sales should double between 2006 and 2011. And if subscription services can show real economies of scale in distribution and sales – not something that Salesforce.com has yet demonstrated – sky-high valuations for Saas companies might be justified.But the segment’s sales of about $3bn remain a small fraction of a global $270bn software market. The impact of inertia should not be discounted either. Chief executives tend to dislike replacing equipment that still works. Mainframes were superseded by servers decades ago but IBM still makes and maintains them. Important security and regulatory questions have to be answered before large companies will consider the cost of moving any form of critical data into the cloud. To hope for more than slow, if steady, progress over several years is to build castles in the air.
158;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-05-29T16:32:52Z;Response to Alastair McAulay’s article on whether it will live up to its billing;;"THREE ISSUES MUST BE ADDRESSED BY PROVIDERS BEFORE CLOUD COMPUTING IS READY FOR PRIME-TIMECloud computing has received plenty of attention of late. Its colourful name notwithstanding, it promises tangible benefits to its users such as sourcing flexibility for hardware and software, a pay-as-you-go rather than fixed-cost approach, continuous upgrades for mission-critical enterprise software, and the centralised management of user software.Yet, as presently constituted, cloud computing may not be a panacea for every organization. The hardware, software and desktop clouds are mature enough for early adopters. Amazon, for example, can already point to more than 10 billion objects on its storage cloud; Salesforce.com generated more than $740 million in revenues for its 2008 fiscal year; and Google includes General Electric and Procter & Gamble among the users of its desktop cloud. However, several issues must still be addressed and these involve three critical matters: where data resides, the security of software and data against malicious attacks, and performance requirements.DataSay you use Salesforce.com as your Software as a Service (SaaS) provider. In theory, this is where you would locate your CRM data. However, in practice, most organisations are likely to have proprietary applications running on their own data center and that use the same data. Furthermore, if one provider is used for CRM, another for human resources and yet another for enterprise resource planning, there’s likely to be considerable overlap between the data used by the three providers and the proprietary applications in the company’s own data center.So where do you locate the data?There are existing and potential options. First, is the platform scenario. Some SaaS providers have evolved from offering single vertical capability (such as CRM) into providing SaaS ”platforms” that bundle their vertical capability with a development environment and an integration environment. The theory is that while an enterprise may use multiple SaaS providers and proprietary applications, there will be a primary provider that hosts all the data and provides a development environment where data can be integrated with all the applications (including other SaaS) using the data.Next, is the database-as-a-service scenario. In this case, one provider – which could be the organisation’s data center – only hosts the data and provides ”database as a service” to all the applications. While this model does not presently exist, it’s a distinct possibility that would offer the advantage of not tying the enterprise to a single SaaS provider for all its data and integration needs.SecurityPerhaps the primary concern when it comes to cloud computing is security. While this is likely to be a significant near-term concern, one could argue that a large SaaS provider whose entire business is predicated on securing its clients’ data and applications would be in a better position to do so than the IT organisation of a single company itself. As an example of the confidence certain global organisations have in this new paradigm, Citigroup recently signed up 30,000 users with Salesforce.com to address CRM needs after extensive evaluation of the SaaS provider’s security infrastructure.The point is that providers are endeavoring to improve their offerings to meet clients’ enterprise-grade security needs. Still, companies in certain industries, such as defence, aerospace and brokerage, are likely to avoid the cloud computing environment because of their security and compliance concerns.However, not too far off is the emergence of “gated community” clouds that, like gated communities, would keep out the riffraff. These highly selective private clouds or consortia would have dedicated networks that connect only their members. Unlike a single company’s data center, a private cloud can consolidate the hardware and software needs of multiple companies, provide load balancing and economies of scale, and still eliminate many of the security concerns.PerformanceWhile the Internet is fast enough to send data to a user from a remote server, it lacks the speed to handle large transaction volume with stringent performance needs if the applications must access their databases through the internet.The emergence of a full ecosystem of enterprise SaaS (for ERP, HR, CRM, supply chain management) plus database-as-a-service, all within a single hardware cloud, will help solve performance problems. An ecosystem cloud also has the added advantage of better integration across the different providers that are part of the same ecosystem.Just as today’s enterprise software falls into distinct ecosystems (Microsoft, Oracle, SAP), cloud computing may well organize itself in a similar fashion, with a number of hardware clouds and a set of complementary (non-competing) SaaS providers and a database-as-a-service provider.For now, cloud computing offers several potential benefits for both small and large companies: lower IT costs, faster deployment of new IT capabilities, an elastic IT infrastructure that can expand or contract as needed and, most importantly, a CIO freed from the more mundane aspects of managing the IT infrastructure. In fact, industry analyst Gartner estimates that by 2012, one in every three dollars spent on enterprise software will be a service subscription rather than a product license and that early adopters will purchase as much as 40 percent of their hardware infrastructure as a service rather than as equipment.Although individual aspects of cloud computing are already relatively mature, how they will all come together and which of the scenarios discussed will play out remains unclear. For now, organisations that take a tactical approach that includes moving aging, non-strategic applications to a hardware cloud: using SaaS for processes that don’t have a significant data overlap with other critical processes and experimenting with network-based desktop for small, deskbound workforces can gain valuable experience and insight into how to take advantage of this emerging phenomenon.This gives CIOs ample time to develop long-term strategies as the paradigm continues to evolve in order to solve those data, security and performance issues."
159;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-05-29T16:32:52Z;Response to Alastair McAulay, Phill Robinson and Malcolm Carrie;;Years of hype about utility computing have made it a contentious subject with many in the industry now treating it with extreme caution bordering on skepticism.In his Personal View article, Alastair McAulay of PA Consulting Group points out that, although “It was only five years ago that Gartner was predicting that by 2008 utility computing…was going to be in the mainstream”, this has not yet happened, despite the considerable industry hype. He goes on to discuss the potential benefits, limitations and impact of such a model in the future. In contrast, Phill Robinson of Velocix says that we are already “very much in the throes of the software as a service era.”Whilst Robinson feels that SaaS, “is already here and has been for years,” Malcolm Carrie of the Corporate IT Forum is more conservative, suggesting that “Some applications are now approaching utility status”He uses webmail services as an example. Robinson points to Salesforce.com, which is frequently held up as the poster child for successful SaaS, though McAulay feels it is an example of a fairly limited kind of business function that “can be sensibly commoditised and handed over to an IT utility service provider”.In actual fact, there is a huge range of applications already being offered and deployed as hosted services, including e-commerce, partner management, collaboration and ERP tools. The adoption of SaaS has been an evolution, not a revolution and we now see ever more vendors recognising the demand for a model that offers myriad benefits, most notably the straight-forward one that businesses only pay for what they need and this is exactly what they receive. In the pre-existing IT model, where businesses host applications themselves, they have to invest in server and networking hardware, datacentre equipment, operating systems, infrastructure software, administration personnel and support services before they can even think about buying the specific application they want to run.With the SaaS model, this underlying infrastructure is no longer owned by the end-user business and they only have to pay for the actual application as and when they use it, which is a much simpler and more efficient way of working. It is not hard then to understand where the demand for SaaS comes from. What is more surprising is that the model has not been more widely adopted. However, when you consider that the burden of the underlying technology infrastructure would instead be passed on to the application vendor, it is easy to understand why SaaS has taken a while to become more widespread.Offering SaaS has traditionally meant vendors would need fundamentally to restructure their business models and architecture. However, on the whole it does not make sense for application vendors to try and offer all the IT elements a business needs. The answer, then, does not lie in a single vendor environment but rather in software vendors working with service providers to find a workable approach to meeting customer demand for hosted applications. The service providers provide the infrastructure to underpin the application delivery and, because they can take advantage of economies of scale, the costs are not prohibitive.You might ask why this model could not have been deployed five or ten years ago. There are numerous reasons but a crucial factor was that service providers could not sweat their infrastructure hard enough for the SaaS model to make financial sense. This has changed in recent years with developments in virtualisation and automation technology. By using virtualisation to consolidate the thousands of servers they need to run, hosting companies can make their hardware far more efficient and the SaaS proposition less costly to set up and operate. Virtual servers can be very quickly provisioned to meet customer demand, and automation tools can be used to reduce the management headache and simplify the process. Taking advantage of such tools, hosting companies can work with multiple vendors to offer businesses real value from integrated IT solutions.The future of SaaS is in the more complex value chain. Application vendors should continue to focus on what they do best: developing business logic in the form of applications, but these should be built to suit the on-demand model of SaaS. Hosting companies should focus on perfecting the infrastructure to deliver these applications as services. By working with vendors, these service providers can become the primary channel for applications for an enterprise.
160;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-05-14T03:17:59Z;Microsoft hosts CRM;;"Microsoft has launched its hosted customer relationship management service, Dynamics CRM Online. It is designed to steal business from online CRM pioneers such as Salesforce.com. It comes with 5GB of storage and costs $44 a month for each user; Dynamics CRM Online Professional Plus with 20GB and more features, costs $59. The Microsoft-hosted service is limited to North America although Microsoft partners can offer it in other territories.● Salesforce.com has teamed up with Google to offer Salesforce.com for GoogleApps. By offering tight integration between Salesforce.com’s hosted CRM service and Google’s online productivity applications, which include word processing, calendar and e-mail, the two firms hope more businesses will abandon packaged software for their cloud-based computing models.● SAP has teamed up with Microsoft to help banks that have caught the service-oriented architecture (SOA) bug but don’t know where to start. The aim of the newly created Banking Industry Architecture Network (BIAN) is to let banks and vendors pool knowledge of how to apply SOA concepts to banking IT systems, many of which use legacy technologies.● You’ve built your SOA system, but does it work? Hewlett-Packard offers new versions of its SOA testing products, HP Service Test and HP Service Test Management. HP also unveiled related software to manage SOAs once up and running.● Going green? IBM aims to make the process easier with Active Energy Manager (AEM). The new software allows IT managers to control energy use for servers, storage, and networking as well as the air conditioning and power management systems that keep the data centre running. IBM is also offering an energy certification programme which allows businesses to trade their energy savings for cash.● Macintosh users often get overlooked by mainstream IT vendors. Not any more. EMC has unveiled an online back-up service for small businesses and consumers running Macs. MozyHome for Mac offers 2GB of online back-up for free, while for $4.95 a month you can have unlimited online back-up capacity. Once the initial back-up is done, successive back-ups are incremental and so much quicker – just don’t try doing it over a dial-up connection. A Mac version of its business-class back-up service, MozyPro, is also in the works.● Going, going, nearly gone. Outlook Express is still around although Microsoft seems determined to kill off its free e-mail program in favour of its successor Windows Live Mail. The latest nail in the coffin comes when Outlook Express users try to access a free Microsoft Hotmail account. From June 30, they will not be able to, as support for the “legacy protocol” used by OE is being withdrawn. Corporate PCs usually come with Outlook instead of Outlook Express and should be unaffected."

But in Japan, a country famed for its electronic widgets and technological prowess, home-grown software providers and internet entrepreneurs are conspicuously absent.Foreign companies, particularly those headquartered in the US, have, for the most part, leapfrogged their Japanese counterparts both in terms of collaborative networking sites and in providing innovative software.Yahoo Japan – originally a joint venture between Yahoo and Softbank, a Japanese mobile phone and internet service provider – and Google dominate the search engine market in Japan, with analysts estimating a 55 and 45 per cent market share respectively.Salesforce.com, a California-based company, is the leading provider of software as a service (Saas) in Japan, allowing companies to tap into the most up-to-date IT systems by choosing the software they want to use over the internet for a monthly flat fee, rather than having to buy a costly bundled package. Baidu, China’s leading search engine, recently made a splash in Japan by launching its site in Japanese.“Software is an intangible asset,” says Hiroshi Kamide, internet analyst at KBC Securities. “Japanese companies have focused on making gadgets as opposed to software. It’s also more difficult for Japanese [internet and software] companies to make a product and sell it overseas due to the language barrier, whereas vice versa it’s much easier.”Industry experts say a focus on hardware stunted development of software platforms and internet-based solutions. Moreover, hardware companies often bundled free proprietary software with a purchase.More fundamental roadblocks in Japan have prevented internet and software entrepreneurs from flourishing. Japan’s tradition of lifetime employment has led to low labour mobility in the services sectors. Venture capital funding is scarce, particularly compared with the US.“The Japanese industrial structure is not very efficient,” says Hiromichi Shirakawa, economist at Credit Suisse. “Productivity in the services sector is kind of dead. Over the past six years, productivity gains [in the service sector] have been less than 2 per cent, while manufacturers have gained 4-5 per cent, which is comparable to Europe.”Alarmed by the slow growth in productivity at companies that employ fewer than 50 people, the government is set to invest Y5bn ($50.5m) in infrastructure that will provide much-needed software services for Japan’s small- and medium-sized enterprises.The goal is to make smaller companies – many of which do not have the capital to make big investments in technology – more efficient by providing software services, including accounting, HR management and supply chain management.Software as a service (Saas) is extensively used in the US and parts of Europe. Japan has been relatively slow to offer such services. Japan Post recently outsourced its customer data management to Salesforce.com, the leader in Saas in both the US and Japan, in a bid to reduce costs.According to the ministry of economy, trade and industry (Meti), investment in IT systems by companies capitalised at more than Y10bn has risen to over Y5bn in 2004, a 16 per cent increase from 2000. But the amount of IT investment for companies capitalised at less than Y10bn has declined or remained stagnant at a level of Y1bn or less over the same period.“Japan was our fastest growth region last year,” says Eiji Uda, president of salesforce.com Japan. “The Saas buzz has gotten bigger in Japan and the government is keen on promoting it. We estimate that our services increase time productivity at a company by one-fifth and decreases costs by anywhere from one-third to one-fifth.”The prevalence of foreign internet services is even more striking in Japan. When Baidu, China’s leading search engine, entered Japan earlier this year it raised the question of why the country has largely failed to produce successful home-grown internet services and content providers. Domestic search engines, such as Goo – a subsidiary of NTT, the telecoms operator – have failed to attract a strong following.One exception is Mixi, Japan’s most popular social-networking site (SNS).The service has rocketed in popularity, doubling its number of users last year to 12.4m, of which more than 70 per cent are in their 20s or early 30s.But Japanese internet companies are tentatively starting to explore overseas markets.Mixi recently announced it would establish an office in China, and Rakuten is set to launch its online shopping mall business in Europe within two to three years.

His testimony drove home the significance of the unexpectedly sharp rise in jobless claims and a weaker-than-forecast economic growth number.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average snapped their four-day winning streak. The Dow closed 1 per cent lower at 12,582.18, while the S&P fell 0.6 per cent to 1,367.69.The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.5 per cent to 2,331.57.Financial stocks sold off after the Fed chairman said he expected to see some bank failures, particularly among smaller banks. An index of investment banks declined 3.4 per cent, while an index of regional banks fell 3.5 per cent.Merrill Lynch fell 4.8 per cent to $51.66. Merrill intends to close its First Franklin subprime lending unit, CNBC reported. Rival Lehman Brothers fell 4.8 per cent to $54.68. Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank by assets, lost 5.1 per cent to $32.36,Zions Bancorp led the declines among the smaller banks, falling 4.9 per cent to $50.34. Fifth Third Bancorp fell 3.6 per cent to $24.05.Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage financier, slid 2.4 per cent to $24.49 after it posted a larger-than-expected $2.5bn loss for the fourth-quarter. Freddie also increased its credit loss estimates for 2008 and 2008 due to the severity of the housing downturn.Fannie Mae, Freddie’s larger rival, pared earlier losses, rising 2.3 per cent to $27.90.Thornburg Mortgage added to investor concerns about the state of the housing and mortgage markets. The lender fell 15.4 per cent to $9.76 after it said it might have to sell assets to meet margin calls.Other mortgage lenders also suffered. Countrywide Financial fell 4.9 per cent to $6.64, while Washington Mutual fell 6.3 per cent to $15.73.Elsewhere in the financial sector, MF Global fell 27.6 per cent to $21.19 after it said one of its wheat traders had triggered a $141.5m loss.Computer maker Dell, which reported results after the bell, fell 3.4 per cent from the regular session close to $20.15. Dell’s revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates. The stock has fallen 26 per cent since December.In the telecoms sector, Sprint Nextel, the third-biggest US wireless carrier, fell 9.6 per cent to $8.09 after it posted a $29.5bn net loss for the fourth quarter and said it would cut its dividend. Dan Hesse, Sprint Nextel’s freshly appointed chief executive, said business was worse than he had expected and was deteriorating further. Fitch responded by cutting the company’s credit rating to junk.The news sparked a rally in Sprint’s chief rivals, AT&T and Verizon. AT&T rose 2.2 per cent to $35.96, while Verizon rose 2.2 per cent to $37.18.Sears edged 0.2 per cent lower to $101.40. The retailer earlier reported a fourth-quarter profit that was lower than consensus estimates. Analysts said Sears’ woes were far from over.Expectations of lower earnings hurt Limited Brands. The owner of the Victoria’s Secret chain fell 9.8 per cent to $16.04 after it said first-quarter profit would fall short of consensus estimates. Limited said it wanted to make the lingerie brand “less sexy” and of return instead to its “ultra feminine” roots.A quarterly loss of $1.4bn sent Mylan, which specialises in making generic drugs, down 8.5 per cent to $12.03.PharmaNet Development slid 30.8 per cent to $28.62 after the medicine-testing company said it expected to earn as much as $1.57 a share this year – below analysts’ estimates.But retailer Salesforce.com provided a glimmer of hope: shares soared 17.2 per cent to $61.66 after the seller of online customer management software reported a 14-fold increase in fourth-quarter profit.Natural gas producer EOG Resources rose 18 per cent to $124.73 after it boosted its production targets.
163;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-02-27T19:33:10Z;Opening the windows on Microsoft;;"Andrew Grove, former chief executive of Intel, popularised the Silicon Valley motto: “Only the paranoid survive.” In the preface to his book of that title he wrote: “The more successful you are, the more people want a chunk of your business, and then another chunk, and then another, until there is nothing left.”That sentiment epitomised the behaviour of many technology companies in the late 20th century, from Intel to Oracle and Microsoft. They lived in fear of a technology inflection point that would suddenly strip them of their leadership and benefit an upstart funded by one of the Valley’s venture capital firms.Under Bill Gates, Microsoft was among the most paranoid of technology companies in defending its hard-won Windows near-monopoly of desktop operating systems and extending its strength into other software niches. Whenever it took its eye off the ball – as it did in the early days of the internet browser – it rapidly fought back.A better slogan for the internet age is: only the sociable thrive. Companies such as Google, IBM, Sun Microsystems and Salesforce.com no longer try to eradicate competition at all costs. Instead, they believe they will get more by encouraging others to reinforce them by building software and services that fit with their own.This is the context in which Microsoft last week announced – to jeers from sceptics – that it was folding the hand that it had played against regulators for over a decade. Instead of keeping as much of its software code hidden as possible, the company would publish details of some of it and encourage other companies to use them.It is no coincidence that Mr Gates, the company’s co-founder and guiding spirit for more than 30 years, steps down this June from full-time work at Microsoft to run his foundation and has handed over his title of chief software architect to Ray Ozzie, an industry veteran who is instinctively more open to collaboration.The changing of the guard has not placated the European Commission’s antitrust enforcers or Microsoft’s competitors. Thomas Vinje, a lawyer who represents some of them in Europe, called for “a permanent change in Microsoft’s behaviour, not just another announcement”.I agree with Mr Vinje that the fact that Mr Ozzie says Microsoft is going to do something does not prove that it actually will. But I differ on why. I do not think that Mr Ozzie and his allies are pulling another fake. I believe they want to alter its culture and modus operandi. The question is whether they have the power.The reason for my doubt is that Microsoft remains Mr Gates’ creation, although he has already handed over the role of chief executive to Steve Ballmer and welcomed on board outsiders including Mr Ozzie. And it will take more than putting thousands of pages of software code on the internet to alter his legacy.Why even try, you might ask, since the company’s paranoia has brought it enormous success? One reason is that it wants to placate regulators. “We have been through a 10-year fight and I don’t want it to turn into a 100-year war,” says Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel.Only on Wednesday, it was fined €899m ($1.36bn) by the European Commission for its past failure to license protocols – the code that enables programs to interact with Windows and other Microsoft software – openly and cheaply enough. Its new policy should at least stop it having to pay further fines on the issue.But regulation is only part of the story. A bigger motivation for Microsoft is that it is in danger of being left behind in the mash-up era. Windows used to have a fair claim to be the only software platform for which it was worth most developers writing applications but their freedom of manoeuvre is now greater.IBM has countered its past software weakness by supporting open source development of Linux; Google has built rivals to Microsoft’s Word and Outlook programs and is encouraging other companies to work with it on mobile phone software; Sun has even made its Solaris operating software open-source.Mr Ozzie wants to follow this trend by making it easier for outsiders to write software that works seamlessly with not only Windows but other programs, including its Office suite. Disclosing its protocols is only a start. It also needs to simplify the way it builds software to make it easier for other programs to plug in.There lies the rub. Like other large companies, Microsoft has an established culture and entrenched interests, notably the product groups in charge of big money-spinners such as Office and Windows. These groups have got into the habit of secrecy, not only with outsiders but even with other parts of the empire.Thus, the Windows division might have handed out full details of most protocols to the people it knew in the Office group but kept some data secret from other Microsoft developers, and even more hidden from outsiders. Its managers wanted to limit full access to those they trusted to write software that worked cleanly with their own.Mr Ozzie is trying to blow this up by forcing Microsoft’s developers to disclose information fully, and on an equal basis, to everyone. This may, in turn, force them to write software that is better adapted to the era in which working sociably with others, inside and outside Microsoft, is a competitive necessity.His statements and now his actions suggest that he is genuine. But taking on three decades of culture and ways of working in a huge corporation is very difficult. Mr Gates may be leaving the building but persuading his paranoid spirit to depart is something else again.john.gapper@ft.comRead more of John Gapper’s columnsRead John Gapper’s Business Blog"
164;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2008-01-29T18:10:23Z;A revolution is taking shape;;When the founder of Microsoft retires this year, it will not only mark the close of a remarkable business career. It will signal the end of an era in computing.“The next sea change is upon us.” Those words appeared in an extraordinary memorandum that Bill Gates sent to Microsoft’s top managers and engineers on October 30 2005.Belying its bloodless title – “Internet Software Services” – the memo was intended to sound an alarm, to warn the company that a new revolution in computing was under way, and that it threatened to upend Microsoft’s traditional business.What had always been the linchpin of Microsoft’s success – its control over the PC desktop – was fading in importance. Thanks to the proliferation of broadband connections in homes and offices, people no longer had to buy packaged software programs and install them on their computers. Instead, they could use their web browsers to tap into software supplied over the internet from central data-processing plants.“The broad and rich foundation of the internet will unleash a ‘services wave’ of applications and experiences available instantly,” Mr Gates wrote. This new wave, he said, “will be very disruptive”.It is not hard to understand what spurred the memo. As Mr Gates composed it in his office at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington, his fears about his company’s future were taking concrete shape just 200 miles away, in a small town named The Dalles in northern Oregon. That’s where Google, the internet search giant, was building a massive data centre on the banks of the Columbia River.Large, windowless warehouses, each the size of a football field and adorned with cooling towers, dominated the site. An article in the International Herald Tribune described the complex as “looming like an information-age nuclear plant”.It was an apt description. What Google was building was a vast computing centre, by all accounts the largest and most sophisticated on the planet. Designed to house tens of thousands of PCs, all wired together to work as a single supercomputer, it was, indeed, the information-processing equivalent of a nuclear power station, able to pump data and software into millions of homes and businesses.The Oregon centre, now largely complete, is just one of dozens of “server farms” that the company has built around the world, holding an estimated 500,000 computers.But Google is not just using its computing grid to process web searches. It is also supplying services such as word processing, spreadsheets, and e-mail – programs that have long been the mainstays of Microsoft’s profitability.By supplying business computing as a set of simple services, Google, and other utility providers such as Salesforce.com and Amazon Web Services, threaten to render large parts of the IT industry obsolete.No corporate computing system, not even those operated by big companies, can match the efficiency, speed, and flexibility of plants such as Google’s. One analyst estimates that Google can carry out a computing task for one-tenth of what it costs a typical company.That is why the big data centres make Bill Gates and other technology executives so nervous. They encapsulate the full disruptive potential of utility computing. If people and businesses can rely on central stations to fulfil all or most of their computing requirements, they will be able to slash the money they spend on their own hardware and software. All the dollars saved are ones that would have gone into the coffers of Microsoft and the other tech giants.What is happening to computing today is a revolution, the biggest upheaval since the invention of the PC in the 1970s. But it is not without precedent. It bears a close resemblance to what happened to mechanical power 100 years ago.Until the end of the 19th century, businesses had to run their own power-generating facilities, producing all the energy required to run their machinery. As industrial technology advanced, the means of generation grew more sophisticated, progressing from waterwheels to steam engines to electric dynamos, but the equipment was always located at the site of a business and maintained by its employees.Like data-processing today, power generation was assumed to be an intrinsic part of doing business.But with the invention of the alternating-current electric grid at the turn of the century, that assumption was overturned.Suddenly, manufacturers did not have to be in the power-generation business. They could run machines with electric current generated in distant power plants by big utilities and fed to their factories over a network of wires. With remarkable speed, the new utilities took over the supply of industrial power. Scores of private power stations were dismantled.What made large-scale electric utilities possible was a series of scientific and engineering breakthroughs – in electricity generation and transmission as well as in the design of electric motors – but what ensured their triumph was not technology but economics. By supplying electricity to many buyers from central stations, the utilities achieved economies of scale in power production that no individual factory could match. It became a competitive necessity for manufacturers to hook their plants up to the new electricity grid in order to tap into the cheaper source of power.The success of the utilities fed on itself. As soon as they began to supply current to factories, they were able to expand their generating capacity and increase economies even further, achieving another great leap in efficiency. The price of electricity fell so quickly that it soon became possible for nearly every business and household to afford electric power.The commercial and social ramifications of the democratisation of electricity would be hard to overstate. Electric light altered the rhythms of life, electric assembly lines redefined work, and electric appliances brought the Industrial Revolution into the home.Cheap and plentiful electricity shaped the world we live in today. It is a world that did not exist a mere 100 years ago, and yet the transformation that has played out over just a few generations has been so great, so complete, that it has become almost impossible for us to imagine what life was like before electricity began to flow through the sockets in our walls.The transformation in the supply of computing promises to have equally sweeping consequences. Software programs already control or mediate not only industry and commerce but entertainment, journalism, education, even politics and national defence. The shock waves produced by a shift in computing technology will thus be intense and far-reaching.We can already see the early effects all around us – in the shift of control over media from institutions to individuals, in people’s growing sense of affiliation with “virtual communities” rather than physical ones, in debates over the value of privacy, even in the growing concentration of wealth in a small slice of the population.All these trends either spring from or are propelled by the rise of internet-based computing. As information utilities grow in size and sophistication, the changes to business and society – and to ourselves – will only broaden. And their pace will only accelerate.One place where the changes will be particularly sweeping is the corporate IT department. As the capacity and capabilities of the computing grid expand, it will continue to displace private systems as the preferred platform for computing. Businesses will gain new flexibility in assembling computing services to perform customised information-processing jobs. They will no longer be constrained by the limits of their own data centres or the dictates of a few big IT vendors.Because of computing’s modularity, companies will have a wealth of options as they make the leap to the utility age.They will be able to continue to fulfil some of their computing requirements inhouse, while relying on outside utilities to satisfy other needs. And they will be able to fine-tune the mix continually, as the capabilities of the utilities advance.In contrast to the switch-over to electricity utilities, buyers do not face an all-or-nothing choice when it comes to computing.While capital-constrained smaller companies have strong incentives to embrace the full utility model quickly, most larger companies will need to balance their investments in inhouse computing with the benefits provided by utilities.They can be expected to pursue a hybrid approach for many years, supplying some hardware and software requirements themselves and purchasing others over the grid.One of the key challenges for corporate IT departments lies in making the right decisions about what to hold on to and what to let go.In the long run, the IT department is unlikely to survive, at least not in its familiar form.It will have little to do once the bulk of business computing shifts into what Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, calls “the computing cloud”. Business units and even individual employees will be able to control the processing of information directly, without the need for legions of technical specialists.Bill Gates’ 2005 memo made it clear that Microsoft had no intention of surrendering. It would turn its legendary competitiveness against the upstart utilities in the hope of sustaining its dominance in the tech business.Putting economic muscle behind its words, the company has launched a huge program of capital investment to expand its utility computing capabilities and try to catch up with Google.In 2006 alone, Microsoft invested $2bn more than it had previously expected to spend, much of it going to build and equip utility data centres. It is using the centres to deliver an array of services to businesses and consumers, through its Windows Live, Office Live, and MSN brands.Other big tech companies recognise their businesses are under threat, and they, too, are taking steps to adapt to the utility age. Oracle and SAP have begun offering web-based software services in addition to their traditional applications. Hewlett-Packard and Sun have opened up utility grids to provide computing power for a metered fee.Even large IT consulting firms such as Accenture, which grew rich on the complexity of traditional information systems, are establishing practices devoted to helping clients make the shift to utility services. Nobody wants to be left behind.Not long after Bill Gates wrote his memo, he announced his intention to step down from his managerial role at Microsoft.He would slowly hand over his remaining responsibilities to other executives and then he would retire from his day-to-day work at the company he had built into the superpower of the PC age.Gates’ departure, scheduled for this summer, is richly symbolic. It marks a turning point in the brief but tumultuous history of computing.The time of Gates and the other great software programmers who wrote the code of the PC age has come to an end. The future of computing belongs to the new utilitarians.Listen to Nicholas Carr warning companies and governments of the dangers they face when they surrender ownership and management of their increasingly important online operations.

Subscribers would pick up their phones and a light would illuminate on the board of one of the operators. She (as it almost invariably was) would plug one end of a cord into the hole by the light, connect her headset and ask: “Number please?”For a local number, she would plug the other end of the cord into the hole representing the destination number to make the connection. For long distance, the operator would plug into a trunk circuit connected to another bank of switchboards elsewhere.Times have changed. A start-up that calls itself Silicon Valley’s first phone company has come up with a technology that allows web developers to plug into the world of telephony with as little knowledge of the routing involved as an ordinary caller.Ribbit, based in Mountain View, has a “SmartSwitch” that takes care of multiple networks, protocols and devices to allow the web to be connected to any device in any manner. A landline phone can call a web page, a web application can be transformed into a virtual mobile phone.To make this happen, developers making desktop widgets using Adobe’s popular Flash or AIR technologies need only add a couple of lines of code to hook up to Ribbit’s telephonic back-end.The company has been unveiling its first service this week at the Demo conference in California. “Amphibian” can give a physical phone a virtual-world equivalent, enabling consumers to use their phone plans in new web environments.Ribbit says it is enabling voiceware, connecting traditional telephony with the web. It treats voice as an object that can be embedded into any application – such as adding voicemail to a Salesforce.com web-based customer relationship management system.Other companies have developed similar applications, but Ribbit sees itself as empowering developers at large. It is creating a marketplace for the widgets they are developing in hooking into its technology.The coolest application of Ribbit so far is the virtual iPhone, developed by the Knoware design studio. This life-size desktop widget looks just like an iPhone and has the same functionality. Its developer says he was making and receiving calls with it in minutes after inserting Ribbit’s code.Ribbit and the iPhone help explain why Silicon Valley is now also known as Smartphone Valley. As mobiles have become more like computers and gained internet connectivity, the Valley’s expertise has come into play.This is a significant shift. In the past, Europe and Asia have led with cellphone innovation. European Voice-over-IP companies such as Skype and Jajah are now part of the Valley, but Ebay admits it overpaid for the former.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, has failed to break into mobile phones with its processors, eventually selling its division to Marvell Technology. But Apple has changed perceptions and turned the Valley’s fortunes round with its iPhone. Its distinctiveness is expressed in its software and user interface, areas where the Valley excels.At Macworld this month, Steve Jobs announced a software update for the iPhone featuring improved maps and the ability to customise the home screen.This is in readiness for a software developers’ kit, expected in February, which will enable third-party developers to write applications for the iPhone.Google is also leading the way in opening cellphones to software developers. It announced the Open Handset Alliance in November, an initiative for open standards on mobile phones, featuring its Android operating system.Android was the name of the Palo Alto mobile start-up Google acquired two years earlier, one of many in the Valley focusing on the future of telephony.Google is also bidding for wireless spectrum and has bought Jaiku, a Finnish mobile messaging service similar to the Valley’s Twitter.Private equity’s telecom interest in the valley has been piqued. Elevation Partners says it is betting on the possibilities for mobile broadband. It began by paying $325m for a 27 per cent stake in Sunnyvale’s Palm in October. Intel is also planning a comeback through mobile broadband, introducing its WiMax chips this year.European groups have taken note. Ericsson paid $1.9bn for Redback Networks in 2006; Nokia has spent more than $1.5bn on 10 Valley companies over 10 years, including Intellisync for $430m in 2005.In early January, Bob Iannucci, head of Nokia’s research centre in Palo Alto, became the company’s chief technology officer. He is the first non-Finn to take up the role – a clear message from the world’s biggest handset maker that it views Silicon Valley as a centre of innovation."

The others are more conventional business intelligence bundles and packages tailored for SMEs.Revamp for CRMMeanwhile, SAP’s customer relationship management software gets a revamp.As well as adding new web 2.0 interfaces, the software giant has strengthened CRM capabilities in areas such as trade promotions management and real-time offer management.SAP calls the software the next generation in CRM but it could have chosen a more forward-looking name than SAP CRM 2007.Microsoft pitches inNot to be outdone, Microsoft has unveiled its own ”next generation” CRM offering, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0.The CRM software can also be accessed as a pay-as-you-go hosted service, in which case it is called Dynamics CRM Live.Unlike SAP, which has been lukewarm about software-as-a-service, Microsoft is giving equal weight to the two delivery methods.Coda embraces SaasCoda, the UK vendor of financial software, is the latest convert to Saas with its new Coda 2go strategy.The first product to get the Saas treatment is sales invoicing. Further releases of Coda 2go will cover general ledger, procure-to-pay and other accounting processes.Coda 2go is built on top of Salesforce.com’s Saas platform and is designed to integrate with its hosted CRM service.Vista gains tractionAfter a slow start, Windows Vista is gaining traction in the mainstream business market.A study by CDW, the US IT distributor, finds that the number of US businesses using or evaluating Microsoft’s latest operating system has soared from 29 per cent a year ago to 48 per cent.Microsoft does not plan to curtail support for Windows XP until 2014 but it seems most US businesses will have made the switch long before then.HP servers for SMEsHP has refreshed its server offering for small and medium-sized businesses.The four Proliant servers are designed around Intel’s quad-core architecture and can support up to 14 disc drives and more than 10 terabytes of storage.Dell thinks smallMore on the SME front, this time from Dell which has unveiled a storage area network aimed at smaller businesses.The Dell AX4-5 array can accommodate up to 60 drives and up to 60TB of data with a choice of high-speed Fiber Channel or cost-effective iScsi networks. The product stems from Dell’s partnership with EMC.Netscape bows outA key chapter in the history of the internet ends.The Netscape browser helped many take their first tentative steps on the web in the 1990s but its popularity has plummeted, causing AOL, which bought Netscape in 1998, to pull the plug.Security updates for the seminal browser cease from February 1.
167;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2007-10-02T14:26:53Z;A clear view from both sides of the fence;;"Scots-born, football mad Howard Lamb, a 30-year veteran of the data processing business, lives near Boston in the US and splits his time between there and the UK.“My biggest problem is trying to figure out what side of the Atlantic I’m on,” he jokes.He is head of internal technology – for which read chief information officer – for Celerant Consulting, an international specialist in strategies for operational improvement based in London, England.His responsibilities include all internal computing matters: data centre operations, support services, hardware and software acquisition and liason with senior management to ensure the group is investing wisely in IT and getting the maximum benefits from its investment. He reports to the chief financial officer.Like many CIOs, he is expected not only to find cost efficiencies in what could be described as commodity data processing but also to innovate: “Historically, IT has been regarded as a cost to the organisation but recently we have been looking at how we can differentiate and leverage the consulting work we do through the sensible application of IT.”For Mr Lamb and for Celerant, “sensible” means doing no more computing inhouse than necessary. Some years ago, it outsourced its data centre operations and today the contract is let to NaviSite, the big US facilities group. “We feel happy with that; we feel it is under control,” he says.Over the past 12 months, Celerant has been taking careful steps in the direction of software as a service (SaaS), taking on customer relationship management (CRM) software from Salesforce.com, the California-based SaaS pioneer whose business model is threatening to disrupt conventional software marketing.Mr Lamb explains why much of the company’s IT is outsourced: “We don’t have the kind of organisation where we have the luxury of building applications. Nor do I think it makes any sense for us to run our own data centre. However, we do need to architect our network and to understand the needs of our organisation and ensure we are delivering benefits to it. We will be looking carefully at anything that looks or smells like commodity to see if we could outsource it.”In fact, the only area Mr Lamb thinks he will not be able to outsource is the decision support system, the codified collective wisdom of the company’s 600 or so employees which can be called on to help its consultants make better operational decisions.He is pondering moving much of the business to the on-demand model exemplified by Salesforce.com’s CRM service.“We are thinking about outsourcing all critical services.Typically, at best we have built applications internally or had companies build applications for us and we’ve bought some applications. It means our software port-
folio has been a mixed bag.“So we looked at software as a service and CRM was an easy place to start. The question was: could we really begin to rationalise our portfolio and look at the IT organisation in a way which keeps the really high value-added jobs such as project management, systems architecture and business solutions in-house, but look at everything beyond that as liable to be outsourced, leading to cost reductions and efficiencies?”Mr Lamb’s duties as CIO include the supply of laptops to employees with a standard, single image “which we can control”, networking the laptops into the corporate application servers, making sure the company has good network connectivity.In addition, ensuring the applications needed to run the business are effective, information provision and knowledge management. “Pretty much everything from soup to nuts,” as he puts it.He points out that renegotiating contracts or changing suppliers can be both cost-
effective and innovative. Leasing rather than buying laptop computers has a positive effect on the bottom line: the lessor retrieves the machines at the end of the leasing period, further boosting the company’s green credentials.He believes that extending SaaS further into the company’s IT activities could free time to concentrate on non-commodity issues.“Some of the stuff we’ve done with Salesforce represents an expansion beyond CRM. We have added such things as contract management and project tracking and integrating them with a costing and pricing model.“So we’re beginning to see almost the emergence of an ERP [enterprise resource planning] environment within the company using Salesforce.com as a backbone to that.”Mr Lamb is contemplating a service covering everything – leads, contacts, and so on through to closing sales.“So we have a full spectrum of a transaction all the way from the point at which we first talk to a customer to the point where we complete the project. That would act as a basis for the data warehousing and decision support challenges that we are facing,” he says.Mr Lamb has spent the greater part of his working life in the US. He is an
example of the kind of CIO who started as a technical specialist but has gone on to straddle the information
systems/business systems divide.After reading computing at Glasgow University, he worked at IBM’s Greenock plant in Scotland as an operations specialist before moving into programming.He relocated to London to work with the Civil Service, programming at the Police National Computer Unit for a few years before heading back to Scotland and Digital Equipment where he became the youngest manager
in DEC’s IT organisation.DEC whisked him off to the US: “Initially for a couple of years but all these years later, I’m still here.” Other companies he worked for before Celerant are Wang Global Services and Getronics.But he has experience of the business side as well: “I worked as a product manager with DEC as well as in service delivery management. And at Celerant, prior to doing my current job, I ran operations in the US for a couple of years. I think that has prepared me to be able to look at technology from both sides of the fence.”Asked about his principal challenges, it is clear they are to do with the business rather than the technology: “The biggest thing is driving information for decision support. That is our number one priority and challenge.“The second is the continual search for opportunities to make the business more efficient and effective. “We are looking for any mechanisms that we can put in place to help those people in analysis and projects who are delivering work for clients, making their lives as easy, efficient and effective as possible.“And a third challenge is around value for money, ensuring that we have invested wisely and are managing our contracts effectively.”"
168;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2007-10-02T14:22:29Z;Tailored software becomes key to Saas model’s success;;"No licence fees to pay, no hardware to install and no maintenance burden to shoulder. It is no wonder that the concept of software-as-a-service, or Saas, is changing the way many companies purchase and deploy enterprise applications.Take, for example, Allianz Cornhill, the insurance company. In 2006, it rolled out a CRM system to 350 underwriters and sales staff, so they could track and manage the process of converting sales leads into policies.Rather than deploy the software in-house, however, Allianz Cornhill opted for a suite of hosted applications from Saas provider Salesforce.com.As a result, its CRM tools and data are hosted, managed and regularly upgraded by Salesforce.com staff in the provider’s own data centre. Allianz Cornhill staff, meanwhile, access them over the internet and pay a monthly, per-user subscription fee for the privilege.It was not hard to convince senior executives of the attractions of the Saas model in terms of cost and convenience, says Phill Harding, broker development manager at Allianz Cornhill. For a start, the roll-out of the software took six weeks, where an equivalent inhouse deployment might have taken months, he says.“In fact, once the concept had been adequately explained and demonstrated and the solution was in place, we were asked by senior executives: ‘Why haven’t we used this approach before?’,” he says.Others are wondering the
same thing, and demand for Saas
applications is soaring. Recent estimates from analysts at IT market research company Gartner, for example, suggest worldwide sales growth of 21 per cent this year, to $5.1bn. By 2011, they say, Saas will account for one-quarter of business software sold globally.“Ease of use, rapid deployment, limited up-front investment in capital and staffing, plus a reduction in software management responsibility all make Saas a desirable alternative to many on-premises solutions, and will continue to act as drivers of growth,” says Sharon Mertz, a research director at Gartner.Some potential users, however, still have reservations about Saas. If information is power, and data among the most valuable of corporate assets, they ask, then why would we put them in another company’s hands?How can we customise software that is hosted remotely by a third party to fit our company’s unique business processes? And how can we possibly integrate Saas applications with the core in-house systems that remain vital to our business?These are all areas that leading Saas providers, such as Salesforce.com and NetSuite, are working hard to address.In terms of reliability and availability, for example, NetSuite offers a money-back guarantee of 99.5 per cent uptime. “Most companies would really struggle to achieve that kind of uptime inhouse and yet we offer it consistently to our customers,” says Zach Nelson, chief executive of NetSuite.And, following well-publicised outages in early 2006, Salesforce.com has upgraded its architecture and can now promise uptime of 99.999 per cent, according to Lindsey Armstrong, the company’s European president. In addition, it has committed itself to full disclosure of performance metrics via a website that was launched in response to those outages, trust.salesforce.com.Other obstacles to Saas are “more perceived than real”, says Robert Bois, an analyst with market research company AMR Research. “Integration and customisation are still common concerns that our clients raise with us, but in fact, the larger Saas suppliers are pretty good at solving those problems and the technology of the multi-tenant architecture that underpins Saas solutions has matured sufficiently that they’re no longer a big issue,” he says.At one time, a “one-size-fits-all” Saas approach was the norm, and “plain vanilla” functionality (where the same product is deployed by all customers) was viewed as the necessary trade-off for relatively low cost of entry.But recent technological advances have changed all that. “Not only can you customise pretty much anything you need to in NetSuite, but those customisations carry over every time the application is upgraded – and we upgraded NetSuite 400 times last year,” says Mr Nelson.“You certainly don’t get that when you customise on-premise software and then need to upgrade it,” he adds.“We do a huge amount of customisation,” confirms Andy French, head of information systems at NetSuite customer Opal Telecom, a division of Carphone Warehouse. “These tweaks and changes range from making certain data fields mandatory to installing Java scripts that drive system logic and user behaviour,” he says.In fact, the only limitation facing Carphone Warehouse, which has more than 3,000 users of Netsuite company-wide, is the number of skilled IT people available to do that configuration, he says.Integration between Saas tools and inhouse applications is also more commonplace these days. Most Saas companies publish application programming interfaces (APIs) based on web services standards, which allow disparate systems to exchange data whether they are based inside the firewall or on a third party’s premises.According to Ms Armstrong, more than half of all API calls to Saleforce.com applications come from non-Salesforce.com systems.Analysts at Gartner, meanwhile, predict that by 2010, three-quarters of large enterprise Saas deployments will have “at least five integration or interoperable points to on-premise applications”.But with increased scope for customisation and integration of Saas products comes greater demand for outside help – a point not lost on a number of leading systems integrators, including Accenture and Deloitte, who have already set up dedicated practices in this area. Mr Bois of AMR Research says other IT services firms are “eager to tap this market, but less willing to go on record with details of their Saas strategy. They’re taking more of a ‘wait and see’ approach.”One company that is certainly not holding back is Saaspoint, a specialist Salesforce.com implementation and consulting partner led by John Appleby, who previously worked for Salesforce.com and was that company’s first EMEA employee. “Demand for help with Salesforce.com implementations far outstrips supply and, as long as Salesforce.com continues to grow so quickly, we don’t see that demand drying up,” he says.For Saaspoint, buoyant demand currently translates to year-on-year quarterly sales growth of between 250 per cent and 300 per cent, fuelled by projects at leading names such as P&O Ferries and pharmaceutical company Quintiles.This flurry of progress suggests a rosy future for Saas, not to mention the consultancy ecosystem that is
fast springing up around it, says Mr Bois of AMR Research. “Already, there are few areas of the enterprise applications industry untouched by Saas,” he says.And as software companies associated with more traditional models of software delivery, such as SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, catch up, he says, the case for Saas deployment can only get stronger."
169;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2007-07-03T21:09:25Z;SAP backtracks in Oracle suit;;German software maker SAP on Tuesday signalled it could seek an out-of-court settlement with Oracle after admitting a subsidiary made “inappropriate downloads” of its US rival’s software.However, the German group again denied charges of corporate theft and said computer firewalls had prevented SAP having sight of any information gleaned by employees at the subsidiary, TomorrowNow.Oracle filed a suit in the US in late March accusing SAP of stealing its intellectual property on a “grand scale” through TomorrowNow, a unit that services Oracle programmes.The US group’s move intensified the often rancorous rivalry between the two companies, which are battling each other and newer entrants including Microsoft and Salesforce.com for a share of the business-software market. SAP is the world’s biggest maker of programmes to control inventories or manage client relations.Henning Kagermann, SAP chief executive, denied all charges when the suit was filed and firmly rejected the idea of settling with Oracle out of court. But he said yesterday that an internal probe had revealed that at least one of Oracle’s 150 allegations was justified.Employees at TomorrowNow had, in a number of cases, “downloaded support material for customers they were not allowed to download”, Mr Kagermann said. “The clear procedures in place were apparently not followed in all cases.”Mr Kagermann told the Financial Times he would no longer rule out seeking a settlement out of court, conceding his previous rejection of such a move had been “based on the assumption that no point [in Oracle’s legal filing] was valid”.He left open the question of whether SAP would make a provision for potential litigation costs. He said SAP had not done so in the first quarter but would “obviously evaluate” the situation before publishing second-quarter figures on July 19.Noting the discovery of wrongdoing was “by definition not helpful” to SAP’s case, Mr Kagermann said. Mark White, the company’s US chief operating officer, had been put in charge of TomorrowNow and of efforts to find out who had breached company rules.SAP said the US Department of Justice had requested documents from SAP and TomorrowNow. But the company said it had no evidence Washington was considering parallel legal action.
170;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2007-07-02T22:43:46Z;NetSuite highlights tech resurrection;;NetSuite, a business software company controlled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, registered to go public on Monday in the latest sign that lossmaking technology companies are again turning to public markets for capital.The company, founded in 1998, is part of a new generation of software companies that sell their products “on-demand”, charging a subscription for delivering the application as a service over the internet. While Salesforce.com and RightNow, among the first proponents of this new approach, went public three years ago, it is only in recent months that Wall Street’s appetite for technology stocks has revived.Mr Ellison owns 61 per cent of NetSuite’s shares, potentially adding hundreds of millions of dollars to his net worth after an initial public offering – though that is dwarfed by his Oracle stake, which is worth nearly $25bn.NetSuite lost $23m last year as its revenues grew 86 per cent to $67m. The business model of on-demand companies means that they reach profitability later than traditional software rivals, since their contracts are spread out over a number of years while marketing costs have to be recorded upfront. Once profitable, though, they stand to benefit from a steadier stream of subscription income.The return of technology and communications companies was one of the highlights of the IPO market in the first six months of this year, according to Renaissance Capital. Some 28 per cent of new public companies came from these sectors, it added.The moderate revival, though still far short of the IPO boom at the turn of the decade, comes in spite of widespread complaints in Silicon Valley that over-regulation in the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has made it hard for young tech companies to go public.Aruba Networks, a networking equipment company, has been one of the best-performing IPOs of the year, even though the company has yet to record a profit.Salesforce.com, which has emerged as the leader of the new on-demand companies and registered a narrow profit last year, is valued at ten times its 2006 revenues, while the slower-growing RightNow trades at five times revenues.
171;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2007-06-05T04:45:57Z;Salesforce and Google join forces;;Google and Salesforce.com, an online provider of business applications, have announced a strategic global alliance that will challenge Microsoft’s business software market.The two internet companies said their first product, available from Tuesday, would combine Google’s AdWords advertising technology with Salesforce’s customer relationship management applications and be targeted at small businesses.Salesforce Group Edition featuring Google AdWords provides a simple interface that guides businesses through placing an advertisement in the Google system to tracking the leads that it generates and analysing its effectiveness in the amount of business earned.“Combining the power and simplicity of Salesforce with Google AdWords helps businesses find and keep customers to ultimately drive their continued success,” said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive, in a statement.“The alliance of Google and Salesforce.com brings together the world’s leading platforms to empower small and medium-size businesses to accelerate and thrive,” said Marc Benioff, Salesforce chief executive.Google and Salesforce have been co-operating since 2003, but the formal alliance and jointly-developed application takes their relationship to a new level.Jeff Kaplan, a consultant on the software-as-a-service industry for Thinkstrategies, said it could lead to Google acquiring Salesforce.“There is a boundless set of opportunities here: Salesforce has a broad variety of third-party alliances through its AppExchange [platform of shared applications] and Google has an enormous customer base of businesses that could find Salesforce’s applications appealing, so it’s a natural fit.”Microsoft would have to accelerate its efforts to build a comparable set of applications for its customers through third-party relationships, he added. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t have an equal partner – there’s no other Salesforce out there.”Salesforce and Google did not detail future plans but Google has been developing a suite of online applications similar to those in Microsoft’s Office package, including word processing, e-mail, calendar, spreadsheets and presentation software.These could be integrated with Salesforce’s web-based CRM software.
172;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2007-05-09T10:36:29Z;TECHNOLOGY LITE: The shrinking IT department;;Business leaders are learning a few lessons about IT. After spending small fortunes on equipment and technical specialists over the last decade or so, many have started to realise that a lack of cost savings and profit avenues from these investments means a shake-up is required.In a bid to reset the IT profit model, larger businesses are now starting to mimic smaller ones by contracting specialist IT companies to service their technology while they focus on selling their product.“You’ve now got the virtualised server environment where you can host things remotely,” says Mark Kobayashi-Hilary, author of Global services – moving to a level playing field. “With that, all the grunt work is then taken away from the office. It’d be better to stick to what you’re best at, write down your technical requirements and ask someone else to do it.”Several services are now on offer that remove the burden of administration from the IT department. For example, some companies opt for software as a service, such as Google’s spreadsheet and word-processing applications that can be used over an internet browser. More commonly in larger companies, this type of hosted service involves customer relationship management (CRM) programs from providers such as Salesforce.com.“You can also outsource IT maintenance by paying a retainer or an hourly rate to another company,” adds Mr Hilary. “Smaller companies do that because it’s cheaper than the salary of an engineer. All this means you have a virtualised IT department.”Such actions to shrink the IT department’s staff and equipment have been coined as moving to an “IT lite” environment – a trend that has been noticed in some of Europe’s largest companies. The Corporate IT Forum (CIF), a CIO-end-user organisation for big companies, said its members are now employing more business-minded people to negotiate outsourcing contracts.“[Our members] were all experiencing the same thing,” says David Roberts, CEO of the CIF. “We found there’ll be fewer people in the IT department but they’ll spend higher amounts of money and will be much more commercially aware. The corporation really has to have these skills to compete with the Accentures of this world.”Mr Roberts explains that CEOs are also pressuring the IT department to find ways of profiting the business, which requires a radical shift in thought from simply saving the company money and time – a move which could see the IT department slim down considerably.“These models are threatening the old establishments,” he says. “This has been a long time coming, where technology alone can build a profitable business. You’re therefore going to need business people for IT who can procure and you can now procure almost anything from the other side of the globe.”Yet some outsourcing companies have been waiting for this moment for years. For example, companies based in China and India, which recruit tens of thousands of highly qualified technical people every year, have based their entire business models on this very shift. Now jobs such as programming, support and administration could soon be offshored to these firms while project managers and architects will remain safely employed internally.“The need for programming is reducing as this is not an essential skill to have in house,” says Ian Campbell group CIO of British Energy. “If you look at new companies, they’re being more virtual in IT, but British Energy is coming from a traditional position – if it was new, I would go for that new model.“The role of the CIO is to understand the business and provide added value. But to do that you need commercial IT managers who can sort contracts. IT people don’t come with these skills and I’m spending a reasonable amount of my time working on relationship management.“I’ve seen one or two organisations that have gone from hundreds of people in the IT department to 50. They are really going for it while others are waiting for it to become standardised.”Of course outsourcing IT jobs could also spell turbulent times for people with technical skills. While many can design databases, build back-end offices and speak programming languages to each other, businesses are starting to require commercial knowledge and better communicative skills. On the other hand, IT recruitment agencies are having difficulty in finding the next generation of IT worker.“The salaries can be anything up to £200,000 because of these trends,” says Albert Ellis, CEO of recruitment firm Harvey Nash. “These people are a mixture of project managers and business analysts. One of the interesting things about this is they not only need understanding of technology and offshoring but sales, cultural issues and how to manage expectations for the board and the customers. This is all new territory.”Research from US employment IT analyst Foote Partners backs this up. It claims employers are “desperate for employees who have more than just technical skills”. Capgemini’s Global CIO report also urges CIOs to move away from IT-centric management.The IT director of European catering firm Elior Alastair Fuller changed the staff on his IT team in a bid to improve the business: “The sector we work in is changing so the IT needed to change,” he says. “What was apparent was that the 20 people in the IT department were clearly not fit for purpose. Now we have almost a new team and only have four of the original.“The new people have brought a much broader set of skills on board. For the IT departments in some organisations it’s about doing the minimum. In the same organisations you can see the self-sustaining interest in IT.”

The shares closed 6.5 per cent down at €35.89.The results came as SAP said that it would launch a new product for mid-sized companies at the end of March, which would revolutionise the way they bought and maintained their computer systems.SAP is attempting to enlarge its traditional customer base from large corporations to small and medium-sized companies. The introduction of the new midsize product, which will see SAP “host” clients’ business programmes on its computers, will set new subscription services alongside the traditional task of selling software licences.SAP and its US rival, Oracle, in recent years have started to compete with suppliers to midsized companies, such as Microsoft and many specialists, as they fear that big corporations’ appetite for software could start to wane.Hanning Kagermann, SAP chief executive, said the new business model would “reshape the way midsize companies purchase, adopt and finance software” and render 10,000 extra clients and €1bn ($1.3bn) in sales from 2010.Although competitors such as Sage and Salesforce.Com already offer inernet-based, “on demand” packages for midsized companies, Mr Kagermann said that SAP would be the first to offer a full range of business programmes.This would mean that small companies would pay a subscription for upkeep and updating of applications and data housed in SAP computers.“I think SAP spending this much money to go into the mid market – and the fact that it is doing so in a tech-savvy way – is going to shake up the market,” said Julian Yates at Investec. Rivals would have to consider similar moves.But some investors seemed unhappy that the investment would cut SAP’s profit margins this year by one or two percentage points to 26-27 percent, far short of the company’s target of a 30 per cent return on sales.Undeterred, Mr Kagermann signalled for the first time that he would stay on as chief executive after his contract expires at the end of the year.
174;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;What goes around…;;Salesforce.com is planning to install server farms in Europe and Asia to underpin its runaway growth. The web-based applications software group is continuing to gnaw away at the heart of the traditional software business with a business model which will seem a touch familiar to those with long memories. It operates, at present, only customer relationship management, which it provides as a service to more than 550,000 customers daily. Customers need neither hardware nor software. They despatch CRM queries over the web: Salesforce sends back the processed results. Yes, it’s basically a computer bureau service brought up to date with the web supplanting those fleets of vans which used to scuttle between customers and bureaux carrying cans of magnetic tape.The dramatic growth of Salesforce – it’s worth $5bn right now – confirms, for me at any rate, that a subtle blend of cost and competition are driving a cycle in which applications move from the centre of the network to the edge and back again. Traditional bureaux saw applications firmly at the centre. Fat clients saw them move to the edge. With client-server computing, the cycle turned again and Salesforce seems to be completing the process.How long will it hold sway? Who knows. My bet, however, is that a combination of ubiquitous computing power at near zero cost and super simple software tools which will encourage the creation of competitive edge software will spin the wheel one more time.– Alan Cane, London
175;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2006-11-07T22:42:46Z;Waiting for the new web revolution;;"When it comes to corporate technology, the internet services revolution cannot be rushed.That, at least, is the message from Bill Gates. A year ago he and Ray Ozzie, now Microsoft’s chief software architect, laid out a radical new vision for Microsoft, one that was based increasingly on delivering software-enabled services rather than traditional software packages.Yet for much of the software that companies use – from desktop “productivity” programs such as Office to the back-office applications that underpin their marketing departments, supply chain operations and other parts of their business – this is still a long way off, according to Mr Gates.Speaking this week to the Financial Times, Mr Gates sketched out a vision for
corporate software that looks less radical than that promoted by many others in the software and internet industries.The danger, if he is wrong, is that Microsoft risks squandering its entrenched position in corporate desktop software, as well as its ambition to turn back-office applications into its next big growth business.“What Microsoft faces today is what happened to the mainframe,” warns Joe Wilcox, an analyst at Jupiter Research – that it will be replaced by a lower-cost, more efficient model of computing, this time based on the internet.It is represented by companies such as Salesforce.com, whose back-office applications are delivered online, and by Google, whose suite of productivity and collaboration tools for office workers has been multiplying.According to Mr Gates, tech companies have made the mistake before of believing in overnight transformations. At the beginning of the decade, for instance, all the talk was of “application service providers”, companies that would deliver services online as if they were water or electricity. “Intel was going to build all these datacentres, there were tons of start-ups,” he says. Most foundered.When it comes to back-office “enterprise resource planning” applications, he adds: “We’ll have some things on-premise, some things published out on the web. We think few companies will be purely on-premise, or purely on the web.”Getting the balance right will be key to success for one of Microsoft’s most important new businesses. Its business applications business, started through acquisition five years ago and now generating revenues of about $1bn a year, is “something that will grow faster than the rest of the business for many, many years”, Mr Gates says.“Like every Microsoft business in the first few years, we’re learning, we’re putting the pieces together.”So far in this area, Mr Gates is following a classic Microsoft game plan. Part of it involves tying the applications more closely to Microsoft’s main asset – its desktop software. By using the Office suite of desktop tools as a way to access back-office applications, Microsoft hopes to stimulate wider usage, particularly among the smaller businesses that are its main target.Microsoft is also playing the same “fast-follower” role it has in other markets where other companies have set the early pace.For instance, when it comes to Office Live – a collection of online services for small businesses – “it looks like they came up with many of the ideas after they looked at the Salesforce.com website”, says Bruce Richardson, an analyst at AMR Research. Yet this me-too approach has worked for Microsoft in other markets before.The shape of this services-and-software vision for corporate software has yet to come fully into focus, though Microsoft continues to inch forward. Earlier this week, for instance, it announced plans to make its customer relationship management software available as a service in the second half of next year, with other software to follow.It also laid out more ideas for how small businesses would be able to combine both on-premise software and internet services (supplied by Microsoft) to create new composite applications – or “mash-ups”, in the jargon of the Web 2.0 internet movement.For instance, a marketing executive, reviewing details of a client relationship on his Microsoft software, might link directly into a hosted “collaboration” service to start a conversation with colleagues, then connect to Microsoft’s online keyword advertising system to launch a campaign.“There are a lot of pieces in motion that haven’t landed yet,” Mr Wilcox says.Mr Richardson adds: “Everything is still in a state of flux.”Microsoft’s growing range of software and services for smaller businesses are “all aimed at the same desktop, and it gets a little confused”. He says, though: “That’s the way Microsoft likes it.”In other areas, Microsoft has shown a similar desire to attack on all fronts at once. In its assault on the digital living room, for instance, it has spread its bets across the Xbox 360 games console, set-top boxes and special “media centre” PCs.As the shape of corporate software and technology services evolves, that may prove a smart strategy – though it risks leaving Microsoft at a disadvantage to pure internet-based companies in at least one respect. “The Salesforce.com story is pure and unencumbered,” Mr Richardson says."

177;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2006-08-27T23:04:53Z;Google joins corporate software fray;;Google on Monday fired the opening shot in a new long-term battle with corporate software giants like Microsoft and IBM, as it launches new versions of Gmail and some of its other consumer internet services designed for workplace use.The initiative takes the internet company into a new market called “software as a service,” where companies rely for some of their technology on services delivered over the internet, rather than buying software to run on their own machines.“I think it’s an incredible opportunity: software as a service is really taking off, because you only buy what you want,” said Dave Girourd, general manager of Google’s enterprise group. “Our view is that a lot of our consumer applications over time really make sense as corporate applications.”Corporate Gmail, which companies will be able to brand with their own names, will carry advertising, like the consumer version. Google said that by the end of the year it planned to offer a separate version that companies would pay a subscription for.However, while the rapid growth of new companies like Salesforce.com has demonstrated the appeal of software as a service, this is still a nascent market where most big companies are still treading carefully, analysts warned.“Companies won’t drop everything and move en masse to Google,” said Matt Brown, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. Particularly when it comes to the communications and collaboration tools used by office workers, “they face all kinds of security and privacy issues” that will make them hesitant to switch, he added.Defending the reliability and security of its services, Mr Girouard said: “All of these are very important to consumers as well.” He added, though, that Google would also seek to make its products more appealing to big companies, for instance with a support service and with features designed to meet regulatory requirements that public companies have to follow.He also suggested that Google is likely to extend other services to the corporate market, such as word processing and spreadsheets, which offer lightweight alternatives to some of the features of Microsoft’s Office package of PC software. Referring to Google’s online word processor, Mr Giroard said: “It’s pretty clearly a good candidate, as are other Google applications.”Microsoft has created online services of its own under the Windows Live brand, but has so far stopped short of offering an online word processor or other services that could be seen as competitors to Office. However, some of the communications and file-sharing tools it has already made available online are more advanced than those that Google is launching on Monday, said Mr Brown.While they are unlikely to appeal to big companies, Google’s online applications may be taken up by “small businesses, families, educational institutions, ones that don’t have big budgets for IT departments,” said Mr Brown.Google began a limited limited trial of the Gmail service for corporate users earlier this year. Other services offered beginning Monday are Google Calendar, Google Talk and Page Creator, a tool for creating web pages.The search engine company launched its first product for corporate customers, a “search appliance” that can be plugged into a corporate network and be used to search a company’s internal data, two years ago.

The stock had fallen as low as $22.99 on August 22 – 45 per cent down in the year to date.Other internet stocks to gain included Amazon, which rose 4.1 per cent to $29.09, and Yahoo, up 1.8 per cent at $28.91.Sears Holdings, the third largest retailer in the US, reported an 83 per cent rise in quarterly earnings, but investors took fright at the slowdown in sales and its shares fell 5.8 per cent to $141.29.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 2.05 points, at 1,297.48. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent, or 8.07 points, at 2,157.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 7.84 points, at 11,334.96.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said investors had been confident about the economy ever since the surprise of the weaker-than-expected producer price data earlier in the week.“[After] the PPI data, it was as if it flicked a switch for the bulls,” he said. “The soft landing argument is what has been moving the markets this week.”Hewlett-Packard added 2.1 per cent to $35.15 after it beat analysts’ expectations with its fiscal third-quarter earnings, announced a $6bn share buyback, and gave bullish earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. HP is now trading at its highest level since the beginning of 2001.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices added 7.2 per cent to $24.20 after it was raised from a “hold” to a “buy” rating by Citigroup. The stock has gained 20 per cent this week.The energy sector continued to fall as crude prices slid further. BJ Services slipped 3 per cent to $35.21 and Valero Energy sank 3.2 per cent to $61.03.Phelps Dodge fell 2.1 per cent to $90.01 and Freeport McMoran dropped 2.1 per cent to $53.58 as copper prices sank on speculation that a strike at the world’s largest copper mine in Chile might end.Research in Motion gained 2.7 per cent to $79.81 on rumours that it would release a version of its Blackberry mobile email device with enhanced multimedia capabilities.Enterprise software group Salesforce.com soared 19 per cent to $33.70 following second-quarter results that came in ahead of analysts’ estimates.
179;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2006-07-11T14:34:37Z;PeopleSoft product line updated;;Oracle has come good on its promise to update the product line of PeopleSoft, the former rival it acquired in 2004.The first product in the new PeopleSoft Enterprise Release 9 suite is for enterprise learning and Oracle promises further enhancements in areas such as CRM, corporate governance and enterprise performance management.Oracle had to backtrack on its original plan to force PeopleSoft users to migrate to its new Fusion suite after seeing them being wooed by rival vendors.Tagging improvedRFID (radio frequency identification) is here to stay, according to Microsoft, and the next release of its BizTalk Server software will support the electronic tagging technology. The BizTalk Server 2006 R2 has improved supply chain capabilities designed to improve links between a business and its external supply chains. As well as RFID and XML-based business processes, the new release supports legacy EDI-based trading networks, still widely used.Compliance helpAvaska is the latest start-up working in the compliance field. Many regulations require businesses to know who has access to what and who did what and when. Those that do not, face regulatory repercussions and run business risks, argues Avaska. Its Compliance Manager software helps businesses automate the labour-intensive tasks associated with controlling and monitoring IT users, without them having to re-invent the compliance wheel each time a new regulation is introduced.Help to sellSalesforce.com wants to help businesses create a single sales force straddling direct and indirect channels. Partnerforce, its new partnership relationship management service, allows businesses to share information not just from their own direct salespeople but from partners as well.One of the problems with PRM to date is that indirect sales channels fear the vendor’s direct sales force will steal their leads. Salesforce.com argues that the problem can be minimised by using PRM to generate sales leads for partners as well as direct sales teams.Saas for salesNetsuite, a rival to Salesforce.com in hosted software, hopes to popularise the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model through a deal with CompUSA, the US chain of computer stores.The initiative is aimed at smaller companies that feel more comfortable talking to a salesperson rather than viewing Salesforce.com’s SaaS offerings online. CompUSA’s in-store business centres will provide a single point of contact for Netsuite’s products, plus training and implementation services.Linking made easyMiddleware has long been a bastion of proprietary technologies but now an open-source technology, called Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP), promises to reduce the cost of linking applications together. One of the biggest beneficiaries is likely to be the financial services industry and much of the impetus for the fledgling standard has come from banks tired of paying licence fees to proprietary middleware vendors such as IBM and Tibco. JPMorgan Chase is already using AMQP for a real-world trading system.

181;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2006-04-19T22:00:10Z;Google makes enterprise search push;;Google on Wednesday unveiled a series of partnerships with enterprise software companies such as Oracle, Salesforce.com and Cisco Systems, which it hopes will help push its search software further into the business market.Google is hoping to become the preferred technology for searching for documents and information within company computer systems, in the same way it dominates search on the internet.It launched its first enterprise search product in 2002, and has since won more than 3,500 customers.However, Google’s enterprise search software has been criticised for lacking the security features required by businesses and for being ill-suited to searching through the patchwork of applications and data sources that make up corporate networks.Google is now hoping to address these issues by launching a new version of the search product with increased security, and by working more closely with business software application vendors.Oracle and Google’s other business software partners are building new features into their software, which will make them easier to search with Google’s technology.Specialist search software companies, such as Autonomy and Fast Search and Transfer, said they were not concerned about Google’s redoubled efforts to penetrate the market, arguing that Google was still competing at the lower end of the market for very basic keyword search technology.“We don’t compete in that space,” said Mike Lynch, chief executive of Autonomy. “We did a hundred deals last quarter and didn’t come up against Google in any of them.”Mr Lynch estimates that Google’s enterprise search threatened only the company’s basic Ultraseek keyword business, which accounts for about 2 per cent of revenues.The simpler end of enterprise search is seeing increased competition, as a number of companies – including Microsoft, Oracle and IBM – have all recently introduced basic keyword search products.“It is a bloodbath down there. Simple keyword search technology will probably be free by the end of the year,” Mr Lynch said.John Lervik, chief executive of Fast, suggested that Google’s move was less about taking market share from search companies, than it was about challenging Microsoft for dominance of the computer desktop.
182;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2006-03-05T18:27:57Z;Dispute prompts calls for reform of US patent laws;;The last-minute settlement that has prevented a shutdown of the BlackBerry mobile e-mail service is unlikely to put an end to the push for reform to US patent legislation that the case has helped to spark, legal experts said.The $612.5m payment by Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, to end the patent infringement case brought by a small Virginia firm, NTP, was greeted with relief by the service’s users in the US, many of whom are senior business executives and financiers.“It is more than a technology, it is an addiction,” Marc Benioff, chief executive of Californian software company Salesforce.com and one of the many executives tied to the gadget, typed into his portable device shortly after the settlement was announced.While Friday’s settlement ends a legal threat to a widely used technology service, however, the high-profile case has probably already done enough to push forward the case for patent law to be reformed, experts said.The threat to the BlackBerry has highlighted issues such as “whether the [US Patent and Trademark Office] needs more resources, whether it’s too slow or whether injunctions are a good remedy in patent cases,” said Carl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond. “Congress may end up legislating on some of these issues.”John Carson, a partner of San Diego law firm Knobbe Martens Olson & Bear, said the case had drawn the attention of legislators in Washington to weaknesses in the US patent system that had made it possible for small companies with intellectual property claims to hold successful technologies hostage.“You can not only threaten an industry, you can threaten consumers – and some of them are politicians,” he said.According to RIM, all of the disputed patents held by NTP have suffered an initial rejection after scrutiny by the Patent Office, with the most recent rejections coming late last month. However, NTP’s patents remain valid until a final decision on its intellectual property rights, which could take years to resolve.Separately from the patent office process, a judge in a US district court had threatened RIM with an injunction to block its service, and to award damages to NTP, if the two sides could not resolve their dispute out of court.It was the risk of an imminent shut-down that prompted the payment by RIM, which was higher than a $450m it had tentatively agreed to pay under an earlier, failed settlement but less than the $1bn that NTP was pushing for.One way to reduce the number of patent disputes that take place only after a technology has become widely adopted would be to allow earlier challenges to patent filings such as those made by NTP, said Mr Carson.The patent registration systems in many countries allow “third parties to challenge patents soon after they have been filed,” he said.Some experts have also argued that injunctions are too blunt an instrument to be used in the case of intellectual property disputes like this, since they can destroy a successful service built up by a company like RIM.The BlackBerry case “serves as another reminder of the precarious state of intellectual property law in the US,” said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley financier.“The lack of attention to these issues will certainly cause real harm – we were very lucky in this case that it was averted.”
183;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2006-02-02T23:43:16Z;SAP ventures into on-demand software field;;SAP announced its long-awaited move into the on-demand software business on Thursday, which analysts and competitors said could raise questions about the software company’s business model.The German software group unveiled a limited version of its customer relationship management software that will be “hosted” on IBM computers and sold on a subscription basis.Under an on-demand contract, customers use applications that run on centrally managed servers, rather than installing and running them on their own machines.They pay a simple monthly subscription rather than up-front licence fees and regular annual maintenance contracts.SAP’s move echoes initiatives announced by Siebel Systems, which has been overtaken by SAP as the leading supplier of CRM software, and Microsoft. Oracle completed its purchase of Siebel this week, setting up a new area of conflict with arch-rival SAP.The push into selling an on-demand version of CRM reflects the fact that this has become the first corner of the business software market where the new approach has worked on a broad scale.According to AMR Research, the on-demand CRM market, though worth only $596m last year, is set to grow at a compound rate of 29 per cent between 2004-2009. Sales of traditional software licences, worth $4.2bn, are set to grow at only 6 per cent.SAP expects many of the customers for the new service to be large companies adopting CRM for the first time, but which eventually switch to running the software in-house instead.Persuading customers to make that transition could be important to SAP’s long-term revenues, said Rob Bois, an analyst at AMR. “Ultimately, SAP would prefer to move [on-demand] customers over to the licensed model.”Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, which has emerged as the leading stand-alone seller of on-demand software, said traditional software companies faced difficulties in changing their business approach.“SAP, like Oracle and Microsoft, now risks cannibalising its existing customer base,” he wrote in an e-mail to employees.
184;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2005-10-04T16:50:37Z;Ian Campbell of Nucleus Research;;One might expect Ian Campbell to be gleeful at last month’s $5.85bn takeover of Siebel Systems by Oracle, its enterprise IT rival.Three years ago last month, Mr Campbell’s company, Massachusetts-based Nucleus Research, published a highly critical study of the use of Siebel software.It found more than 61 per cent of “reference customers” it interviewed had not achieved a positive return on investment after more than two years, even though they were being promoted as success stories on Siebel’s website.This, it said, contradicted the company’s claims about the positive ROI average customers were achieving.Tom Siebel [the founder] was apoplectic. “It made for some good phone calls,” says Mr Campbell.In fact Mr Campbell owes Mr Siebel a debt of gratitude. The latter’s angry public reaction and a similar response at Germany’s SAP following another study of March 2003 helped put Nucleus on the technology consultancy map.Mr Campbell, a former research manager at IDC, the IT analysts, founded Nucleus in 2000, convinced of the need for quantitative assessment of investments, to complement the prevalent opinion-based approach.“Everything we do has some sort of number at its core,” he says. Its main tool, the ROI assessment, is a “great, impartial measuring tool, if done correctly.”In an IT context, the rigour and consistency of an ROI assessment has a particular resonance. “Some people will write whatever you want,” says Mr Campbell. And an inaccurate case study could result in a vendor losing its credibility with customers.Also, he says, the strategic and market-related analysis from the main IT research companies such as Gartner and Forrester Research tends to be general, but ROI assessments have to be done on an individual basis to have any value.Three years after the spats with Siebel and SAP, relationships have improved, he says. “Everyone now understands that we’re not out to get them, and we’re not going to lie to them.”In a sign the industry accepts the need for impartial ROI studies, Nucleus works not only for customers but also for vendors, including Microsoft, Siebel and Oracle.The respect Nucleus has won reflects the “rules of engagement” it established when it took on Siebel. “We follow a certain path. No vendor can say ‘Make sure the ROI is 200 per cent’,” says Mr Campbell.Even so, Nucleus’s work can still give customers and vendors pause for thought. Its study of customers of Salesforce.com, the fast-growing customer relationship management (CRM) service, supplied on demand over the internet, showed that a third would switch if they could find a better and cheaper alternative.“We quoted one customer who said it would take 30 minutes to switch to another provider. It’s not that Salesforce.com are doing poorly, but it needs to realise its tenuous hold on customers.”In general, Nucleus’s ROI studies suggest hosted CRM services such as Salesforce.com work better for smaller customers. As companies get bigger, and want to build on top of their CRM and integrate it with other systems, they should be thinking whether to bring CRM in-house.Nucleus has also looked at the ROI case for Venda, the hosted e-commerce service founded by UK serial entrepreneur Dan Wagner. “Does it make sense for anybody to create their own e-commerce system and support it, when they can outsource to Dan and pay a few thousand a month?” he asks.He is much less enthusiastic about the ROI case for two of the most-hyped fads: radio frequency identification, and Voiceover Internet Protocol.“I don’t think [tagging items with] RFID is a compelling ROI story for people other than a Wal-Mart,” he says. “When Wal-Mart [the world’s biggest retailer] moves from barcodes to tags it has positive ROI because of the high volumes, but very few companies fall into that category. Does Prada want an RFID tag on every one of its shoes?”VoIP is “wonderful”, he says, but questions whether there is an ROI case for it. “Yes, if you don’t have anything right now, you’d buy VoIP. But if you already have something, does it make sense to yank it out? Not yet.”Meanwhile, Mr Campbell refuses to gloat over Siebel’s takeover. “After our report there was a strong change in the way the company interacted with analysts, the press and customers,” he says. “I think they took what we said to heart.”
185;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2005-10-04T16:35:36Z;Marc Benioff of salesforce.com;;Marc Benioff is an ebullient character, a worthy heir to a long line of noisy, passionate and opinionated West Coast technology executives.But even judged by those standards, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, the software rental group, was in particularly bombastic mood late last month as he reflected on a momentous week.“This is the most exciting week of my career,” he says. “Not only have we introduced our most important product, but our top competitor just disappeared.”The “most important” product is Salesforce.com’s AppExchange, of which more later, while the competitor is Siebel Systems, which had just been swallowed whole by Oracle.Siebel employees and customers are doubtless waiting to discover what is in store for the once high-flying customer relationship management software provider. But Mr Benioff is already certain of what the future holds.“There is no future for Siebel customers. We’re now in a situation where Oracle now has seven CRM applications, so which will they continue and which will they kill? And what happens to the customers and what’s the plan? The reality is they have one product, Oracle Fusion. and they say it’s not ready for 2009,” he says.Mr Benioff, whose “on- demand” model has been eating away at the traditional software licence business model that was the bedrock of Siebel, does not mourn the demise of his closest rival.He says: “For the industry it was a good day, as the company that has given us the worse software with the poorest success rate is gone. Siebel’s epitaph will read: ‘They invented CRM, but the customers didn’t like the product’.” All of which begs the question of why Oracle paid billions for this unpopular software.With his 13-year experience of working for Oracle, where he was once regarded as Larry Ellison’s protégé, Mr Benioff has some insight: “Larry has SAP envy. He wants to do everything he can to become SAP. He dominates database but that can’t be said about the applications business.“Larry never cared about it until the past year or two but he wants to be king of applications and the only way is to buy market share.”Keen as Mr Benioff is to discuss other people’s businesses, he only really gets going when talking about Salesforce.The demise of Siebel as an independent business, is merely confirmation, he says, of the arrival of the business model that has made Salesforce one of the decade’s technology growth stories.What’s more, he says, he is not alone in appreciating this shift. “In 1999 he [Mr Ellison] spent $2m on 4 per cent [of Salesforce] because he believed that the future of industry is the internet and delivering software as a service,” he says.The change, he says, has been prompted by the experience of many customers in the late 1990s, when they paid huge licence fees for huge systems that failed to deliver satisfaction.“A lot of customers spent a lot of money for no return. They are now very cautious and that’s why buying patterns have changed. Companies that were buying multi-million dollar packages are now buying smaller things, or piloting them and buying later,” he says.And herein lies the strength of the business model. Customers try a product, like it and roll it out further and further across their organisations.“We have better products that users love. We turn our users into our salespeople, and they love us,” he says.Among those romantically linked with Salesforce at the moment are Deutsche Post, ADP and Merrill Lynch, big names that serve to emphasise Mr Benioff’s point that the Salesforce model is about providing companies of all sizes with usability, functionality and flexibility.The AppExchange will add to those qualities, allowing Salesforce users to create their own customised applications on the group’s architecture and sell them on.“Someone in Bangalore might go home one evening and develop an application on our service. They save it to a directory and charge others. Once we had two on-demand applications and now we have 70 and soon we will have thousands,” he says.And adding new and better services for customers, Mr Benioff believes, is the key to growth. “We’re hiring developers not lawyers and investment bankers. We think it’s a good idea and will benefit customers.”
186;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
187;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2005-04-13T22:19:24Z;Siebel ousts chief executive after sales fall;;Siebel Systems, a fallen star of the software industry, on Wednesday replaced its chief executive for the second time in less than a year as it continues to suffer falling sales and pressure from unhappy shareholders.The company named George Shaheen, a technology industry veteran, to succeed Mike Lawrie, the former IBM executive appointed in May last year.Mr Lawrie himself took over from Tom Siebel, who created one of the most successful software companies of the 1990s, riding on the boom as big companies bought packaged software to automate many of their operations.As chairman and Siebel's biggest shareholder, with 11 per cent of the stock, Mr Siebel played a part in Mr Lawrie's departure. “The board and Mike spoke and agreed he would step down as CEO,” Mr Siebel said. “This is all about performance.”Last week the company revealed sales of new software licences in the first quarter of this year were lower than at any time since 1998. The leader in customer relationship management software, which companies use to run call-centres and automate their salesforce operations, Siebel has suffered from a slump in big new call-centre and other projects, as well as competition from companies such as Salesforce.com, which have developed a new business by selling salesforce support as a service over the internet.Mr Shaheen, 60, made his name as head of the former Andersen Consulting, since renamed Accenture, which increased its revenues from $1bn to $9bn during the decade he was in charge. However, as head of Webvan, an internet grocery company, he went on to preside over one of the biggest flops of the dotcom era.Siebel's shares have risen since its profit warning last week. This, said Yun Kim, software analyst at AG Edwards, reflected a belief on Wall Street that the company might be put up for sale or bow to pressure and pay out some of its $2.2bn cash hoard to shareholders. Oracle, the most acquisitive software company, has included Siebel in the past on a list of companies it wants to buy.Mr Siebel and Mr Shaheen moved quickly to fend off suggestions that Siebel might be sold. “I want to emphasise this is not an interim leadership position,” Mr Siebel said of Mr Shaheen. “I am here to continue to build this company that is a long-term goal as I see it,” said Mr Shaheen.
188;CRM;Salesforce.com Inc;2005-03-09T06:04:26Z;CRM adapts to pay-as-you-go;;When US-based Siebel Systems moved late last year to deliver its customer relationship management (CRM) package as an online service for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it marked an important step in the development of hosted application services. For the CRM market leader to acknowledge, albeit belatedly, that smaller businesses could benefit from better CRM put the seal of approval on this “pay-as-you-go” approach to using business software.According to Gartner, 30 per cent of US SMEs will be using some form of on-demand service to support their CRM initiatives by the end of 2007.Online service pioneers, including Salesforce.com and RightNow Technologies, grew in stature during 2004 and showed that it was possible to deliver simple IT applications through the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. The supplier takes full responsibility for providing software and hardware resources, security and back-up and the customer pays according to how much they use the application.This approach obviously appeals to organisations that either cannot afford, or do not want, to take responsibility for application development and IT support.“We see it as a utility - like electricity. You don’t have a power station in your back garden - so why not use the internet as the utility to deliver the services you want without the complexity of a huge IT department,” says Phill Robinson, senior vice-president of global marketing at Salesforce.com. “We are not really a software company - we are more like a telephone company with 213,000 subscribers.”CRM he adds, is an example of an application which is usually associated with larger companies. Making it available as a pay-as-you-go service opens the door to a wider market.Salesforce “subscribers” come in all shapes and sizes and some are very enthusiastic about the service. “We use Salesforce to manage our student database. It has allowed us to use the business model we preferred. We wanted to run a successful business - but balance it with a particular lifestyle,” says Lucy Carter, managing partner of the Oxford College of Marketing.“We have no office or headquarters - we run completely virtually with staff dotted all over the country. But now when we have a new contact, it is filed in the student database and we all have access to it. We can manage them through the process because we know what they have been sent and the stage they have reached,” she says.“We do more than just sell courses - we also want to help students with career development But with spreadsheets and paper records, we could not do this in a structured way. As we have grown, we needed a way of tracking the conversation with the student and this is what Salesforce has given us. But it is more than getting at the information easily - it has actually allowed us to do the job.”Not surprisingly the growing market for online services has attracted big players including Microsoft, Oracle and, of course, Siebel. But they have found there are significant differences between the large enterprise and the SME markets.“We knew hosted services worked for large organisations and decided to build a strategy for SMEs around hosting. SMEs are resource constrained. They have a small or no IT departments, have less capital and less assets and yet, they must compete in the same arena as larger enterprises,” explains Bruce Cleveland, global head of on-demand services at Siebel.SMEs, he says, also have a different approach to buying technology. “SMEs tend to buy products based on testimonials - they do not have resources for research. At least 50 per cent prefer to buy from a local reseller.”Gerry Carr, marketing manager for CRM solutions at software developer Sage, also sees differences in the SME approach to IT.“In the SME sector there are all sorts of small vertical markets and they look for a lot of technology out of the box. They don’t want to get involved in large projects and employ IT experts. Hosted services are obviously appealing to this market - but it is still a minority,” he explains.“But there are advantages - all you need is a web browser and a good technology solution. For the smaller business it is fine - but it does have limitations.”Mr Carr adds that once companies reach a certain size, they are likely to need some sort of customisation and then the costs can rise. “If you start scaling above 25 users you could see a large monthly bill and this might be the time to bring it in house,” he says.Mr Robinson from Salesforce acknowledges that growing businesses need scope to scale up their IT support. “We sell to big enterprises too. The economic benefits are just as compelling for larger companies,” he says.One approach to scalability is to offer the option of bringing the application service in-house when it reaches a certain size.“There are some important questions for SMEs to ask before they commit to a hosted service. How long do I want to rent? How many restrictions am I prepared to accept? And how comfortable am I having my core business data outside the firewall?” says Brad Wilson, general manager for Microsoft’s CRM product.”We work on a multiple business model where companies can start by hosting the application and then transfer to an internal service when it grows. In the end hosting is about hiding complexity and making the software easier to use.”One way or another hosted services, and in particular CRM, look set to grow as an important way to deliver IT support. “In five years time, every application will be delivered this way,” says Mr Robinson.
