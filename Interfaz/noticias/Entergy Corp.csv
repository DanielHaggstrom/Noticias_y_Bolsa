That will mean he leaves his current job as project director for Hinkley Point C, a huge nuclear power station project in Somerset that has been dogged by delays.Mr Bakken said: “This is a critical time for the industry, Entergy and its nuclear fleet. I’m proud to join the Entergy team.”EDF said: “Chris Bakken has decided to return to the USA, his home country, to pursue new professional opportunities whilst allowing him to spend more time with his family.”The company has appointed Philippe Bordarier, currently the chief nuclear officer for EDF Energy Generation, to run the project.Under current plans, Hinkley Point is due to be completed by 2025, after which it will provide 7 per cent of Britain’s electricity. But the process has dragged on in part because of technology problems at the company’s plant at Flamanville, in Normandy, which is built to the same specifications.EDF was set to take the final investment decision at a board meeting last week. But the company delayed doing so because of concerns by some of its backers about how it plans to finance the project.Reports in France have suggested EDF is currently pressing the French government, which owns 85 per cent of the company, to take some of its 66.5 per cent stake in the project. The other 33.4 per cent is owned by CGN, the Chinese state-owned nuclear group.Anti-nuclear campaigners said Mr Bakken’s move was another sign that the project is in trouble. John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace, said: “Coming just days after the EDF board failed to agree a final go-ahead for Hinkley, this move is yet another symptom of the disquiet this project is causing within the company itself.“The whole enterprise makes so little economic sense that EDF’s own staff and many board members are concerned it will seriously damage the company. ”But EDF said the project is ready for its final investment decision. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of the UK arm of EDF, recently told a parliamentary dinner: “I can tell you that I am absolutely confident that Hinkley Point C will be reaching a final investment decision soon.”
1;ETR;Entergy Corp;2015-08-10T16:47:07Z;Industrials and materials lead S&P rally;Energy sector boosted by rising oil prices;The industrials and materials sectors led a rebound on Wall Street on Monday, as investors bet that lacklustre Chinese economic data would bolster the case for additional stimulus from Beijing.The gains follow a torrid few months for the two cyclical sectors — materials and industrial stocks have both trailed behind the broader S&P 500 since the third quarter began in July and are both negative for the year.While data on the weekend revealed a sharp decline in China’s exports for July over the past year, strategists with Deutsche Securities said Chinese equities, which climbed overnight, were “supported by the potential for more stimulus”.Marc Chandler of Brown Brothers Harriman noted that the figures reported from China showed demand for certain commodities and that related sectors were likely “oversold” last week and due for a bounce.“Even when you look at the decline in Chinese exports, they still imported a record amount of oil. Iron ore also held up well for example,” Mr Chandler said. “My sense is that the China story helps at the margin.”Shares in Joy Global rose 8.4 per cent to $26.84, Caterpillar climbed 3.7 per cent to $80.16, Dover advanced 3.5 per cent to $66.06, Alcoa increased 7.1 per cent to $10.07 and CF Industries gained 3.4 per cent to $60.95.The energy sector also climbed as oil prices rebounded off of recent lows. US crude prices rose 2.2 per cent to $44.83 a barrel while Brent, the international benchmark, advanced 3.3 per cent to $50.21.Shares in Valero advanced 5.5 per cent to $69, Consol Energy improved 5.4 per cent to $13.86, Transocean climbed 6.6 per cent to $14.46 and Halliburton rose 4.7 per cent to $41.64.The S&P 500 energy index, which advanced 3.1 per cent to 505.61, remains the worst performing sector on the blue-chip index, battered by oil price declines. The industry is one of only two within the S&P 500 that is expected to report a decline in second-quarter earnings.Strategists with Morgan Stanley, who have called their overweight energy position a “bad call”, said they nonetheless expected the sector to rebound as funds flow into the industry.“Sentiment on the stocks is low. Analysts slashed their numbers so aggressively that earnings look like they will be upwardly revised throughout the year. We remain optimistic that money will flow to this group in the second half of this year,” Adam Parker, a strategist with Morgan Stanley, said.Investors shifted out of US utilities after the sector recorded its best week since March, sending shares in Entergy down 1.9 per cent to $68.91 and Edison International 2.4 per cent lower to $59.54.Utilities, which have lagged behind the wider market since the year began, have been buffeted by fears that the Federal Reserve will soon begin to raise interest rates, a negative for a sector closely correlated to rate moves.Overall, US equities climbed on Monday, joining a rally in place across European and Asian stock markets. The S&P 500 gained 1.3 per cent to 2,104.18, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4 per cent to 17,615.17.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 5,101.80.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
2;ETR;Entergy Corp;2015-03-10T17:19:36Z;Financials and techs fall amid defensive turn;Utilities the sole beneficiary after big US stocks retreat;US investors piled out of cyclical sectors in a defensive turn that dealt a blow to the consumer discretionary, financial and technology industries and erased the S&P 500’s gains for the year.A sharp rise in the dollar against its largest trading partners, as well as renewed concerns over negotiations between Greece and its creditors, weighed on US stocks.The shift out of cyclical sectors on Tuesday sent more than four in five issues within the S&P 500 lower.Shares of Micron Technology fell more than 3 per cent to $27.61, Genworth Financial slid 4 per cent to $7.15, Freeport-McMoRan slipped 4 per cent to $18.84 and Citigroup fell 3 per cent to $51.23.Interest rate-sensitive utilities proved the sole beneficiary of the day’s rout, rising 0.2 per cent.Water and electricity providers have fallen out of favour since two blockbuster jobs reports increased the possibility that the Federal Reserve could lift rates in the coming months.Entergy rose 1 per cent to $75.48 and Exelon advanced 0.1 per cent to $32.13.New issuance also exacerbated dynamics in the market, strategists said, increasing selling pressures as investors bought into block and follow-on offerings over the past week.“Clearly there is a message being sent about risk assets and that message is probably that we’re going into a period of time where you’ve got some big macro risks,” said Joseph Spinelli, head of single stock trading for the Americas at Deutsche Bank.“The biggest one around the US market probably is what the Fed has to say and whether or not they change their language.”Debate has centred on when the Fed will change the language and eliminate the word “patient’ from its statement — which many economists say could occur on March 18.That could be followed by a rate rise as early as June, some investment banks wager.The divergence between Fed policy and that of the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan has weakened the euro and yen against the US dollar, creating a headache for US multinationals.Companies within the blue-chip S&P 500 index earned about 46 per cent of revenues abroad and a majority have already warned that profits and revenues will be hit by the stronger dollar.Investors have instead turned to European equities, which have far outperformed their US counterparts this year.Mutual funds and ETFs invested in large-cap US stocks have recorded $35bn worth of withdrawals since the year’s start, according to fund tracker EPFR.“The US market is an easy target right now — it’s the worst performing of the major developed markets,” Mr Spinelli added.“With that as the backdrop, you have a situation where a fund flow dynamic exists. As we talk to institutional clients, they’re highly convicted that with quantitative easing, Europe and Japan are a much easier bet than the US is.”The S&P 500 slid 1.7 per cent to 2,044.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.9 per cent to 17,662.94.

3;ETR;Entergy Corp;2015-02-16T11:26:05Z;US utilities turn down as summer rate rise expectations grow;Outlook for sector depends on timing and trajectory of interest rate changes;US policy lift-off is looming and the once high-flying utilities sector is feeling the pain.Investors have rotated out of US utilities, the top trade of 2014, as traders begin to re-price the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates some time this summer, fuelled by a steadily improving economic picture and brisk labour market gains.The S&P 500 utilities index has quickly become the worst performing sector within the broader market, sliding 4.6 per cent since the year began and trailing behind the main index’s 1.6 per cent advance.A bumper payrolls report on February 6 acted as a catalyst for the sell-off, with shares in Entergy, Ameren, Exelon and AES each off more than 10 per cent for the year. Utilities had been among the best performing members of the S&P 500 before the report showed a rise of more than 1m jobs over the past three months. This bolstered expectations that the Fed could drop “patience” from its language at its March meeting before raising rates in June or July for the first time since the financial crisis.“Utilities are not going to be middle of the pack,” Julien Dumoulin-Smith, an analyst at UBS said. “In an interest rate sensitive environment like the one we’re in, I’m not surprised to see it leading the pack up or down.”The sector is particularly sensitive to interest rate movements and has benefited from a low rate environment. Investors have bought the stocks for their high dividend yields as Treasury yields hovered below 1.7 per cent.S&P 500 utilities have returned an average dividend yield of 3.6 per cent over the past decade compared with the 2 per cent yield the S&P 500 has offered, according to S&P Capital IQ. But the sector also carries more than twice as much debt as the wider market, with net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 3.75 times forecast 2015 results.“In this environment, it’s more of a macro call,” Anthony Crowdell, an analyst at Jefferies, said. “If you believe interest rates will increase then utilities will underperform the general market. If that does not happen and global risks rise, investors could get defensive and utilities should do well.”Investors had broadly ignored the Fed’s own statements that it remained on course to raise its benchmark interest rates until recently. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who is believed to have a similar policy view to chairwoman Janet Yellen, last week said the time for raising rates was getting “closer and closer”.Much of the move in utilities over the remainder of the year will depend on the trajectory of the rate rise. Several strategists forecast the Fed may only raise rates once or twice this year in small increments, falling short of the central bank’s own earlier published projections.“Typically during the first year of the Fed tightening sequence, the Fed funds rate rises 215 basis points,” Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities, says. “Right now most economists are likely to tell you that we will see about a 100 basis point rise, as the economy will not grow to escape velocity and because of problems in Europe.”Valuations are another point of concern for strategists: utility shares climbed 24.3 per cent in 2014.“The sector is outright unattractive on a valuation basis and has been experiencing yield compression,” strategists with JPMorgan say.
4;ETR;Entergy Corp;2014-10-01T17:38:24Z;Utilities gain as eurozone fears damp tech;S&P 500 slumped as investors sold off positions in the technology and industrial sectors;US investors postured defensively on Wednesday following the weakest reading of eurozone manufacturing in more than a year.Activity was weighed down by a stagnation in German manufacturing in September as well as an unexpected dip in British manufacturing during the month, adding to concerns that a weakening Europe could weigh on S&P 500 earnings.Overall, the closely watched Markit eurozone manufacturing PMI index fell to a 14-month low of 50.3. Conversely, a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a moderation in activity in the US, although it remained above the trailing 12-month average and indicated the 16th consecutive month of expansion.“The global readings on the manufacturing sector fall into three camps. Activity is humming in North America, stalled in Europe and most of Asia, and dreary with minor declines in most of the rest of the world,” Michael Montgomery, an economist with IHS Global Insight, said.Companies on the benchmark US index, which generate 46 per cent of sales abroad, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, slumped as investors sold off positions in the technology and industrial sectors.Utilities, which are less exposed to currency movements and earn a far lower portion of revenues abroad, advanced.Since the year’s start, utilities have been among the best performing sectors on the S&P 500 – rising 11 per cent, trailing only the 14 per cent gain by the healthcare industry.Shares of Exelon advanced 1 per cent to $34.57, NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $31.19, Entergy rose 1 per cent to $78.04 and Southern Company increased 1 per cent to $44.09.Shares of pharmaceutical companies with potential treatments for the deadly Ebola virus rallied after the Centres for Disease and Control confirmed that the first case of Ebola had been diagnosed in the US on Tuesday.Shares of Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals surged 18 per cent to $24.99, while NewLink Genetics, which received Food and Drug Administration approval last month to proceed with clinical trials of its Ebola vaccine, advanced 7 per cent to $22.95.Lakeland Industries, the maker of protective suits to combat Ebola in west Africa, climbed 30 per cent to $9.01.Shares of fee-based consumer review site Angie’s List, surged 19 per cent to $7.59 after the FT reported that it hired bankers to review strategic options including a possible sale.Angie’s List executives are not tied to the sale, people familiar with the matter said. The stock remains 50 per cent lower this year to date.America’s biggest automaker, General Motors, rose after it unveiled plans to double profit margins to 9 to 10 per cent as measured by earnings before interest and tax adjusted for special items.The Detroit-based automaker also reported that September vehicle sales rose 19 per cent from a year ago. Shares of GM climbed 2 per cent to $32.49.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,946.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 per cent to 16,804.71.

5;ETR;Entergy Corp;2014-08-14T20:42:41Z;Utilities climb amid appetite for haven assets;;Utilities led a languid trading day as markets digested stagnant European economic activity as a drop in yields on German and US treasuries made the sector comparatively more attractive.Investors shifted back into haven assets, particularly higher dividend-paying equities in the US, and out of higher growth sectors including the technology industry.The reversal into US utilities, including Pinnacle West, Entergy and Exelon, which all climbed more than 1 per cent, followed a difficult quarter for the sector.Since the start of July, utilities have lagged behind all others on the benchmark S&P 500, falling 5.2 per cent.Analysts with Credit Suisse noted that much of the weakness at the end of July related to “market concern over Fed activity and the threat of rising interest rates”.Sluggish activity across Europe, which economists with IHS Global Insight said faced significant growth constraints, and a Federal Reserve cautious of lifting rates amid a fragile recovery, has made utilities more appealing.“Fiscal policy is still generally restrictive, despite increased flexibility over countries’ fiscal targets, and tight credit conditions persist in several countries amid still significant banking sector problems,” said Raj Badiani, European economist with IHS.The Dow Jones Utilities Average advanced 0.8 per cent to 545.91 while the Russell 2000 technology index declined 0.2 per cent to 2,047.88.Shares of Pinnacle West rose 1.8 per cent to $54.35, Entergy climbed 1.5 per cent to $73.01 and Exelon advanced 1.2 per cent to $31.83.Cisco shares were under pressure after the company said it would lay off 6,000 employees, or 8 per cent of its workforce, beginning in its current fiscal quarter as it seeks to trim costs and better compete with rivals.The San Jose, California-based company said it would incur a pre-tax charge of $700m relating to the restructuring.Cisco, like venerable tech giants IBM and Hewlett-Packard, has found difficulty lifting revenues, particularly as emerging markets struggle to maintain economic growth rates seen over the past decade.John Chambers, the Cisco chief executive, highlighted the “economic and geopolitical challenges” in China, Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and Thailand for some of the weakness.Cisco declined 2.6 per cent to $24.54 while HP rose 0.8 per cent to $35.59.Berkshire Hathaway, the company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett, soared to $200,000 for the first time on Thursday.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s class A shares advanced 1.6 per cent to $202,850 valuing Berkshire at more than $326bn.Kohl’s buoyed the wider department store sector after it said profits exceeded expectations as it trimmed costs and saw an uptick in July sales.The Wisconsin-based retailer said quarterly sales fell 1 per cent to $4.24bn.Profits were little changed at $232m, or $1.13 per share. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.07 a share.Kevin Mansell, chief executive, told analysts on a call that the company saw sales momentum at the start of July, reporting “a positive comp for the first time in several months”.The results followed figures from Macy’s on Wednesday, which fell short of analyst forecasts.Kohl’s shares rose 3.3 per cent to $56.91. Rival Dillard’s edged up 0.2 per cent to $115.60 while JC Penney climbed 4 per cent to $9.74, ahead of stronger results which lifted the stock another 5 per cent to $10.24 in after-market trading.Restaurant chain Noodles & Co tumbled 16 per cent to $21.16 after the company said second-quarter profits and sales missed analyst expectations as same-store sales declined.The company said overall sales advanced 11 per cent from a year earlier to $99.5m as it continued to open new restaurants, while profits climbed to $3.5m, or 11 cents per share.Overall, US equity markets advanced as new figures showed recent jobless claims hovering near pre-crisis levels.The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,955.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 16,713.58. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 4,453.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
6;ETR;Entergy Corp;2014-07-03T17:11:50Z;Utility stocks cool with temperatures;;Energy utility company stocks cooled along with US midwest and east coast weather forecasts, with natural gas prices trading near their three-month lows.The price of gas fell to $4.36 midweek from a spike to a high of $6.15 in February following the severe winter weather patterns. In the past three days, the price had fallen sharply from $4.60, said Travis Miller, a Morningstar analyst.The drop was the consequence of cooler than expected weather forecasts, and demand for power to run air conditioners and fans fell.“This is the biggest drop since February after the polar vortex,” Mr Miller said. “Utilities had a big run in gas prices after the polar vortex. It had a big spike and a big drop.”It was not unusual to see investors rotating their funds from utilities into more growth-oriented sectors, particularly in a rallying market, he noted.The fallers in the S&P 500 were led by Public Service Enterprise Group, the New Jersey-based utility company, down 3 per cent to $38.16.The Tampa-based TECO Energy fell 2 per cent to 17.71. New Orleans-based Entergy fell 2 per cent to $76.97, and North Carolina’s Duke Energy fell 1 per cent to $71.39. Chicago-based Exelon fell 2 per cent to $33.97.By contrast, the S&P 500 gainers were led by Petsmart, the US’s largest retailer of pet items, rising 13 per cent to $67.28 after hedge fund Jana Partners expressed interest in buying the company.Jana Partners on Thursday disclosed a 9.9 per cent stake in Petsmart and pushed management to examine options for the company.Jana, run by Barry Rosenstein, amassed its stake after a difficult first quarter for Petsmart in which sales missed expectations.Shares in the company have fallen roughly 12 per cent over the past year.A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made clear that, with its almost 10 per cent stake, Jana expected Petsmart to look at options including a sale, better operating performance and a return of capital to investors.Shares in tobacco groups Lorillard and Reynolds American jumped on merger speculation, after a CNBC report that the two were nearing a deal, following on rumours of talks earlier this year.Shares in Lorillard, maker of Newport and other brands, jumped 5 per cent to $64.41. Shares in Reynolds, maker of Camel, Pall Mall, Winston and others, rose 2 per cent to $61.56.Shares in truck manufacturer Paccar added 5 per cent to $67.25 after Volkswagen denied claims it was interested in making a bid for the company.Speculation of a potential bid for Paccar surfaced late on Wednesday after analysts at Sanford Bernstein said that the head of Daimler’s truck division had told investors that Volkswagen was eyeing a bid for the US truckmaker.Washington-based Paccar had been seen as offering the potential for VW to gain a foothold in the North American market where it lacks a presence.Volkswagen has been trying to integrate its truck operations more closely as it says that could help it achieve extra synergies of at least €650m annually within the next 10 to 15 years.That will help it boost its challenge to rivals Daimler and Volvo. VW’s truck assets comprise Scania, MAN and VW commercial vehicles.Christine Ritz, a VW spokeswoman, denied the reports to media outlets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to breach the 17,000 level for the first time, reaching 17,068.26 by close, buoyed by a much stronger than expected employment report.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,985.44 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 4,485.92.
7;ETR;Entergy Corp;2014-05-28T15:42:50Z;Power industry braced for US carbon rules;;Next Monday, President Barack Obama is expected to launch the most significant environmental policy of his presidency: proposed rules to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.Many of the critical details of the plan from the Environmental Protection Agency are still under wraps. It is already clear, though, that the new regulations are likely to have a significant impact on the consumers and producers of electricity.Gas-fired generation, renewables such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency will be favoured, while the struggling US nuclear industry could be thrown a lifeline. Coal, which generates roughly twice as much carbon dioxide as a modern combined-cycle gas-fired power plant, will be the worst hit.The rules for new plants proposed by the EPA in 2012 have the effect of preventing the construction of any new coal-fired plants that do not have some capacity to capture and store their CO2 emissions.The rules for existing plants would be much less restrictive. Gina McCarthy, the EPA’s administrator, has promised a “flexible” approach, which would allow states freedom to decide for themselves how to reduce emissions, although it is expected to set at a national level the targets they would have to hit.Its proposals are sure to be thoroughly tested in the courts. “You can expect this to be a wildly litigated document at every level,” says Julien Dumoulin-Smith, an analyst at UBS.Some companies, though, will be more troubled by the rules than others. Research published on Wednesday by Ceres, a group that works with investors to campaign on social and environmental issues, shows how widely their emissions vary.Among the largest generators, companies with a high rate of emissions relative to their total power output include Ohio-based American Electric Power and Missouri-based Ameren. Other high emitters include Energy Future Holdings, the Texas utility group that sought bankruptcy protection last month, and MidAmerican Energy, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. At the other end of the spectrum is Exelon, which relies heavily on nuclear power.One consequence of the Environmental Protection Agency’s new carbon dioxide rules may be a wider role for the fledgling US emissions trading schemes such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which covers nine states in the northeast of the country.It has not yet been formally confirmed, but it seems very likely that participation in the RGGI or a similar scheme would be accepted by the EPA as a way to comply with its regulations . . .Continue readingThe differences are striking: AEP emitted more than eight times as much carbon dioxide as Exelon for every megawatt hour of electricity that it generated, according to the most recent data, for 2012.The prospect of carbon regulation puts low-emitting companies at an advantage, particularly in the 17 US states that have more or less competitive electricity markets, rather than tightly regulated utilities.Calpine, one of the relatively low emitters which specialises in competitive markets, is urging the EPA to push for significant cuts. “The EPA should propose something that has meaningful reductions,” says Derek Furstenwerth, Calpine’s senior director of environmental services. “It’s not worth all the effort that we’ll be going to if they only have token reductions.”Conversely Southern Company, which created emissions at a rate about 40 per cent higher than Calpine, is suggesting the EPA should hold back.The new rules “should not infringe upon states’ authority to develop performance standards and flexibility to choose compliance mechanisms”, it says. It is arguing for the standards to be based on what measures to reduce emissions are practicable not at a state level but at each individual plant, which would allow for much smaller cuts.Creating fewer emissions has not so far been an infallible route to superior investment performance. Exelon’s shares have dropped 25 per cent in the past five years, while AEP’s have more than doubled.If they are allowing the industry to retire nuclear plants prematurely, it would significantly impede their ability to hit their national carbon targetsHowever, some investors are starting to use greenhouse gas emissions as a factor when making decisions about where to put their money. Calvert Investments, a Maryland-based fund manager, in March launched an investment strategy based on comparisons of companies’ performance in areas including greenhouse gas emissions and resource use.Stu Dalheim, vice-president of Shareholder Advocacy at Calvert, says investors are becoming increasingly concerned about climate change, and the Obama administration’s plans show how companies are operating in a “carbon-constrained world”.One way in which that may manifest itself is in better prospects for US nuclear generators. Exelon and Entergy have been under pressure because the economics of their reactors are threatened by cheap gas. But UBS analyst Mr Dumoulin-Smith argues that carbon limits will make it much less likely that regulators will allow otherwise viable plants to shut purely for economic reasons.“If they are allowing the industry to retire nuclear plants prematurely, it would significantly impede their ability to hit their national carbon targets,” he says.The technical details in the regulations would make a significant difference to their effects. For example, Entergy emits at about half the rate of Southern Company, but over 2006-12 Entergy’s emissions were roughly unchanged, while Southern’s fell 27 per cent. So how much credit should Southern gain for that improvement?It is a reason for every US electricity company to be nervous as they look ahead to next week.Chuck Barlow, vice-president of environmental strategy and policy at Entergy, says the company’s “very manageable” carbon risk is a source of competitive strength. But he is also concerned that the EPA should not be too ambitious with the emissions cuts it demands.“We believe we’ve put ourselves in a good position to comply with a carbon rule,” he says. “But they do need to make sure it is flexible enough for us to cope with the regulations.”
8;ETR;Entergy Corp;2014-02-19T18:23:20Z;Uneconomic US nuclear plants at risk of being shut down;;"More US nuclear power plants are at risk of closure because they are no longer economic, industry leaders have warned, jeopardising the administration’s hopes that the reactors can help support energy security and limit greenhouse gas emissions.Exelon and Entergy are among the US power generators facing pressures to close some of their nuclear plants, as a result of lower electricity prices, competition from cheap gas, and sometimes political opposition.For a list of the US nuclear power plants being shut down and those at riskSee belowOn Wednesday Ernest Moniz, energy secretary, said the government would offer $6.5bn in loan guarantees to support the construction by a consortium led by Southern Company of two new reactors at Vogtle in Georgia, scheduled to start up in 2017-18.Over the next five years, however, it is possible that more nuclear capacity will be shut down in the US than started up. The country has a patchwork of regulatory systems, with competitive retail electricity markets in 20 states, and it is in those states that nuclear power is under pressure.Where nuclear plants have to go head-to-head with gas-fired plants, and with wind and solar power that are supported by regulatory mandates, they are finding it hard to compete.“Competitive markets can be efficient, but right now they aren’t,” says Marvin Fertel, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry group.“We’ve seen a real problem that needs to be fixed.”It has been clear for years that the shale gas boom made it hard for costly new reactors to compete. Over the past year, though, it has become clear that even some existing plants are no longer commercially viable.About 3.6 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity were retired last year, compared with 4.5GW of coal-fired capacity, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration.While existing US nuclear plants may face an increasingly uncertain future, the new reactors being built by a consortium led by Southern Company in Georgia are at least making reasonably good progress, so far.Continue readingOf the four nuclear plants where closures were announced in the past 18 months, two – Duke Energy’s Crystal River in Florida and Edison International’s San Onofre in California – were already shut down and required multibillion-dollar repairs that made the economics of restarting them particularly challenging.The two decisions that really rattled the industry were the closures of Dominion Resources’ Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin and Entergy’s Vermont Yankee in Vermont. Both were running fine and licensed to keep going into the 2030s, but became uneconomic to keep in operation.Now executives and analysts are warning that several other reactors are threatened by a similar fate.Chris Crane, chief executive of Chicago-based Exelon, one of the largest nuclear generators in the US, warned earlier this month that some of the company’s reactors were losing money “due to the low prices and the bad energy policy that we’re living with”.Speaking on a call with analysts to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results, he said: “If we do not see a path to sustainable profits, we will be obligated to shut units down to avoid the long-term losses.”New Orleans-based Entergy has not issued such direct warnings. Leo Denault, chief executive, told analysts on its call this month that the company had been “exploring opportunities” for its nuclear plants, but “we didn’t find anything that we liked. And we like owning them better”.However, analysts at Morningstar, the research company, have identified two of Entergy’s plants, Pilgrim in Massachusetts and James A. Fitzpatrick in New York, as among those at greatest risk of closure. Its Indian Point plant near New York City is also under heavy political pressure.Morningstar argued in a note last November that Entergy’s plants generally had a “a long-term competitive advantage”.However, Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS wrote in a note last week that its reactors selling in competitive markets were “fundamentally challenged and driving downside to [the] shares”.Figures published this month by the NEI show that across the 61 nuclear plants in the US – 35 of them with more than one reactor – operating and capital costs averaged about $44 per megawatt hour generated in 2012.Cheap US coal has made gas-fired electricity uneconomic and accelerated a capacity shortfall in the UKContinue readingThat compares reasonably well with a new gas plant that will cost about $47 per MWh to run, according to the EIA, but there is a wide variation in nuclear plants’ costs. The best-performing quarter of the fleet cost only about $28 per MWh in 2010-12, while the worst cost more than $62 per MWh.Security and safety measures following the 9/11 attacks and the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, and a generally tougher line from regulators, have been putting upward pressure on costs.Nuclear plants’ prospects also depend on which market they serve. In the Miso grid region of the midwest, where wholesale power prices averaged about $35 per MWh in the first half of last year, even the lower-cost reactors are under pressure.In regulated markets, where generators are allowed a guaranteed return, nuclear’s prospects are much better. Duke, for example, operates all of its reactors in regulated markets, and Lynn Good, its chief executive has said she is confident they can continue as part of the company’s fleet for decades to come.Re-regulating competitive markets to support nuclear plants would be a controversial move, but may be the only way to prevent the US industry shrinking further.Nuclear power: on the way outPlants that are planned to be shut downSan Onofre in California, pictured, operated by Edison International

9;ETR;Entergy Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

Any military action, however, may only have a small effect on the price with Libya’s declining production more of a long-term worry. This comes at a time when nuclear plants are being shut across the US, the latest an Entergy-owned one in Vermont, in what could prove to be a short-sighted move if clean energy remains a worthy goal. Prices for another basic material, potash, are falling fast with the arrest of Uralkali’s chief executive in Belarus dashing any hopes of the previous cartel being re-established.Those not distracted by events in Syria had plenty of dealmaking to keep them busy. Vodafone confirmed it was in talks with Verizon about selling its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless, but the US telecoms company may have to find $130bn to seal the deal. In the US, Amgen agreed the cash purchase of biotech company Onyx for $9.7bn as it searches for growth. Also in America, stock exchange operators BATS and Direct Edge combined forces in an attempt to give Nasdaq and NYSE a run for their money.But any hopes Ryanair had of acquiring rival Irish airline Aer Lingus were dashed after the UK Competition Commission ordered the former to sell down its stake in the latter. In Asia, conglomerate Fraser and Neave was busy breaking itself up after 130 years in existence by spinning off its property portfolio. If activist investor Dan Loeb is hoping to shake up the cosy auction house duopoly after raising his stake in Sotheby’s, he has his work cut out.Finally in financial services, JPMorgan had yet another fine hanging over it – this time for mortgage bonds sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that allegedly included faulty loans – but the US bank can easily afford what could be a $6bn bill. Its reputation is another matter. In Switzerland, the chairman of Zurich Insurance, Josef Ackermann, stepped down after the apparent suicide of the company’s CFO, leaving investors wondering exactly what was happening behind the scenes.John Casey, Lex Publisher
11;ETR;Entergy Corp;2013-08-27T18:35:40Z;Vermont reactor is new victim of shale boom;;"The financial pressures on the US nuclear industry caused by the shale gas boom claimed another plant on Tuesday, as Entergy Corporation announced the closure of its Vermont Yankee reactor in the northeast of the country ahead of schedule.Leo Denault, chairman and chief executive of Entergy, a Louisiana-based utility, described the closure as “an agonising decision” but said energy market conditions, including low gas and electricity prices resulting from the shale boom, meant it was the right move to take.The plant was expected to break even in 2013 and would have fallen into loss in subsequent years, the company said.It is the fourth closure of a US nuclear plant to be announced this year, as utilities decide that investing in older reactors is no longer commercially viable.The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry group, said the decision was “jarring evidence that market reform is essential to ensure [the US] maintains a diversified portfolio of electricity options”.Vermont Yankee is one of the older US nuclear plants, having come into operation in 1972, but it had a licence from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to remain in service until 2032.However, Entergy said that its economics had been hit by “a transformational shift in supply”, driving down the price of natural gas, which generally sets the price of electricity.It added that Vermont Yankee was a small standalone plant, with a capacity of 650 megawatts, which meant that it had relatively higher costs and a greater burden for regulatory compliance than larger plants.Entergy’s announcement follows Duke Energy’s retirement of the Crystal River plant in Florida, Dominion’s closure of the Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin, and Edison International’s retirement of both units at the San Onofre plant in California.Those plants have also faced challenging market conditions, and in the case of Crystal River and San Onofre would have required costly repairs.The Vermont Yankee decision means that retirements of about 4,200MW of nuclear generation have been announced this year; about 4 per cent of US nuclear capacity.Mr Denault said Entergy remained committed to nuclear power. “Nuclear energy is safe, reliable, carbon-free and contributes to supply diversity and energy security as part of a balanced energy portfolio,” he said.Entergy bought six nuclear plants in 1999-2007, shortly before the shale gas boom really got under way, and once Vermont Yankee is closed will continue to operate 11 other reactors on nine sites.Entergy will take a $181m charge after tax in the third quarter for the closure, which is expected to be completed by the end of next year, and a further $55m-$60m for the costs of severance or retention for the plant’s 630 employees.However, the fact that the Vermont Yankee was expected to sink “gradually” into loss means the move will boost earnings, excluding the one-off closure costs, within two years, and add $150m-$200m to cash flow by 2017.In its statement announcing the closure, the company criticised what it called “flaws” in the design of the New England power market, saying it resulted in “artificially low energy and capacity prices” and did not provide “adequate compensation to merchant nuclear plants for the fuel diversity benefits they provide”.Marvin Fertel, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said failure to reform power markets to support nuclear power would “jeopardise reliable electricity supplies and leave consumers vulnerable to steep or long-term electricity price swings”.Vermont Yankee’s capacity represents about 2 per cent of the 32,000MW available on the New England independent system operator’s grid, which covers an area from Connecticut to Maine in six states, including Vermont.Electricity demand in the region has stagnated in recent years. The record high for demand was in 2006, at about 28,130MW, and the peak day so far this year has been about 3 per cent lower, at 27,4360MW."
12;ETR;Entergy Corp;2013-02-04T06:31:06Z;Powerless Super Bowl disrupts advertisers;Brands turn to Twitter as outage halts play for half an hour;The Baltimore Ravens held off a resurgent San Francisco 49ers and survived a power outage to win American football’s most lucrative game, the 2013 Super Bowl.Advertisers paid up to $4m to appear in 30-second spots between plays but many of them had an eye to the digital world too, with about half of the ads using Twitter’s “hashtags” to stimulate online discussion after their broadcast.After a flurry of news about how she sang to a backup track during the US presidential inauguration, Beyonce showed up with an all-singing, all-dancing half-time show that also reunited her former group, Destiny’s Child, and was sponsored by Pepsi.CBS, which broadcast the game, remained on the air despite the half-hour power failure in the third quarter, which plunged the New Orleans Mercedes-Benz Superdome into darkness.The broadcaster did not cash in by running extra ads during the interruption, telling Advertising Age that its commitments to advertisers were “being honoured” despite what the industry magazine called “one of the oddest moments in Super Bowl history”.However, the blackout interrupted the plans of some marketers, including Coca-Cola’s two-part desert race ads, and altered the momentum of the game.The Ravens had been leading 28-6 until that point with a strong showing that included a touchdown run the full length of the field. Amid jokes on social media networks that Silicon Valley hackers had intervened on behalf of their home team, the 49ers staged a comeback once power was restored, but were unable to close the gap from the first half.Ravens coach John Harbaugh eventually held his team’s lead to win over his younger brother Jim, who coached the 49ers.A spokesman for the Superdome later apologised for the blackout while the sport’s organising body, the NFL, said it was investigating the cause. In a statement, energy provider Entergy said: “At all times, Entergy’s distribution and transmission feeders were serving the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.”Some fleet-footed brands, including Mercedes rival Audi and Oreo cookies, used Twitter to capitalise on the blackout, with witty takes on the interruption. “Sending some LEDs to the @MBUSA Superdome right now,” tweeted Audi.Oreo and Audi both had TV ads running during the game too, as more brands try to integrate their media campaigns.The TV ad line-up included ambitious spots from Budweiser, including the debut of its new Black Crown beer that tried to appeal to a more sophisticated audience, and Taco Bell, whose depiction of elderly residents escaping from a retirement home to have a wild night out has been building since December.As ever, some ads caused controversy, including web host GoDaddy’s “The Kiss”, accused of sexism as a swimwear model smooched a red-faced nerd, and Volkswagen’s “Get Happy” ad, criticised by some in social media of cultural insensitivity by having a white man parodying a broad Jamaican accent.
13;ETR;Entergy Corp;2012-10-15T17:26:12Z;NY plant at heart of nuclear power battle;;Forty miles north of New York City, the Indian Point nuclear power plant has become the latest battleground in the debate over nuclear safety in the US.Critics including Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, say the site is old, unsafe and a ripe target for terrorists. Defenders warn that shuttering the plant would cost the state billions, raise the city’s already high energy prices and lead to sweeping job losses.Safety concerns are being showcased at a hearing on Monday as the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission considers whether to renew the plant’s licences for another two decades. The original 40-year licences are set to expire in 2013 and 2015.Opponents say the risks of continuing to operate the ageing plant are too great and shutting it down will not disrupt New York’s energy grid. The 2,000-megawatt plant supplies more than a quarter of the city’s electricity.“It simply makes no sense to keep operating 40-year old reactors that are vulnerable to fire, earthquake, outside attack and a host of other potential disasters,” said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, chief prosecuting attorney for Riverkeeper, an environmental group that is challenging the re-licensing. “Even if you closed it today there would be no [energy] shortage until 2020 and there’s so much new power in the pipeline that it would be replaced.”Industry advocates disagree. “Indian Point is very valuable in terms of ensuring a stable voltage level across the transmission grid and ensuring a reliable flow of electricity,” said Jim Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, which owns the plant. He said security and back-up measures have been improved at the site since the meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility last year prompted a reassessment of seismic risk at the 104 US plants.The Japanese crisis raised particular fears over Indian Point, which sits near two active faults.“This plant could never be built by today’s safety standards,” Mr Kennedy said.But Mr Steets said: “We have seismic protections that protect the plant from an earthquake twice the magnitude of the strongest ever recorded [there].”New York state is among the parties opposing new licences, citing concerns over the cost of exposure to radioactivity in case of an accident and possible corrosion or leaks in piping that could contaminate the nearby Hudson River.Mr Cuomo has advocated closing Indian Point since before his election as governor in 2010. During the 2011 post-Fukushima safety review, he said a proposed 50-mile radius evacuation – which would include more than 20m people in New York City and much of its suburbs – is not “a feasible concept”.The hearing has also fuelled debate over the economic impact of closing Indian Point.Last month, a study from the Manhattan Institute, a fiscally conservative think-tank, concluded closing the site would raise prices for consumers who already pay well above the national average.Switching to alternative sources would raise the average New Yorker’s energy bill by $76 to $112 a year, the report said, as well as adding to costs for the city’s public transit agency.All told, closing the plant would increase average electricity costs statewide by up to $2.2bn, reduce overall economic output by up to $2.7bn and eliminate 26,000 to 40,000 jobs a year, the study found.Mr Steets warned of higher energy prices “in a state that already has high electricity costs and which any business will tell you could be a determining factor in locating there”.Environmentalists responded with their own study last week that said the power produced at Indian Point could be replaced by improved energy efficiency and renewable resources at a limited cost to consumers.The report, commissioned by Riverkeeper and the Natural Resources Defense Council, found New York has enough capacity to withstand the loss of output from Indian Point until 2020, at which point proposed investments to boost efficiency and increase solar and wind production would make up for it. That would add about 1 per cent a year to electricity bills, or $12 a year for the average residential customer, the study said.
14;ETR;Entergy Corp;2011-12-05T19:15:19Z;ITC to buy Entergy’s south-east US grid;;ITC, the Michigan-based electricity grid company, is to become the largest US high-voltage transmission operator, with an enterprise value of about $11bn, by acquiring the networks in the south-east of the country owned by Entergy, the integrated power group.The deal means Entergy can strengthen its financial position by cutting its debt and offloading a cash-hungry network business that will require heavy investment over the next few years.It also enables the two companies to benefit from a favourable shift of regulatory regime, by moving from the state regulation imposed on Entergy to the federal regulation that governs ITC.In a complex transaction known as a “reverse Morris Trust”, which is a tax-effective way to make a disposal, Entergy is spinning off its transmission business in Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana, and then merging it with ITC.At ITC’s share price on Friday night, the deal puts an enterprise value of about $4.86bn on the business being sold, based on ITC issuing 52m new shares, which will go to Entergy shareholders, and taking on about $1.78bn in debt. Entergy shareholders will end up with just over half the equity of the enlarged ITC.Power transmission grids in the US need heavy investment to replace ageing equipment and meet new regulatory requirements such as connecting wind farms and solar power plants.Entergy expects the network business it is selling will have to invest up to $525m a year until 2014 to meet those requirements. Under state regulation, its ability to make a return on that investment would be uncertain.As a pure transmission business, ITC is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which takes a more favourable position on allowing returns on investments made to meet policy objectives.Wayne Leonard, Entergy’s chief executive, said: “Transmission really needs to be independent. It is far less complicated and more value-creating when you don’t have a stake in any business at either end of the line.”Entergy warned last month that it expected earnings to drop next year because of a drop in power prices, the absence of favourable tax effects and an expected reversion of the weather to more normal temperatures.The transmission disposal will strengthen its cash position and help sustain its investment-grade credit rating.Shares in both companies rose sharply on the news: at 1pm in New York, Entergy was up 4 per cent at $72.57, and ITC up 3 per cent at $76.25.However, the deal still has to win approval from state and federal regulators.Joseph Welch, ITC’s chief executive, said the deal served to validate the benefits of the independent transmission model.He added: “This is an attractive and natural strategic fit for ITC that provides benefits for stakeholders, including customers, employees, local communities and shareholders. Customers in Entergy’s service territory will benefit from the commitment that ITC makes to the regions and communities we serve.”ITC was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays Capital. Entergy was advised by Goldman Sachs.
15;ETR;Entergy Corp;2011-09-30T16:52:52Z;Scouring the data for quality indications;How I go about picking “quality” stocks;What constitutes a quality stock? In last week’s column, I began trying to define the criteria for picking shares in mega-cap companies with strong business franchises. As you’d expect, there are a great many definitions of “quality”, some involving attributes that might equally be ascribed to a “defensive” company, others to companies with valuable “strategic assets”, such as large oil and gas reserves. “Value” investors, meanwhile, might see quality more in terms of companies paying a sustainable dividend yield.As last week’s headline – Quality in the eye of the beholder – surmised, any definition is intensely personal. It is easy to pick a list of companies with a loosely defined “great business franchise”: such a list would probably contain Microsoft, Google, ExxonMobil, BG Group, AstraZeneca and Vodafone. However, I prefer to start with a quantitative screening of the market, and then add a series of personal overlays. These overlays are essentially tests of whether a company can defend its business franchise in an era of low-growth rates and intense price competition.To do this, I use a piece of software called Sharescope, which allows you to sift fundamental data on both UK and US stocks – but you can run a similar exercise using web-based services such as the FT’s stock screener at www.markets.ft.com/screener/customScreen.aspA quick update on Golden Prospect, the precious metals fund I mentioned a few weeks back. As part of its fundraising, it is offering new subscription shares. These are priced at 150p and can be converted into ordinary shares every quarter from May 2012 to May 2014.A few institutions are wary of subscription shares, thinking they could dilute profits for existing investors. But they could be especially appealing to outside investors looking for a medium-term hedge. In effect, you’re buying an option on gold – if spot prices shoot up past $2,500 I’d expect profit margins at the gold miners to soar, producing an uplift in their share prices.These subscription shares will be geared to this increase – so, in effect, you could look on them as a bet on really bad things happening in the global economy. Of course, if gold prices fall back, the subscription shares could expire worthless, but that’s the nature of insurance.My quantitative screen is relatively simple. I’m trying to find a large-cap stock in the UK and the US, with a decent dividend, controllable debts, a substantial profit margin, and lots of cash inflows. So these are the fundamentals measures that I screen for – and note that I deliberately exclude any banks or financial institutions.● Market capitalisation > £2bn● Dividend cover > 1.5● Historical dividend yield > 4 per cent● Net gearing < 150 per cent● Operating margin > 5 per cent (unless it is a utility company)● Cash flow per share: positive (unless it is a utility company)Where more than two companies from the same sector are identified, I will only take the two with the best figures for yields, dividend cover and net gearing.This “screen” will probably throw up a couple of dozen “big-name” candidates, which I will then whittle down to a shorter list by carrying out a qualitative investigation of the business franchise. By this I mean finding out whether a company has a clearly discernible “moat” of competitive advantage, which should deter low-margin competitors. To do this, the simplest approach is to look at past profit margins to check the trend, then search press commentary on the company, and then list the strengths and weaknesses of its main competitors.In this process, I tend to favour companies with substantial strategic assets, such as oil reserves – that’s why I’m currently a bull on the large integrated oil majors. I also believe that utilities have an innate attraction for long-term investors, as their businesses are heavily regulated and built around the notion of returning cash to shareholders through dividends.When I recently carried out this combined quantitative/qualitative screening process, I ended up with the following 14 stocks (although I’d be tempted to have only one North American telecoms utility – either BCE or AT&T – and I’m not entirely convinced about Microchip Technology’s inherent competitive advantage).My shortlist contains lots of companies that I don’t think you’d find surprising.BAE Systems is having a rough time at the moment due to declining orders, but it still possesses some fantastic technology and products. Drug companies are usually popular among fund managers right now, and both AstraZeneca and US group Eli Lilly make it on to my list. Tobacco stocks have long been popular with income fund managers such as Neil Woodford at Invesco Perpetual, and Vodafone offers strong yields and international diversification. All of these companies are in some way protected by that “moat” of competitive advantage. Then, meeting my strategic assets criterion, there are oil majors in the shape of Royal Dutch Shell and American outfit Marathon Oil. Completing the list are a smattering of utility companies including SSE (in which I already hold shares), US outfit Entergy, and Centrica (probably the favourite utility of the institutional investor).My list of “quality stocks” is BAE Systems, Marathon Oil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly & Co, British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco Group, Scottish and Southern Energy, Entergy Corp, Centrica, Microchip Technology, AT&T, BCE, Vodafone Group.adventurous@ft.com

The S&P financial index added 1.1 per cent while the KBW banking index climbed 1.4 per cent.The sector was helped by news that banking capital requirements agreed over the weekend were less punitive than some had feared.These gains helped the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent to 1,280.09, with the index finding support just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses, and traders are using the 200-day average as an excuse to get back in,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound on Wall Street was broad based, with all 10 big S&P indices gaining ground.But technology stocks saw the strongest gains, rebounding from the 1.8 per cent losses in the previous session.The S&P technology index, which had suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 1.4 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.7 per cent to $25.20 in the biggest one-day move upwards in more than nine months. On Tuesday, the technology group is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Elsewhere, Amazon was up 4.5 per cent to $201.25 while Adobe Systems added 3.1 per cent to $30.89.The material sector was the worst performing in the session as commodity prices softened. Allegheny Technologies fell 1.5 per cent to $59.11 and the S&P material index was up 0.2 per cent.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant the news was largely shrugged off by the markets. Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up. The figure was also below the 0.1 per cent rise that had been expected by economists.The data are just one in a long line of weak economic numbers released in the past few months which have left the S&P 500 6.1 per cent lower since the start of May.“With the economic indicators weakening and the concerns about the European periphery rising, markets are once again questioning the strength of the economic recovery,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 12,043.56 in the session, reclaiming its 150-day moving average lost last week.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.3 per cent to 2,688.28, bouncing off its own 200-day moving average level hit on Friday.The Nasdaq and the Dow indices are on their way towards 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent losses this month, respectively. The S&P 500 is looking at a 4.8 per cent fall in the worst month on the index since June 2010.In corporate news, ReneSola lost ground after announcing that its chief financial officer was resigning. The Chinese solar panel wafer maker was down 3.2 per cent to $4.88 after disclosing the news late on Friday.The stock has lost 53.7 per cent since the start of April.The Bank of New York Mellon China ADR index is down 8.5 per cent since its last cyclical high in the middle of April.Sino-Forest, a Chinese forestry company, has lost 88 per cent to $2.29 since the start of the month, and Renren, the Chinese social networking site, has fallen 53.7 per cent to $7 since its initial public offering in May.Other solar companies have also suffered in the past few months. First Solaris down 16.4 per cent to $116.68 since the start of May. But LDK Solar jumped 4.9 per cent to $7.14 in the session after the Chinese solar company said it planned to buy back up to $100m of its American Depository Shares.Wall Street kicked off the week in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the major indices bounced off key technical support levels after nearly two straight months of losses.The financial sector, which has been one of the worst performing in recent months falling 13 per cent from its last cyclical high in February, saw the strongest gains in the session.Janus Capital was up 2.3 per cent to $8.99 while Bank of America rose 2.3 per cent to $10.76. The S&P financial index added 0.9 per cent while the KBW banking index climbed 1.3 per cent.These gains helped the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent to 1,275.69, with the index finding support just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses, and traders are using the 200-day average as an excuse to get back in,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound on Wall Street was broad based, with nine out of ten major S&P indices gaining ground in the session.After financials, technology stocks saw the next strongest gains. The S&P technology index, which has suffered a 10.7 per cent correction since its last cyclical high in February, was up 0.9 per cent.Microsoft was one of the best performing stocks in the sector, rising 3.5 per cent to $25.15 in the biggest one-day move upwards in over nine months. On Tuesday, the technology giant is launching a new cloud version of Microsoft Office.Only the material sector was lower in the session as commodity prices softened. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, lost 0.6 per cent to $48.14 while Cliff Natural Resources fell 0.8 per cent to $85.90.Sentiment in the session was not helped by weak data on consumer spending, but these technical factors meant that the news was largely shrugged off by the markets.Still, data from the commerce department showed that consumer spending had remained largely unchanged in May, which was the first time in nearly a year that spending had not gone up. The figure was also below the 0.1 per cent rise that had been expected by economists.The data is just one in a long line of weak economic numbers released in the last few months which has left the S&P 500 6.3 per cent lower since start of May.“With the economic indicators weakening and the concerns about the European periphery rising, markets are once again questioning the strength of the economic recovery,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.Other data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed that business conditions in Texas-area manufacturing worsened this month.Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,012.16 in the session, bringing the index to within striking distance of its 150-day moving average.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9 per cent to 2,677.09, bouncing off its own 200-day moving average level hit on Friday.The Nasdaq and the Dow indices are on their way towards 5.6 per cent and 4.5 per cent losses this month, respectively. The S&P 500 is looking at a 5.2 per cent fall in the worst month on the index since June 2010.In corporate news, ReneSola lost ground after announcing that its chief financial officer was resigning. The Chinese solar panel wafer maker was down 2 per cent to $4.94 after disclosing late on Friday that Julia Xu will leave the company and will be succeeded by financial executive Henry Wang.The stock has lost 53.3 per cent since the start of April and is one of the many US-listed Chinese companies to suffer in recent months.The Bank of New York Mellon China ADR index is down 8.8 per cent since its last cyclical high in the middle of April.Sino-Forest, a Chinese forestry company, has lost 86.6 per cent to $2.70 since the start of the month, and Renren, the Chinese social networking site, has fallen 64.5 per cent to $6.31 since its initial public offering in May.Other solar companies have also suffered in the last few months. First Solar is down 16.1 per cent to $117.10 since the start of May.But LDK Solar jumped 7.4 per cent to $7.31 in the session after the Chinese solar company said it plans to buy back up to $100m of its American Depository Shares.
17;ETR;Entergy Corp;2011-03-23T20:54:51Z;US officials make NY nuclear site top priority;;US nuclear officials pledged to make New York’s Indian Point nuclear site “its first and top priority” in their review of 27 facilities across the country, Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, said this week.The promise came after a meeting on Tuesday between Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff and Robert Duffy, New York lieutenant governor, about concerns over seismic risks at the site in the wake of Japan’s nuclear crisis following the March 11 earthquake.The NRC has also agreed to join state officials in a cooperative review of the plant and Greg Jaczko, the federal watchdog’s chair, will personally inspect the site, Mr Cuomo said in a statement.The regulator is in the midst of a study evaluating US nuclear plants’ “seismic risk and their ability to cope with it” based on data received in September 2010 from the US Geological Survey, said Beth Hayden, a NRC spokeswoman. In addition “the NRC is going to look at all aspects of the response of Japan to the earthquake and tsunami to determine if any action should be taken.” The study is expected to be released in 2012, she said.Indian Point, located in Buchanan, New York, about 40 miles up the Hudson River from New York City, sits near two active seismic faults. The site has been the focus of intense scrutiny amid a growing debate over the safety of nuclear plants.The two reactors at the New York site began operating in the mid-1970s, according to the NRC, well before the area’s seismic nature was identified. During his 2010 gubernatorial campaign, Mr Cuomo called for the reactors to be closed and alternate sources of energy to be found to replace their output. The site provides up to a third of the electricity used in New York City and Westchester County. The balance of electric power comes from natural gas, hydroelectricity, coal and petroleum.“There’s no immediate safety concern” at Indian Point, Ms Hayden said. The US Geological Survey data “shows for eastern and central states, the reactors remain safe and the overall seismic risk remains low. However, some of them had different risk information that came out slightly higher than we had initially calculated. Indian Point is one of those.”It “remains to be seen” whether the NRC’s evaluation will be affected by events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, she said. “We are going to be looking at what’s going on over in Japan and we will factor that into whatever seismic reviews we do.”In a statement following Tuesday’s meeting with New York officials, the NRC said that “the robust design of US plants makes it highly unlikely that a similar event could occur in the United States.”Entergy, the company that operates the Indian Point site, told Westchester County legislators on Monday that the plant is unlikely to be hit by an earthquake of the magnitude of the Japanese temblor or by the tsunami that destroyed Fukushima Daiichi’s backup power supply.The largest recorded quake in the area was a 5.25-magnitude temblor in 1884, according to the 2008 Columbia University study that first identified the intersection of two seismic zones near Indian Point. Entergy says the plant can withstand a 6.1-magnitude earthquake.But critics dispute that risk assessment. The same Columbia study found that magnitude six and seven quakes are “quite possible” along the faults. “The seismic risk is something that has to be examined quite carefully and independently,” said Phillip Musegaas, the Hudson River program director at Riverkeeper, an environmental group that has called for the site’s closure. “From six to seven is orders of magnitude stronger.”In addition, Mr Musegaas said that while Indian Point may not be at risk for the tsunami like the one that knocked out power at the Japanese site, “a different kind of accident or natural disaster here could have the same effect.” Flooding or a storm surge from a hurricane could disable the plant’s back-up diesel generators, which are necessary to keep the nuclear fuel cooled and avoid a meltdown, he said.Mr Musegaas also questioned evacuation at the site. Indian Point’s emergency plan, which is approved by the NRC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, calls for evacuating a 10-mile zone around the plant. But following damage at Fukushima, Mr Jaczko, the NRC chair, advised Americans to stay 50 miles away from the site, and said he would recomment the same distance were the crisis occurring in the US, he said. According to Riverkeeper, some 20m people live within 50 miles of Indian Point, including the population of New York City and parts of New Jersey and Long Island.“I’m not sure how you can square that with the regulation that we have now,” Mr Musegaas said. “We have clear evidence now that the radiation contamination in Japan goes far beyond this 10-mile zone.”Ms Hayden said she was not aware of plans to change the standard evacuation zone.Entergy has applied for 20-year extensions of its operating licenses for the Indian Point reactors, which come up for renewal in 2013 and 2015. Mr Cuomo said on Tuesday he “has long been an opponent of Indian Point and has worked to prevent the federal relicensing of the facility.”
18;ETR;Entergy Corp;2011-03-16T18:44:55Z;New York nuclear site under scrutiny;;The nuclear crisis in Japan has sparked a fresh round of calls for reviews of US facilities. One target is Entergy’s Indian Point power plant in Westchester County, New York, about 40 miles north of Manhattan, which provides about a third of the electric power used in the area.This week, Nita Lowey, a New York congresswoman, called on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to “evaluate all possible threats, including terrorism, natural disasters, and the challenges that must be met in developing safety standards and evacuation procedures while determining the re-licensing” of Indian Point. Operating permits for two of the site’s reactors are up for renewal in 2013 and 2015.Riverkeeper, the New York-based environmental group, has called for the plant to be closed until it is “proven safe”, citing a 2008 Columbia University study that found Indian Point “sit[s] astride the previously unidentified intersection of two active seismic zones.”The permit renewal also played a role in Andrew Cuomo’s successful bid to become New York’s governor last year. During the campaign, Mr Cuomo urged the NRC to close the site, writing in a position paper that “We must find and implement alternative sources of energy generation and transmission to replace the electricity now supplied by the Indian Point facility.”Entergy, the plant operator, said in statement that “Entergy’s nuclear plants were designed and built to withstand the effects of natural disasters, including earthquakes and catastrophic flooding.”“The company understands and appreciates that these forces, natural and man-made, require constant vigilance and preparation for the unexpected. Accordingly, the company will continue to monitor closely the situation in Japan, and lessons will be learned and translated to even greater safety and effectiveness to meet the challenges of the most adverse and unexpected events, creating stronger public confidence in US nuclear programs.”
19;ETR;Entergy Corp;2011-03-14T19:20:16Z;Nuclear power: Fukushima fallout;The damage to the world’s energy industry will be widespread and long lasting;Even if further serious consequences are averted, Fukushima has already joined Chernobyl and Three Mile Island as a once-obscure place whose name the opponents of nuclear energy can invoke to great effect.The public’s visceral reaction to the terrifying images from Japan will overwhelm nuances such as redundant reactor technology, modern safety mechanisms or the geological stability of plant locations, nipping a nascent industry renaissance in the bud. Nuclear is once again a dirty word.In the US, tens of billions in loan guarantees as well as the first wave of new plant licences since Three Mile Island in 1979 are in jeopardy. In Europe, Germany’s reversal of plans to phase out nuclear plants in a decade face new criticism. And in Asia, India’s plans to ease power shortages through a big expansion of nuclear generation are being questioned.The only country sending a clear signal about sticking to development goals is China, with nearly half the world’s 155 planned reactors. In democracies though, Nimbyism, a potent phenomenon at the best of times, has been fortified.Companies most directly affected are uranium miners and processors such as Camecoand USEC, and reactor-builders Areva, Toshiba and General Electric. Secondary effects will harm, and in some cases help, other industries. In the US, utilities such as Entergyand Southern Company, in the middle of relicensing or developing multiple reactors, appear vulnerable, while thermal coal producers Arch Coal and Peabody Energy could benefit.Meanwhile, big liquefied natural gas producers such as Shell and Chevron will see both short- and long-term demand increase. Developers of other zero-emission power sources may also benefit, though they can replace only a fraction of nuclear’s potential.For the world’s energy industry, Fukushima’s economic fallout will be widespread and long lasting.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
20;ETR;Entergy Corp;2010-10-18T16:17:06Z;High stakes played for in UAE nuclear scheme;;When Abu Dhabi awarded a $20.4bn contract last December to a consortium led by the Korea Electric Power Corporation to oversee construction of a nuclear programme, many observers were taken by surprise.The bid battle had been considered a two-horse race between US- and French-led consortia. Critical to Kepco’s success was a commitment to technology transfer and to train and employ a high proportion of UAE nationals in the massive plants to be built.But that commitment may be difficult to meet, say industry watchers and participants, because of a dearth of qualified engineers locally and because of high international demand for skills. Today, some 60 nuclear plants are being built worldwide.The UAE plans to complete its first 1,400MW unit at Braka, an uninhabited region 50km south-west of Ruwais, by June 2017, and to add a further three plants to generate a total of 5,600MW by 2020. The long-term intention is that 60 per cent of employees should be UAE nationals.“We have an extremely limited pool of Emiratis available,” Abdullatif al-Shamsi, director-general of Abu Dhabi’s Institute of Applied Technology, pointed out at a nuclear construction conference in Dubai last month.The existing UAE bachelor’s programme to train potential Emirati nuclear personnel takes too long, Mr Shamsi says, so he has had no choice but to truncate study and work experience programmes from eight to five years.Away from the classroom, UAE planners have seized opportunities for hands-on experience. In the summer, 50 Emirati students visited South Korea for a four-week training programme in electrical and mechanical engineering, and worked at a nuclear reactor simulator.The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation has also launched scholarship programmes and is working with institutions to start different degrees, such as in nuclear engineering.“We believe we’re off to a strong start – within a year of launching the nuclear energy scholarships programme, we’ve received more than 1,000 applications from interested students,” says Fahd al-Qahtani of Enec.In spite of such initiatives, Bismark Tyobeka, a South African nuclear engineer working for the International Atomic Energy Agency, says his country remains short of skills after more than 20 years of operations at the Koeberg plant near Cape Town.“Even if the UAE can train nuclear engineers to be ready, they will all be inexperienced,” he says. “They will need considerable mentoring, job shadowing and a smooth transfer of skills will probably need more time.”For Kepco and for Enec, much credibility rides on timely and efficient delivery. Such schemes remain technically very demanding. A nuclear unit under construction by a rival company at Olkiluoto in Finland is at least four years behind schedule and 50 per cent over budget, according to industry watchers.“Performance like the Olkiluoto experience would be disastrous for the UAE’s plans and for Kepco’s reputation as a nuclear supplier,” says John Wheeler a nuclear manager with Entergy, the US electric power producer.On the other hand, the potential gains for Kepco and Enec are enormous given the high profile of the UAE project. The programme, led and funded by Abu Dhabi, is considered by the US government to be a model for others in the region to follow.“The prestige and marketing value for the Koreans can’t be understated,” says John Wheeler, a nuclear manager with , the US electric power producer. “If they pull off an on-time, on-budget delivery, Enec and Kepco will [look] like superstars.”
21;ETR;Entergy Corp;2010-02-25T18:18:25Z;Nuclear renaissance struggles to fire up;;"Amid the rural homes and thick greenery of Long Island’s North Shore is the biggest testament to the difficulties of building nuclear power plants in the US.It is the Shoreham nuclear power plant – a building from which no steam rises and no hum is heard. Completed in 1984, the $5.3bn (€3.7bn, £3.3bn) plant could not overcome public resistance and obtain an operating licence. It has lain idle ever since.That resistance was echoed in the Vermont Senate on Wednesday when it voted to close an Entergy Corp nuclear power plant 140 miles from Boston when its licence expires in 2012, citing a radioactive leak.If that vote is not overturned, Vermont will be the first state in more than 20 years to shut down a nuclear plant; California took such action in 1989.No reactor has been built in the US in almost three decades. Fears of nuclear accidents run deep following the country’s worst commercial nuclear accident at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant in 1979, which exposed those nearby to low levels of radiation.That was followed by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which killed more than 30 people in Ukraine. US utilities say public resistance is just one of the risks to building nuclear plants. The others are high costs, at about $5bn a reactor, and the lengthy bureaucratic approval process.Yet as the US grapples with energy security, global warming and an ageing nuclear fleet that supplies 20 per cent of the country’s power, the administration of Barack Obama, president, is trying to kickstart the industry.In his 2011 budget request Mr Obama included $54bn in loan guarantees to encourage construction of 10 reactors.While some say the president is using the guarantees to get pro-nuclear Republicans to negotiate on an energy bill, the industry says the guarantees are just what it needs. “The loan guarantees were an absolute prerequisite for the industry,’’ says Dan Krueger, managing director of global generation and energy markets for Accenture, the consultancy.“We should see an accelerating level of investment in US nuclear-related manufacturing, as well as renewed momentum behind proposed nuclear energy facilities,” Mr Krueger says.Given nuclear energy has no carbon emissions, it has won over those keen to block global warming. “Zero emissions has rung the right tone,’’ says Jack Bailey, vice-president of nuclear generation development at Tennessee Valley Authority, the US’s largest public power provider.TVA is considering completing two reactors halted in various stages of construction in the 1980s and two new ones. Yet environmentalists are not universally behind nuclear power.Entergy’s Yankee plant in Vermont had applied for a 20-year extension to keep it open once its original 40-year operating licence expired in two years. This is routine, as the US fleet of 103 plants must continue operating without new reactors to replace it.But James Moore, clean energy programme director at Vermont Public Interest Research Group, says the plant has suffered “old age problems” with the collapse of a cooling tower, a burst pipe and three leaks. He is among those who successfully lobbied the state Senate to block the extension on Wednesday.Larry Smith, spokesman for the plant, says problems there have been minor, with no radioactive material leaking outside the facility, and that the state needs the power. But the facility must prepare to shut down.Only if the $54bn in loan guarantees goes through is the US likely to see a concerted effort to replace such ageing facilities, leading to a ramping up of the equipment manufacturing and expertise needed to fuel expansion of the industry.“It would be the birth of a nuclear renaissance,’’ says Robert Rosner, co-director of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences’ project on the global nuclear initiative and a professor at the University of Chicago.One problem is the long lead times involved. In 2005 Congress approved $18.5bn in loan guarantees, but it took five years for the first conditional commitment: $8.3bn was approved last week for Southern Co, once it receives an operating licence, to help build two reactors in Georgia.“It’s just an extraordinarily long time,’’ says David Crane, chief executive of NRG Energy, which in 2007 became the first company in almost three decades to apply for a licence to build a reactor. According to the government’s schedule, it should get that within the next two years.Dozens of other companies that lined up behind NRG shelved plans after the economic downturn made obtaining credit on such expensive projects even harder.And now low prices of natural gas, providing a competing energy source, have made others even more uncertain. “If natural gas becomes almost free, there won’t be a nuclear renaissance,’’ Mr Crane says."
22;ETR;Entergy Corp;2007-03-04T19:14:07Z;Impact of the TXU bid;;The defining feature of the TXU takeover bid is its peculiar marriage of private equity’s largesse with the US green lobby’s newfound political power. But the Texan utility’s shareholders are not the only ones who stand to profit from this.TXU might have scaled back its plans to build new power plants – a decision announced alongside the deal – even without pressure from environmentalists. But the green angle is important. Wood MacKenzie estimates the industry had planned to build 53 gigawatts of new coal-fired capacity by 2012. TXU has removed 13 per cent of that already. More important, other utilities will think twice about building new coal-fired plants. Renewable and nuclear power cannot fill the resulting gap in the near term, so that means more gas-fired plants, which emit less carbon dioxide than coal. That, in turn, means high and volatile power prices in the near-term.Higher bills could eventually erode public support for action on climate change. By then, though, power generators themselves may have already accepted that the world has moved on. In a parallel with the early 1990s, when legislation to curb sulphur dioxide emissions came in, the industry may prefer the certainty of an agreed federal climate action plan, rather than the constant threat of new laws or a patchwork of state-level initiatives.As in Europe, generators with existing coal and nuclear plants should profit from a US power market linked to gas prices and are likely to start factoring a carbon cost into prices within, say, five years. Those in regions with little spare capacity and poor grid links should do particularly well. Citigroup identifies southern California and the area between Washington DC and Boston as two very constrained areas. That should benefit the likes of Constellation Energy, Exelon and Entergy. Higher power prices will also stoke sector valuations in another way. If TXU does fall to the barbarians, expect more generators to be taken private.
23;ETR;Entergy Corp;2007-01-17T18:31:32Z;Power companies endorse emissions cap bill;;In a sign that US electricity companies are recognising that the Democratic-controlled Congress will seek to impose aggressive climate change initiatives, six companies, including Exelon, one of the largest utility companies, on Wednesday endorsed a bill that would reduce their projected emissions by 25 per cent below projected levels by 2020.Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Democrat from California, and co-sponsor of the cap and trade bill with Tom Carper, a Democrat for Delaware, said the bill was the first time “major industry groups have endorsed a cap and trade bill which establishes emissions reductions as deep and aggressive as this bill”.The six companies, which have broken ranks with the rest of the industry, represent 15 per cent of the US electricity market and operate in 42 states. They include Calpine, Entergy, Florida Power and Light and PG&E Corporation.However, critics say that the six companies have a comparative advantage over rival power companies, in that they are less dependent on creating power from coal and have been more active in moving to nuclear power and wind power.Peter Darbee, chief executive of PG&E, which operates California’s largest utility company, acknowledged there was a degree of self interest by the companies. “There was a lot of push-back against global warming, but in the last few weeks there has been a view of the need to take proactive action to deal with this, otherwise we will be viewed as unconstructive. We want to be at the table.”Ms Feinstein said electricity companies accounted for a third of all US emissions, and that the bill was the first of five bills that would address global warming, including one to raise fuel economy standards by 10 miles per gallon over the next 10 years and a cap and trade proposal for the industrial sector.“You’ve got a cap and trade in seven north-eastern states, and in Europe and also California is looking to enter a cap and trade system.”She acknowledged resistance on Capitol Hill. “Coal dominates and is in 40 states, which makes garnering votes here in the Senate very difficult, so we decided whether there was some parts of industry with which we could work.”The White House also remains firmly opposed to cap and trade.The proposal underlines rising interest in cap and trade on Capitol Hill.
24;ETR;Entergy Corp;2006-09-24T19:20:42Z;US greenhouse gases;;Somewhere, somehow, someone’s going to pay. Two decades after starring in Commando – a film with a storyline as subtle as its tag-line – Arnold Schwarzenegger is gunning for greenhouse gases. California’s governor is at the vanguard of efforts to cut emissions. Last month, the state passed legislation to that effect. Meanwhile, seven northeastern states will cap emissions for power producers and allow them to trade permits from 2009, much like the European Union’s existing system.The White House may be no nearer to turning green – especially when it comes to taxing gasoline. But events like Hurricane Katrina are causing ordinary Americans to think again about climate change. Heavyweight potential presidential nominees on both sides of the political divide back federal emissions controls. Critics should remember that, in spite of a history of tough green measures, California’s economy has outpaced that of the US as a whole since 1970.The EU’s big mistake was to grant too many free emissions permits to power plants – basically handing them money without boosting investment in greener technologies. In the US, any eventual mix of free and auctioned permits would have big effects on utilities. The marginal generators, which set the price, are usually coal or gas-fired plants which would have to incorporate the cost of permits. That would widen margins for low-cost, carbon-free nuclear plants, but could hurt coal-fired generators.Citigroup has tried to quantify the effects of a hypothetical federal cap-and-trade system. In spite of uncertainties, the base-case scenario suggests a double-digit percentage point boost to the net present value of nuclear generators such as Exelon and Entergy. Coal-heavy rivals fare less well, especially in markets where cleaner gas-fired plants set prices or if more permits are auctioned rather than given away. Utilities investors should keep an eye on Arnie.

By Thursday, the third day after the tempest, he was among the first to be back in real business, with generators and drying equipment trucked down from Canada by International Catastrophe Solutions, based in Atlanta, Georgia.“I wasn't going to leave,” he said.On Friday, he had mains power back, restored by the Entergy utility in the area close to New Orleans airport in the Kenner district. Life for utility workers and journalists staying there got even better on Sunday when Mr Rhame trucked in water for showers and toilets.Apart from the Comfort Suites and Travelodge nearby, most of the hotels in the area were shut. The stench of rotting meat pervaded even the car park of the boarded-up Holiday Inn. The bad news for the media “rat pack” at least those without the comfortable trailers of the networks is that Mr Rhame and other hotels are fully booked later this week for months ahead as insurance companies and utilities move in. With his no-nonsense approach and the logistics skills of a field general, locals are suggesting Mr Rhame as a replacement for Michael Brown, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who was called a “blithering idiot” by Maureen Dowd in her New York Times column.Other top contenders for the New Orleans medal for business grit include Domino's, which appeared to have the only functioning eatery in Jefferson parish home to more than 400,000 people last Monday. It was followed by Mae Fong, who has re-opened her Chinese restaurant. Lines were almost as long as the convoys of troops driving by.Molly's bar in the historic French quarter, run by John Monaghan, and Johnny White's were also doing a brisk business even without water and electricity. Warm beer over ice satisfied many a thirsty television crew.And a final mention for those canny boat-owners who charged the networks for “canal” rides of the sunken city.
26;ETR;Entergy Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Engineers turn to air-con plant for electricity source;;"Louisiana engineers were on Wednesday on the brink of turning the lights back on in New Orleans in an imaginative plan to use the emergency generator of an air conditioning plant.Operation Jump Start New Orleans entails jerry-rigging the air-conditioning plant’s huge diesel-powered backup generator to provide enough power to light and air condition several large hospital, administrative and dormitory buildings.Some of the generator’s power will be rerouted to buildings that will be used to house emergency workers, National Guard troops, the US Army Corps of Engineers and federal agencies.A triage medical centre and temporary shelter could also be up and running within days. Many of the buildings are connected by an elevated walkway.The backup generator had worked throughout the hurricane to provide air conditioning to the Louisiana State University Medical Center and several other medical buildings. It survived the flooding without damage. Since then, however, the buildings it supplied have been evacuated.That changed when the Jump Start plan was hatched by Bengt Järlsjö, a vice-president at the Shaw Group, the engineering and construction company, and the man who designed the plant for Entergy seven years ago. It took less than a day for Entergy, the local utility, and Louisiana State University to get on board.“You want to provide hope. That New Orleans is alive, not dead,” said Mr Järlsjö, who is Shaw’s vice-president of project development, concepts and solutions. “Think of it in concentric circles. You start getting the plant up and running; you get a small centre up; get command and control up; get the medical facilities up – the emergency room – and then start opening up living quarters.”The 8MW plant has 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel on site and can provide air conditioning and electricity for 2m sq ft.Other potential power sources are now beginning to emerge. A.J. Finnin, a New Orleans engineer who consults utilities, hospitals and universities, pointed to possibilities at the University of New Orleans, Tulane University and Xavier University. “What we are looking for are three things: You need a site with potential. One of the things all of these sites have is dormitories to put workers in. Second, can these sites make electricity? Third, is their cooling system operable?” he said.Also important, but more easily securable, are clean water, proper sewage and communication capabilities. “If you have power you can get all these,” he said.Tulane fits all three criteria and the other universities have dorms, cooling systems, but no power generation on site. But, providing the cooling systems have not been too damaged by the hurricane and flood, Mr Finnin said power generation could be secured within the time it took to truck generators in."

Alabama Power serves about 1.3 million customers in the state.Gulf power, another Southern Co. subsidiary serving 400,000 customers on the Florida Panhandle, reported 345,000 homes and businesses without service.Georgia Power, which was preparing for the storm, reported no outages as the most damaging of the storms winds and rain had not reached the state. Georgia Power is Southern Co.s biggest subsidiary with almost 2 million customers.The storm mostly spared the power systems along the Gulf Coast west of Alabama.Entergy Corp. , with 2.6 million customers in Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas and Mississippi, reported just 50,000 customers without power in Louisiana and Mississippi.The company said it was in the process of restoring power as the storm headed away from its service territory.Mississippi Power, another Southern Co. subsidiary, reported 68,000 outages, which the company was already starting to restore. Mississippi Power, the biggest power company in the state, serves about 200,000 customers.In Florida, meanwhile, Progress Energy , which serves about 1.5 million customers in the central and northern Gulf Coast of Florida, reported just 7,000 customers without service on the eastern Florida Panhandle.
