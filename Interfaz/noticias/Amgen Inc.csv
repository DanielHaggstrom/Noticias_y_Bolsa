But drug researchers have no trouble deploying military metaphors. In June, biotech company Amgen compared its team of chemists to Navy Seals. Their feat was discovering a drug capable of tackling an apparently invincible target: one of the master switches that turn cells cancerous.The pursuit of novel mechanisms is paying dividends in fighting a disease category against which researchers previously struggled to make progress. This brings new hope to patients — and the prospect of healthy returns for investors. This weekend, Amgen provided more data on its experimental drug. It shrunk the tumours of about half the very sick lung cancer patients it was tested on. With expectations running high, that was a lower proportion than some had hoped. The shares opened down 3 per cent on Monday. Even so, the stock is up nearly a fifth since June.Amgen has first-mover advantage. Its drug targets the KRAS mutation present in about 13 per cent of lung cancers and many colon cancers too. Sales could peak at $2bn, says Citi.Many other companies are interested in KRAS, however. Shares in Mirati Therapeutics, a small biotech group with a rival drug, are up 1,663 per cent over two years. Wellspring Biosciences, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca are pursuing similar approaches. Moderna has partnered with Merck on a KRAS vaccine. Gritstone Oncology is developing one too.Cancer drugs currently account for 27 per cent of all new drug approvals in the US, up from 4 per cent in the 1980s, says Tufts. Spending on cancer drugs in the US has more than doubled since 2013, though elsewhere uptake is limited by the high costs.The apparent breakthrough on KRAS followed the discovery of a secret groove on a protein as round as a tennis ball. It is too soon to judge the impact of Amgen’s drug on survival rates. But the innovation is yet more evidence that oncology is the hottest area in drugs research.

As part of that deal, Bristol and Celgene said they expected to divest assets to win regulatory approval.“This agreement represents an important step toward completing our pending merger with Celgene,” said Giovanni Caforio, chairman and chief executive of Bristol-Myers.Pharmaceutical and healthcare companies’ deal frenzy this year has been partly driven by the desire to sell non-core assets or buy innovative medicines as their own drugs are close to losing patent protection. Major pharmaceutical groups are focusing on becoming one of the top three players in whatever category they operate.So far this year, more than $700bn worth of transactions have been agreed in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector, according to Refinitiv, including AbbVie’s decision to buy the maker of Botox, Allergan, for $63bn; Pfizer’s sale of its off-patent drug business to Mylan for $9.5bn; and Roche’s $4.8bn takeover of gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics. Bristol-Myers’s acquisition of Celgene is the largest in the largest pharma deal so far this year.Shares in Bristol-Myers Squibb jumped 4.2 per cent to $48.52 in morning trading in New York, while Amgen stock rose 2.2 per cent to $203.42.Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at SVB Leerink, said the deal was positive for Bristol investors but “marginally negative” for Amgen shareholders, because the price is higher than expected.He also questioned whether the Federal Trade Commission would approve the deal, given Amgen already has a significant presence in the same disease area. But Amgen said it feels “confident” that it is an appropriate buyer, with the key drugs complementary while not targeting overlapping patient populations.Bristol-Myers also announced that it plans to buy back $7bn worth of shares, up from the previously planned $5bn share repurchase. The move follows strong business performance and encouraging clinical developments across the pipeline of its portfolios.Under the terms of the agreement, Amgen will acquire Otezla and its related intellectual property, plus any other associated assets and liabilities. The deal will also affect Celgene employees who produce Otezla, who will transfer to Amgen.The deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2019, will help Bristol-Myers deleverage and maintain its investment grade rating. The company took on billions of dollars of debt to finance its takeover of Celgene, with rating agency S&P Global on Monday saying it expected to downgrade the company’s credit rating one notch to single-A even with the sale of Otezla.Amgen had $21.8bn in cash and investments at the end of the second quarter in 2019. Robert Bradway, Amgen chairman and chief executive, said the company was able to take advantage of an opportunity presented by industry consolidation.“We have been patient with deploying our capital and I think this deal rewards that patience,” he said on a conference call.Amgen believes acquiring the blockbuster drug will boost its cash flow and support its research and development plans. The California-based biotech company has seen early success with a drug candidate that might be able to treat the previously “undruggable” cancer gene mutation KRAS. But it needs to invest in much larger scale trials for the AMG510 candidate.Otezla had sales in 2018 of $1.6bn, and Amgen forecasts at least low double-digit average sales growth over the next five years. Amgen said the drug would be immediately accretive to its adjusted earnings per share from the close of the deal. The company expects to maintain its investment grade credit rating.The drug is approved for three different kinds of inflammatory diseases in the US and has intellectual property exclusivity until at least 2028 in the US, Amgen said. But Mr Porges said investors are likely to be “sceptical” that its patent protection could last for that long.The acquisition should also help Amgen with its international expansion plans, as it is approved in more than 50 markets outside the US but launched in only 32 of them.Amgen already has a significant drug in the inflammatory category — Enbrel — which it says is complementary to Otezla. Amgen is also selling Amgevita, a biosimilar version of the anti-inflammatory drug Humira, in Europe."
2;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2019-07-30T20:06:08Z;Amgen boosts earnings guidance amid optimism for new cancer treatment;;Amgen beat expectations on earnings and revenue, as the California-based biotech said its early stage drug to treat the previously ‘undruggable’ cancer gene mutation KRAS has seen success in cancers in the colon and appendix.The drugmaker increased its full-year guidance to the top end of its previous range, forecasting adjusted earnings of between $13.75 and $14.30 a share and revenues of between $22.4bn and $22.9bn. On reported basis, the company forecast earnings between $12.10 and $12.71 a share.The company updated the market on the progress in its AMG510 studies, saying it has now seen responses in tumours in colorectal and appendiceal cancer patients, on top of the results published at the world’s largest cancer conference in June showing early signs the drug may work in lung cancer. AMG510 targets ‘KRAS’ an oncogene that scientists have known about for decades — but struggled to create a drug that hooks on to it.In the second quarter, Amgen reported adjusted earnings of $3.97 a share, far above the consensus forecast for $3.59 and up 4 per cent year-on-year. Net income was down 5 per cent year-on-year to $2.7bn.Revenue fell 3 per cent to $5.9bn because of increased competition due to patent expirations, above the average analyst estimate for revenue of $5.7bn. But four drugs grew at double digit — or more — percentage rates: Prolia, for osteoporosis, Repatha, for cholesterol, Parsabiv, for kidney patients, and Aimovig, for migraines.Robert Bradway, chief executive, said: “With our newer products generating strong volume gains globally and many first-in-class medicines advancing through our pipeline, we are well positioned to serve patients and deliver long-term growth for our shareholders.”Shares in Amgen, which have fallen 8 per cent year-on-year, rose 2.6 per cent to $181 in after-hours trading in New York.
3;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2019-07-11T21:14:20Z;Amgen, Novartis abandon two Alzheimer’s drug studies;Move comes after some patients on the trials showed a worsening in cognitive function;"Amgen and Novartis have closed two studies trying to find drugs for Alzheimer’s disease, dealing another blow to the millions of patients left waiting for a treatment for the neurodegenerative disorder.The pharmaceutical companies, along with their partner, the research centre Banner Alzheimer’s Institute, said that some patients on the trials had shown a worsening — rather than the hoped for improvement — in cognitive function. They concluded that the potential benefit for participants did not outweigh the risks.The decision comes after Biogen, a neuroscience-focused biotech company, closed down its Alzheimer’s drug trial with Japanese company Eisai in April, after they found the drug was not going to be effective.Both trials were targeting the amyloid plaques that build up in the brains of patients and destroy connections between nerve cells. The hypothesis that clearing these plaques has dominated Alzheimer’s research for years — but is now being rethought by many scientists.David Reese, executive vice-president of research & development at Amgen, said the team was disappointed.“We still believe amyloid plays an important but complex role in Alzheimer’s disease,” he said. “Although the outcomes of the research program did not lead to the results we aimed for, we are committed to sharing our findings to help advance the medical and scientific community one step further toward finding a prevention for this devastating disease.”The trial focused on a drug known as CNP520 that was designed to inhibit BACE1, an enzyme that plays an important role in the production of amyloid ß.There are other trials under way at very early stages, looking at a variety of strategies from targeting ‘tau’, twisted proteins that tangle up in the brain; anti-inflammation strategies and the brain’s immune system.Shares in Novartis fell 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading to $88.98, while Amgen remained flat."
4;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2019-06-14T21:19:10Z;Drugmakers sue to stop rule requiring prices in TV ads;Amgen, Merck and Eli Lilly say Trump administration’s move infringes on free speech;Three large US drugmakers and a marketing trade group have filed suit against the Trump administration, claiming that a new rule that forces them to include drug prices in their TV advertisements hinders their free speech.The lawsuit filed Friday by Amgen, Merck, Eli Lilly and the Association of National Advertisers challenges a rule announced in May that will require the list price of any drug that costs over $35 for a month’s supply or a normal course of treatment to be displayed in TV ads. The companies claim the rule exceeds the authority of the federal department that issued it, the health and human services department, and violates First Amendment speech protections. They protest that the “list price” often has little relation to how much a patient will pay. The gap between a drug’s list price and its net price is often the result of rebates that go to middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers, and the proportion of the cost that a patient must contribute depends on their insurance plan. That can make it seem more expensive than it actually is, the groups say.“Far from promoting transparency and improved decision-making, therefore, the rule would instead force pharmaceutical companies to mislead tens of millions of Americans about the price they would actually pay for important medicines that might improve their health or even save their lives,” the companies said in the complaint. The rule was introduced to try to tackle rising drug prices and soaring out-of-pocket contributions from patients, which have become an issue for many voters. Both Republicans and Democrats are trying to pressure the pharmaceutical industry to lower drug costs. When it was announced, Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, challenged the drugmakers’ claim that list prices do not matter. “You’ve got to level with people what your drugs cost,” Mr Azar said. “Put it in the TV ads. Patients have a right to know — and if you’re ashamed of your drug prices, change your drug prices.”“President Trump and Secretary Azar are committed to providing patients the information they need to make their own informed healthcare decisions,” said Caitlin Oakley, HHS spokesperson.Many large pharmaceutical companies have begun to direct consumers to their website for more personalised information on pricing, following guidelines produced by the industry association PhRMA.But not all are resisting the rule. Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest healthcare group, became the first drugmaker to voluntarily display the list price of a drug in an advert, before the rule was even announced. Eli Lilly said it agrees that patients need more and better information but added: “The impetus for the lawsuit is drug prices in TV ads, but the crux of it is HHS not having the authority to mandate this action.”Merck said: “Not only does the rule raise serious freedom of speech concerns but the rule is not in the best interest of patients because it fails to inform them — and indeed may cause them to be misled — about what they will pay for their medication.” Amgen said: “Most importantly, it does not answer the fundamental question patients are asking: ‘What will I have to pay for my medicine?’”
5;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:00:06+0000;Amgen drug takes aim at cancer ‘master switch’;Researchers may have found way to target gene implicated in cancers;Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company, has discovered a drug to target a supposedly ‘undruggable’ gene mutation, potentially paving the way for a new cancer treatment.The California-based biotech company presented very early data on its research into drugging the protein made by the ‘KRAS’ gene — a mutation of which is found in many cancers including lung and colorectal — at the American Society for Clinical Oncology on Monday. Greg Friberg, Amgen’s vice-president of global oncology development, said researchers had been studying ‘KRAS’ for decades because it was one of the master switches that turned a cell cancerous, known as an oncogene. “The mutations allow [cancerous cells] to survive in the face of stresses, to not follow the rules, to not die when they're supposed to and to become immortal,’ he said. “That's what a cancer is: your cells become immortal.”Researchers had struggled for years to find a way to hook a drug on to the KRAS protein because it is round like a tennis ball. By using X-ray crystallography — which Dr Friberg describes as a kind of “Polaroid for the microscopic environment” — Amgen’s team had found a secret groove that they could then search for a drug to target. The drug targets only one of the rarer types of KRAS mutation, G12C, which is found in 14 per cent of non-small cell lung cancers and 2 to 5 per cent of other tumour types. The phase 1 study is a very early look at whether the drug will work in patients who have tumours with the specific KRAS mutation. It had a mixed response in patients: the drug shrunk five of the ten lung cancer tumours to a degree that is called a ‘partial response’, with larger doses having more impact. Four of the lung cancer patients had their tumour stabilise but it grew in one patient. Amgen does not yet know why the response from lung cancer patients was mixed or why colorectal cancer patients did not respond. Dr Marwan Fakih, a professor at the department of medical oncology & therapeutics research at the City of Hope, a clinical research centre in California, who presented the study at Asco, said he hoped that after further investigation, the drug would help patients. “While there’s been significant progress in treating solid tumour cancers overall with targeted therapies, patients with the KRAS G12C mutation have not benefited from these advances,” he said. Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at SVB Leerink, estimated that the drug had about a 35 per cent probability of success in lung cancer patients. But he said it could generate $2.3bn in total revenue by 2028, a forecast which pushed him to slightly increase his price target for Amgen, from $185 to $187 a share.
6;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2019-04-30T20:19:15Z;Biotech Amgen reveals earnings beat in face of rising competition;;Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company, beat earnings and revenue expectations and edged up its full-year guidance despite pricing pressure and increased competition for its Neulasta drug for cancer patients.The California-based biotech reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.56, compared with the average analyst estimate of $3.48. Net income fell 14 per cent year-on-year to $2bn.Amgen said revenue was $5.6bn, higher than the consensus forecast for $5.5bn, driven by a 4 per cent rise in sales of Enbrel, the autoimmune disease drug that is its best-selling product with $1.1bn in revenue.But sales of Neulasta, its second largest drug fell 12 per cent to $893m, as biosimilar competition entered the market.Robert Bradway, chairman and chief executive, said there was “strong, volume-driven growth” for new products. “We are also advancing a record number of first-in-class molecules targeting significant areas of unmet need through our pipeline,” he said.Amgen slashed the list price of Repatha, its cholesterol-lowering drug, by 60 per cent last year in an attempt to make it more accessible to patients and boost volume sales. Sales of Repatha increased by 15 per cent in the quarter, compared to the same period the year before, to $83m.Amgen has its own biosimilar products, including a new rival to Humira, the world’s best-selling drug, which is on sale in Europe. The company made $55m in its biosimilars division during the quarter. Mr Meline said it is on track for a $200m in annual revenue.Amgen followed several other drugmakers to raise guidance for 2019, pushing up the bottom of the end of its range slightly on both earnings and revenue. It now expects adjusted earnings per share between $13.25 to $14.30, up from $13.10 to $14.30, and revenue of between $22bn and $22.9bn, up from $21.8bn to $22.9bn.Shares in Amgen fell 0.6 per cent to $178.28 in after-hours trading in New York.
7;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:40:49+0000;Amgen invests £50m in gene-reading company Oxford Nanopore;California-based group acquires 3 per cent stake in UK sequencing company;Amgen, the US biotechnology group, has invested £50m in Oxford Nanopore, in a deal that values the UK developer of gene-reading machines at £1.5bn.California-based Amgen is the first big user of DNA sequencing machines to invest in Nanopore.Amgen’s subsidiary deCode Genetics, which searches through human genomes for causes of disease that could lead to new drugs, is already an enthusiastic customer, according to its founder Kári Stefánsson.He said the technology “creates a window into parts of the genome that have been out of reach, as well as giving us a much better handle on structural variants that confer risk of a wide variety of diseases”.“We have used Oxford Nanopore technology to sequence several hundred human genomes and continue to see the promise of this emerging technology,” he added.[Oxford Nanopore’s technology] creates a window into parts of the genome that have been out of reachBut Amgen’s equity investment will not give it privileged access to Nanopore technology.Oxford Nanopore’s technology is based on electrically charged nanopores, which are microscopic holes inside protein molecules.The machine pulls strands of DNA through the nanopores, recording the distinct change in current for each of the four letters of the genetic code (G, A, T and C). Combining these signals gives the whole sequence of the DNA molecule.Amgen has acquired a 3 per cent stake in Nanopore by buying existing shares at the same price per share as new investors paid at the company’s previous funding round. That raised £100m in March of this year from GIC in Singapore, China Construction Bank and Australia’s Hostplus.London-listed IP Group, which was one of the original investors when Nanopore was set up in 2005 as an Oxford university spinout, has not sold any shares to Amgen.It remains the largest shareholder, with a stake of 18.3 per cent worth about £270m. Other significant shareholders include Lansdowne Partners, Invesco, Woodford Investment Management and Redmile.Nanopore caught scientists’ attention with its early products, including the world’s first small, lightweight and portable DNA sequencer called MINION, which has since been used on the International Space Station.But the company is now promoting the large, lab-based PromethION sequencer that Amgen’s deCode has been using.The device competes directly with machines from Illumina of California, which dominates the $3bn-a-year DNA sequencing market with machines that use different technology.According to Nanopore’s critics, its machines, unlike Illumina’s, are not capable of delivering the extremely accurate DNA readouts required for some applications.But the company said it aims to close the accuracy gap. It has already achieved 99.98 per cent accuracy and is aiming for 99.999 per cent.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
9;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Amgen earnings boosted by new products, lower tax rate;;Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company, saw revenue inch higher in the first three months of 2018, with strong growth for recently launched products like its Repatha cholesterol medication softening a decline in sales of some of its more established ones.The company’s shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the report, which showed a 2 per cent gain in revenue from a year earlier to $5.6bn.Net income jumped 12 per cent to $2.3bn for the three months ending March 31, while earnings per share came in 16 per cent higher year-on-year to $3.25.Analysts had been looking for sales of $5.43bn and net income of $1.95bn, or $2.82 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Adjusted for special items, earnings per share came in 10 per cent higher at $3.47.The company credited the results to a lower tax rate and higher product sales, particularly for new and recently launched products like Repatha, cancer drug Kyprolis, and Prolia and Xgeva, both used to treat bone problems. Those products all racked up double-digit percentage sales growth in the past quarter, Amgen said.That helped to offset respective declines of 5 and 6 per cent for blockbuster drugs Neulasta and Enbrel, which still managed to eke out more than $1bn in sales apiece during the first quarter due to weaker demand.The solid performance prompted Amgen to modestly bump the bottom range of its previous forecast for full-year adjusted earnings and revenue. It is now looking for adjusted earnings between $12.80 and $13.70 (previously $12.60 to $13.70) and sales between $21.9bn to $22.8bn (previously $21.8bn to $22.8bn).Amgen said its earnings were also boosted by the lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding during the quarter. Earlier this year it said it would spend $10bn to buy back shares, funded by cash repatriated after Donald Trump’s tax reforms.After climbing 18.9 per cent in 2017, Amgen shares are down 1.13 per cent so far in 2018. They were down 0.55 per cent in after-hours trading.
10;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2018-02-11T15:14:50Z;Amgen ‘looking hard’ at striking deals using $27bn cash pile;Chief financial officer of world’s largest biotech company cautions on high valuations;"Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company, has said it is “looking hard” for deals to deploy its $27bn cash pile but warned it is struggling to find targets amid soaring valuations in the life sciences sector.The note of caution comes as mergers and acquisitions activity in the healthcare sector recorded its strongest start to a year in more than a decade, with almost $32bn of global deals announced since the start of January.However, buyers have been offering record premiums to clinch deals, with Celgene agreeing to pay $9bn for cell therapy group Juno — almost twice its undisturbed market value. Sanofi paid a 63 per cent premium for haemophilia specialist Bioverativ.“We want to deploy any excess cash and our first priority is to do acquisitions and invest in the business,” said David Meline, Amgen’s chief financial officer, in an interview with the Financial Times.But he added: “We see all of these deals announced, and we participate pretty actively in considering whether to bid, but we haven’t been able to come up with a business case that would make a return for our shareholders.“We will keep pushing ourselves and keep looking ourselves, because we have lots of financial flexibility.”He cautioned it would be difficult “as long as people are willing to pay levels above what we deem we can make a return on”.Mr Meline was talking before the recent market gyrations, which have sent valuations for biotech groups lower.Amgen’s stance runs counter to predictions of a deals frenzy from bankers and lawyers, who say they are working on more M&A leads than they have done in years.The company’s warnings on valuations carry additional weight because it is among the pharmaceutical companies with the most firepower to do big-ticket acquisitions.In a recent note to investors, Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Leerink, estimated that Amgen had as much as $70bn in dry powder that could be spent on M&A, including $27bn of available cash; the ability to easily raise $40bn on debt markets; and $3bn in retained free cash flow.Mr Porges suggested that Amgen would need to do a deal at some point, given that its product sales declined last year, while the launch of its new cholesterol drug Repatha has fallen short of Wall Street’s expectations.“Amgen’s growth outlook is not exciting, and the pressure on its legacy products is only going to increase.” said Mr Porges.He added: “We expect big things, which are most likely to be dilutive to margins and earnings near term, but to confer some growth and further diversification longer term.”"
11;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2018-02-01T21:42:50Z;Amgen Q4 earnings fall short of expectations;Additional costs related to Hurricane Maria weigh on result;Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company, reported fourth quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, sending shares in the group down more than 4 per cent in after-hours trading.The company, which specialises in biological drugs harvested from living cells, also announced a $10bn buyback, which it will fund with cash it is repatriating following Donald Trump’s tax reforms.The group posted adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share on revenues of $5.8bn for the quarter, whereas the consensus forecast was $3.03 and $5.85bn.David Meline, Amgen’s chief financial officer, attributed the earnings miss to additional costs related to recovering its plants in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.Mr Meline said the group also moved some discretionary expenses into the quarter for tax planning purposes. Those expenses would have otherwise fallen in 2018, he said.Amgen forecast revenues of between $21.8bn and $22.8bn for this year, below the consensus forecast of $22.9bn, which Mr Meline attributed to uncertainty over when its calcium-lowering drug Sensipar will face competition from cheaper generic rivals.The group said it expected adjusted earnings of between $12.60 and $13.70 per share in 2018 versus the consensus forecast of $12.73.Its tax rate will fall to 14-15 per cent in 2018 as a result of President Trump’s reforms versus expectations for 19 per cent.
12;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2018-01-24T05:03:09Z;Drugmakers ‘flush with cash’ and hunting for deals;January M&A surge prompts questions over valuations;For more than 36 years, pharma executives have descended on San Francisco in January for the JPMorgan healthcare conference, known as the Davos of the pharmaceuticals world, using the event as an opportunity to meet rivals and cook up deals.This year, the pace of those discussions was more frenetic than it has been for a decade, according to lawyers and bankers who attended the meeting — and many are predicting the tentative talks will morph into a bumper crop of mergers and acquisitions in 2018.“It’s as active a period as I can remember in many, many years, probably since before 2008,” says Mike Silver, a corporate lawyer at Hogan Lovells, who has been advising healthcare companies on deals for almost four decades.Large drugmakers are “flush with cash”, he says, and have a renewed sense of optimism following President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, which have made it cheaper to access billions of dollars of cash that was parked overseas.Mr Silver advised Celgene, the US biotech group, on its $9bn acquisition of cell therapy company Juno, which was announced earlier this week.“A lot pops up after the JPMorgan conference . . . and then gets announced a few weeks after. So you should expect more soon,” he says.This year has got off to the strongest start for healthcare and M&A since at least 2007: almost $30bn of deals have been announced since the start of January, according to Thomson Reuters.But executives at large drugmakers warn that over-exuberance — which has ruined many good parties — could dampen deal activity. Specifically, they say that valuations for the innovative biotech companies they would like to buy are too high.This opinion is supported by the data: buyers of healthcare companies have agreed to pay an average premium of 81 per cent, according to data provider Dealogic — well above the 42 per cent typically paid in 2017.“I think the smaller companies that have yet to generate sales or revenues are still very expensive relative to companies that have approved [drugs],” says Robert Bradway, chief executive of Amgen, the world’s largest biotech group.Mr Bradway’s company is expected to repatriate as much as $39bn in overseas cash, but he urges caution about splurging it on expensive deals — especially when potential target companies can secure higher valuations from private investors.“A large number of the venture-backed companies are able to attract capital at valuations in private financings that exceed what I would ascribe the M&A value to be,” he says.“The terms of trade for innovative companies is still relatively favourable,” he adds.Jeff Stute, co-head of global healthcare investment banking at JPMorgan, says many innovative biotechs that have gone public have had “strong stock performances” and that “whenever they’ve needed to raise capital the equity markets have been quite receptive”.“So there is no real pressure for any of these companies to sell,” he adds.Not all executives at large drugmakers agree that potential targets are too expensive.Michel Vounatsos, chief executive of Biogen, a large biotech company focused on neuroscience, says the valuations reflect what has been a “stellar” year for biology, citing advances in treating Huntington’s disease, migraine, multiple sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy.“At this stage, I don’t think valuations are too high,” he says. “We are screening different targets all the time, be they pre-clinical or small-to-mid-sized companies, and we did not reach the point of saying ‘no’ because of the valuation.”Some of these folks [small and mid-sized biotech groups] are in the business of building and selling companies, not selling medicinesSome industry executives say a buyer’s willingness to overpay depends in large part on how desperately they need to replenish their drug pipelines.Celgene, which has announced deals worth up to $16bn so far this year, is often identified as something of a “distressed buyer” given that it is barrelling towards a big patent cliff. Revlimid, its top cancer medicine, accounts for almost two-thirds of revenues, but will face competition from cheaper generic rivals from 2022 at the latest.The New Jersey-based group paid a premium of about 90 per cent for Juno, while its purchase of privately held Impact Biomedicines raised eyebrows given that its main asset, fedratinib, has had a checkered history.“There is a set of players that seems to be willing to pay very outsize valuations,” says one executive at a large pharma group. “A couple of deals Celgene has done seem to be quite expensive. It’s hard to believe they’re justifiable.”So why would small and mid-sized biotech groups sell themselves to Big Pharma if they are able to raise oodles of cash from private investors and public markets?One reason, say some executives and bankers, is that many such companies are good at discovering and developing medicines, but struggle when tasked with building sales forces to commercialise their products.“I suspect there are a few public companies today that have had to go to market with their medicines that didn’t necessarily anticipate having to market medicines,” says Darren Carroll, a senior vice-president at Eli Lilly, who acts as the company’s chief dealmaker.“Some of these folks are in the business of building and selling companies, not selling medicines.”Most smaller biotech companies are worth significantly more inside a Big Pharma structureMr Carroll declined to name the companies, although investors sometimes point to a trio of cancer biotechs — Tesaro, Clovis and Puma — as examples of single-product groups that are still independent despite being widely tipped as takeover targets.All three have brought their drugs to market independently, but there have been doubts about the strength of the respective launches, while their reliance on a single product has led to a choppy ride for shareholders in recent months.Mr Stute of JPMorgan argues that it often makes sense for smaller biotechs to sell to larger drugmakers.“Most smaller biotech companies are worth significantly more inside a Big Pharma structure, because they have . . . the sales and distribution capability that would be quite difficult and expensive for a biotech company to build from scratch.”Thomas Sheehan, head of healthcare investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says for the founders of smaller biotech companies — and the venture capitalists who have backed them from the start — it can be a tough call to decide when to sell.“You can either market the drug on your own or sell it,” he says.“The former is very challenging, but can be incredibly rewarding economically. The latter option can help you to bring your drug to market rapidly by leveraging the global capabilities of a large biotech or pharma company.”

The appeal court also reversed a decision that banned the companies from selling their medicine, known as Praluent.Shares in Amgen fell 1.6 per cent as investors digested the news that the company’s drug, Repatha, would not have the market to itself. Sanofi’s Paris-listed stock edged up by 0.6 per cent.Analysts had touted the new cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, as an alternative to the statins taken by millions of people to prevent heart attacks and strokes, which would have made them one of the most lucrative classes of medicines in years.But sales of the medicines have been sluggish since they were launched at the end of 2015, as healthcare systems and insurers have balked at the pricetag — $14,000 a year versus just a few cents a day for generic statins.
14;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2017-09-28T14:58:39Z;AbbVie makes peace with Amgen over Humira patents;;The legal clash between AbbVie and Amgen over Humira — one of the world’s top-grossing drugs — is finally over, sending both drugmakers’ shares higher.The companies said on Thursday that they had reached a global resolution ending all of their intellectual property-related litigation over the drug. As part of that, Chicago-based AbbVie will grant licenses to California-based Amgen to launch a copycat version of the blockbuster drug on a country-by-country basis.Amgen said it expects to launch a version called Amgevita in Europe on October 16, 2018, and in the US, where it will be sold under the name Amjevita, on January 31, 2023.AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, saw its shares up more than 6 per cent in Thursday morning trading. Amgen shares were also up 1 per cent.Amgen’s vice-president and general manager of biosimilars, Scott Foraker, said in a statement: “We look forward to leveraging our existing biologics capabilities to bring high-quality biosimilars to patients worldwide. Amgevita will be one of our first biosimilar launches, and this agreement will allow us to secure a strong foothold in the $4bn European adalimumab market.”AbbVie executive vice-president and general counsel Laura Schumacher said that in the agreement, the company “achieved the balance between protecting investment in innovation and providing access to biosimilars, which will play an important role in our healthcare system. We will continue to defend our intellectual property and to reinvest in further advancements in medicine to bring choices to patients in need.”Investors have been closely watching the fight over Humira, which raked in more than $16bn in global sales last year and accounted for 63 per cent of AbbVie’s total 2016 revenues, according to a regulatory filing.The anti-inflammatory treatment, approved to treat conditions from arthritis to Crohn’s disease, has enjoyed 15 years of market exclusivity so far and was one of the earliest approved “biologic” drugs — made by harvesting living cells, and therefore more difficult to replicate in a so-called “biosimilar.”Last year, a US Food and Drug Administration panel had recommended the approval of Amgen’s biosimilar.
15;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2017-07-25T21:14:02Z;Amgen tops sales estimates, raises earnings guidance;;Amgen’s second-quarter results came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts on Tuesday, prompting the drugmaker to boost its earnings-per-share guidance while tightening its full-year sales forecast range.The company said that revenue rose 2 per cent year-on-year to $5.8bn in the three months ending June 30, driven in part by growing sales for bone-drug Prolia, cholesterol treatment Repatha and cancer drug Kyprolis. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been looking for sales of $5.67bnSales for its best-selling drug by revenue, Enbrel, used to treat joint pain, dipped 1 per cent over the quarter to $1.4bn, but still came in ahead of the $1.3bn that analysts have been looking for.Net income in the quarter grew 15 per cent year-over-year to $2.15bn, or $2.91 a diluted share, versus expectations for $2.07bn in net income and earning per share of $2.77.Amgen boosted its full-year forecast for earning per share to $10.79 to $11.37, up from its earlier estimates for EPS in the range of $10.64 to $11.32. It also tightened its revenue forecast, looking now for sales between $22.5bn and $23bn, versus earlier estimates in the range of $22.3bn-$23.1bn.Amgen chief executive Robert Bradway said:“Our continued solid performance this quarter is yet another indication that we are on track to deliver on our long-term growth objectives. Our newer products are registering strong volume-driven growth globally and we expect their contribution to continue to increase over time, offsetting declines in mature products.”Amgen shares fell 2.6 per cent after hours. So far this year, its stock has risen more than 5 per cent.
16;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:00:06+0000;Safety risk for Amgen and UCB’s bone drug lifts rival Radius;Drugmaker’s shares plunge on fears osteoporosis medication will not win approval;A bone density drug being co-developed by Amgen, the US biotech, and UCB, the Belgian drugmaker, increased a patient’s chances of suffering serious heart problems during a late-stage trial, prompting fears that regulators will block the medicine.The safety concerns underscore the highly unpredictable nature of drug development, with many promising candidates failing the final stages of testing. Analysts had tipped the osteoporosis drug, Evenity, for blockbuster status with peak sales of €1.3bn a year before Amgen and UCB revealed the problem.Shares in UCB, which has a paucity of late-stage drugs in its pipeline, fell 14 per cent on Monday following the news, while Amgen’s stock lost 2.6 per cent in early trading. Evenity reduced the chances of a person developing fractures during the trial of 7,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. However, 2.5 per cent of patients suffered a serious cardiovascular event — such as a heart attack, angina episode or stroke — compared with 1.9 per cent of those taking a placebo. The finding took investors by surprise because the drug had already been tested in other large clinical trials without throwing up similar safety concerns, although some analysts noted that this study had been conducted on a more elderly group of patients. “The newly observed cardiovascular safety signal will have to be assessed as part of the overall benefit-risk profile for Evenity,” said Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen.The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every FridayIris Loew-Friedrich, chief medical officer at UCB, added: “We are working on understanding the observed cardiovascular safety signal and will continue to discuss these results with global regulators and experts in the field.”Analysts were downbeat on the chances of the drug being given the green light by regulators at the US Food and Drug Administration. “At best this points to a material delay in any approval and, at worst, it is not approvable,” said Andrew Baum from Citi. Geoffrey Porges from Leerink said he gave the drug a 50 per cent chance of winning approval. Investors interpreted the problems as a positive for Radius Health, a small Massachusetts-based biotech company that recently secured approval for Tymlos, a rival osteoporosis medicine. Analysts had expected sales of Tymlos to struggle against Evenity, because regulators asked that the drug label contain a “black box” warning due to an increased risk of some patients developing a bone cancer known as osteosarcoma. Shares of Radius Health jumped 14 per cent in early trading in New York, giving it a market value of roughly $1.7bn.
17;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:00:06+0000;Amgen shares fall after quarterly sales miss expectations;;Amgen on Wednesday reported first-quarter revenues that fell short of Wall Street expectations, sending shares in the biotech group down more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading.The company generated sales of $5.46bn versus analysts’ estimate of $5.61bn, although it beat forecasts for adjusted earnings per share, which were $3.15 compared to the consensus expectation of $2.99.Sales of Repatha, a new cholesterol medicine, were particularly weak. The medicine generated revenues of $49m in the quarter, whereas analysts had typically penciled in $74m.The launch of the $14,000-a-year drug had been tipped for blockbuster status with sales in excess of $4bn a year. However, the medicine has been bedeviled by the publication of a large long-term trial that showed it had prevented heart attacks and strokes but not the overall number of deaths.Amgen has since offered to refund the price of the drug if a patient has a stroke or heart attack while taking the medicine.“We are working with payers to improve access to this important therapy for patients at risk for heart attacks and strokes,” said chief executive Robert Bradway.
18;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2017-03-17T13:04:10Z;Amgen to refund cholesterol drug if patients suffer heart attack;Pledge aims to convince insurers to pay for $14,000-a-year medicine ;Amgen said it would offer a refund if patients had a stroke or heart attack while taking its cholesterol-lowering medicine, as the US biotechnology group tries to convince cash-strapped healthcare systems to pay for the expensive new drug. The pledge is the latest instance of a drugmaker offering to reimburse health insurers or governments if a drug is less effective than promised, in an effort to retain premium prices for medicines at a time when those footing the bill are driving a much harder bargain. Amgen made the guarantee as it unveiled a study of the drug in 27,500 patients that demonstrated the medicine, Repatha, could reduce the chances of a patient suffering from a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack, stroke, or hospitalisation for angina.However, the results of the study fell short of expectations. The trial found that adding the medicine to a statin resulted in a 15 per cent reduction in the risk of patients suffering a cardiovascular event, versus the more than 20 per cent in risk reduction that some analysts and investors had expected. Repatha is part of a new class of medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors that can dramatically reduce levels of LDL or “bad cholesterol”, which has been identified as one of the leading causes of heart diseases. Sanofi and Regeneron make a similar medicine called Praluent. Shares in Amgen fell by 6 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.The drug was launched in 2015 and is approved for patients deemed to be at a high risk of suffering a cardiovascular event because, for instance, they have previously had a stroke or heart attack.There are roughly 10m people in the US who still have dangerously high levels of cholesterol despite taking a statin, according to Amgen. However, health insurers have baulked at a price tag of as much as $14,000 a year for the medicine, which is intended to be taken for life, against just a few cents a day for a generic statin. Earlier this year, Amgen said that about three-quarters of prescriptions for Repatha were being rejected by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. Amgen’s executives hope insurers will be more willing to pay for the drug now that it has published this large study, showing the drug actually reduces heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, rather than just lowering LDL cholesterol. The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every Friday“Now that Repatha has proven a meaningful reduction in cardiovascular events, we expect payers to remove onerous barriers and help appropriate patients get access to Repatha,” said Joshua Ofman, a senior vice-president at Amgen. However, Salim Syed, analyst at Mizuho, said he thought the minimum level of risk reduction would need to be about 20 per cent for insurers to start reimbursing the drug more widely, and said the number “could be higher” still.Brian Skorney, analyst at Baird, said most investors were expecting the risk reduction to be in the range of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. Elliot Levy, senior vice-president at Amgen, pointed out the drug had performed better on a different measure, which looked at risk reduction of “hard” cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes while excluding hospitalisations for angina and a procedure known as a coronary revascularisation. On this measure the reduction in risk was 20 per cent. “These are the most important and relevant cardiovascular events because they cause a lasting effect on life,” said Dr Levy. 
19;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;Amgen rises after reporting upbeat results from cholesterol drug trial;;Amgen said a large clinical trial of its new cholesterol-lowering drug showed that the medicine “significantly reduced” the risk of patients dying from heart disease, having a stroke or suffering from a “cardiovascular event”.Shares in the biotech company jumped by more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading in New York.The drug, Repatha, was tested over three* years in 27,500 patients to see if it would reduce the long-term risk of patients suffering from deadly cardiovascular events like heart attacks, rather than simply reducing LDL or “bad” cholesterol.Analysts have touted the new cholesterol-lowering drug, a so-called PCSK9 inhibitor, as an alternative to the statins taken by millions of people to prevent heart attacks and strokes, which would make it one of the most lucrative medicines in years.Sales of PCSK9 inhibitors have been sluggish since they were launched at the end of 2015, as healthcare systems and insurers have balked at the price tag — $14,000 a year versus just a few cents a day for generic statins.But analysts expect US sales of Repatha to surge to about $4bn a year if the long-term studies show they can significantly reduce the chances of patients suffering a deadly cardiovascular event.Amgen did not give details on the scale of the benefits from taking the drug, which will remain under wraps until next month when the full study is unveiled at a medical meeting.Dr Walid Gellad, a physician and academic, said that simply hitting the trial targets was “not enough given [the] cost” and that the full study would have to demonstrate a “big improvement” when published.“These results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimised statin therapy,” said Dr Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen.“Cardiovascular disease remains the number one health burden in the world, and we look forward to sharing these outcomes data with the scientific community.”*This post has been amended to correct the length of the trial.
20;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2017-01-12T16:56:01Z;Sanofi confident it can overturn Praluent patent ruling;French drugmaker faces questions over how to offset declining Lantus revenues;Under pressure to deliver a new blockbuster medicine, Sanofi, France’s biggest drugmaker, bet big on a new class of cholesterol-lowering products with its Praluent treatment.Last week it was dealt a harsh blow after the drug was ordered off US shelves in a patent dispute with rival Amgen. Now Olivier Brandicourt, Sanofi’s chief executive, is facing questions over how he can plug the revenue gap left by the sure and steady decline in sales of its best-selling insulin medicine, Lantus.Mr Brandicourt is confident that the injunction announced last week can be overturned. He also argues it is in the “public interest” that Praluent remains on the market and questions Amgen’s approach to the litigation given the risk of uncertainty for the 18,000 US patients taking the drug.District Judge Sue Robinson ruled that Sanofi and Regeneron, which helped develop Praluent, were infringing patents held by Amgen, which makes a competing drug, Repatha. Sanofi and its US partner were given 30 days to stop selling Praluent in the US, although this was extended to 45 days in a hearing this week.Both drugmakers are appealing against the decision and Mr Brandicourt says they have a “fair chance of winning”.“The judge herself may not have given the full scope of what we wanted to bring to the party and to the jury members, and in our defence I feel we have been a little short changed,” Mr Brandicourt told the Financial Times at the JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco this week.In a market where US president-elect Donald Trump has said pharmaceutical companies are “getting away with murder” over pricing, Mr Brandicourt will find it even harder to make up lost revenue if Sanofi and Regeneron lose their appeal.Analysts at Bernstein had expected Praluent revenues to reach $2.3bn by 2025, making it Sanofi’s biggest medicine by sales.Mr Brandicourt says that withdrawing Praluent from the US is akin to having allowed a single statin to have a monopoly when the drugs were first used in the 1980s, as he says Amgen’s Repatha will be the only drug of its class available in the US.The market for PCSK9 inhibitors could be worth up to $6bn a year at peak, according to analysts. The medicines block a type of protein that reduces the liver’s ability to release LDL or “bad” cholesterol, which is identified as a major cause of heart disease.While it is estimated that as many as a third of US adults take statins, roughly a fifth do not respond well to the treatment and continue to register high levels of cholesterol.Insurers in the US have been reluctant to pay for PCSK9 inhibitors since their launch in 2015, after balking at a price tag as high as $14,000 a year versus a few cents a day for statins.Analysts say, however, that insurers will have to drastically expand access to the medicines if soon-to-be-published research shows they reduce heart attacks and strokes, rather than simply lower cholesterol.Amgen executives told investors in San Francisco this week that about three-quarters of prescriptions for its Repatha were being rejected by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The company says it will net about $250m of sales from Repatha in 2016, but the drug would have generated $1bn in revenues if all prescriptions were authorised.Without the potential windfall from Praluent, Mr Brandicourt could struggle to offset declining revenues from Lantus, which had sales of more than $6bn in 2015, and which is being is being challenged by a cheaper “biosimilar” alternative made by Eli Lilly.However, Lantus is a biologic drug harvested from living cells — meaning it is not possible for a generic manufacturer to produce a carbon copy as they can with a pill — so rivals must instead produce a “biosimilar” version that has the same effect. But being relatively new, biosimilars are being used with caution, resulting in a less rapid switch from branded medicines.Mr Brandicourt says Lantus is not facing a “patent cliff”, but rather a long and gradual decline that he describes as a “patent hill”. Goldman Sachs estimates sales will fall to roughly $2.9bn a year in 2020.

Amgen, which makes the only rival drug, Repatha, gained 3 per cent.Sanofi and Regeneron have 30 days to appeal against the verdict or to come to some kind of commercial arrangement with Amgen, which would most likely involve paying a royalty to their rival.However, a statement from Amgen suggested the company was unwilling to do a deal with the competing drugmakers. “Protecting intellectual property is essential to our industry as it reinforces the incentives for the large and risky investments we make,” said Robert Bradway, Amgen’s chief executive.Amgen said it had the “ability to supply” everyone being prescribed Praluent and that it would “work to ensure a smooth transition for patients who wish to switch”.Regeneron said it would “immediately appeal” against the decision and said the “best interests of patients will be greatly disserved” by the ruling.Amgen now has a monopoly in the US market. The California-based biotech company has a reputation for fiercely protecting its intellectual property and is disparagingly known as a “law firm with fermenters attached” for what some rivals see as a strategy of putting patent disputes before its core business of making drugs.The decision surprised analysts, who were divided on whether Regeneron and Sanofi’s drug will be permanently banned in the US.“Regeneron may appeal or negotiate with Amgen in the meantime, though we think neither are likely to be successful,” said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies.However, Geoff Meacham of Barclays said: “We continue to maintain that this case is far from over and will probably take a few years to play out in appeals.”Ronny Gal, analyst at Bernstein, said: “We have been asked by investors if Amgen would ‘dare’ to force Praluent off the market — we think they certainly would.”Praluent and Repatha block a protein known as PCSK9, which reduces the liver’s ability to release the LDL or “bad” cholesterol that is identified as a major cause of heart disease.PCSK9 inhibitors are not intended to fully replace statins, the main defence against heart disease since the 1990s, but there is a sizeable number of patients who find statins intolerable or who need additional cholesterol reduction.

24;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2016-07-14T08:48:58Z;Biosimilars set to compete with two of world’s biggest drug franchises;Makers of medicines with $22bn sales a year expected to fight hard to delay rivals’ introduction;The world’s top grossing drug, Humira, generated $14bn in global sales last year for AbbVie, the Chicago-based pharmaceuticals group that owns the medicine.The anti-inflammatory treatment, used for conditions from arthritis to Crohn’s disease, has enjoyed 14 years of market exclusivity, unburdened by the kind of copycat medicines that tend to push drugmakers over the patent cliff.Now AbbVie must contemplate the end of the party, after advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration recommended this week that the drug regulator approve a copycat version of the medicine.Analysts say the agency is all but certain to rubber-stamp their recommendation in September.The FDA’s advisers recommended the agency also approve a knock-off rival to Amgen’s Enbrel, another anti-inflammatory, which was first approved in 1998 and generated revenues of $8.7bn last year.Many patients will ask why it has taken so long for a competitor to launch a cheaper version of Humira, which costs roughly $4,000 for two injections, or Enbrel, which is priced at $3,800 for a pack of four shots.The medicines have benefited from their status as two of the earliest “biologic” drugs, which are made by harvesting living cells rather than producing chemical pills.The very nature of biologic medicines means it is impossible to create an exact replica, as happens when a generic drugmaker produces a knock-off tablet. Instead, competing companies must try to manufacture a drug that is virtually the same — a so-called biosimilar.The introduction of biosimilars in the US has been hampered by years of wrangling among drugmakers, politicians and regulators, but the decision by the FDA’s advisers on Humira and Enbrel copycats this week has been hailed as an important step in speeding up their introduction.The regulator has given the green light to a couple of biosimilars before, although those were in part seen as test cases, while its European counterpart has been much more aggressive in approving the medicines.But this week’s events in the US threaten for the first time to topple two of the world’s biggest drug franchises, which together account for more than $22bn in annual sales.“The agency is getting the hang of this,” says Ronny Gal, an analyst at Bernstein. “This is the start of the path forward for Humira biosimilars.”Analysts note that the FDA advisers recommended approval for the Humira and Enbrel copycats not just for arthritis, but for all the illnesses treated by the originals — a process known as “indication extrapolation”.Some biologic drugmakers had argued that approvals should be limited to one illness at a time, meaning biosimilar companies could only chip away at drugs such as Humira, rather than competing head on.One issue that has yet to be resolved, though, is whether pharmacists can dispense a biosimilar to a patient if their doctor has written the brand name — Humira — on the prescription, rather than the generic Adalimumab.Biologic patent expiries likely won’t present as large of a threat to sales as [chemical] drugsSome drugmakers have lobbied against such “substitutability” — even though pharmacists regularly do this with chemical pills — claiming that biosimilars might not be as safe as the original drug and that doctors’ wishes should be respected.Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, says the tactics are exactly the same ones used to try to hinder the introduction of generic drugs in the 1980s. “It’s déjà vu — the brands said generics are unsafe, that they were made in a bathtub, blah, blah, but now generics account for 88 per cent of all US prescriptions.”Regulatory approval is of course important, but most in the pharmaceuticals industry expect the introduction of a Humira biosimilar to be delayed by years of courtroom battles.AbbVie has said it can stave off a rival until 2022, having built a wall of more than 70 patents around Humira, governing areas from how it is manufactured to the auto-injector used to deliver the medicine.Once biosimilars gain traction the biggest beneficiaries will be patients and taxpayers. Their introduction is expected to slash US spending on biologic medicines by $44bn over the next decade, according to the Rand Corporation, an independent think-tank.But others say biosimilars will struggle, as the makers of branded drugs fight tooth and nail to delay their introduction. “Biologic patent expiries likely won’t present as large of a threat to sales as [chemical] drugs,” says Bob Kirby of Fitch, the rating agency. He says branded drugmakers will have to contend with a “patent slope”, rather than a cliff.There is also disagreement among executives over how much cheaper biosimilars will be, with discount estimates ranging from a third to 75 per cent. Either way, they will not offer the same sort of savings as traditional generic drugs.Nor is it clear which companies will benefit from the advent of biosimilars, which are much harder to manufacture than simple chemical pills. The drugs are cultivated in huge fermenters located in highly regulated factories, an expensive endeavour that could prove a barrier to the kind of low-cost entrants that have pushed down the price of pills.Ironically, it is the biggest branded drug companies that are using their knowledge and equipment to produce biosimilars.Amgen, for instance, is trying to launch the first biosimilar of Humira, while simultaneously fighting the introduction of a copycat version of its drug, Enbrel, by Novartis, the Swiss pharma group.And many of the best-known companies are dabbling in biosimilars to hedge their bets, including Pfizer, Merck of the US and Biogen, as big pharma seeks to occupy the role not just of gamekeeper — but poacher too.There are sure to be countless legal battles as drugmakers fight to prevent the introduction of new biosimilars, but few will end up in the US Supreme Court.Yet the highest court in the US is considering whether to take up the closely watched case of Amgen versus Sandoz, and its decision could have big ramifications for the adoption of biosimilars.Sandoz, a division of Novartis, makes a biosimilar version of Amgen’s drug Neupogen, which is used to boost white blood cell production in cancer patients.The case hinges on the 180-day notice period that biosimilar makers such as Sandoz are required to give to branded makers such as Amgen before they launch the copycat product.The Federal Circuit ruled that Sandoz could only fire the starting gun on the waiting period after it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration — in effect granting Amgen a further six months of market exclusivity.Sandoz is appealing against the decision to the Supreme Court, which has not yet decided whether to hear the case.Six months might not sound like a lot of time when one considers that biologic drugs already enjoy 12 years of exclusivity. But Scott Cunning, an intellectual property partner in corporate law firm Haynes and Boone, says it is more important than it might seem.“When you’re talking about franchises that are worth billions of dollars, six months can be lucrative,” he says.“It also gives them the time to get their ducks in a row so that they have their patent challenges lined up.”

And Amgen on Wednesday revealed promising results for its contender.Amgen, one of the four large cap biotech groups, released trial data showing that its drug Erenumab reduced the number of migraine days in patients who suffer from them chronically, according to data from a mid-stage clinical trial, writes David Crow in New York.Patients enrolled in the study experienced roughly 18 migraine days a month, but after 12 weeks on Amgen’s drug that number fell to an average of 11.4, a reduction of 6.6 days.Those patients taking a placebo also experienced a reduction in migraine days of 4.2 on average.“Migraine is the sixth leading cause of disability worldwide. Three to seven million Americans spend more than half of each month living with the debilitating symptoms of chronic migraine,” said Dr Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen.Indeed, analysts are predicting peak annual sales in excess of $10bn for this class of medicines, which suppress a chemical known as calcitonin gene-related peptide or CGRP.Amgen is also testing the drug in a larger trial on patients who experience migraines more occasionally.
26;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2016-04-18T13:13:13Z;Lowering risk of a heart attack for those who cannot take statins;Trial of Repatha indicates it has fewer side effects than usual medication;"After decades of big trials on both sides of the Atlantic, there is convincing
evidence that taking statins reduces the chance of heart attacks and strokes, even among those who are less at risk.There has been less agreement, however, over people who suffer severe side effects from statins, such as muscle pain.This group is estimated at about 5 to 10 per cent of statin users. This might sound small but when you consider that 6m people in the UK and 25m in the US take statins, the group of patients who, it seems, can’t tolerate the drugs is numerically fairly large. Some doctors have even suggested that the muscle pains these people reported were psychosomatic in nature.However, a study presented this month at the American College of Cardiology convention in Chicago may finally put the psychosomatic argument to rest and offer a solution to the many thousands who cannot tolerate statins.A new class of drugs, called PCSK9 inhibitors, was approved last year in the
US and Europe. Until this study, however, it was not apparent whether the drug, called evolocumab, would prove as effective as statins.The study was led by Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, and had clear results.First, the researchers gave patients who had failed to tolerate some statins a test to determine whether their imagination was to blame by offering statins or a sugar pill without knowing which was which. Some 43 per cent of the patients given the statins reported intolerable muscle pain, while only 27 per cent of those given the placebo did, confirming that the condition is real.Second, after 24 weeks on evolocumab, which is marketed by Amgen under the brand name Repatha, patients saw their levels of LDL cholesterol — the
so-called bad cholesterol that increases the risk of heart attacks — reduced by more than half, without the usual side effects.Daniel Rader, a professor of medicine and an expert on blood cholesterol at
the University of Pennsylvania, who was not part of the trial, says Repatha works by blocking PCSK9, a protein produced in the liver that increases LDL cholesterol.He said that people born without the gene variant that produces PCSK9 have low cholesterol and little risk of a heart attack, a fact that inspired the search for PCSK9 inhibitors.Still, evolocumab is likely to be controversial for some time, primarily because of its cost: $14,000 a year in the US. Last year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in Britain recommended that doctors should not use Repatha, but the NHS says it is likely to revise its recommendation this year. Without Nice support, the NHS will not provide the drug.While Repatha was very effective in lowering bad cholesterol, large clinical trials to determine whether the drug reduces heart attacks and strokes will not be completed for a year or more, though preliminary results have been good, it has been reported.Pascal Meier, a cardiologist at University College London Hospitals and in Geneva, says those results will be key to how widely Repatha is used.“I would like to have more data on its clinical effectiveness,” he says. “But I now definitely have a lower threshold for prescribing Repatha because it is very effective at lowering LDL levels and doesn’t have any side effects.”fitexecutive@ft.com"
27;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2016-03-06T21:23:23Z;Gene study points to pharma breakthroughs;Belgian group discovers bone-rebuilding treatment in South Africa;An osteoporosis drug that was discovered by researching a community in South Africa with abnormally dense bones has shown how rare genetic traits can provide clues about how to treat more common conditions.UCB, the Belgian pharmaceuticals group, says that its medicine, called romosozumab, is the first capable of rebuilding weakened bones.It works by mimicking the action of a bone-thickening gene linked to a rare hereditary disease called sclerosteosis, which is unusually prevalent among Afrikaners in South Africa.Jean-Christophe Tellier, UCB chief executive, said that the drug, co-developed with Amgen of the US, was on course to be filed for US regulatory approval this year, subject to discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration.Analysts have forecast peak annual sales of up to €2.7bn for romosozumab, making it important to the growth prospects of both UCB and Amgen, which would each be entitled to half the revenues.Trial results published last month showed a 73 per cent reduction in risk of vertebral fracture among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who took romosozumab for a year, compared with others who received a placebo.Another study last year found that the drug increased bone strength in the spine of women by 27 per cent.Not all the data has been positive. Investors were disappointed that last month’s results failed to show reduction in non-vertebral fractures.Peter Verdult, analyst at Citigroup, said this had “significantly impaired” the drug’s commercial potential in the absence of further supportive evidence.However, Mr Tellier said that he hoped a more detailed presentation of the findings later this year, as well as data due from additional studies, would strengthen the case for the drug.In a briefing with reporters, he voiced confidence that romosozumab would save money for health systems by reducing bone fractures among people with osteoporosis. “I think the value proposition will be very compelling.”Harnessing the electronic signals of the human nervous system to treat diseases has been described as the next great frontier in medical science. Andrew Ward discusses the possiblities and risks with Clive Cookson, FT science editor.About one in three women and one in five men over the age of 50 will suffer a fracture because of the bone-weakening condition, according to the International Osteoporosis Foundation.Romosozumab was discovered by Celltech, the UK biotech company acquired by UCB for £1.5bn in 2004, working with South African scientists investigating how sclerosteosis had been passed down generations of Afrikaners from a tiny number of Dutch migrants in the 17th century.People with sclerosteosis were found to have a gene which blocks a protein that inhibits bone growth. This protein, called sclerostin, was used to develop romosozumab.Researchers have become increasingly interested in the genetic make-up of people with unusual characteristics, including attributes such as exceptional longevity, to help develop new drugs.Other examples include a 2006 study of three Pakistani families with an extraordinary capacity to tolerate pain. Scientists had been alerted by a 10-year-old street performer in Lahore who was able to cut himself with knives and walk on burning coals.It was discovered that he and his relatives all had defects in a gene involved in the transmission of signals through the nerves and it is hoped that this could lead to new pain treatments.

Investors have shied away from allocating money to the sector, with caution driven by worries stemming from predictions of lower global growth and falling commodity prices.The first euro-denominated bond to be sold by a Chinese issuer this year was priced on Wednesday by Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, a maker of surveillance cameras, and several US companies have given investment banks mandates to begin the process of raising debt.These include Amgen, the pharmaceuticals company, US aerospace manufacturer United Technologies and LyondellBasell Industries — a US-listed chemicals company with European roots.Wednesday’s deal follows the launch on Tuesday of an inaugural bond from easyJet, the UK low-cost airline, which was nine times subscribed.“In theory this shouldn’t be a market for debuts but this deal went incredibly well,” said Marco Baldini, head of the European corporate syndicate desk at Barclays. “EasyJet has been the highlight of the week.”Foreign borrowers raising money in euro markets were a big theme last year as non-European companies rushed to take advantage of the low rates brought on by quantitative easing in Europe and to hedge against the falling value of the euro.“The coupons on offer are still significantly lower in Europe than the dollar market, even if the spread has widened for some US issuers,” said Mr Baldini. “So [issuing in Europe] can help them navigate the volatility and absorb some of the widening.”Last year US companies were the largest issuers by value, accounting for 20 per cent of the total, according to Dealogic. Chinese corporate issuance in euros increased more than fivefold, with €8.9bn sold, up from €1.72bn the previous year.Bankers suggested the lack of issuance in Europe was a result of companies sitting on large cash piles and having already taken advantage of low interest rates to extend the maturity of their debt — with opportunistic borrowers staying away.“The lack of euro corporate deals this year is due to a lack of supply, not a lack of demand,” said Frazer Ross, a managing director on the debt syndicate desk at Deutsche Bank.With few borrowers willing to risk a failed deal when they are not desperate for funding, the market drought had become self-sustaining, he said.“People are frustrated at the lack of activity and want to invest. They have cash and want to put it to work.”
29;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2016-02-01T15:06:49Z;US borrowers wake up euro debt markets;;It’s alive…European corporate debt markets are starting to warm up after one of the quietest starts to the year on record.US issuers are once more coming to the euro markets. Aerospace manufacturer United Technologies, biochemical company Amgen and industrial conglomerate Honeywell are currently marketing bonds to investors, according to people familiar with the matter.Known as reverse Yankees, these deals were a big theme last year. US issuers were the largest sellers of euro-denominated bonds by company domicile, writes Gavin Jackson.Honeywell will be meeting investors this week while Amgen and United Technologies will be marketing the following week with the bonds expected shortly after.The quantitative easing program launched by the European Central Bank last year held down interest rates on euro debt as well as leading the currency to slide in value against the dollar, so big companies crossed the Atlantic to take advantage of cheap debt and to match their European revenues with interest payments in the same currency.Now, with a difficult January out of the way and a couple days of improved performance in equity markets — partly due to the surprise announcement of further easing by the Bank of Japan — bankers say that investors are feeling more bullish and positive about new offerings, meaning that companies are likely to get more favourable prices.UK-based low-cost airline EasyJet is also expected to come to market with its first ever bond this Tuesday after successful investor meetings last month. The deal is expected to be a €500m seven-year offering, according to people familiar with the matter.Investors had a paucity of deals in January and so have large amounts of cash to put to work, according to one portfolio manager. With very little new supply, outstanding bonds have seen large increases in price, encouraging bankers to bring deals to market, the investor said. Still, he added that it is “relatively quiet compared to what it could be.”
30;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2016-01-18T16:46:32Z;Pharma sell-off threatens to stifle appetite for IPOs;Cautious sentiment risks cutting off funding for smaller biotechs;After months of battling a public outcry over high drug prices, the pharmaceuticals and biotech industry had hoped that its annual gathering in San Francisco last week would provide an opportunity to start the year on a positive note.The JPMorgan Healthcare Conference is the largest event of its kind, providing a forum for companies to trumpet their prospects, and for healthcare bankers to cook up deals.Shire, the Anglo-Irish drugmaker, kicked off proceedings by announcing its long-awaited $32bn takeover of US-based Baxalta on Monday. But investors reacted to the proposed deal by promptly sending shares in both companies tumbling, adding to a growing sense that appetite for large deals is waning.There was little else on offer to convince investors to start buying again after the recent sector sell-off. The Nasdaq biotech index finished last week down roughly 6 per cent, compared with a fall of about 2 per cent for the S&P 500.Celgene, one of four large-cap biotech groups, added to the gloom by cutting its profit forecast for 2015 and predicting that revenues this year would be below analyst expectations. Robert Hugin, chief executive since 2010, also spooked some investors by announcing that he is to stand down in March and become chairman.Industry executives argue that investors are missing the bigger picture: biopharma companies are discovering more drugs than they have in years, such as cancer immunotherapies that are producing some remarkable results in tumours which have hitherto been untreatable.They also point to other potentially huge advances: if solanezumab, an Alzheimer’s drug being developed by Eli Lilly, is successful when data from a large trial are published later this year, it would be the first medicine proven to delay the onset of the disease.Investors remain wary, however. Just over a third say they believe solanezumab will work, according to a survey by Evercore ISI, the investment bank. And, at any rate, the data are not due until the fourth quarter — which seems like a long time when stock markets are so volatile.Usually the JPMorgan conference is the time to tee up fundraisings, and I think that this week has probably shaken some organisationsAs investors scurried around the conference halls of Westin St Francis hotel, nervously checking the sea of red on their smartphone stocks apps, bankers and lawyers tried to put a positive gloss on tumbling valuations. They say that the recent market sell-off could spark a fresh wave of deals as acquisitive companies go bargain hunting.Last year was a record for healthcare deals, with much of the activity being driven by a group of drugmakers loosely known as “specialty pharma”, which typically increase profits and sales through acquisitions rather than discovering their own drugs.That is unlikely to be the case in 2016. Allergan, the largest specialty pharma group, has said it will refrain from large deals ahead of its takeover by Pfizer. Valeant, the beleaguered Canadian drugmaker, has pledged to abstain from acquisitions so it can pay down a $31bn net debt position that is making its investors nervous.Instead, bankers expect large, cash-rich biotechs to drive dealmaking, such as Gilead and Amgen, which recently told the Financial Times they were actively seeking acquisitions.However, David Hallal, chief executive of Alexion, a rare diseases specialist, says it will take time for directors of smaller biotech companies to accept that they are worth considerably less than they were in the summer.“Capitulation doesn’t just happen all of a sudden, especially when you juxtapose today’s valuations with where you were just a month or two ago,” says Mr Hallal.Some cash-rich companies will have the luxury of waiting for stock markets to improve, but there are many smaller groups that had hoped to raise funds from investors in the early part of this year through initial public offerings. Others had planned to return for a second or third follow-on financing.“Where the pressure is going to be is on those who are thinking about coming out with their IPO and then all the secondaries,” says Mr Hallal. “Usually the JPMorgan conference is the time to tee up fundraisings, and I think that this week has probably shaken some organisations.”The head of healthcare at one large investment bank said the week would prove crucial for companies considering raising capital. Editas Medicine, a group focused on modifying genetic defects that cause diseases, will test the markets with its IPO, as will BeiGene, a Chinese biotech in the field of cancer.The banker, who is not involved in either fundraising, predicted the companies would complete their listings due to strong support from their existing shareholders, but said if their stock prices subsequently tumbled it could prevent others from following suit.If IPO markets do freeze up, it would leave some cash-strapped companies with little option but to sell at a knockdown price. Many companies are ready to pounce, such as Horizon Pharma, an acquisitive group that is trying to turn itself into a rare diseases specialist.“I think you’re going to see a trend, depending on the next few months, of people being scared about the IPO markets and not being able to access them,” says Timothy Walbert, chief executive of Horizon.“When we do start seeing an increase in trading in private companies, we will have the ability with our cash balance to be active.”A panel of experts appointed by the US Food and Drug Administration is set to recommend on Friday whether or not the medicines watchdog should approve a new drug for a rare and deadly childhood disease.There is no treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inherited disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness in boys, leading to paralysis in early infancy, and cardiac and respiratory problems during a sufferer’s teenage years. Most patients die in their twenties.Sarepta Therapeutics, a tiny biotech group, is hoping to secure the first approval for a DMD drug, but a negative briefing document published by the FDA on Friday does not bode well. Shares in the group fell 55 per cent following its release.If the FDA rejects the drug, it will be the second time it has rejected approval for a treatment for DMD this year. Last week, it refused to approve a similar treatment made by BioMarin, a rare diseases specialist.The knock-back was an embarrassment for BioMarin, which took a big gamble by buying the drug’s maker, Prosensa, for $680m last year, even though the medicine had failed in late-stage clinical trials and lost the backing of its big partner, GlaxoSmithKline.PTC Therapeutics has also applied for approval for its DMD medication, even though the medicine failed to hit its primary target during a clinical trial last year. The drug is conditionally approved in Europe, pending the results of further trials.The failure of all three drugs, which have secured billions of dollars in investment, would underline the sometimes risky endeavour of developing medicines for rare diseases.Because the number of people suffering from a rare disease is by definition so small, it can be hard to design clinical trials that show a clear benefit — even though the cost of the medicines often runs to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for each patient.A highly organised group of parents who have campaigned for the medicines to be approved fear that if the FDA rejects the drugs, its decision will discourage drugmakers from pursuing other potential treatments for the disease.
31;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Big pharma joins forces to tackle cancer;GSK, Amgen and Celgene among groups teaming up for Cancer Moonshot 2020 to trial experimental drugs;Some of the biggest makers of cancer drugs are joining an alliance to speed up the discovery of new treatments for the disease, with the aim of testing scores of experimental and approved medicines on 20,000 patients within the next four years.GlaxoSmithKline, Amgen and Celgene have signed up to the Cancer Moonshot 2020 initiative spearheaded by Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, the founder of Nantworks who became a billionaire by inventing a type of chemotherapy known as Abraxane.The alliance — which includes some of the biggest academic cancer centres in the US — aims to accelerate the development of so-called immunotherapies, which try to encourage the body’s immune system to attack cancerous tumours.Doctors have hailed recently launched immunotherapies as one of the biggest developments in the battle against cancer in years, following some remarkable successes in patients suffering from skin, lung and blood cancers.But the drugs still only benefit a minority of sufferers, and many scientists and doctors say the real breakthrough will come from combining multiple immunotherapy drugs — often made by different pharmaceutical companies — into “cocktails” tailored to individual patients.Drug groups participating in the initiative will make more than 60 experimental and approved immunotherapy medicines available to other companies and to scientific researchers, allowing different combinations to be tested on 20,000 patients by 2020.The initiative comes as drug companies are already engaging in an unprecedented level of collaboration in an effort to unearth new combinations, although many of these partnerships are governed by commercial considerations as much as scientific theory.Dr Soon-Shiong told the Financial Times that the initiative aimed to create a “more rapid way of testing lots of combinations [of drugs] and quickly moving to large, late-stage clinical trials”, adding that the experiment would be open to patients with all types of cancers regardless of the stage of their disease.We have learnt that the research and development of breakthrough treatments for patients requires novel approaches, bold science, strong vision and broad collaborationDr Manuel Hidalgo of the Harvard Medical School, which is participating in the collaboration, said the full potential of immunotherapies would be realised by combining several medicines. “Doing combination studies is currently complicated by access to drugs and regulatory issues,” he said.Dr Hidalgo added that existing collaborations focused on just two to three products and were structured with the intention of getting a drug approved. “Here the goal is to make the perfect cocktail with access to all the required compounds, and to be able to do that in a safe, rapid and informative manner,” he said.Robert Hugin, chief executive of Celgene, a cancer-focused biotech group that has scores of partnerships with other companies, said he was “fully committed” to the initiative.Mr Hugin added: “We have learnt that the research and development of breakthrough treatments for patients requires novel approaches, bold science, strong vision and broad collaboration with partners across the healthcare ecosystem.”However, some of the biggest names in immunotherapy were notable by their absence from the alliance. Bristol-Myers Squibb and US-based Merck, which make the only approved immunotherapies, have not yet joined the initiative, and neither have those companies that hope to launch the next batch, such as AstraZeneca and Roche.Dr Soon-Shiong said their absence was down to “pure logistics” and the determination to announce the initiative at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, the industry’s biggest annual gathering, which is taking place in San Francisco this week. He said he hoped more companies would join the alliance.Some other details remain fuzzy, such as who would foot the bill for the initiative. Although the participating drug companies have agreed to make their medicines available to the project pro bono, the cost of carrying out clinical trials is very expensive.A spokesperson for Dr Soon-Shiong said pharmaceutical companies would be asked to pay for trials that were “important” to their businesses, while the US government-funded National Cancer Institute would finance some other studies.Dr Hidalgo said, however, that the subject of funding was “not clear to me yet”, adding that it would probably fall to big pharmaceuticals groups. An executive at one of the companies involved in the initiative said such details were still being worked out.Before entering the trials, patients will undergo genetic testing by Dr Soon-Shiong’s company, Nantworks, to determine which drugs they are most likely to benefit from. Independence Blue Cross, a health insurer that covers 10m people, has agreed to pay for patients to have their entire genome sequenced by Nantworks — the first time a commercial insurer has agreed to cover the procedure. Sequencing an entire human genome costs several thousand dollars.

A Pfizer acquisition of Allergan would be bigger than both those deals and all others since.“It is the perfect storm,” Philipp Gutzwiller, chief healthcare banker for Lloyds Banking Group said at a Financial Times conference last week. “Pharma companies can do deals because there are willing sellers, supportive shareholders . . . and a benign financing environment.”There have been many different types of deals. Allergan’s $40.5bn sale of its generic drugs unit to Teva of Israel reflected consolidation in the lowest-margin part of the industry. AbbVie’s $21bn swoop for Pharmacyclics was the biggest in a wave of bolt-on biotech acquisitions to reinforce innovation.However, a Pfizer-Allergan tie-up, would be the first full-scale combination between two top-20 pharma groups since Pfizer bought Wyeth and Merck acquired Schering-Plough in 2009.Could it spur further megamergers if rivals feel threatened by an enlarged industry superpower?One of the main driving forces behind the mooted deal is the big tax savings Pfizer could achieve by moving its domicile to Ireland, where Allergan is based. This would put Pfizer’s tens of billions of dollars of overseas cash out of reach of the US Internal Revenue Service and its 35 per cent tax rate.Other big US drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson, Merck and Amgen, would benefit in the same way from a so-called “inversion” with an overseas company and will be left at a disadvantage to Pfizer if it buys Allergan.GSK rebuffed a tentative takeover approach from Pfizer in recent months, according to people familiar with the matter, and the UK group could yet prove tempting to other US suitors. The same applies for AstraZeneca.However, there are reasons to believe Pfizer-Allergan would most likely remain an exception. Merck has ruled out an inversion, while J&J has refrained from the strident criticism of the US tax code frequently made by Ian Read, Pfizer chief executive.In part, that is because both companies’ executives are more optimistic than Pfizer that the US will embark on tax reform after next year’s presidential election. Amgen, which has almost the entirety of its $30bn of cash trapped outside the US, is also holding out for a deal in Washington, according to people close to the group.Mr Read, in contrast, is not prepared to wait, partly because a long timetable could frustrate his plan for a potential break-up of Pfizer. Analysts believe he wants Allergan as a way to beef up Pfizer’s branded drugs portfolio before separating it from the slower-growing generics business.As such, the putative deal may in the long term prove less a return of the mega-merger than a step towards more focused business models. Sanofi’s indication this month that it may sell or spin-off its animal health unit brought a reminder that divestments have been almost as important a part of the deals boom as acquisitions.“Scale for scale’s sake is not what you need,” says David Redfern, chief strategy officer of GSK, which in March completed a $20bn asset swap with Novartis. “You do need critical mass in [core] therapeutic areas . . . but just being an enormous pharmaceuticals company is not the criteria.”Even if Pfizer-Allergan was not followed by more inversions, the broader M&A surge looks set to continue. Last month, J&J said it was open to deals of “any scale” and Amgen is looking for an acquisition of up to $10bn, according to people familiar with the matter. The other top biotech groups — Gilead, Biogen and Celgene — are also widely considered to be on the hunt for growth-boosting assets.“We’re all picking areas where we can play to win,” said Shaun Grady, head of business development at AstraZeneca, which this month bought ZS Pharma of the US for $2.7bn. “That is driving the M&A because we’re all willing to pay . . . a strategic premium to get an advantage.”
33;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:00:06+0000;Amgen on the hunt for potential deal of up to $10bn;Companies with drugs already in clinical testing are being evaluated;Amgen, one of the four largest US biotech groups, is on the hunt for potential acquisitions, according to people familiar with the situation, as it prepares to end its self-imposed exile from the boom in pharmaceuticals mergers and acquisitions.More than $850bn of healthcare deals have been announced since the start of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters, but Amgen has so far stayed on the sidelines, eschewing large or medium-sized transactions.Instead, it has focused its efforts on buying or licensing a handful of unproven drugs that are in early-stage testing and typically command much smaller price tags.However, a person familiar with the company’s thinking said it had recently “opened the aperture” and was now evaluating companies worth up to $10bn, with drugs that have been proven in clinical testing and are almost ready to bring to market.Companies that have recently completed similar acquisitions include Celgene, another biotech group, which paid $7.2bn for cancer specialist Receptos, and Alexion, which spent $8.4 on Synageva, a rare diseases specialist.Amgen, which ended last week with an equity value of $121bn, has also been seen as a potential target and has been linked to Allergan, the drugmaker that is in talks about combining with Pfizer.One investor who recently held meetings with Amgen’s management team said the company had contacted shareholders in the past few weeks to get “everybody prepared” for an acquisition.Amgen declined to comment.Amgen’s last major acquisition was Onyx, which it bought in 2013 for roughly $10bn, primarily to secure the rights to its cancer drug Kyprolis.$121bnAmgen’s market value on FridayInvestors initially turned sour on the Onyx deal amid lacklustre sales of the medicine, but many shareholders revised their opinion this year, after the US drugs watchdog approved Kyprolis for use in a cocktail of medicines to treat patients with cancer of the plasma cells.The decision by the Food and Drug Administration paves the way for a big jump in sales, according to analysts.“They’re taking a lot of comfort from the Onyx acquisition,” the investor said.Amgen would probably finance an acquisition by raising debt, according to the person familiar with the company’s thinking.Although the company’s balance sheet has $30bn of debt it also has roughly the same amount in cash, with the vast majority trapped offshore. Repatriating cash to the US to fund a deal would incur a hefty tax bill.Amgen, founded in 1980, is one of the four cornerstone groups of the US biotech sector, along with Celgene, Gilead and Biogen, and is credited with developing some of the first successful “biologic” drugs.It is now facing competition to some of its top-selling products from a new generation of “biosimilar” copycat medicines. Earlier this year, the FDA approved the first ever biosimilar version of Neupogen, an Amgen medicine that had sales of $1.16bn last year.Last year, Dan Loeb, the activist investor, acquired a stake in Amgen through his Third Point vehicle and pushed for cost-cutting and a potential break-up of the company. Subsequently, the group said it would make roughly $1.5bn of cuts.However, Amgen has fiercely resisted any attempt to split in two, and Mr Loeb has, for now, dropped the idea.
34;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

The Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company is conducting a large, late-stage trial for Anacetrapib, a drug that uses a similar mechanism to Evacetrapib. Analysts are expecting sales of $567.2m for the Merck drug in 2019, and $858.6m the following year, according to a poll by Bloomberg.Jeffrey Loo, equity healthcare research analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the news from Lilly “raises more uncertainty” about Merck’s drug, but “doesn’t necessarily mean [it] won’t be efficacious”.Eli Lilly shares shed 8 per cent at $79.45 by the close of trading.On the other side of the spectrum, companies that were recently approved for new cholesterol drugs climbed on the day. Amgen, which gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for a drug called Repatha in August, climbed 2 per cent to $153.03. Meanwhile, Regeneron, which in partnership with Sanofi scored a green light from the FDA for Praluent in July, rallied 4.6 per cent to $526.83.Mr Loo said both of those drugs are aimed at lowering “bad” cholesterol among people who do not respond well to so-called statins, such as Lipitor.Elsewhere, Phillips 66 said its board approved an increase in its stock buyback of $2bn, bringing the total authorisation to $9bn. The Houston-based oil refiner also unveiled a $3.6bn capital budget for next year, excluding its Philips 66 Partners’ capital programme.Of those capital expenditures, $2bn will go to the midstream business, which includes the continued construction of a liquefied petroleum gas export terminal on the Gulf Coast. It is also investing in pipeline projects to move crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken region to market centres across the US.Meanwhile, $1.2bn will be invested in the company’s refining business, with 70 per cent of that sum heading to safety and environmental initiatives.By close, the shares were up 0.4 per cent to $83.87.The US energy sector as a whole dropped after its best week of 2015 amid a decline in the price of crude oil. Chevron, an oil major, fell 1 per cent to $88.75. Marathon Oil, which is a big performer in the shale arena, dipped 3 per cent to $18.96.Freeport-McMoRan, the mining heavyweight, saw its shares dip 4 per cent to $12.94. The move came after a 27 per cent surge last week on news the company might spin off its oil and gas division.Shares of US airlines flew higher on the day. American Airlines rose 3.4 per cent to $43.84, Delta Air Lines climbed 2.7 per cent to $48.49, Southwest Airlines ticked up 3.2 per cent to $41.22 and United Airlines jumped 3.8 per cent to $57.80.Fiat Chrysler shares traded in New York climbed 1.5 per cent to $15.91. The carmaker said late on Friday that it planned to raise nearly $1bn as it spins off a 9 per cent stake of Ferrari in an initial public offering.By close, the S&P 500 added 0.1 per cent to 2,017.46, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 17,131.86 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.2 per cent to 4,838.64.
36;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-10-12T16:08:49Z;Eli Lilly shares sink as it scraps heart drug;Trial into Evacetrapib abandoned due to ‘insufficient efficacy’;Eli Lilly has pulled the plug on a potential blockbuster medicine intended to ward off heart attacks and strokes, sending the company’s shares down as much as 10 per cent and dealing a blow to its strategy of pursuing high-risk “moon shot” drugs.The company said it had accepted the advice of independent scientists who recommended it discontinue a large and expensive trial into Evacetrapib due to “insufficient efficacy”.“There was a low probability the study would achieve its primary endpoint based on results to date,” the company said in a statement on Monday. It said the full results of the so-called Phase III study, which involved 12,000 patients in 37 countries, would be published in the future.Analysts had expected Evacetrapib to be a blockbuster drug, contributing $800m of revenue in 2020, rising to $2.6bn in 2025. Shares in Lilly fell as much as 10 per cent in premarket trading in New York and were down more than 8 per cent by lunchtime trading.The Indianapolis drugmaker had hoped Evacetrapib would prevent heart attacks and strokes by blocking the protein CETP, in theory boosting HDL, or “good” cholesterol and staving off serious cardiac events.“The announcement from Eli Lilly management this morning that they have discontinued development of Evacetrapib is a major negative surprise,” said Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies, who retained a “buy” rating on the company’s shares.The company said it would take a pre-tax charge of up to $90m, or about 5 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, although Derica Rice, Lilly’s chief financial officer, said the failure did not change the company’s ability to generate long-term growth.“Our recent string of positive data-readouts and our strong pipeline position us to increase revenue and expand margins through the remainder of this decade,” Mr Rice said.The failure of Evacetrapib is a setback for Lilly’s pursuit of potential blockbuster drugs that are risky to develop but would generate huge sales if approved. The company is also pushing ahead with its Alzheimer’s drug, Solanezumab, which has failed in two clinical trials but has shown some promise in treating patients in the early stages of the disease.Hopes that Solanezumab will be the first Alzheimer’s drug to be approved in a decade — a status that would guarantee blockbuster sales — have helped Lilly outperform most of its peers so far this year, as have data showing one of its diabetes drugs can reduce the incidence of heart attack and stroke.The company’s shares are up by 15 per cent since January, whereas the New York Stock Exchange’s pharmaceuticals index is flat, following a recent sell-off of the sector’s shares over fears of pricing pressure in the US.Evacetrapib is the latest in a string of failed CETP inhibitors, following similar duds from Roche and Pfizer, which were abandoned due to safety issues that emerged during late-stage clinical trials.Analysts said the news cast doubt on a rival CETP inhibitor being trialled by Merck and shares in the company were initially down 2 per cent in early trading.Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said: “Today’s news is a negative for Lilly and we anticipate that investors will also likely read across negatively to Merck, whose CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib, is also being studied in an outcomes trial with data expected in early 2017.”However, Lilly’s decision to drop Evacetrapib could boost sales of so-called PCSK9 inhibitors, a competing class of drugs that aims to prevent serious cardiovascular events.Shares in Amgen, which recently launched its own PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were up more than 3 per cent by lunchtime in New York trading, while shares in Sanofi, which makes rival drug Praluent, rose more than 1 per cent.
37;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-10-06T21:25:23Z;Express Scripts agrees deal for heart drugs;Pharmacy group secures big discount on medicine’s $14,000-a-year price tag;The largest pharmacy group in the US has agreed to make two expensive new heart drugs available to its patients, after securing big discounts from the companies which make the medicines and implementing strict curbs on who is eligible.Express Scripts, the number one pharmacy benefits manager, said it had reached an agreement that covers 25m of its members after the makers of the medicines agreed to cut the $14,000-a-year price tag, although it did not disclose the size of the discount.According to some estimates, the US healthcare system will end up paying more than $20bn a year for the so-called PCSK9 inhibitors, which reduce levels of “bad” or LDL cholesterol by between 55 and 70 per cent.The FDA recently approved two of the drugs — Repatha, made by Amgen, and Praluent, made by Sanofi and Regeneron — for people who have had a heart attack or stroke but cannot reduce their LDL cholesterol to safe levels using statins alone.The drugs were also approved for a genetic condition known as familial hypercholesterolaemia, which leads to dangerously high levels of LDL cholesterol.However, there has been uncertainty over whether companies like Express Scripts, which run prescription drug programmes for employers and insurers, would agree to pay for the medicines because of the huge price tag.Dr Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, said it would not spend more than $750m on the drugs in 2016 because it had secured a discount.The group will also implement an “aggressive utilisation management programme” to ensure only those patients who are eligible for the drugs will receive them.There has been concern that doctors will prescribe the drugs more widely to those patients who experience side effects on statins, which cost less than 50 cents a day, and the utilisation management programme is designed to stop this happening.We did pit them against each other and made it clear we were willing to go exclusive, but the best case scenario is to get the economics you want and the broadest accessDr Miller said both companies had agreed to limit any price hikes for the entire contract, although he would not specify how long the agreement lasts.The negotiation over PCSK9 inhibitors is the most closely watched since Express Scripts refused to pay for Gilead’s $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill last year and instead signed an exclusive agreement with a rival after securing a big discount.Dr Miller said he was again prepared to give exclusivity to either Amgen or Sanofi-Regeneron but that he had achieved a good enough deal to offer both products.“We did pit them against each other and made it clear we were willing to go exclusive, but the best case scenario is to get the economics you want and the broadest access,” he told the Financial Times.Express Scripts is the first of the large pharmacy benefits managers to sign a deal for the new drugs and its competitors are expected to announce similar agreements shortly.Anthony Hooper, an executive vice-president at Amgen, said: “This is an important milestone for patients. We will continue to engage constructively with other payers to enable patients to have access to Repatha.”
38;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Novartis launches first biological copycat drug in US;Appeals court denies Amgen’s request for an injunction to block Swiss group’s cancer medicine;"Novartis has launched the first cut-price copy of an expensive biological drug in the US, opening the way for a new category of medicines that could shave billions of dollars off American healthcare costs.The Swiss group said on Thursday that its “biosimilar” version of Amgen’s Neupogen cancer drug was now available in the US hours after a federal appeals court denied Amgen’s request for an injunction to block the product.Biosimilars are near-identical copies of the pricey biological drugs that have been gaining a growing share of global pharmaceuticals spending — and placing increasing strain on healthcare budgets.Copycat versions of these complex injectable medicines have been on sale in Europe for almost a decade but they have been slow to arrive in the US, in part because of lobbying against them by parts of the pharmaceuticals industry.President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms included measures to encourage biosimilars and pressure has been building from insurers and other healthcare “payers” for their introduction to mitigate the rising US drugs bill.The US Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to Novartis’s Neupogen copy, Zarxio, in March and Wednesday’s federal court ruling removed the final legal obstacle.Novartis said its product would provide “a high-quality, more affordable version of this important oncology medicine”. Amgen said it intended to “compete effectively” against its new rival.Amgen generated almost $1.2bn in global sales last year from Neupogen, which boosts the white blood cell count in cancer patients to combat infections. It had accused Novartis of infringing its intellectual property.The case has been closely watched because Zarxio is the first in a wave of biosimilars preparing to seek entry to the US market, posing a threat to companies such as Amgen, AbbVie and Roche which have blockbuster biological drugs nearing the end of their patent lives.Biosimilars play the same role as traditional generic drugs, which have long provided cut-price competition to chemical-based pills when they lose patent protection. But biological drugs — made from living cells — are harder to replicate, explaining why biosimilars have been slow to emerge.The higher cost of development means biosimilars do not offer as big a discount as the 80-90 per cent saving provided by generic pills; in Europe biosimilars have typically been priced about 30 per cent below the original. Novartis did not say how much it planned to charge for Zarxio in the US.According to Express Scripts, which manages drug prescriptions on behalf of insurers, biosimilars should reduce US drug spending by $250bn in the next decade. This is based on the assumption that biosimilars will be approved for 11 blockbuster biological drugs, including AbbVie’s best-selling Humira arthritis medicine and Roche’s Avastin and Herceptin cancer therapies.“With spending on prescription drugs continuing to rise . . . biosimilars will play an important part in keeping healthcare benefits affordable and accessible for Americans,” said Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts.Others are more cautious, warning of resistance from doctors and patients to abandoning proven brand-name drugs. A report by Fitch, the credit rating agency, last month said: “While the US market holds significant potential for biosimilars, the prospects remain uncertain.”Novartis is one of several large drugmakers seeking to take advantage of growth in biosimilars even as others resist them. Pfizer made a big commitment to the category in February when it bought Hospira, a biosimilar manufacturer, for $17bn."

Sales rose 12 per cent to $147.8m.Analysts had forecast earnings of 15 cents on sales of $143m. Adjusting for one-off items, earnings of 32 cents a share beat expectations.“The combined results of our firearms and accessories divisions indicate to us that consumer demand and the preference for our products was stronger than anticipated,” said James Debney, chief executive.Shares of Smith & Wesson, which have advanced more than 86 per cent this year, jumped 11.2 per cent to $18.03 by the close.GameStop, a video game retailer, fell more than 8 per cent to $42.49 after analysts at Benchmark downgraded the stock from “hold” to “sell” with a price target of $29.76.“We believe the company’s core business model, the physical distribution of hardware, software and used product through a traditional retail network, will be increasingly displaced from growing consumer adoption of digital, streaming and subscription content service channels and the competitive pressure from mobile platforms, an ecosystem we anticipate will extend to the living room,” said Mike Hickey, analyst.The downgrade arrived after second-quarter profits came in at $25.3m, or 24 cents a share, on sales of $1.76bn — in line with analysts’ expectations. Same-store sales rose 8.1 per cent, ahead of forecasts for a 1.7 per cent gain.Amgen nudged up to close at $155.89 after the US Food and Drug Administration approved Repatha, its cholesterol drug.Shares of United Continental enjoyed a tailwind from the S&P 500, after S&P Dow Jones Indices said the airline group would replace Hospira on the benchmark index after the market close on September 2.Hospira, a maker of injectable drugs, is being acquired by Pfizer in a transaction that is expected to be completed on or about that date.United Continental, whose shares climbed more than 7 per cent to $57.12, will join American Airlines, Delta and Southwest in the S&P 500.After two days of gains US stocks were mixed on Friday following a lacklustre trading session in Europe.

A bear market is a 20 per cent or more decline from a recent peak.Biotech has been one of the best performing sectors in US equities in the bull market of the past seven years as investors have chased the returns that follow the discovery of new blockbuster drugs.But with global markets now turning, the sector is falling fast and dropped another 2.6 per cent to 3,470.76, its fifth day of losses. The
index is down 16.6 per cent since its July peak.“Everyone was hiding [in biotech], trying to still go up in a flat market,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “They drove those valuations too high and they’re paying the piper now so to speak.”Gilead Sciences, Amgen, Celgene and Biogen, known as the “big four” of biotech, were all hit.Celgene plunged 21.2 per cent on the open, before recovering to trade down 1.2 per cent lower at $117.62 in the afternoon. Gilead dropped as much as 8 per cent before trading 0.8 per cent lower at $104.49 later in the day.Amgen initially dropped 9.3 per cent but later traded just 1.2 per cent down at $117.62, while Biogen slid 9 per cent but was trading 1.2 per cent lower at $291.82 by the afternoon.Daniel Koller, of Swiss investment company BB Biotech, said the sell-off had driven valuations of large-cap biotech stocks to “very attractive levels”.“We see the current sector correction in the context of all equity markets under pressure given no change to the fundamentally very sound biotech business model,” he added.Since March 2009, the Nasdaq biotech index had risen 580 per cent by the time it reached its July peak, and putting it up by 31.1 per cent for the year.The index is now up just 9.1 per cent year-to-date and has returned to its lowest level since February.The impressive run has been driven by a flood of private companies going public and mergers and acquisitions activity.Just 11 biotech and pharmaceutical companies floated in 2011, a number that had rocketed to 84 in 2014. So far this year, 37 companies had raised $3.7bn going public, according to Dealogic.Biotech’s rise had led to warnings the market was showing signs of dotcom era exuberance and had been driven by an era of cheap money that has helped change the dynamics of drug development.With interest rates at rock-bottom levels, biotech start-ups have increasingly turned to the public markets to fund drugs through clinical trials instead of partnering up with big pharmaceuticals.According to estimates from Silicon Valley Bank, more than 40 per cent of venture capital backed “biopharma” companies that came to the market in 2014 were yet to complete phase 1 trials or were pre-clinical.However, the carnage in global markets is already deterring companies from coming to market.RainDance Technologies pulled plans for an initial public offering, citing “market conditions”.The Massachusetts-based company makes medical devices for genetic testing and was planning to raise $60m from public markets."

The Swiss group this month won approval for a new heart drug, called Entresto, tipped by analysts for up to $11bn in annual sales.This optimism is reflected in the 40 per cent jump in the S&P pharmaceuticals index over the past year, compared with a 7 per cent rise in the broader S&P 500.However, sceptics warn that the industry is still facing big challenges from the high cost of developing drugs and pressure on prices as health systems around the world struggle to cope with rising demand from ageing populations.Eli Lilly hopes its solanezumab drug can help ease the cost of Alzheimer’s on society while delivering a multibillion-dollar windfall for the company by allowing patients to remain independent for longer.Analysts cautioned that the drug’s fate would remain in the balance until the results from a further big clinical trial are reported late next year. Many previous Alzheimer’s studies have failed at this stage, causing heavy financial losses.But new analysis on Wednesday of a previous trial of more than 1,000 people with mild Alzheimer’s reinforced earlier signs that solanezumab might provide a lasting reduction of about 34 per cent in the pace of mental decline.“The results provide encouraging evidence that Solanezumab could indeed be acting on the disease processes that drive Alzheimer’s,” said Eric Karran, research director at Alzheimer’s Research UK, the charity.It is seen as a ‘black hole’ for drugs spending, but there is fresh hope of a treatment for Alzheimer’s.Read moreOther signs of renewed pharma innovation include the approval by the European Commission this week of Amgen’s Repatha drug, which was shown in clinical trials to reduce “bad cholesterol” by more than 55 per cent in people who failed to respond to statins. A similar product called Praluent from Sanofi of France and Regeneron of the US is likely to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday, igniting a fierce battle with Amgen for what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar market.European regulators are also expected to rule this week on GlaxoSmithKline’s Mosquirix malaria vaccine, which has been in development for 30 years. This will not be a big money-spinner for the UK group — it has vowed to reinvest any modest profits in further tropical disease research — but could make a dent in the almost 600,000 deaths a year from malaria.Moncef Slaoui, head of vaccines at GSK, said recent breakthroughs were a vindication of the industry’s big spending on drug development. “R&D is not a quarterly report activity — it is something that comes in waves,” he said. “There are breakthroughs in understanding and that leads to new medicines.”
42;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-07-22T07:37:56Z;Amgen and Sanofi to battle for cholesterol drug crown;Rival product launches set to prove a boon for insurers and healthcare providers;"Drug regulators have fired the starting gun in the race between Amgen and Sanofi to dominate the first large new class of cholesterol-busting drugs since statins in the 1990s.The European Commission gave the go-ahead to Amgen’s Repatha drug on Tuesday and Sanofi is hoping for a green light for its rival product, called Praluent, from the US Food and Drug Administration by the end of this week.Both are tipped for multibillion-dollar annual sales after clinical trials showed their potential to cut “bad cholesterol” — linked with heart attacks and strokes — by more than 55 per cent in people who failed to respond to statins.Amgen of the US is, however, set for a tough battle for market share with Sanofi and the French company’s US partner, Regeneron.US insurers and European public health systems are expected to use the competition to push for price discounts amid concern over the drugs’ impact on health budgets.Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, told the Financial Times that the company was ready to “engage in a value-based discussion” with customers over pricing.“The direct cost in hospitalisation and social care from heart attacks and strokes in Europe exceeds $100bn and it is much greater when you consider indirect costs,” he said. “The economic benefit of preventing these events is quite clear.”He was speaking after European green light for Repatha on Tuesday marked the first approval for one of the so-called PCSK9 inhibitors anywhere in the world. Sanofi and Regeneron remain on course to be first to launch in the bigger US market, however, assuming the FDA approves Praluent this week as expected. A US decision on Repatha is due next month.New multibillion-dollar drugs offset patent expiriesRead moreNeither company has yet declared a price for their drugs but analysts predict they will cost about $10,000 a year. This has rattled insurers and healthcare providers who have benefited from a sharp fall in the cost of treating high cholesterol as statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, have lost patent protection in recent years.Some generic statins can cost as little as $4 for a month’s supply.Mr Harper insisted that PCSK9s — named after a protein linked with high cholesterol that the drugs suppress — were not intended to replace statins altogether. Instead, their use would be limited to patients “who have inadequate response or cannot tolerate” the older drugs.However, this is a big potential market; Amgen said more than 60 per cent of European patients deemed “high-risk” were unable to adequately lower their cholesterol levels using existing drugs.Sanofi is also preparing to make its case to wary customers. Elias Zerhouni, the French company’s president of research and development, said: “People forget that cardiovascular disease is still the world’s number one killer; there is a large unmet need.”"
43;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-07-12T12:32:26Z;Drugmakers premiere summer blockbusters;New multibillion-dollar drugs offset patent expiries;Blockbuster drugs are back. A wave of new multibillion-dollar medicines for heart disease and high cholesterol, added to recent breakthroughs in cancer and hepatitis C, is reviving optimism that the pharmaceuticals industry has moved beyond the heavy patent losses of the past few years.Last week, Entresto — a heart disease treatment from Novartis, which cut death rates by 20 per cent in clinical trials — was approved by US regulators. Analysts are now tipping it to reach $6bn in annual sales.Similar expectations surround anti-cholesterol drugs from Sanofi of France and Amgen of the US, both of which look set for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in coming weeks. They were recommended by the regulator’s advisory panel last month.These three weapons against heart failure— the world’s biggest killer — come on the heels of a new category of cancer drugs that harnesses the human immune system to destroy tumours. The first of these so-called immunotherapies was launched by Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb last year and analysts expect them to generate $35bn of annual sales within a decade.Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences has sold about $20bn-worth of its Sovaldi hepatitis C medicine and a follow-on product called Harvoni since the former was approved 19 months ago — making it the most successful drug launch in history.All of the successes reflect a broader pharmaceuticals resurgence. A record 61 drugs were introduced around the world last year, according to Citeline, the research firm, compared with an annual average of 34 in the previous decade.Elias Zerhouni, president of research and development for Sanofi, says the industry is finally feeling the benefits of scientific advances triggered by the sequencing of the human genome 15 years ago. This has led to more targeted treatments and a deeper understanding of the biological processes behind disease.“People are using human genetics in ways that have never been possible before,” he says, citing the way that Sanofi’s new Praluent drug targets a particular protein, called PCSK9, associated with high levels of the “bad” cholesterol linked with heart disease.Praluent and Repatha, the rival Amgen product, are aimed at people who do not respond to statins, the mass-market cholesterol-busters that emerged from pharma’s last golden age of innovation in the 1990s. It was the expiration of patents on blockbusters from this era — such as Pfizer’s Lipitor statin — that sent the industry into a slump from which it is only now recovering.Sales lost to cut-price generic competition reached a peak of $37bn in 2012, according to Evaluate, the research group. But that figure is now falling and forecast to reach $12bn by 2020 — because the paucity of innovation over the past decade has meant fewer drugs patents are ending.A combination of declining patent expiries and rising drug launches ought to create fertile conditions for growth. With an ageing world population, increasing incidence of chronic disease and widening access to healthcare, there is certainly no shortage of demand. Investors appear confident: S&P’s pharmaceuticals index has risen by almost a quarter in the past year.Amid all this optimism, however, there is little sense of triumph among pharma executives. Instead, the mood has been unsettled as a wave of mergers and acquisitions have swept the sector. Big drugmakers have been scrambling to buy promising young biotech companies and trading businesses with each other as they jostle to build the strongest product portfolios.Rather than a sign of confidence from a resurgent industry, some explain this M&A boom as preparation for challenges ahead.Downward pricing pressure hitherto associated with the cash-strapped public health systems of Europe has been spreading across the Atlantic, as the US gets serious about cutting waste from its private health market. A backlash by insurers and health providers against Gilead’s $1,000-a-pill hepatitis C drugs last year was seen by many as a harbinger of tougher times in the world’s biggest pharma market.Alert to these pressures, Novartis has indicated that it will experiment with outcome-based pricing for Entresto in an effort to encourage wide uptake. This would involve a link between price and performance to ensure the company is only rewarded if the medicine works.Sanofi and Amgen are also braced for difficult negotiations over the price of their PCSK9 drugs. Mr Zerhouni acknowledges that, while levels of innovation have risen, so too have commercial hurdles. “If you are not first in class, best in class or a very fast second you will not see a return [on investment].”June 2015: An NHS decision not to stock a new cancer drug from AstraZeneca has seen the UK pharma group accuse the country of stymieing scientific innovation. Andrew Ward explains the predicamentWatch videoThese pressures are also prompting a rethink of the way drugs are developed. Secretive in-house R&D operations are being broken up in favour of collaboration with academia and biotech. Sanofi’s Praluent, for example, was developed in partnership with a smaller US partner called Regeneron. Meanwhile, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have launched fast-track approval processes to speed the path of breakthrough medicines.All these factors have played a role in the R&D renaissance. But Julian Remnant, life science partner at Deloitte, warns that productivity is still depressed by high costs. According to the Tuft Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston, the average bill for a new drug has risen to $2.6bn, from $802m the last time an estimate was made in 2003.Return on R&D investment edged up to 5.5 per cent in 2014, from 5.1 per cent the year before, according to Deloitte, but Mr Remnant says it is too soon to declare an improving trend. “The industry has got wind in its sails again but it needs to use this momentum to drive change.”Big pharma was supposed to have moved beyond the blockbuster era. Instead of medicines for the masses, many of today’s drug breakthroughs are targeted at specific genetic mutations in smaller numbers of patients.However, there are still plenty of opportunities where the potential market size and price are high enough to achieve blockbuster drug status: annual sales in excess of $1bn. Eleven blockbusters are expected to launch this year, up from three in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters. These include:Praluent (Sanofi/Regeneron): A clinical trial last week showed it reduced “bad cholesterol” by an average 64 per cent among patients with an inherited form of high cholesterol or pre-existing heart disease. Forecast 2019 sales: $4.4bnEntresto (Novartis): A twice daily tablet that reduces strain on a failing heart. Reduced hospitalisation and deaths by one-fifth in trials compared with an existing drug. Forecast 2019 sales: $3.7bnIbrance (Pfizer): Granted conditional approval by US regulators in February for women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer — the most common form of the disease. In combination with AstraZeneca’s Faslodex, the drug slowed cancer progression by 9.2 months, compared with 3.8 months for Faslodex alone. Forecast 2019 sales: $2.8bnRepatha (Amgen): A rival to Sanofi’s Praluent targeting the PCSK9 protein associated with high cholesterol. Both were recommended by an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration last month but questions remain over how widely they should be used. Forecast 2019 sales: $1.9bn

It was led on Thursday by a near 3 per cent advance in the biotech sector.The gains follow comments from Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday that the central bank would raise rates slowly and there remained division over the pace at which it should tighten.“The underlying message from yesterday’s meeting was that the prevailing bias remains for the start of policy normalisation later this year,” said Millan Mulraine, strategist with TD Securities. “Wrapped within that message was a dovish tone that suggests the Fed is placing a greater burden on the data to justify any policy action.”The comments buoyed biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which have enjoyed a strong rally this year on industry consolidation and drug advances. Shares of Celgene advanced 4.24 per cent to close at $116.92, Regeneron climbed 2.94 per cent to close at $527.97, Vertex gained 2.89 per cent to close at $127.63, and Amgen rose 2.87 per cent to close at $160.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 had set intraday and closing record highs earlier this year.US stocks have also been somewhat rangebound as investors readied for the Fed to move and concerns mounted over valuations.A narrower pace of tightening than expected in March has helped alleviate some of those concerns. Strategists with Wells Fargo note that despite a heightened sense of nervousness by investors, “the bull market likely remains intact”.“Nervousness is rather normal around the first Fed tightening,” said Gina Martin Adams, a strategist with the bank. “Nervousness is also usually rather scarce at the time of bull market peaks.”Two flotations were also well received by the market, with shares of Fitbit and Univar climbing. Shares of the fitness tracking device maker soared 52 per cent to $30.40 in their debut, lifting the company’s valuation to $6.2bn. Fitbit closed at $29.68.Univar, which sold shares on Wednesday at $22 apiece, gained 15.45 per cent to $25.40.Shares of Oracle slid 7 per cent to $41.56 midday after the software maker said profits fell by nearly a quarter to $2.8bn as a strengthening dollar cut into sales. Oracle closed at $42.74.Oracle, which offers database and cloud products for companies, said overall sales fell 5 per cent from a year earlier to $10.7bn in the three months to the end of May, attributing roughly $900m in lost revenues to the dollar.The company reported adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share, short of analyst expectations for 87 cents.Overall, markets advanced on strengthening economic data, as initial jobless claims declined by a better than expected pace and an index of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region hit its highest level of the year.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both climbed 0.9 per cent to close at 2,120.88 and 18,113.84 respectively.

45;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;New heart drugs set to add billions to US healthcare bill;Breakthrough cholesterol-lowering medicines could add $150bn to US health bill;"An expensive new class of heart medicines that threatens to add tens of billions of dollars to the US healthcare bill is set for approval after a panel of experts endorsed one of the new drugs.The medical professionals on Tuesday recommended approval for Praluent, a medicine made by Sanofi and Regeneron, and will meet on Wednesday to examine Repatha, a rival drug made by Amgen, which reduced LDL or “bad” cholesterol by between 55 per cent and 70 per cent in a series of large, late-stage clinical trials.Analysts said they were confident Repatha would be recommended given the backing for Praluent.The drugs would then be set for final approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, the pharmaceuticals watchdog, which almost always follows the recommendations of these advisory committees.Doctors have hailed the arrival of such so-called “PCSK9 inhibitors” as the biggest development in cardiology since the 1990s, when the introduction of statins led to a remarkable reduction in LDL cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease.The advisory panel suggested that Praluent should only be given to specific groups of patients, such as those with familial hypercholesterolaemia, a genetic condition that leads to very high levels of LDL cholesterol.Sanofi, Regeneron and Amgen say the new drugs are not intended to replace statins but are aimed at three groups of patients: those who take statins but still have high levels of LDL cholesterol; those who cannot tolerate statins; and those who have already had a heart attack or stroke.The companies have not yet released pricing information, but analysts and healthcare professionals are working on the assumption they will cost in the region of $10,000 per year.CVS Caremark, the pharmacy group, said that even if the drugs were only given to those with dangerously high levels of cholesterol they would cost the US healthcare system about $16bn a year. That would dwarf the initial costs of Gilead’s Sovaldi, a $1,000-per-pill medicine that sparked a national outcry over drug prices.If this class proves to be as safe and effective as trials suggest, then they could become the biggest class in all of pharmaceuticals, although that would take years to accomplishIf the drugs were also given to statin intolerant patients they would add a further $20bn of costs, while including those with a history of coronary disease would add as much as $150bn, according to CVS Caremark.Despite the huge success of statins, which now cost as little as $4 for a month’s supply, heart disease remains the biggest killer in the US and most other developed countries.Dr Paul Chew, Sanofi’s chief medical officer, said: “Statins have been around for a long time. They are and were a tremendous innovation. But there has been nothing since their arrival that can take LDL cholesterol down by 50-60 per cent, even in high-risk patients.”American Depository Receipts in Sanofi rose 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York on Tuesday. Shares in Regeneron were suspended all day because of the panel hearing.Unlike some medicines, PCSK9 inhibitors are so-called “maintenance drugs” which are intended to be prescribed on a regular basis, normally for the rest of the patient’s life. That means they could put a bigger strain on healthcare systems than drugs such as Sovaldi, which can cure Hepatitis C after 12 months.“If this class proves to be as safe and effective as trials suggest, then they could become the biggest class in all of pharmaceuticals, although that would take years to accomplish,” said Dr Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager.Jeffrey Berger, a cardiologist at the New York University Langone Medical Center, said: “The new class of medicines has very exciting properties. Preliminary data suggest they will be a very effective medicine in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease.”However, he said the profession should wait for data from a series of long-term trials before getting too excited. While studies have conclusively shown the drugs can lower levels of LDL cholesterol, that does not necessarily mean they will reduce the incidence of heart attacks or strokes, he said."

But First Solar now faces competition from crystalline silicone (C-Si) producers.A supply shortage had pushed C-Si prices higher in the past, making it less competitive, but “driven by significant decline in polysilicon price and manufacturing efficiency improvement, we estimate that production cost of C-Si modules will be only 2 cents higher than First Solar by the end of 2015”, he said.Shares of First Solar, which have declined nearly 15 per cent in the past year, fell 7 per cent to $51.04.AstraZeneca shares fell more than 2 per cent to $67.68 after US drugs developer Amgen said it would terminate its participation in a joint project to develop brodalumab, a treatment aimed at helping patients with the skin disease psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.“The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behaviour in the brodalumab program, which Amgen believes likely would necessitate restrictive labelling,” Amgen said in a statement.AstraZeneca said it would announce its decision on the future development of the treatment as soon as possible.Shares of Time Warner Cable led the benchmark S&P 500, after Charter Communications agreed to buy the company in a $57bn deal that is subject to regulatory approval. The takeover comes a month after US regulators thwarted Comcast’s attempt to take over TWC.Airline stocks, which have recently been hit by concerns that carriers will boost capacity and cut prices to win market share, came under renewed pressure on Tuesday.

47;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-04-28T21:07:48Z;Oracle leads US corporate bonds sale surge;Raisings of $13.5bn to fund wave of share buy backs;Amgen and Oracle led a US corporate bond sales charge on Tuesday, raising $13.5bn to buy back shares as the market for company debt heated up again after the traditional earning season blackout period.Oracle reported earnings in March but saw its credit rating upgraded by one notch to AA- by Standard & Poor’s earlier this month, and decided to push the button on a large $10bn six-part bond sale this week, offering maturities ranging from seven years to four decades.The technology company led by Larry Ellison said in a regulatory filing that the use of the proceeds “may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions”. The deal is the fourth biggest this year, after significant bond sales from Actavis, AT&T and Microsoft earlier in 2015.Amgen raised $3.5bn through the sale of bonds maturing in five, seven, 10 and 30 years. In addition to reducing some of its bank loans, the drugs group also said it planned to use the money raised to buy back shares.US share buybacks and dividends are forecast to hit $1tn this year, as companies continue to eschew investments in favour of returning money to shareholders.Much of the money has come from cash reserves bloated by fatter profit margins thanks to cost-cutting, but many companies have turned to bond markets to raise money for equity investors.Whether M&A related, share repurchase related or corporate finance related, there is a need for larger bites of fundingWhile this has caused some political consternation, the debt-financed buybacks have largely provided welcome fodder to bond markets that remain ravenously hungry for fresh supply.Issuance slows down in earnings season due to the mandatory information blackout period but now that most companies in the S&P 500 have finished reporting their latest results bond sales are expected to jump again.“It’s very normal,” said Ryan Preclaw, a strategist at Barclays. “Companies often tail off issuance even before the earnings blackout and then there’s a big rush afterwards . . . The first quarter was the best ever for gross supply, and demand is very robust.”This represents the best start to a year on record for both investment grade and junk-rated corporate debt sales, according to Dealogic, with $247.9bn of blue-chip bonds being sold and $132.2bn of high yield debt so far in 2015.Jonny Fine, head of US investment grade debt syndicate at Goldman Sachs, highlighted that a bigger proportion of bond sale volumes has been “jumbo” deals.“Whether M&A related, share repurchase related or corporate finance related, there is a need for larger bites of funding,” he said. “Large, liquid, jumbo, benchmark deals from large-cap, liquid, easy-to-follow credits are very much in the wheelhouse of corporate bond investors today.”The issuance splurge has not caused any indigestion yet. US corporate bonds have returned 2.7 per cent already this year, and the average yield stands at just 2.88 per cent.
48;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-04-08T17:20:22Z;Biosimilar drugs: spot the difference;The market’s view on the impact of biosimilars is sanguine, but this may be wrong;"Big pharma groups crushed by patent expirations in the first decade of this century spent the second rushing into biotech. Biotech medicines — proteins grown from live cells — had effectively infinite patents. There was no regulatory route to market for copies of drugs with expired patents. In the US, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 set up a path. And finally, last month, the US authorities approved a biosimilar of Amgen’s Neupogen, a drug with more than $1bn in annual sales.There are still hard questions for regulators, health insurers and doctors. The drugs are complex; the original and the biosimilar are not identical. It is not perfectly clear if the differences matter. So should biosimilars of the same drug from different manufacturers have different names? Should pharmacies fill prescriptions for the original with its biosimilar? If a biosimilar is approved for one condition treated by the original, does the approval cover the other conditions, too?Given these ambiguities — and the fact that biosimilars are tricky and expensive to become approved and to produce — the market has been sanguine about the impact of biosimilar competition on originators’ profits. Shares in groups reliant on biomedicines with patents near expiry (AbbVie and Roche, say) appear unperturbed.This relaxed view may be mistaken. Big companies with lots of biotech experience — Amgen, Pfizer, Biogen Idec — are committing piles of capital to biosimilars. In Europe (where these have been taking hold, slowly, since 2007) a biosimilar for Merck’s blockbuster Remicade is starting to hit sales hard. Biosimilars will grow gradually, but the issue is less about market share than how a cheap alternative affects the original’s price.There is much work ahead. And originator companies will fight hard. But if the biosimilars work perfectly well (so far, they seem to) the economic pressure on all health systems will probably carry the day, in time. Liberum, a rare research house that takes biosimilars seriously, thinks these will keep Roche’s margins flat for the next five years. Consensus calls for a big margin expansion. The next decade will be interesting.This note has been amended since original publication to correct a reference to PfizerEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
49;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-03-15T18:50:27Z;Pharma sector hails ‘sea change’ in heart disease treatment;Cardiovascular treatment is about to change as companies prepare to launch innovative new drugs;The pharmaceuticals industry has hailed an impending “sea change” in the treatment of heart disease as it gears up to launch innovative — but expensive — cardiovascular drugs.Amgen, Sanofi and Novartis all hope to receive regulatory approval this year for new drugs aimed at preventing or treating the world’s most deadly disease. AstraZeneca, meanwhile, is focusing on an existing medicine for those who have suffered heart attacks.“This is a landmark time for patients that have cardiovascular disease,” Scott Wasserman, executive medical director of global development at Amgen, told the Financial Times. “We are about to witness a sea change in the trajectory of this illness.”Much of the excitement surrounds a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs called “PCSK9 inhibitors” from Amgen of the US and Sanofi of France. These block a type of protein known as PCSK9, which reduces the liver’s ability to release the LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, identified as a major cause of heart disease.PCSK9 inhibitors are not intended to fully replace statins, the older and much cheaper drugs such as Pfizer’s Lipitor which have provided the main defence against heart disease since the 1990s. But they should benefit those patients who are intolerant to statins or for whom a statin alone was not enough.At the American College of Cardiology’s annual gathering in San Diego this weekend, Amgen published data which bolstered the case for its PCSK9 inhibitor, called Repatha.A Japanese clinical trial, released on Saturday, showed Repatha, also known as evolocumab, reduced LDL cholesterol by between 67 and 76 per cent in combination with a statin after 12 weeks of treatment. A second study released on Sunday showed the proportion of patients taking Repatha who had died, or had a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular event was less than 1 per cent, compared to 2.18 per cent for those on statins alone.However, policy makers and “payers” — the insurance companies and employers who foot the bill for US healthcare — have expressed concern about the price of PCSK9 inhibitors. The drugs are expected to cost between $7,000 and $12,000 per patient annually. Analysts expect them to generate peak sales of $12bn a year.That could set the stage for a repeat of the recent showdown over hepatitis C medicines, where pharmacy benefit managers — the organisations that manage prescription drugs for insurers — forced big discounts from drugmakers after balking at pills that cost more than $1,000 each.“I’m making the call that Amgen and Sanofi won’t play ball, that they will not give the [pharmacy benefit managers] what they want here — dramatic discounts,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at Evercore ISI. “This could be where sentiment sways back” from the payers to the drugmakers, he added.However, Steve Miller, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the US, said the discussions he had been “having in this class are totally different to the ones we were having in hepatitis”.While PCSK9 inhibitors aim to prevent cardiovascular disease occurring, Novartis is preparing for launch of a new drug, called LCZ696, for those already suffering heart failure. In trials it has been shown to reduce both death and hospitalisation by 20 per cent.Meanwhile, a new trial of AstraZeneca’s Brilinta released on Saturday showed that continued use of the drug beyond one year after a heart attack reduced the risk of death, heart attack or stroke by at least 15 per cent compared with a placebo. This promises to strengthen the UK drugmaker’s push with regulators to widen the drug’s permitted usage beyond the first year after a heart attack.

But, while traditional chemical-based pills can be copied identically, modern biological therapies are harder to replicate.This has created a challenge for manufacturers to come up with substitute products that are similar enough to provide the same therapeutic effect.Biosimilars have been allowed in Europe for several years but US regulators have been more cautious in the face of scepticism in the medical community and resistance from some big pharmaceuticals companies.However, President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act included measures to help smooth biosimilars’ path to market as part of efforts to bring the country’s sky-high healthcare costs under control.An FDA advisory panel recommended Zarxio for approval in January and the decision was rubber-stamped on Friday.Announcing the decision, Margaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner, said: “Patients and the healthcare community can be confident that biosimilar products approved by the FDA meet the agency’s rigorous safety, efficacy and quality standards.”In Europe, biosimilars have typically been sold for 20-30 per cent less than the original product. This is less than the discounts of 80 per cent or more provided by generic medicines and reflects the greater complexity of developing biosimilars.Novartis has won about 30 per cent of the market from Amgen with its version of Neupogen in Europe.A study by the Rand corporation in November forecast that biosimilars could save $44bn in US spending on biological drugs, known as biologics, over the next decade. Biologics are drugs derived from living organisms and include many of the world’s best-selling pharmaceuticals.Further biosimilars are under consideration by the FDA, including a competitor for the Remicade arthritis drug owned by Johnson & Johnson and Merck. Celltrion of South Korea and Hospira of the US launched versions of Remicade in Europe last month.
51;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-02-02T05:05:36Z;Big pharmaceuticals groups faces biosimilars challenge;Drugs pipeline improves but report finds biological treatments are beginning to face competition;Global pharmaceuticals companies have seen an improvement in their drugs pipelines but the industry is facing a fresh challenge as the first generation of blockbuster biological drugs begins to face competition.Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly have the strongest late-stage pipelines relative to existing revenues, while AstraZeneca has shown the greatest improvement over the past two years, says a report by credit rating agency Moody’s.However, those same three companies also face the greatest exposure to patent expiries over the next three years, highlighting the perennial battle faced by drugmakers to develop new medicines as old ones lose market exclusivity.Eli Lilly is one of five companies, together with Novo Nordisk, Amgen, Pfizer and Merck & Co to have seen an increase in patent exposure since Moody’s previous study in 2013.Michael Levesque, the report’s author, said this reflected rising competition from biosimilars— drugs that aim to mimic biological medicines at a lower price.Pharmaceuticals companies have been gradually shifting from chemical-based pills to more complex biological therapies derived from living cells. Whereas traditional drugs typically face low-cost generic competition as soon as their patents expire, so-called biologics are much harder to replicate.This has allowed biological products such as Roche’s breast cancer treatment Herceptin to maintain market dominance even after their patents have begun to expire.Mr Levesque said biosimilars were still a long way from threatening the almost overnight collapse in price and market share faced by non-biological drugs when they go off-patent. But he noted they were gradually gaining acceptance from regulators. In December, an expert panel of the US Food and Drug Administration paved the way for the first US biosimilar when it recommended approval for a copy of Amgen’s Neupogen cancer medicine by Novartis of Switzerland.“Companies with strong emphasis on biotech such as Roche and Biogen Idec still have the greatest protection from patent exposure but competition from biosimilars will gradually increase,” he added.Overall, Moody’s study showed a strengthening in outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry in the last two years ago as drug-development pipelines have improved.The FDA last year approved 41 new medicines— the most for 18 years and its second-highest tally on record. One of these was Opdivo, a hotly-anticipated cancer drug whose $4bn of forecast annual peak sales helped secure Bristol-Myers Squibb top spot in Moody’s ranking of pipeline strength.Amgen and Merck & Co were among others of the 16 companies analysed to show pipeline improvement compared with 2013.Mr Levesque said the industry was showing steady rather than dramatic progress, forecasting that operating profits would grow, on average, in the low-single digits over the next three years.In addition to patent exposure, increased pricing pressure was another brake on growth, he said, highlighting the recent push by US insurers to force discounts from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs.
52;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2015-01-07T19:44:20Z;Kyle Bass plans legal action on pharma patents;Hedge fund manager to target shares for potential falls;A US hedge fund manager who rose to fame by predicting the subprime mortgage crash in 2008 has identified his next target: the pharmaceuticals industry.Kyle Bass, founder of Dallas-based Hayman Capital Management, plans to mount legal challenges against questionable drug patents as part of an investment strategy that would bet on the share prices of targeted companies falling.He said his plan would benefit the world by lowering drug prices — providing a rare example of a hedge fund claiming to align itself with the public good.Mr Bass, who has also placed big bets against Greece and Japan in recent years, told a meeting of investors in Oslo that drug companies were exposed to an attack on weak patents intended to protect against generic competition.“The companies that are expanding patents by simply changing the dosage or the way they are packaging something are going to get knee-capped,” he said, according to Reuters and people who attended the meeting.“This is going to lower drug prices for Medicare and for everyone,” he added, referring to the US social security scheme.Drug patents often come under legal challenge from generic manufacturers looking to break companies’ market exclusivity over medicines but Mr Bass would be the first to take such an approach as part of an investment strategy.He planned to target about 15 companies with a combined market capitalisation of $450bn using the Inter Partes Review process introduced by the US government in 2012 to allow fast-track patent challenges.“We are going to challenge and invalidate patents through the IPR process …[and] we are not going to settle,” said Mr Bass, without identifying the companies he planned to target.While his approach is unique, Mr Bass joins a growing number of activist investors to have trained their sights on the pharmaceuticals industry, which has struggled with low productivity and growth.Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management last year took a stake in Allergan, the maker of Botox, to push an abortive sale to Valeant, while Daniel Loeb’s Third Point took a stake in Amgen to press for a break-up of the company.Pharmaceuticals stocks have performed strongly over recent months amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions and an improving drug development outlook. The US Food and Drug Administration last year approved 41 new medicines — its highest for 18 years.But some analysts and investors remain sceptical about the industry’s prospects as drug prices come under pressure from health providers battling to contain the rising cost of caring for an ageing global population.Mr Bass did not respond to requests from the Financial Times for comment.
53;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;FDA paves way for biosimilar drug approval;US watchdog bullish on copycat biotech drug that could help cut ballooning healthcare costs;The US pharmaceuticals watchdog has published a bullish assessment of a copycat biotech drug, paving the way for it to approve its first ever “ biosimilar” — a novel category of medicine that looks set to cut America’s ballooning healthcare costs.Reviewers at the Food and Drug Administration said a generic version of Neupogen, which counters some of the harmful side effects of chemotherapy, was “highly similar” to the original drug and had “no clinically meaningful differences . . . in terms of safety, purity and potency”.The FDA’s opinion of the medicine is a boost for its developer Sandoz, a generic drugmaker owned by Switzerland-based Novartis. Last year it applied for US approval of the drug, known as Zarzio, which seeks to copy the original medicine made by US biotech group Amgen.Aaron Gal, an analyst at Bernstein, said the FDA’s opinion meant it was now likely that Zarzio would be approved at some point this year, making it the first ever generic version of a biological drug — or “biosimilar” — to be given the green light in the US.In recent years pharma groups have invested huge sums in biological drugs, which are made using living cells, in part because they have been virtually immune to the threat from generic alternatives. They have tried to recoup the cost of developing the drugs by charging high prices, which have strained healthcare systems.Although many of the patents on these biological drugs are set to expire soon, it had been impossible for generic copycat versions to win regulatory approval in the US, the world’s largest healthcare market. That started to change in 2009, when the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act was passed as part of the “Obamacare” reforms, bringing the US in line with Europe, where biosimilars have been allowed for a decade.Analysts at Credit Suisse predict biologics will account for 36 per cent of worldwide spending on drugs in 2018, against 31 per cent last year and 24 per cent in 2008.The dominance of these drugs is even more pronounced among the most popular medicines, such as Humira, AbbVie’s arthritis treatment, and Herceptin, the breast cancer drug made by Roche. Credit Suisse expects biologics to account for almost 80 per cent of spending on top 10 drugs this year.US policy makers hope the introduction of a new wave of biosimilars will help bring down the country’s rising healthcare costs. Rand, a non-profit research organisation, predicts that biosimilars will reduce spending on biological drugs by $44bn over the next decade, resulting in big savings for patients and their healthcare providers.The FDA’s new regulatory regime allows for biosimilar drugmakers to win quick approval by proving there are no clinical differences between their medicines and the ones they are trying to copy, meaning there is no need for them to to invest in lengthy and expensive trials. Sandoz is the first company to apply for approval using this pathway, making its version of Neupogen a closely watched test-case.The FDA published its opinion on the generic version Neupogen in a report ahead of a meeting of its oncology advisory committee on Wednesday.Amgen is trying to delay the approval of Sandoz’s drug in the courts and has filed a lawsuit claiming that Sandoz is not following the correct rules in seeking the go-ahead from the FDA. The US accounted for nearly 84 per cent of Neupogen’s $1.4bn in sales in 2013.

55;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2014-10-22T15:22:51Z;Amgen: splitting hairs;Amgen is not a conglomerate. Breaking it up is pure valuation arbitrage;"Dan Loeb lacks ambition. The investor thinks that Amgen, the big US biotech, should break in two. Why stop there? Amgen should be cut into four, at least.Mr Loeb argues that “disparate business units generally benefit from operating separately due to distinct corporate cultures, superior efficiencies and a greater focus.” So Mr Loeb wants Amgen’s older products put into a cash-generating “MatureCo”. This looks sensible. Neulasta, Aranesp, Epogen and Sensipar all treat blood disorders brought on by kidney failure, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants. They go together.But why should Amgen’s other drugs all be forced into a single “GrowthCo”, as Mr Loeb suggests? Amgen’s treatments for inflammatory conditions (Enbrel and Nplate), cancer (Vectibix and Kyprolis) and bone disease (Prolia/Xgeva) would on Mr Loeb’s logic be trapped in a culturally heterogeneous, inefficient, conflicted conglomerate.Absurd, of course. A four-way split would eliminate more efficiencies than it would create – by multiplying chief executives, regulatory departments, back offices and so on. Amgen is not a conglomerate, like eBay. It makes drugs. MatureCo/GrowthCo split proposals (Pfizer has considered one too) are not about culture, efficiency and focus. They are about valuation arbitrage. Some investors want companies that generate cash; others seek growth. Nobody wants a company stuck between. So break the growthy bit from the cashy bit and the parts are worth more than the whole. A respectable idea, true in many cases, which usually comes wrapped in misleading rhetoric.The maths has to work, of course. The value created by segmenting demand for the shares must be greater than the efficiencies of scale inevitably lost. And all drugs age, some of them quite quickly. It will not be too many years before GrowthCo looks like a very odd label.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex"
56;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2014-10-21T21:54:18Z;Loeb urges Amgen to explore a break-up;Activist investor says the biotech company is trading at a ‘substantial discount’ to its peers;The activist hedge fund manager Dan Loeb has turned his fire on Amgen, calling on the biotechnology company to follow one of the biggest trends for US businesses and explore breaking itself into two.In a letter to investors, Mr Loeb’s Third Point fund said Amgen traded at a “substantial discount” to its biotech peers due to a “bloated cost structure”, a poor return on research and development spending, and its “questionable” $9bn acquisition of Onyx in 2013.Third Point said it had urged management to “seriously consider” the “radical option” of breaking itself into two distinct businesses, an increasingly common demand made by activist investors. Last month eBay announced it would spin off its PayPal unit after pressure from Carl Icahn, while DuPont heeded Nelson Peltz’s calls that it should split into two. Mr Loeb is calling for Dow Chemical to follow suit.Third Point, which described itself as one of Amgen’s “largest shareholders” without disclosing the size of its stake, said the biotech group should put its mature assets into a company focused on cutting costs and boosting cash flow, while a “GrowthCo” would “emphasise product development and innovation”.The letter attributed the break-up idea to George Porges, a Sanford Bernstein analyst, who wrote to investors on Tuesday saying Amgen could “create considerable value” by splitting in two. However, Mr Porges said this was “increasingly unlikely” given the stock’s strong performance in recent months.Shares in Amgen, which have risen by 26 per cent this year, added a further 4.8 per cent in New York to close at $144.09, valuing the company at $108bn.Amgen could also address concerns by streamlining R&D and cutting spending, Third Point argued, adding that “recent efforts to trim costs do not even scratch the potential opportunity”. It also said the company, which halted its buyback programme when it bought Onyx, should consider returning cash to shareholders. However, the break-up of the company had the “most upside”, it said.Amgen has always appreciated the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point, and welcomes constructive input toward our common goal of enhancing shareholder valueThe Third Point letter did not contain any of the aggressive language that has been a hallmark of some of Mr Loeb’s interventions, and Amgen’s response was similarly conciliatory in tone.“Amgen has always appreciated the perspectives of all of its shareholders, including Third Point, and welcomes constructive input toward our common goal of enhancing shareholder value,” the company said in a statement.“The board and management continually assess Amgen’s strategic priorities – and, when appropriate, take action – to set the best path forward to increase shareholder value,” it said.Third Point’s letter also revealed that it had sold its stake in Sony, after it “regrettably” failed to convince management to spin off 15-20 per cent of its US-based entertainment business.However, it said had spurred some change at Sony, including cost cuts, and had made a 20 per cent return on the investment despite the disappointing pace of Japan’s macroeconomic reforms and a string of quarterly profit warnings.
57;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2014-09-02T20:47:33Z;Biotech stocks buoyed by bullish broker UBS;US equity markets waver following Monday holiday;US biotech stocks were buoyed on Tuesday after brokerage UBS lifted price targets for a swathe of companies in the sector on its view that new medications and potential merger and acquisition activity will boost earnings.The investment bank said it remained bullish on the sector, despite a 22 per cent advance by the Nasdaq biotech index this year, ahead of the release of new trial data this autumn.If successful, analysts with the bank say it could “trigger price-to-earnings multiple expansion” as expectations are currently low.“We continue to see new product cycles and mid to long-term growth as a strong basis for valuation despite relative outperformance of large-cap biotech over the past few years,” Matthew Roden, an analyst with UBS, said.Mr Roden added large biotech groups, flush with cash from recent drug hits, would aid shares of smaller companies in the sector.“We are more bullish on mergers and acquisitions given the inflection of cash flows in large-cap, coupled with the need for large-cap to address toughening growth comps by 2016-17, and because mid-caps have done a good job in value creation,” he said.The sector’s advance this year has been in fits and starts, cooling after US politicians, as well as officials at the World Health Organisation, voiced concerns over the price tag of a successful Hepatitis-C treatment.Strong sales results from the Gilead medication alleviated some of those concerns. Several analysts on Wall Street predict first year sales of the treatment will near $10bn.UBS increased its price target on Gilead to $125 from $115, Achillion to $15 from $11, Regeneron to $360 from $320 and Amgen to $155 from $129.Regeneron shares climbed 3 per cent to $359.50, Achillion rose 6 per cent to $12.27 and Gilead advanced 2 per cent to $109.36.Tuesday offered another lesson for investors in biotech: disappointing trial data can cut short a stock’s rally, as was the case with Exelixis.The company, which is engaged in prostate cancer research, said it would lay off 70 per cent of its staff after an experimental drug failed a late-stage study, sending shares 55 per cent lower to $1.85.Family Dollar, which has agreed to sell itself to Dollar Tree for $8.5bn, said it would review a new $80-a-share offer presented by Dollar General, lifting all three companies.In a short statement it said that its board “has not changed its recommendation in support of the merger with Dollar Tree”.Family Dollar last month rebuffed Dollar General’s first, $78.50-a-share bid, arguing that the chief obstacle was its concern that US competition regulators would quash a deal to combine the country’s two largest discount chains.Dollar General said it would divest more stores in an attempt to gain regulatory compliance.Family Dollar shares rose nearly 1 per cent to $80.22, Dollar General increased 1 per cent to $64.36 and Dollar Tree advanced 2 per cent to $54.46.Norwegian Cruise Line agreed to pay $3bn in cash and shares for smaller rival Prestige Cruises, which operates the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Sea Cruises brands.Kevin Sheehan, the chief executive of Norwegian, said that the acquisition would provide for a “solid accretion to earnings per share and drive long-term shareholder value”.Analysts with Stifel Nicolaus said the deal “makes sense” considering Prestige’s position in the luxury cruise market.“Luxury has been the one area of cruise which has been relatively stable over the past couple of years, whereas the contemporary brands have been more impacted by economic events while also being impacted by negative press headlines about the cruise industry,” Steven Wieczynski, an analyst with Stifel, said.Shares of Norwegian soared 11 per cent to $36.99.Overall, US equity markets wavered following a Monday holiday. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,002.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 17,067.56.

Noble Corporation fell half a per cent to $27. Ensco fell 2.1 per cent to $50.52 and Diamond Offshore Drilling fell 1 per cent to $47.09.The S&P oil and gas drilling index fell 1 per cent to 486.66.Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company by sales said on Monday that a late-stage blood-cancer treatment trial had met the study’s primary goal, sending shares 2 per cent higher to $128.65.Kyprolis, the drug at the centre of the trial, increased the time patients lived without their disease worsening by 8.7 months compared to those treated without it.Amgen said the results would help form the basis of the drug’s submission for regulatory approval in the first half of 2015. Wall Street analysts have set high expectations for the drug, with those at UBS expecting sales to reach $1.2bn by 2016.Robert Bradway, chief executive of Amgen, hailed the trial’s results, adding: “Coupled with our recent US regulatory submissions for ivabradine and talimogene laherparepvec and our upcoming regulatory submissions for evolocumab and blinatumomab, our pipeline continues to show notable progress.”Amgen’s gains on Monday come against a volatile year for the wider biotech industry, after the US Federal Reserve voiced concerns over the valuations of biotech, social media and small-cap stocks.The Nasdaq biotech index remains 8 per cent below its February peak.Overall US equities traded slightly higher.

Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $8.10 per share.The upgraded forecast accompanied second-quarter results, which showed an 11 per cent rise in revenues to $5.2bn and 23 per cent increase in profits to $1.55bn.Sales of Enbrel, Amgen’s top drug for arthritis, rose 7 per cent from a year ago. Total product sales rose 8 per cent.Robert Bradway, the company’s chief executive, called the quarterly results “robust”.The company said it also planned to cut as many as 2,900 jobs, or 15 per cent of its workforce, in a bid to cut costs and restructure.The California-based company will consolidate facilities and expects to close plants in Seattle and Bothell, Washington, and Boulder and Longmont, Colorado.“The company is making progress advancing the pipeline while implementing restructuring to redirect spending to support upcoming new product launches in 2015 and 2016 needed to drive top-line growth,” Citi analyst Yaron Werber said.UBS analysts noted Amgen was an “industry bellwether” and its strategic initiatives would likely light a path for other large-cap peers.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shares advanced after the biopharmaceutical company said the US Food and Drug Administration had approved its eye treatment – an injection called Eylea – as a treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema.Analysts with Citigroup estimate Eylea could tally sales of $1.8bn this year.Shares of Amgen advanced 5 per cent to $129.98 while Regeneron climbed 6 per cent to $322.18. The broader Nasdaq biotech index rose 1 per cent to 2,692.61.Twitter shares surged 20 per cent to $46.30 after the company’s latest quarter bucked a disappointing trend in user numbers. The much-watched number of monthly active users increased 6 per cent quarter on quarter and 24 per cent year on year to 271m.Although chief executive Dick Costolo has been squeezing more advertising revenues from each of the company’s users, anxiety over Twitter’s ability to add users has shaped the performance of the shares so far this year.Analysts across Wall Street lifted price targets on the company following its results, with those at RBC saying Facebook provided a “clear road map” of where Twitter profits could go.Facebook shares climbed 1 per cent to $74.68, Yahoo advanced 3 per cent to $36.60 and LinkedIn rose 4 per cent to $187.29.SodaStream shares popped 10 per cent to $32.76 after the company reported second-quarter results ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Revenues climbed in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East and Africa last quarter, lifting overall sales 6.6 per cent to $141.2m.Profits slipped to $9.2m, or 43 cents a share, from $12.9m in the year-ago period. The company said US sales remained under pressure as it “struggled to drive consumer demand and retailers worked through excess inventory carried over from the holiday season”.SodaStream added it is trying to “reposition” the brand in the US “behind health & wellness”.Genworth Financial shares slumped by more than a tenth after the company said higher-than-expected claim costs in its long term care insurance business forced the company to conduct a review of the adequacy of its reserves.Second-quarter profits also trailed Wall Street expectations, at 31 cents per share.

Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
61;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2014-06-30T23:04:33Z;AbbVie puts investor patience in European drugmakers to the test;;Will the last mid-sized European drugmaker please turn off the lights? AbbVie’s £27bn takeover approach for UK-listed Shire has highlighted the scarcity of companies bridging the gap between big pharma and small biotech in Europe.Whereas the US has nurtured a cadre of biotech powerhouses such as Amgen, Biogen Idec and Gilead Sciences that are shaking up the traditional pharmaceuticals industry, Europe has few such examples.Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chief executive, is due in London this week to seek backing from Shire shareholders for a takeover. If he eventually prevails, it would add to a history of European drugmakers being sold before they reach full maturity.“In Europe, investors have not always had the patience to give biopharma companies the time they need to grow,” says Flemming Ornskov, Shire chief executive, pictured, urging investors to back the board’s rejection of AbbVie’s offer.Shire is an unlikely poster child for European life science. While it was founded in the UK, today its management and research are largely US-based and much of its revenues come from treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among American teenagers.Yet it remains European in one important respect: its London listing puts it among the top quartile of the UK’s FTSE 100 index, bigger by market capitalisation than household names such as Tesco, Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems.Since Dr Ornskov took charge last year, Shire has produced the highest shareholder return of any FTSE 100 company. Its takeover would mark the loss of one of the world’s fastest-growing drugmakers from the European investment landscape.Having shifted its tax domicile to Ireland and reduced its UK workforce below 500, Shire cannot count on political support of the kind that helped AstraZeneca, the much bigger British drugmaker, fight off an unwanted £69bn approach from Pfizer last month.The company is almost the definition of the “mid-Atlantic floating entity with no allegiance to anybody except the lowest tax rate” that Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, once warned was eroding public trust in business.Dr Ornskov bridles at such criticism, arguing that all drug companies are global and owe their allegiance to patients and shareholders. But, with nearly half of Shire’s shareholder base in the UK, he says the company has a firm anchor in London.AbbVie’s approach, therefore, provides a test of whether European investors are willing to forgo a hefty premium – of 58 per cent over Shire’s share price in mid April before takeover speculation intensified – in the hope of bigger long-term rewards. Dr Ornskov has predicted a doubling in revenues to $10bn by 2020 as it moves aggressively into high-margin treatments for rare diseases.“Shire together with Actelion have the potential to do something similar to what we have seen from Gilead and Biogen in the US,” says Dr Ornskov, referring to the Swiss biotech company often touted as a takeover target. “If these high-growth European companies keep getting taken out, they are going to get pretty scarce.”The pharmaceuticals sector has been convulsed by deal-making this year as cash-rich drugmakers hunt for growth. For US predators, European companies carry the added appeal of big tax savings by providing a vehicle through which to shelter offshore cash from high US rates.Europe has no shortage of big pharmaceutical groups, with Roche and Novartis of Switzerland, Sanofi of France and GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca of the UK all powerful global players. It also has a strong research base with three of the world’s top five medical science universities – Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London – in the UK, according to Times Higher Education.But while there are several thriving biotech clusters across Europe, relatively few companies reach the scale of Shire or Actelion. Promising UK companies such as Celltech, PowderJect and Cambridge Antibody Technology, have been gobbled up by bigger rivals just as they were hitting their stride.“The US has been much better at developing mid-sized companies,” says Sir John Bell, professor of medicine at Oxford University. “We’ve had 35 years of biotech [in the UK] but very few companies have broken through.”Europe was at the forefront of biotech when Biogen was founded in Geneva in 1978. However, the company soon moved to Boston and listed on Nasdaq, drawn by the greater depth of capital and risk appetite in the US, as well as the bigger drugs market. European biotech has struggled to keep pace ever since.Several promising European companies are emerging, such as Genmab in Denmark, Morphosys in Germany and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, with more following behind. Almost $500m has been raised by biotech companies from five initial public offerings in Europe so far this year, exceeding the $305m raised from six IPOs in the whole of last year, according to Mergermarket.However, the tally pales in comparison with Nasdaq, where 32 biotech IPOs have taken place so far this year, raising $1.98bn.Whereas the US has many specialist healthcare funds attuned to the rhythms of drug development, European companies are more dependent on generalist investors.David Solomon, chief executive of Zealand Pharma, a Danish biotech company, points to Novo Nordisk as proof of what can be achieved with long-term support. The Danish diabetes specialist has grown into a near-$100bn company backed by the foundation that controls it.“You need large funds that see the long-term value and build a durable partnership with the company,” says Mr Solomon. “That has been the challenge in Europe.”
62;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2014-06-12T22:26:52Z;Taxing time ahead as offshore rules come under more scrutiny;;The OECD called it “ the golden age” of tax planning: a period in which multinational companies pushed ever more of their profits offshore and pushed their effective tax rates down.In the past eight years, this simple strategy has enabled some of the largest US corporations – including Oracle, Microsoft, and Johnson & Johnson – to cut their tax bills by a quarter, on average – while boosting their annual earnings by up to 24 per cent.But there are signs that both politicians and investors are increasingly questioning the merits of a tax regime that has made such savings possible.Earlier this week, the joint committee on taxation, which advises the US Congress, warned that American companies were incurring extra costs from keeping their profits outside the US. It cited research showing a “ballooning” of company balance sheets, as multinationals chose to borrow more for spending purposes, rather than repatriate their offshore cash and pay US tax on it.Investors are also starting to worry that the positive effect of tax-cutting strategies on companies’ earnings could go into reverse. Earlier this month, Luca Paolini, chief strategist of Pictet Asset Management, warned investors against complacency by pointing out that a quarter of international companies’ improvement in net margins had been achieved only by reducing their tax bills.Many technology and pharmaceuticals companies have been at the forefront of a 15-year push by US multinationals to earn more of their profits in tax havens and in low-tax jurisdictions, such as Ireland and Singapore.To measure this, the Financial Times reviewed the accounts of 14 cash-rich tech and pharmaceuticals companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Amgen, EMC, eBay, Eli Lilly and Medtronic.Between them, the 14 held $479bn-worth of cash and similar assets offshore – a little more than half of the $947bn of total offshore cash that Moody’s estimated was held by US non-financial companies at the end of 2013.By doing so, the 14 companies surveyed cut their tax rates by an average of 7.7 percentage points between 2004-06 and 2011-13. In the most recent period, they were, on average, taxed at a rate of just 10 per cent, down from 11 per cent in 2004-06. By comparison, average OECD corporate tax rates fell 3.4 points to 25.15 per cent over that timescale.A little more than 85 per cent of this average tax reduction could be attributed to the companies’ fast expanding foreign operations.Many of the companies point out that these apparently low foreign tax rates are not the full story. Investors, they say, are fully aware that they owe extra tax to the US – at a rate of up to 35 per cent – on any foreign earnings when they are brought back to the US.They are exempt only from reporting the “deferred” tax charge – reflecting the money they will ultimately have to pay the US – in their accounts for as long as they can prove the profits are being indefinitely reinvested abroad. And a company’s decision to indefinitely reinvest its cash overseas can be reversed, resulting in big increases in the reported tax rates. For example, eBay recently surprised the market by reporting a $2.3bn loss after recording a $3bn deferred tax liability, saying that it needed the “flexibility” to use foreign cash for US dealmaking.Pfizer, the world’s largest pharmaceuticals company, also bucked the trend of falling tax rates, after a 2011 change in its accounting treatment. It has provided for $6.6bn of deferred tax – nearly two-thirds of its total tax bill over the past three years. It was the only company surveyed by the FT to report a tax rate above 25 per cent for 2011-13, except for Apple, which also reports “deferred” tax on some of its offshore earnings.Regulators are now pushing some cash-rich companies to disclose more details of their offshore cash. Google recently had to explain to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it planned to spend up to $30bn on foreign acquisitions and technology rights, after it was challenged to describe its “specific plans” for reinvesting undistributed earnings.In addition, the SEC has called on some companies to explain why their foreign profits are “disproportionate” to their foreign sales. On average, the companies surveyed by the FT reported two-thirds of their profits outside the US but only half their sales. This followed an eight-year period in which foreign profits grew at nearly three times the pace of foreign sales – a trend similar to one identified by Harry Grubert, senior economist at the US Treasury. He warned that “profits, not sales, are being globalised” after discovering a 14 percentage-point increase in foreign profits at multinationals, as a proportion of the total, between 1996 and 2004.Last year, the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of Congress, warned that the process was continuing as US companies moved more profits out of high tax countries, including the US, into “tax preferred” countries, such as Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.Some companies argue that relatively higher profit margins outside the US are to be expected, given the heavy research and development costs they incur in their home country, the cost of servicing US debt, the cost of their corporate headquarters and, in some cases, US litigation costs.David Lewis, vice-president of global taxes and assistant treasurer of Eli Lilly, says that it is “unremarkable” that the company’s reinvested earnings had more than doubled in a period when sales growth had only nearly doubled. “This doubling should be expected of a company that is growing throughout the world, especially in non-US markets,” he argues.Oracle, Johnson & Johnson and EMC declined to comment. Pfizer, Cisco, Qualcomm, Merck, Amgen and Medtronic did not respond to request for comment. Google made no formal comment and eBay said that it complied with all international tax rules. Microsoft and Apple referred to past statements in which they said that they abided by US and foreign tax laws – but believed they should be improved.‘Book tax’ more important than cash kindUS companies invest about 55 per cent of their near $2tn of foreign earnings in productive assets, such as factories and offices, according to academic research. But some of them have told researchers that they would bring more of this cash back to the US if they were not deterred by the prospect of high tax bills.Companies also say that the accounting rules create an incentive for them to designate their offshore earnings as “permanently reinvested” abroad, as this spares them from the need to earmark money in their accounts to pay future US tax bills.Academic studies have even found that so called “book tax” – the tax bill that is reported in a company’s accounts, but may vary from the “cash tax” amount that is actually paid – can influence share prices, executive bonuses and competitor analysis.Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California says: “Book tax is extremely important. It is the filter through which we see companies. It dominates corporate behaviour much more than cash taxes do.”Michelle Hanlon, a professor at MIT, says that her research shows that moving offshore and retaining cash there is at least in part driven by “the accounting for taxes that shows up on the financial accounting statements”, in addition to the real financial impact.
63;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2014-04-07T21:13:47Z;Pfizer falls as treatment trial disappoints;;Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals group, weakened on Monday after results of a mid-stage experimental breast cancer treatment trial disappointed investors, despite meeting the primary goal of the study.The trial of palbociclib, an oral medication, has been closely watched by market participants, many of whom believe it could top $5bn in sales at its peak if approved.On Sunday, Pfizer released detailed results of a second phase trial which showed a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival. The median time before the cancer began to grow again or the women died was 20.2 months, compared to 10.2 months in the control group.“These data demonstrate the potential of palbociclib to be a major advance in the treatment of women with this type of advanced breast cancer,” said Mace Rothenberg, Pfizer’s chief medical officer.Dr Rothenberg has estimated the treatment could benefit roughly 60 per cent of women with breast cancer.While analysts have called the results impressive, they nonetheless marked a slight deterioration from the midpoint of the trial, when the difference in progression-free survival between the treatment and control group was a larger 18.6 months.“While some investors have expressed concern about the magnitude of the progression-free survival benefit, interim overall survival or filing timeline – we see all meaningful indicators looking favourable,” Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin said.Shares in the drug company slid 3 per cent to $31.20. Shares in Amgen, which is entitled to an 8 per cent royalty on palbociclib sales, dipped 0.3 per cent to $118.82.The shift lower comes amid mounting declines for much of the biotech industry, which was lifted by strong fund flows in the first quarter and through 2013. Analysts and strategists have pointed to a reassessment of valuations.“While investors continue to look for growth opportunities in this low earnings growth and revenue growth environment, the continuing market rally is producing some stretched valuations, and value stocks could therefore become more attractive,” said Morgan Stanley strategist Adam Parker.Technology companies, including Yahoo, TripAdvisor and Baidu, were also put under pressure by the rotation, each falling by about 3 per cent.MannKind shares sank 8 per cent at $6.32 after the company said US regulators had extended the review timetable of its inhalable version of insulin by three months.The decision, which was expected, will give the US Food and Drug Administration extra time to review the company’s application for Afrezza.The news comes a week after the drug won backing from the an FDA committee, a key hurdle in the process of coming to market.Genworth Financial led the benchmark S&P 500 lower after the company was named in an investor lawsuit on Friday.Investors have charged they were misled over the timing of Genworth’s public offering of its Australian mortgage insurance business, which was subsequently delayed and prompted a 24 per cent slide in the company’s stock.Genworth shares closed down 4 per cent at $17.07.General Motors continued to weaken, after a US senator called for the company to make restitution to victims’ families in relation to an ignition switch recall that has been linked to at least 13 deaths.Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri and chairwoman of the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection, told a Sunday news programme the carmaker faced a “real moment of truth” and faced a criminal investigation.“Now it’s time for them to come clean, be transparent and most of all make all victims whole, no matter when this deadly ignition caused heartbreak in their families,” Ms McCaskill told ABC. Shares in GM closed down 2 per cent at $34.11.Overall, US equities weakened for a third straight day, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite extending last week’s losses to 4.5 per cent, after another 1 per cent fall to 4,079.75 on Monday.The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,845.04 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 1 per cent to 16,245.87.
64;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2013-08-26T20:04:11Z;Amgen/Onyx: at what price growth?;Focus is on Kyprolis, the multiple myeloma drug;"What was the premium? The value of the cost savings? The multiple of the target’s current earnings paid? In most $10bn acquisitions, these are the questions. In biotech deals, where the value of the target is derived primarily from a new drug – such as Amgen’s agreed cash purchase of Onyx, announced late on Sunday – the answers are mostly uninformative. Amgen is paying, mainly, for Kyprolis, Onyx’s drug for multiple myeloma, approved in the US last year. Cost savings and the rest of Onyx’s products are a bonus. Kyprolis will prove effective, and sell enough to recoup the price plus a good return, or not. The end.This leaves financial analysts with little to do but some version of the following maths: estimate the population affected by multiple myeloma each year, Kyprolis’s potential market share, its duration of treatment, price per month and profit margin; multiply these figures together to get annual profits – and hope to be off by no more than, oh, a third or so.Piper Jaffray, a broker, sees Kyprolis pulling in $1.5bn in 2017 sales, and adding $1.31, or about 14 per cent, to Amgen’s earnings per share that year, and growing from there. If that is about right (other brokers have similar hopes), Amgen just paid $9.7bn for the chance – the chance – to increase its five-year EPS growth rate by two or three percentage points, and for the possibility of some upside to that.The market thinks the deal clever, sending Amgen’s shares up sharply on Monday. Suppose, though, Amgen took the opposite tack and spent the same money buying back its own shares (at a premium of 10 per cent to their undisturbed price). Amgen would get solid double-digit accretion to EPS, right now, with no risk at all. Alternatively, the company could pay out a $13 special dividend. The real question for biotech investors is: at what price growth?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
65;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2013-08-25T22:32:50Z;Amgen’s $10.5bn takeover of Onyx approved by both boards;Deal is latest sign of merger activity among pharmaceuticals;Amgen said on Sunday night that its takeover of Onyx, the US cancer drug developer, at $125 a share had been approved by both boards, in the latest example of increasing acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical sector.The $10.5bn deal continues a series of purchases by Amgen, which has been seeking to diversify its portfolio at a time of intensifying competitive pressure including generic “biosimilar” threats to its biological treatments.It also suggests that larger companies are ready to pay significant premiums for biotech businesses, with Amgen’s offer of $125 a share reflecting a high multiple of 13 times earnings.“We believe that Amgen is strongly positioned to realize the full potential of Onyx’s portfolio and pipeline,” said Robert Bradway, Amgen chairman and chief executive officer.Tony Coles, chairman and CEO of Onyx, said: “We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Amgen, a company that shares Onyx’s vision for innovation.”Onyx, based in San Francisco, specialises in oncology products led by Nexavar for kidney and liver cancer, which has been commercialised outside the US by Bayer of Germany. Some analysts project that Kyprolis, Onyx’s new treatment for multiple myeloma approved by US regulators last year, will generate annual peak sales in excess of $2bn.The company had revenues from Nexavar in the second quarter of this year of $82m and $61m from Kyprolis.Amgen’s move comes after a run of takeovers, including Elan’s purchase by Perrigo for up to $8.6bn. Consolidating deals within the sector have also included Actavis, which bought Warner Chilcott for $11bn and Valeant, which took over Bausch & Lomb for $8.7bn.Other larger companies interested in midsize deals include Novartis, Sanofi and AstraZeneca.Shire, the Ireland-domiciled, UK-quoted speciality pharmaceuticals group, has often been mentioned as a target, including most recently by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Shire says it remains open to deals, following three under its new chief executive.Amgen made an earlier $120 a share bid in June for Onyx, valuing the company at about $8.5bn. Rival companies including Astrazeneca, Pfizer and Novartis also examined the acquisition of the cancer drug developer, although Jörg Reinhardt, the incoming chairman of Novartis, appeared to rule out a purchase in recent public comments. Bidders had sought greater clinical data on the performance of Kyprolis.The proposal marked the most ambitious takeover proposal yet by Mr Bradway, the former investment banker who replaced Kevin Scharer as chief executive of Amgen last year.

You are already on your own private island, bought with some of the 1,400 per cent total return the US biotech company has delivered since 2003, and it is approaching cocktail hour. The rest of us should listen up.The biotech sector has recovered from a long slump after the 2000 technology crash. The Nasdaq Biotech index is 18 per cent above its high, after a bumper rally this year. A burst of dealmaking is keeping things interesting. Is this another bubble?The quick answer is yes. The rally has left no room for disappointment. When Amgen turned in sales numbers for the first quarter of 2013 a whisker below what Wall Street had pencilled in, its shares sank 7 per cent. (They are still up strongly on a 12-month basis.) Given the tough economic climate and tangled regulatory approval environment, there may well be more negative earnings surprises in store.Consider the long answer, though. Biotech is the Silicon Valley of the healthcare industry. It is where seed capital chases the best new drug ideas. The pharmaceuticals sector is grappling with a patent expiry crisis, and biotech – which often concentrates on a single drug or treatment area – is the beneficiary.Inflows into exchange-traded biotech funds are running at half as much again in 2013 as in all of 2012. That has fuelled a sharp outperformance – the NBI has offered almost double the returns of the S&P 500 in the year to date. Even a relative minnow such as the London-listed Biotech Growth Trust has offered twice the returns of the FTSE 100 this year. And the sector is not overpriced. Research from Deutsche Bank shows that biotechs’ price/earnings multiples are not historically high.Some biotechs are so big – Celgene, Amgen and Gilead are worth a combined $215bn – they could be mistaken for Big Pharma. Yet Sanofi’s purchase of Genzyme in 2011 did not spark large-scale consolidation. Deals are centred on smaller companies such as Elan and Life Technologies. This rally may well point to the prospect of bigger ones.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
67;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Beware side-effects of biotech boom;Scale of rally suggests caution is warranted;"If you need a pick-me-up, look at biotechnology companies. They may not have drugs approved for sale, but their shares are having their best start to a year since the sector was invented in the mid-1990s.The Nasdaq biotech index is up 31 per cent so far. The six S&P 500 biotechs averaged 40 per cent in spite of disappointing earnings from Amgen, the biggest.This would make sense if there had been a stunning discovery, a cure for cancer or, perhaps even more profitable, for the common cold. There hasn’t. Instead, hopes are high of big findings in the future. Investors speak excitedly of cures for hepatitis C, of fatal cancers becoming treatable, of genomics finally delivering on its promise.The scale of the rally suggests caution is warranted; after all, nothing much has changed this year, aside from investor sentiment – and that sentiment is being driven by the wash of money pouring out of the Federal Reserve and into markets. Most has ended up in safer, dividend-yielding stocks and junk bonds, which offer an alternative to the negligible yields available on government bonds. But some is fuelling speculation, and there is nothing more speculative than the biotech sector. Other speculative classics, such as gold mining and oil and gas exploration, look unappealing amid falling commodity prices.Valuations matter little for biotechs, many of which are lossmaking. Approval for a blockbuster drug puts the cost of the laboratories used to develop it into the shade, too, so book value is hard to use. Still, the valuation of the entire sector can be examined: in the US it is close to five times estimated book value, for the first time since the summer of 2004. In a year the valuation has almost doubled.Biotech has had speculative booms before, as investors bet on new technology curing the world’s ills. It did not work out in the late 1990s, or in 2007. Investors can do little more than hope that this time they find a panacea."
68;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2013-01-17T23:14:31Z;Healthcare: Consumers and industry brace for change as Obamacare rolls out;Law improves access to medical aid but, Alan Rappeport asks, will it cut costs?;The healthcare landscape in the US is set for a big makeover, as the signature piece of legislation from President Barack Obama’s first term becomes fully implemented in the next four years.Mr Obama’s re-election will probably cement many of the reforms from the 2010 law, which drew fierce opposition from his opponents and was narrowly upheld by the US Supreme Court last year. Exorbitant healthcare costs are one of the biggest drags on US fiscal solvency and the law, which requires most Americans to buy health insurance, is intended to reduce medical costs by improving access to treatment.Among the biggest changes imposed by the law will be the development of state insurance exchanges, where people can shop for more insurance products and compare plans more easily. States have the choice to set up their own exchanges or allow the Federal government to develop them, and consumers that are unemployed or work for small businesses will be able to make purchases through them by next year.As consumers familiarise themselves with a vast new set of rules, industry is also bracing for big changes. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies are facing additional taxes and hospitals are expected to continue to consolidate to increase their buying power and prevent suppliers from passing on price hikes. Insurers face new limits on how much profit they can keep from premiums and reviews by state authorities on price increases greater than 10 per cent.“There is increasing pressure on us to reduce costs,” said Dr Toby Cosgrove, chief executive of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.The clinic has become a model other hospitals are looking at for ways to reduce costs. It has taken a “team medicine” approach where groups of specialists collaborate to treat individual patients. It has invested in electronic medical records and is so heavily focused on efficient use of supplies that it labels the cost of surgical materials in its operating rooms.The clinic’s approach uses some of the principles of “accountable care organisations” that the new health law is trying to promote. The physician-based groups are intended to promote better co-ordination of care, more attention to preventive medicine and, ultimately, better outcomes than the present system.Although medical technology in the US is envied elsewhere, studies have shown it lagging behind other rich countries in terms of health outcomes. The US ranks near the bottom of the 34 OECD countries in terms of life expectancy and suffers more than its peers when it comes to chronic disease and obesity.Disappointing medical outcomes are occurring even as the US spends far more than any other country in the world on healthcare. Although medical cost growth has levelled off in recent years, much of this is attributed to a weak economic backdrop and high rates of unemployment. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found health expenditures account for 16.4 per cent of US gross domestic product, compared with a median of 8.8 per cent in other OECD countries.Kenneth Frazier, chief executive of Merck, the world’s second-largest drug company, argues that cultural and behavioural trends in the US are important factors that are making it difficult to rein in costs.“A lot of it is the habits of Americans in terms of what we eat, how much we exercise, drinking. Of course, we have a problem with other pathologies, including violence in our country,” he told the Financial Times.Although “Obamacare” is expected to improve access to health insurance and medical care, its ability to change behaviour and cut costs remains less clear. Some of that uncertainty is due to the fact that all of the provisions of the law have not yet been defined and the possibility of unintended consequences.Detractors have pointed to early signs the law is not working. Insurers have been raising premiums in states that have not adopted powers to block big price increases. Owners of some restaurant chains say they will reduce workers’ hours, taking advantage of a loophole in the law that does not require them to provide insurance to part-time employees.Some groups disregard the law altogether. Several states have said they will not take federal funds that the law affords to expand the Medicaid health programme for the poor. Most states opted not to create their own health insurance exchanges. And fringe movements are trying to promote legislation to nullify the law.All the conflicting forces likely mean that the rollout of Obamacare will be as bumpy and contentious as the law’s passage.“We’ve got a crazy quilt of inconsistent incentives that have become embedded in the public’s mind and so any attempt to change these …just evokes a ferocity of response, a layer of misinformation and a lack of real dialogue that’s stunning,” Kevin Sharer, the recently retired chief executive of Amgen, the biotechnology company, told the Financial Times recently.
69;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Amgen pleads guilty to illegal drug marketing;;Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company by revenues, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges in the US that it illegally marketed one of its best-selling drugs and agreed to pay more than $700m in fines.Amgen has been ensnared in whistleblower lawsuits around its branding of Aranesp, for anaemia. The company was accused of enticing doctors with kickbacks and free samples of the medicine so they would use it instead of cheaper alternatives, billing Medicare and private insurers.Amgen was also accused of promoting the drug “off-label” to treat anaemia caused by cancer, even though it was not approved for that purpose.Amgen agreed to a $612m civil settlement, a $14m forfeiture and $136m in criminal fines. The company said in a filing in September it had set aside $806m for charges related to the proposed settlement of the suit.“Amgen today entered a conditional plea of guilty to one misdemeanour count of misbranding Aranesp,” said Ashleigh Koss, for Amgen. “If the court accepts the plea and enters an agreed sentence, Amgen expects immediately thereafter to complete the comprehensive resolution of related civil and criminal matters.”In 2009, 15 US states sued Amgen for offering medical providers sham consultancy agreements and weekend retreats so that they would buy and prescribe Aranesp. Government-sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programmes were billed for thousands of ineligible claims and hundreds of millions of dollars in treatments when less expensive alternatives were available.“Drugs should be prescribed to patients on the basis of need, effectiveness, and safety, not on a corporate giant’s promise of an all-expense paid vacation,” Andrew Cuomo, the then attorney-general, said at the time.Lawyers representing one of the whistleblowers said they hoped the settlement would deter drug companies from illegally marketing their products.“We are pleased with this outcome and believe it will go a long way in preventing Amgen from continuing to violate federal regulations by promoting the off-label use of its powerful drugs and providing medical providers with kickbacks for inappropriately prescribing them,” said David Sanford, chairman of Sanford Heisler. “This settlement will also empower pharmaceutical sales representatives to blow the whistle on their employers’ illegal actions.”Aranesp generated more than $2bn in sales last year. Amgen has been trying to boost sales and restock its product pipeline as demand for some of its best selling drugs has levelled off amid safety concerns.Last week, Amgen said it would purchase Decode Genetics for $415m in cash from a consortium of private investors as it tries to strengthen its expansion into genetically targeted treatmentsIts shares fell 0.2 per cent to close at $89.29.
70;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-12-10T19:41:11Z;Amgen to acquire genetics pioneer Decode;;Amgen is to buy Decode Genetics, injecting new life into the Icelandic company that pioneered large-scale genetic sequencing but sparked ethical debates and failed to find a successful commercial strategy.The US biotech group – seeking to strengthen its own expansion into genetically targeted treatments – will pay $415m in cash to acquire Decode from a consortium of private investors who bought it out of bankruptcy in 2010.Decode’s history reflected initially high hopes over the potential and speed of the genomic revolution. However, its initial public offering in 2000 was followed by financial difficulties as it failed to turn discoveries rapidly into new medicines.It collected full genetic sequences of 2,600 Icelanders and, given the country’s relative isolation, was able to extrapolate significant information on 320,000 past or present inhabitants.Kari Stefansson, founder and chief executive, said: “This is the first time those who are singing the praises of human genetics to empower drug discovery have put their money where their mouth is.“We struggled turning our discoveries into tangible benefits. This is a new opportunity for us to deliver on the dream that we had in the very beginning.”Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, said: “An enormous problem for the industry is working on . . . drug targets that end up not being highly relevant to human disease because they have been validated in contrived animal models. Human genetic technology will give us a huge degree of confidence into where to pour resources and where to back away.”Decode sparked debates over confidentiality and whether the Icelandic government had sold individuals’ control over their genetic information.Mr Stefansson said: “We were entering into a new era, and there were a lot of questions about the nature of informed consent and whether it was appropriate that a private enterprise should be working on discovery. Most have been answered. All over the world people are trying to replicate what we did.”Mr Harper said Decode would continue to make findings public, continuing a trend of publications including drivers of Alzheimer’s and the impact of a father’s age on diversity.Jeffrey Barrett, group leader at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute at Oxford, praised Decode’s pioneering role. “There was an over-promising of how quickly we could deliver medicines and now there is a slight overreaction in the opposite direction,” he said.Subsequent large-scale genetic studies in other countries including Finland, and the falling cost of genetic sequencing, had reduced the unique detail of Decode’s data, he said, but it had continued to provide valuable information on disease and markers that could lead to future treatments.
71;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Lessons from corporate America;Kevin Sharer, outgoing head of Amgen, explains how the group taught him to be patient;"On a frosty November afternoon in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Kevin Sharer, chairman of Amgen, is poring over a notepad as he tries to work out a cost analysis of FedEx.After more than a decade as chief executive of the world’s largest biotechnology company – Amgen became an anomaly in an industry known for being small and scrappy – Mr Sharer has traded the boardroom for the classroom.As a professor of corporate strategy at Harvard Business School, worries over patent cliffs – when intellectual property rights for blockbuster drugs expire, causing revenues to collapse – and even US government fiscal cliffs are being replaced by the pressure of facing questions from bright young minds.“It’s really bracing at this stage in your life to be a complete raw rookie,” says Mr Sharer, who retired as chief executive of Amgen this year and steps down as chairman at the end of December.It is indeed a big shift for Mr Sharer. Under his leadership, Amgen’s annual sales grew from $3bn when he took the helm in 2000 to $16bn when he step­ped down, with profits multiplying and its focus widening from drugs that fight anaemia to the treatment of osteoporosis and soon, potentially, obesity.● Born: 1948 in Clinton, Iowa

● Family: Married, two children
● Interests: Cycling, skiing, golfFounded in 1980, the California up­start that made a business out of the new science of recombinant DNA now rivals many “Big Pharma” companies in terms of its resources and reach. By harnessing molecular biology and gene splicing technology, Amgen helped to define the biotech sector.It was the breadth of Mr Sharer’s corporate experience and his background that appealed to Harvard, which often draws on former executives. His new job is the capstone to a career that has been a classic climb to the top of corporate America.Mr Sharer attributes his successes to good luck, taking risks and an ability to change course if needed. “Seizing the opportunity always involves risk. You’ve got to have courage,” he says.He learnt about courage during his training at the US Naval Academy. After graduating in 1971 with a degree in engineering, Mr Sharer served on a nuclear attack submarine as the cold war intensified.Although he enjoyed the discipline and adventure, Mr Sharer wanted new challenges and different kinds of pressures, so he changed tack in the early 1980s to immerse himself in management consultancy at McKinsey. Two years later he moved to General Electric, learning the nuts and bolts of corporate operations by running business units under Jack Welch, its long-serving chief executive.Looking back, Mr Sharer says, he was plagued with impatience to rise quickly in his career. In 1989, he left GE to run sales and marketing at MCI, the telecommunications company. But he clashed with the culture and felt his career languished after he gave the CEO un­solicited advice on how to structure the business units.“Their culture was a culture that I couldn’t really learn how to manoeuvre in,” says Mr Sharer. “I was young, I was arrogant and so things didn’t go well for me there.”But in 1992, Amgen came calling with the offer of a job to run sales, marketing and government relations. This turned out to be a corporate home where Mr Sharer, now 64, would remain for 20 years.After eight years, he took over as chief executive – the third person in the company’s 12-year history to hold the position.Mr Sharer quickly shook things up, recruiting a new leadership team and moving much of the company’s manufacturing operations to Puerto Rico. “That was a big risk,” he says. “A good way to lose a biotech company is to have manufacturing [fail].”Within two years, he had led Am­gen’s 2002 acquisition of Seattle-based Immunex, which manufactured Enbrel, the strong-selling arthritis drug, for $16bn. He also led the development of Denosumab, the blockbuster osteoporosis drug.However, as Amgen grew in size, critics contended that it had lost sight of its roots as a nimble, fast-growing biotech company and became more like any lumbering pharmaceutical group with a stagnant stock price. It was an issue that he acknowledged in 2006, as he noted Amgen’s need to stay “small and hungry in feel and behaviour as we grow larger”.In some ways, Mr Sharer says, Amgen transcends easy definitions. “We are – I think – an example of the potential of a biotech company,” he says. “We are what other people in many ways would want to be – a big, successful company.”But Amgen has also had its struggles with drug safety concerns and investor frustration. Mr Sharer has been criticised by shareholders for being overpaid – before the recent trend for decrying excessive pay – and for investing heavily in research that failed to yield commensurate results.“We certainly had our crises, we had our surprises, I had nights when I couldn’t go to sleep,” says Mr Sharer. “But I was not a guy who spent a lot of time on what I would call unproductive, unconstructive worry.”Mr Sharer has handed the reins to Robert Bradway, whom he recruited from Morgan Stanley to be chief operating officer, and the company continues to ramp up its res­earch spending in hopes of developing drugs to lower cholesterol levels and combat obesity.As Mr Sharer starts his new professorial role at Harvard, the challenge is not unlike when he started at Amgen and plunged into biology after a lifetime as an engineer and businessman.It was critical for him as a non-scientist CEO to make sure he learnt enough about the science of the biotech industry to be credible, while also maintaining the mindset of a manager. It required tutors, textbooks and years of perseverance to learn to think differently so that he could make decisions about in­vestment and research and earn the respect of the company’s scientists.“One of the things that you have to do to be certified as a chief engineer in the American Submarine Force is have comprehensive knowledge of the reactor plant – everything from theory of every dimension and chemical, electrical, nuclear, metallurgy,” he explains. “I’d had to master taking apart in [my] head a very complex system and I thought biology’s kind of like that.”The experience helped Mr Sharer leave behind much of his earlier impatience and arrogance and develop as a leader, he says, as he learnt to trust colleagues with deeper experience in drug development. Finally at the top, he became a better listener and ceased trying to be the smartest person in a room.“I realised that being in the moment meant giving the person you were with your full attention and that’s the best way to convey respect, and listen for comprehension,” he says. “As I became more comfortable as chief executive, I didn’t have to worry that I was going to impress.”The same skills are helping him now, as he wrestles with complex case studies across a range of industries and prepares for life as a professor. The challenge could be as tough as learning biology.“You can’t wing it by power of position or authority or presumed competence,” he says. “When you’re the CEO, if you say something, prob­ably people are going to believe you. This is a completely different environment.”The pace will be different too. Gone is the focus on quarterly earnings and the constant travel. Mr Sharer’s cadre of assistants has been replaced with one and instead of meetings with bankers and investors, Prof Shar­er sees students seeking advice.“Probably the biggest transition I’ve made here is the move from the CEO emergency room doctor-triage mindset to one of a more thoughtful, reflective, penetrating mindset.”"
72;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-09-02T23:07:01Z;Tax-exempt funds sought for tech sector;;Individual investors would be able to place up to £15,000 tax free each year into funds to support British high-technology companies, under proposals submitted on Monday to the government by the biotech industry trade body.The BioIndustry Association (BIA) called for the creation of “mass market” citizens’ innovation funds in the UK for mid net-worth taxpayers, totalling £300m a year, to help create more British equivalents of Apple and Amgen.The idea was inspired by France’s Fonds Commun de Placement dans l’Innovation, with 300 such funds raising more than €6bn and investing in more than 1,000 young companies. BIA said their support had increased the likelihood of sales, credit, patents and initial public offerings.Steve Bates, chief executive, said: “Citizens’ innovation funds provide a practical way of unlocking the patriotic potential of a large number of Britons to ‘crowdfund’ the innovative businesses essential for our nation’s economic future.”The BIA says in a report that tax deductible investments should be pooled for five years, placed by professional fund managers into predominantly innovative research-intensive young companies, and any capital gains on maturity should be tax free.It concludes: “While the UK continues to fund a world class and productive research and science base a continued lack of equity and venture funding will damage the long-term prospects of translating such ideas into products.”The idea follows continued frustration in the industry at the low levels of risk capital available for fledgling biotech companies, with the result that many promising experimental medicines are not developed and successful small businesses are bought by foreign groups.However, investor returns in France had been modest before the tax relief offered, with one estimate placing the internal rate of return at -3 per cent in the years up to 2010, in line with venture capital, according to the BIA.The investment criteria and the nature of backers would distinguish the funds from the UK’s tax efficient venture capital trusts and enterprise investment schemes, it added.
73;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Deal boosts AstraZeneca’s interim chief;;The $7bn planned acquisition of Amylin announced this weekend is an indicator of interest in the fast-growing diabetes market, a symbol of the need for large pharmaceutical companies to find new products and a sign of a senior executive’s eagerness to seal a deal to cap his career.By overseeing a pioneering joint takeover in which he let his US partner Bristol-Myers Squibb take the lead, Simon Lowth, the interim chief executive of AstraZeneca, has pushed ahead with a transaction that shares risk, keeps costs low and helps compensate for the dearth of marketed and late-stage experimental drugs in the Anglo-Swedish group’s pipeline.“This is very exciting news and further expands our ambitions to become global leaders,” he told an analysts’ call. “Diabetes is an important strategy focus for AstraZeneca, a disease of epidemic global scale.”It also helps boost Mr Lowth’s standing in the race to replace David Brennan as head of AstraZeneca, showing a desire for controlling costs, maintaining dividends and identifying new deals. It follows a recent partnership he helped broker with Amgen, and the purchase of Ardea, in efforts to compensate for falling sales on a series of blockbuster drugs losing their exclusive patent rights.“In our opinion, the Amylin transaction is a step in the right direction on a long road and an important first step for Simon Lowth’s candidacy as AstraZeneca’s permanent CEO,” noted analysts at Leerink Swann on Monday.In the first stage of the acquisition, Bristol-Myers Squibb purchases Amylin, the San Diego diabetes company, for $31 a share in cash. That values the deal at $5.3bn, ahead of a further $1.7bn in royalty commitments and debts that it assumes.AstraZeneca then pays $3.4bn, or almost half of the total cost, to BMS, which wraps the Amylin assets into the two larger companies’ existing diabetes joint venture. In a second stage, it has the option to make a $135m balancing payment to re-establish a precise 50:50 split.Not everyone is convinced about the value of the deal, which represents a purchase price of seven times Amylin’s sales. “Investors may grit their teeth at the price, but AstraZeneca’s joint acquisition of Amylin was strategically necessary and consistent with previous management communication,” wrote Panmure.“Will the acquisition of Amylin dramatically change the outlook for either Bristol-Myers Squibb or AstraZeneca? Probably not,” said Bernstein Research. It assessed as “modest” the eventual earnings accretion to each company, given the purchasers’ large existing overall sales relative to future likely performance of Amylin’s drugs split between them.An auction for Amylin began earlier this year between a number of large pharmaceutical groups, following the unwinding of the company’s existing partnership with Eli Lilly. That had offered the benefit of a full range of diabetes products including insulins for those with more advanced forms of the condition.Some interpret the failure of that partnership as a loss of confidence in the relative value of Amylin’s GLP1s, a new class of drugs to treat earlier stage, pre-insulin diabetes in which it was the leader. But Novo Nordisk has since launched its rival Victoza, which has taken significant market share, and other rivals are also developing variants.Another analyst argues there could be tensions over future strategy between AstraZeneca and BMS in their joint venture, notably given the former’s reputation for aggressively cutting costs and preserving cash for shareholders.They may disagree, for instance, over whether to risk substantial sums in a “head-to-head” comparative clinical trial to test the performance of its products against Victoza and other competitors.But by the time such issues have played out, Mr Lowth will either have lost out to a rival in the race to run AstraZeneca, or be running the company and have to handle the consequences himself.
74;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-06-17T17:27:18Z;Alarm sounded on copycat drugs regulation;;When Amgen, the biotechnology group, announced last year that it was teaming up with Watson Pharmaceuticals, a rival maker of generic drugs, to make cheaper versions of cancer medicines, the move demonstrated how fast things were changing in the industry.Branded drug makers such as Amgen had long fought against the threat of generic competition in the biotech sector, but were now starting to pursue the business as an economic necessity – given the worldwide demand for cheaper drugs.It also underscored the importance of a provision in the 2010 US healthcare law that created a regulatory pathway to approve copycat versions of biotech drugs – known as biosimilars – at the nation’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA).If the US Supreme Court overturns “Obamacare” in an imminent legal ruling, fears have been expressed that the decision could cause the biosimilar policy to unravel and place uncertainty over a burgeoning multi-billion-dollar business.Although most analysts say it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will strike down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, the possibility that this might happen has prompted lobbyists who worked on all sides of the biosimilar provision to map out contingency strategies.Nicholas Groombridge, a partner with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a US law firm, said overturning the act would undermine plans for biosimilars.It would also create fresh pain for the innovative pharmaceutical companies because they successfully lobbied to include in the law generous long-lasting protection from competition.“I expect that any new legislation on biosimilars would be far less generous,” he said.Some believe that the US Congress would have to pass a new law to create a regulatory structure to approve biosimilars. This would reopen a fight over data exclusivity – the number of years branded drug makers are protected before generic versions of their medicines are allowed to be produced. It could also force parties to rethink the rules under which such drugs are approved.Under the current law, branded drug companies such as Amgen won a big concession when lawmakers agreed on 12 years of exclusivity. The Obama administration was reported to have sought a shorter period of seven years, which would have put more pressure on makers of expensive biotech drugs.While some healthcare experts have suggested that recreating the biosimilar provision in a new standalone law if the ACA were overturned would be relatively easy – because it would generate bipartisan interest in Congress – others say it would be exceedingly complicated, especially in an election year when Congress is deadlocked on most issues.“It was popular because it was part of a larger deal,” said Cole Werble, an analyst at Prevision Policy. Mr Werble said he believed that the FDA could argue that it had regulatory authority to begin approving such drugs, with or without the support of an explicit law.But the FDA would be likely to face a legal challenge it if pursued that approach without the approval of Congress. One leading lobbyist said the issue was not only important to branded and generic drug makers. It was also a priority for carmakers and other big companies who pay high healthcare costs and are demanding lower-cost drugs.Phrma, the branded drug makers’ powerful lobby group in Washington, said in a statement that it could not speculate on how the Supreme Court would rule, but that it supported the biosimilar provision as it was drafted.Innovative pharmaceutical companies have been bracing themselves for biosimilars, with many investing in in-house capacity or making acquisitions in the field.Amgen recently acquired a generic producer in Turkey, and Merck has talked about launching “biobetters” or improved formulations of biological drugs.Novartis has long spanned both sides, with its generics arm Sandoz among the most advanced developers of biosimilars.Whatever happens in the US, European regulators are already receiving applications for biosimilars set to be approved in the next few years, and versions are on sale in Asia.
75;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Generic rivals are also being blown off-course;Many off-patent counterparts also feeling pressure;The strong headwinds facing big pharmaceutical groups are due in part to pressure from the rise of generic rivals. But many of these off-patent counterparts are having an equally tough time as they feel the squeeze from a harsh economic climate.Intensifying competition from even lower-cost rivals in India, and price pressure from western healthcare systems seeking to save money on medicines via tenders and discounts, are cutting into margins.Claudio Albrecht, chief executive of Actavis, the Swiss-based generic group that amassed large debts as it bought up smaller European rivals over the past decade, says generic producers face two choices.“You can become bigger and benefit from scale and then fight on price and the best cost of goods, or you can become more non-generic,” he says.If his company’s €4.5bn purchase last week by Watson of the US signalled the former approach, Teva’s partnership unveiled last year with Procter & Gamble and its $6.8bn purchase of Cephalon pointed to the latter.Yet innovative pharmaceutical companies are also interested in generic companies, notably to diversify into emerging markets or into higher margin products. For instance, Amgen late last month bought MN of Turkey for $700m, and Novartis this week paid $1.5bn for Fougera, a generic dermatology products group.Frances Cloud, a consultant to the generics industry, warns that innovative pharmaceutical groups recent inroads will be shortlived, given the modest scale and lower margins of the niche.But she predicts further consolidation among midsize generic companies, such as the takeover of Stada of Germany. “We are running out of chunky sized targets and buyers, although there will still be lots of people hoovering up small assets for access to new geographies and technologies.”
76;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-04-25T18:12:23Z;Amgen snaps up Turkish generic drug group;;Amgen, the US biotechnology group, is to pay $700m for control of Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals, a Turkish generic drugs company, accelerating its shift into off-patent medicines and the emerging markets.The deal will give Amgen a platform for its own medicines in the fast-growing region, as well as providing scope to diversify and expand its product range as it loses exclusivity over its existing top-selling medicines.It comes at a time of growing potential for generic drugs in Turkey, as the government – responsible for 70 per cent of healthcare – attempts to save costs by promoting lower prices.MN Pharmaceuticals, which is privately held and focuses on speciality generic drugs for hospital treatment and injectables, reported sales of $200m last year and “on average double digit growth” over the past five years.The deal marks the reinforcement of a shift in strategy signalled by Amgen in 2010 and which it began to implementing last year, when it acquired Bergamo of Brazil for $215m. Sales had traditionally been concentrated in the US and on its own pipeline of products.Robert Bradway, president and chief operating officer appointed last year, said: “Amgen is dedicated to making our innovative medicines available to patients in major markets around the world. Together with MN’s staff and management team, we plan to grow our business with high quality and innovative medicines in Turkey and the surrounding region.”An Amgen spokeswoman stressed that the company’s core business strategy remained innovative medicines, and that it would initially continue to maintain a separate Turkish representative office of its own established two years ago.The company has faced growing pressure on its biological drugs as European and US regulators prepare guidelines authorising “biosimilars”, or generic versions of their products, which have in the past largely escaped the competitive pressure faced after patent expiry on chemically-based drugs.Cost-cutting measures taken by the Turkish government have kept the market relatively stagnant in recent years at about $10bn. But the share of generics, which account for just over 50 per cent of the market by volume, is widely expected to increase.“Because of the cost pressures and the cost cutting initiative taken by the government we see pressures on all local manufacturers and multinationals in Turkey,” said Cem Baydar at IMS Consulting in Istanbul. “At the end of the day what we see is that generics will have increasing volume penetration in the market place in coming years.”He added that he expected to see increasing numbers of companies moving into generics in Turkey, as Amgen is now planning.
77;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;AstraZeneca to pay $1.3bn for Ardea;;AstraZeneca is set to acquire US biotechnology company Ardea Biosciences in a $1.3bn deal, as the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical group attempts to secure future sales before patents for key medicines expire.AstraZeneca will acquire lossmaking Ardea – which has a drug under test for gout – for $32 a share, valuing the California-headquartered company at $1.26bn, including net cash.The offer represents a 54 per cent premium to Ardea’s closing share price on April 20, and will not be financed by debt, AstraZeneca said.The group, which specialises in treatments for cancer and cardiovascular diseases, has suffered several recent setbacks in its pipeline of late-stage experimental drugs, and is hoping the deal will help it launch a new treatment for gout.Ardea has specialised in developing Lesinurad, a compound which acts as a selective inhibitor to help regulate high levels of uric acid in the bloodstream.AstraZeneca plans to file for approval in the US and EU to market the compound as a new medicine in the first half of 2014, and also wants to “develop and commercialise” Lesinurad in China and Japan.Panmure said in a research note that the deal “seems consistent with management strategy, although the target indication of the lead product candidate is gout, which has not, traditionally, been an easy target for drug development.”The proposed acquisition is the latest in a series of late-stage development and commercialisation deals by AstraZeneca over the past two years, and the second within the space of a month.Three weeks ago it agreed a joint deal with Amgen, another west coast biotechnology group, in which it pledged to finance development of several compounds.The company faces the expiration of several patents for key medicines and lost $450m in sales to generic rivals in the final quarter of last year alone.David Brennan, chief executive of AstraZeneca, is also under pressure from investors for top-level change and to counter the failures of medicines in late-stage clinical trials. He faces a vote for re-election to the board at AstraZeneca’s annual general meeting on Thursday.“This attractive Phase III programme is an excellent opportunity to leverage AstraZeneca’s global speciality and primary care sales and marketing capabilities,” said Mr Brennan. “These compounds have real potential to benefit patients.”The announcement comes less than a week after AstraZeneca’s larger British rival GlaxoSmithKline saw its $2.6bn offer for the equity of a US developer of antibody drugs rejected. Human Genome Sciences, whose board has kicked off a review of strategic alternatives which could yet include a sale, said the unsolicited proposal did not reflect “the value inherent” in the company.The boards of both AstraZeneca and Ardea have unanimously approved the terms of the agreement and Ardea’s board has recommended that its shareholders approve the transaction.Several investors, whose holdings represent around a third of the outstanding shares, have agreed to vote in favour of the deal, which should be completed by the end of the third quarter this year, AstraZeneca said.Shares in AstraZeneca were down 1.5 per cent to £28.11 at the close of London trading.
78;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-04-22T22:29:59Z;Oxfordshire displays scientific knowhow;Science Vale looks to build on enterprise zone status;Haydn Parry holds up his coffee cup to illustrate why saleability is one problem his company does not need to worry about.“I could fit several million mosquito eggs into this,” says the chief executive of Oxitec, a biotechnology company that offers governments the chance to eliminate disease-spreading mosquitoes by releasing swarms of its genetically sterilised male insects into affected areas.Mr Phillips’ company is one of a swath of high-tech companies in south Oxfordshire that see an advantage in proximity to Oxford university, the transport connections of the M4 and Heathrow and a cluster of like-minded companies in sectors ranging from biotech to batteries.Oxitec has three facilities on Milton Park, an industrial and business centre near Didcot that hosts more than 165 companies, including Amgen and Dow AgroSciences. Just five miles away lies the Harwell Oxford science campus, former home to the UK Atomic Energy Authority and now the site of Diamond Light Source, the UK’s national synchrotron research facility.Nicknamed Science Vale UK, the area was named in September as one of the government’s new enterprise zones – a development that the region’s supporters predict will spark the creation of 8,000 new jobs.But while the region is affluent, well-connected and a hotspot of scientific expertise, it is less well-known than its Cambridge equivalent – the so-called Silicon Fen – and has yet to produce a homegrown business on the scale of Arm Holdings, the Cambridge-based microchip design company.Scott Brown, chief executive of Nexeon, a battery start-up firm based in Milton Park, has worked in a previous role in Cambridge and believes that the number of companies in the Oxfordshire area is a factor.“What you see in Cambridge is companies working in similar areas. Oxfordshire needs critical mass, like-minded companies working on similar things. But maybe we’re at the start of that,” he says.Nexeon’s technology makes batteries more efficient by using silicon-based anodes rather than conventional carbon. The company, which has raised £50m in funding since 2009, principally from Imperial Innovations and Invesco Perpetual, is now working on increasing production to commercial volumes.In reaching the next stage, though, Nexeon must decide where to locate its new production facility – and this may not be in Oxfordshire. “Our production processes are be better done on a chemical complex,” Mr Brown said. But the decision will depend partly on their chosen level of production.“If we decide to make 250 or 500 tonnes, we might want to go somewhere like Runcorn [in Cheshire] where there are large production assets.” He has not ruled out staying nearby, where production could take place, subject to planning constraints. And he is keen to retain the expertise of his 40 staff. “Come what may we will keep our headquarters and research here,” he said.For Mark Whittaker, senior vice-president of drug discovery at Evotec, a drug discovery firm also based at Milton Park, the Oxfordshire area has great strengths in so-called structural biology, but lacks an “absolute concentration of companies in one spot”.“At Cambridge there are a couple of large business parks where in one visit you could probably cover 90 per cent of all the companies there. Whereas here it is not as well concentrated or as well organised.”Nonetheless, he says, the “vibrant” culture among biotech companies in the area inspires valuable collaboration. He cites Evotec’s work with Oxagen, a neighbouring biotech firm, to create a compound now in clinical trials for the treatment of asthma.Such links are enhanced by the Oxford Bioscience Network, a not-for-profit group that provides purchasing and networking support for biotech and medical technology companies in Oxford and the south-east. At its briefings and networking events sector specialists can share ideas for opportunities in both the technical and business spheres.David Mott, investment director and co-founder of Oxford Capital Partners, a private equity firm that manages investments of £100m, including in Oxitec, says the area is more of a match for Cambridge than its public profile would suggest.“We’ve got a very big cluster here already and maybe we don’t shout about it as much as others but in terms of employment and patent registrations Oxford ranks right up there,” he said.Successful clusters require the presence of skilled researchers, world-class managers and a flow of international and domestic capital as well as people making and selling things, he argues. But companies in the Oxford area have another advantage.“Oxford does benefit from the global brand. Wherever you go, people have heard of it, which gives companies a great boost,” he said. “And when overseas investor groups come to the UK they go to London, Cambridge – and Oxford. It is a destination of choice for VCs around the world.”
79;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-04-09T16:14:56Z;AstraZeneca chief in need of a tonic;;When David Brennan won the race to become chief executive of AstraZeneca six years ago, he joked to a colleague who had come to congratulate him: “Great job, shit timing.”Since then, the Anglo-Swedish group has struggled under its American boss to adapt to the malaise affecting much of the sector as pharmaceutical companies face a so-called cliff of expiring patents and an ever thinner pipeline of innovative drugs to replace them.“It seems that something has to give at AstraZeneca, given its troubling future financial outlook,” Bernstein Research wrote in a note, highlighting that the company was trading at just over seven times 2012 consensus earnings, the lowest in a sector with an average multiple of 11. Many investors, it said, had an attitude towards the company of “left for dead”.Mr Brennan’s defenders argue that he was dealt a difficult hand by his predecessor Sir Tom McKillop, and it is not clear that a different manager would have played it better, or could even today.AstraZeneca – formed through the merger of Astra of Sweden with the spinout of the UK chemicals group ICI in 1999 – was slower than many of its peers to embrace the shift towards more profitable, targeted biological therapies. Patent filings suggest it still lags behind, with the majority of its intellectual property still, until recently, chemical-based.Its efforts to accelerate progress through the acquisition of CAT in 2006 and MedImmune in 2007 both backfired, with few of those companies’ planned drugs since making significant advances.AstraZeneca has instead been hit by failures of medicines in late-stage clinical trials, so the returns on its research have proved very disappointing.Since last year, it has written off failed late-stage cancer and anti-depressant projects. This month it signed a deal with Amgen, of the US, for joint development and commercialisation of a series of experimental medicines, providing potential for some additional future revenues but handing the larger share of the upside to the partner that developed them.Similar research and development setbacks have affected AstraZeneca’s peers, too, but Mr Brennan’s critics argue that he has played his hand badly. They suggest he refused to prune research early or deeply enough, or to diversify sufficiently into other cash generating activities such as generics or consumer healthcare deals.“He’s a delegator, not a decision maker,” says one large shareholder.To Mr Brennan’s credit, he championed the company’s expansion into fast-growing emerging markets, notably establishing a place as a market leader in China, which has been envied and since followed by his competitors.He oversaw the emergence of Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, as a blockbuster, although some insiders say he could have done far more to tap the potential of AstraZeneca’s portfolio of so-called mature drugs that have gone off patent, notably in emerging markets.He has championed improved business ethics, last year irritating some rivals by cutting funding for doctors travelling to medical conferences – a custom that has been criticised for possibly influencing prescribing practices. But that followed legal actions against the company for alleged aggressive marketing of drugs including the anti-psychotic medicine Seroquel, which AstraZeneca is fighting.Mr Brennan and his team were quick to embrace calls for higher returns to shareholders, stripping out costs to boost earnings. He has stepped up restructuring with a further 12 per cent reduction in the company’s 60,000 global workforce by 2014. Such moves have allowed Mr Brennan to increase dividends and share buybacks, driving up AstraZeneca’s multiple at a time when investors were seeking defensive stocks during the economic downturn.“Until the past year, AstraZeneca was performing quite well,” says Gbola Amusa, pharmaceuticals analyst with UBS, who remains bullish. He stresses that efficiency gains have helped generate strong total shareholder returns, which take into account the dividend as well as the share price. That triggered Mr Brennan’s jump in total remuneration last year to £9.3m.Even Mr Amusa predicts radical surgery ahead: “If you cut $2bn a year in research for infinity, and used it to finance acquisitions, it would be highly rewarded.”For others, AstraZeneca has lost the first-mover advantage it once had on boosting shareholder returns, and with far less internal fat to cut it is already heading over a steep patent cliff with revenues set to fall. Even a miraculous new drug approval can do little to make an impact.One institutional investor says: “This was predictable for a long time, but it shows how short-term the market is.”
80;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;US pharma: keep taking the tablets;Biotechs, despite higher multiples, look a better bet than the pharma stocks;Time to get off the drugs? We’ve had a good time, after all. Over the past 12 months, the average return of the eight-largest US pure-play pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies by market value is a dizzy 34 per cent, according to Capital IQ, compared with the S&P 500’s buzz-killing 3 per cent. Before going cold turkey, keep a distinction in mind. The big eight fit in two broad categories. Pfizer, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly are very slow-growing, dividend-paying pharma stocks. Amgen, Gilead, Celgene and Biogen Idec are big-cap biotechs that are expected to squeeze out solid single-to double digit sales growth over the next few years.For the more staid former cohort, there are two general explanations of the strong one-year performance (up 24 per cent). Big-cap dividend stocks across all sectors have had a great run. And the year before the four were flat as a group, while the S&P rallied mightily, rendering them cheap and paving the way for them to perform well simply by reverting to the mean. The big biotechs (up 45 per cent) have been driven more by specific product and pipeline successes, for example a new multiple sclerosis drug at Biogen, and one for osteoporosis at Amgen.The pharma stocks, then, have run up less and, except for Bristol-Myers, are cheaper than the biotech stocks. It would be a mistake to think that price-to-earnings multiples in the single digits are a signal of low risk, however. As drugs such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, Bristol’s Plavix, Lilly’s Zyprexa and Merck’s Singulair lose patent protection, revenues are expected to fall at all four companies over the next few years. The big pharmas will rely on their pipelines or acquisitions to turn things around – a chancy business either way. The biotechs, despite higher multiples, look a better bet.

81;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-01-26T18:09:39Z;Illumina adopts ‘poison pill’ against Roche;;US diagnostics company Illumina has moved to fend off Roche’s $5.7bn hostile takeover bid by announcing that it will adopt a “poison pill” to protect its shareholders.Through the rights agreement, Illumina shareholders can buy new common stock if a bidder acquires 15 per cent of the company’s shares. The move is intended to deter Roche, the swiss drugmaker, or other potential acquirers by making Illumina more expensive to acquire.“The Illumina board has taken this action to ensure that our stockholders receive fair treatment and protection in connection with any proposal or offer to acquire the company, including the proposal announced by Roche,” said Jay Flatley, Illumina’s chief executive.The bid for Illumina comes as dealmaking in the healthcare sector has proved resilient amid the economic slump. Large pharmaceutical and biotech companies are doing deals as they try to replace revenues lost from drugs coming off patent and to establish their position in emerging treatment and diagnostic areas.In a second high profile healthcare deal this week, Amgen of the US on Thursday unveiled a $1.16bn agreed takeover of Micromet, a biotechnology business founded in Germany with a leading experimental cancer compound and a broader technology with scope for a wider range of treatments.The $11 per share cash offer gives Amgen control of Micromet’s experimental drug Blinatumomab, currently in mid-stage clinical trials for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with scope for a range of other diseases. Roger Perlmutter, Amgen’s head of R&D, said: “Our goal is to bring new therapies to patients in need. These are rare assets, and we have enormous confidence in our freedom to operate with them.”Separately on Thursday, Celgene, another US biotech group that specialises in cancer therapies, said it is acquiring Avila Therapeutics for $350m in cash plus another $575m pending the development of some of its drug candidates. Avila is developing promising drugs to “silence” problematic proteins associated with diseases.This news follows an uptick in dealmaking activity in the sector that started late last year.Gilead Sciences, the US biotechnology company which pioneered treatments for HIV, last November said it would buy fellow biotech Pharmasset for about $11bn, a sizeable bet on the fast-developing market for oral remedies for the treatment of hepatitis C. Bristol-Myers Squibb, which faces losing patent protection on several top-selling drugs, followed suit in January agreeing to buy Inhibitex for $2.5bn, another developer of new treatments for hepatitis C.Both deals were struck at substantial premiums to the target’s stock price – something advisers say is typical in a sector where the value of emerging technology and drugs in testing and development has yet to be fully established.Illumina’s decision to put in place a poison pill, which was announced on Thursday, suggests the company’s board is intent on forcing Roche to pay a higher price for the company. Illumina’s shares are already trading substantially above Roche’s $44.50 cash offer, although they slipped 2.85 per cent to $53.51 on Thursday.Industry advisers were this week doubtful that a counterbidder would emerge for Illumina, given Roche’s reputation and previous success in launching hostile bids and its financial firepower.
82;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2012-01-20T15:48:09Z;Letter from Lex: Post-holiday blues;;The week started on what one UK psychologist has labelled Blue Monday – the most depressing day of the year – and for some it was not much better by the end. The 131-year old company that helped turn photography into a popular pastime, Kodak, had a worse week than most as it filed for bankruptcy. The world’s second largest retailer, Carrefour, also had a bad week, predicting that 2011 earnings would be up to 20 per cent lower. Citigroup is in no such danger thanks to a government backstop despite its disappointing third quarter performance. The US bank is in far better shape than Italy’s UniCredit and ING of the Netherlands, which are both struggling to put their post-crisis houses in order, and the world’s largest listed hedge fund, Man Group, which has turned to cost cutting. Even the mighty Google did not have the best of weeks as it reported top- and bottom-line results that were short of expectations. But private sector bondholders who bought Greek debt were probably more miserable than most as it looks like they will have to accept a default on lousy terms.However, it was not all grim news. Italy appears to be in good hands with Mario Monti as prime minister despite its still precarious debt position. China’s growth may be slowing, but its rural economy is still expanding rapidly and 8.9 per cent quarterly growth is hardly depressing. In the UK, investors in DS Smith may have been doing cartwheels after it announced a €1.6bn deal to buy the packaging division of Sweden’s SCA. Investors in the world’s largest biotech company, Amgen, and a maker of robotic equipment for surgery, Intuitive Surgical, were happier than most as both companies are performing well. Even bankers at state-controlled RBS may have been feeling happier after the $7.3bn sale of its aircraft leasing unit to a Japanese bank. But few are probably as happy as those who have worked for Goldman Sachs for the last decade during which the bank has paid its employees a staggering $125bn, twice what it made in net profits.John Casey, Lex publisher
83;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Amgen: gaining momentum;The world’s largest biotech suddenly looks like a value stock with upside;The long winter of Amgen’s discontent seems to be ending. The shares of the world’s largest biotech company by sales have reached $67, a level last seen in 2007.In the intervening years Amgen has been hobbled by the struggles of Epogen and Aranesp, its anaemia drugs. The two drugs combined to generate an impressive $4.5bn in sales in the past 12 months, more than a quarter of Amgen’s total. But the corresponding figure five years ago was $6.3bn. The decline is largely due to studies that suggested the drugs were of limited clinical benefit and could even shorten lifespans in certain groups of patients. Adverse changes to the drugs’ labels, and to reimbursement from US government health programmes, followed.Revenues are still falling for the drugs, but final label and reimbursement levels were set in 2011, clearing the way for stabilisation. Amgen has one new drug, Denusomab for osteoporosis, that industry experts say could become a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. The result is that Amgen suddenly looks like a value stock with upside. It has a valuation similar to big drug stocks such as Pfizer and Merck (a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 10 and a free cash flow yield of nearly 10 per cent). Yet analysts forecasting sales to shrink at Pfizer and Merck over the next three years see single-digit sales growth at Amgen.Amgen is not protecting earnings by cutting research spending, which amounts to nearly 20 per cent of sales, a level the big pharma groups are backing down from. There are still significant risks. Amgen’s revenues are concentrated in a small number of products and if the anaemia franchise does not bottom out as expected, investors will head for the doors. But, for the first time in a long time, the company has undeniable momentum.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
84;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-12-15T23:25:24Z;Amgen chief executive to retire;;Kevin Sharer, chief executive of Amgen, will retire next year after leading the US biotechnology company for more than a decade.Robert Bradway, currently the company’s chief operating officer and president, will replace Mr Sharer next year. A 19-year veteran of Morgan Stanley, Mr Bradway previously was Amgen’s chief financial officer.Mr Sharer, 63, has been chief executive since 2000 and will step down next May. He will continue as chairman of the board of directors until the end of 2012.Roger Perlmutter, executive vice-president of research and development, will also retire next year and be replaced by Sean Harper, chief medical officer, the company said.The changes come as Amgen has been looking to boost returns to shareholders after years of accelerating growth have started to slow.“Amgen will be in good hands,” said Mr Sharer, who joined the company in 1992 and previously said he would retire at the age of 65.When Mr Sharer took over at Amgen, it had $3.6bn in annual revenue and operated in 17 countries. Annual revenues have now reached $16bn and the company operates in 55 countries.Last month, the company said it would sell $6bn of debt to buy back stock in a move to boost its share price. On Thursday, Amgen announced a 36 cents per share first-quarter dividend, representing a 29 per cent increase above what it paid in the previous two quarters.Shares of Amgen rose 1.74 per cent to $58.62 on Thursday.Amgen, which has traditionally focused on biological products for illnesses such as kidney disease, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, has recently sought to diversify as it faces growing generic competition.Mr Sharer last year told the Financial Times that Amgen has hopes of expanding its global reach and that as the pharmaceutical industry consolidates, it is seeking acquisitions.

86;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-12-07T18:52:58Z;Low bond yields fuel corporate buy-backs;An increasing number of US companies are doing stock repurchases;With shareholders being rewarded by a surge in US company stock buy-backs, bondholders could be forgiven for feeling left out.Their contrasting fortunes were highlighted as investors bought $800m of bonds issued by Safeway last week, only to see the grocery store chain’s credit rating downgraded on the same day by one notch to triple-B minus by Fitch Ratings.Also on the same day, Safeway had announced that it would buy back an additional $1bn worth of its own shares – the main reason Fitch cited for the downgrade.An increasing number of US companies are doing buy-backs because the economics of such a move have probably never been better, according to bankers.Debt has become a cheaper source of capital, and this has helped to fund the biggest year for buy-backs since 2007.With corporate bonds benchmarked to US Treasuries, whose yields have fallen to historic lows amid strong demand for havens, borrowing costs for investment grade companies have also fallen.At the same time, the stock market has been languishing, leaving many companies frustrated that they are not being rewarded for recent strong profits and double-digit growth.“With what’s available in terms of rates right now, the ability to put more debt on balance sheets while not having a material impact on the ability to run the company is extremely attractive,” says Robert Leonard, managing director of the special equity transactions group at Citigroup.At least $33bn worth of debt has been raised to finance share buy-backs this year, according to Marc Zenner, head of corporate finance advisory at JPMorgan.The total may be higher, he says, since most companies do not say how they use proceeds from debt sales.Intel, the chipmaker, raised $5bn in debt in September for a share buy-back. At the time, the dividend yield on the stock was about 4 per cent, a person familiar with the deal said, but it was able to sell 30-year bonds paying interest of just 3.12 per cent after tax deductions.“In many cases, companies can borrow at lower rates than their dividend [yield],” says Jim Probert, head of investment grade capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “That often signals an imbalance between equity and debt valuations that deals like these may help correct.”US companies are on pace to announce buy-backs of more than $500bn worth of shares this year, according to stock research firm Birinyi Associates, the third biggest year on record.Although bondholders generally do not like these transactions because of the risk they pose to companies’ credit ratings, most of the groups buying back shares this year with debt have not seen too much fallout from the bond markets or from credit rating agencies.The deals, then, are likely to continue so long as investors keep buying bonds, and pressuring rates.Fitch has said many groups doing buy-backs are “reducing the level of cushion within the rating, but avoiding downgrades”. However, companies have been testing the boundaries of those cushions. Deals in November by Amgen, the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals group, and Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, were seen as particularly aggressive.Bonds sold by Amgen just last year fell sharply in price after the company sold another $6bn worth of bonds to finance a share repurchase early last month.The move prompted Moody’s Investors Service to cut Amgen by one notch from A3 to Baa1, while Fitch cut the company’s existing debt by two notches from A minus to triple-B.Fitch warned in the wake of Amgen’s deal that “the jump in new, heavy [share buy-back] programmes…remain at risk of further deterioration in operating results and financial leverage”.After Lowe’s last month sold $1bn of bonds to buy back stock – a manoeuvre that played a role in dowgrades from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s – Fitch said it saw a “heightened risk that other US retailers may follow a similarly agressive path”. Officials for Lowe’s could not be reached for comment.“It is very common for [company] managements to be incentivised by share prices,” says Matt Toms, head of US public fixed income at ING Investment Management. “It is very uncommon for managements to be incentivised by bond prices.”
87;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Surge in sterling corporate bond issuance gains pace;Bond rush testifies to the strength of demand for sterling issuance;British retailers may be struggling in the face of high inflation, a struggling economy and dour consumer sentiment but investors still snapped up an inaugural bond offering by Wm Morrison, the UK supermarkets group, last week.Investors placed £1.5bn of orders for Morrison’s £400m 12-year bond in spite of the uncertainty swirling around growth prospects for the UK and Europe, and the retailer’s own predictions of a “very tough Christmas” due to “frugal” shoppers.“Morrison’s order book was a who’s who of large insurers, pension funds and fund managers,” says Marco Baldini, European head of corporate syndicate at Barclays Capital, a bookrunner on the bond. “They could have done a much bigger deal if they’d wanted to.”The deal, and others, are evidence of the strength of demand for sterling issuance. On Monday, Petrobras, the state-controlled Brazilian oil company, sold £700m to UK investors, the largest sterling-denominated emerging market bond on record, according to HSBC.The reason for the strong demand is Britain’s status as a relative haven as the eurozone crisis has worsened. UK government bonds, or gilts, have benefited amid the financial storm that has swept through Europe’s bond markets, with yields on its sovereign debt falling to record lows.This has had positive knock-on effect on sterling-denominated corporate bond spreads as well as sales, say bankers and analysts.Another factor is the Bank of England’s second £75bn dose of “quantitative easing” or emergency bond-buying. Some of the money the Bank pours into the financial system by buying gilts from banks and pension funds is recycled into the corporate bond market.UK corporate bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have climbed in recent weeks, but by less than many of those issued by companies in other European markets.Tesco’s 2022 sterling bond yield has added 58 basis points to 4.35 per cent since November 9. Carrefour’s euro-denominated 2021 bond yield has over the same period jumped more than a percentage point to 5.51 per cent. Vodafone’s 2022 bond yield has added 41bp to 3.52 per cent, while Deutsche Telekom’s 2018 bond yield has climbed 55bp to 4.12 per cent over the same period.This relative resilience has nurtured the primary bond market for much of 2011. Sterling-denominated, non-financial corporate bond sales, including both investment grade and junk-rated debt, have climbed to $43.2bn so far this year, a 43 per cent increase over the same period last year, according to Dealogic.By contrast, euro-denominated corporate bond issuance has slumped 18 per cent to $181.7bn, while US dollar bond sales have risen just 7 per cent to a little over $739bn.The appetite for sterling bonds has attracted a string of European and international names in recent weeks – the former due to rising funding costs in their domestic euro-denominated markets and the latter because of a desire to broaden investor bases outside the traditional dollar stronghold.In addition to Petrobras, recent arrivals include Amgen, the US biotech company, and America Movil, the Mexican telecommunications group . Several French companies have also sold sterling bonds.Can this resilience last? The Bank’s second QE programme will eventually come to an end, and for all the strength of the UK’s investment grade corporate sector, the country’s weak economic outlook could lead to a reversal of sentiment.The UK’s 10-year composite gilt yield has edged up from a record intraday low of 2.10 per cent on November 23 to 2.32 per cent on Monday. Sterling itself has weakened against all but two of the 16 most actively traded currencies so far in December.Ketish Pothalingam, portfolio manager at Pimco, argues that Europe’s woes could yet hurt UK corporate borrowers. “The road to a European fiscal union will be fraught with problems, and if Europe goes into recession then the UK cannot escape its effects,” he says.Mr Pothalingam also argues that 2011 “has actually been an average year” for sterling issuance overall. He points out that the apparent jump in sterling corporate bond sales this year mainly reflects the inclusion of many smaller deals and limp issuance last year. Moreover, there has been little supply from financial companies, which have customarily made up much of the market.“Overall 2011 will be the second lowest issuance year in the past 10 years,” he says.Nonetheless, bankers and investors agree that UK bond funds remain cash-rich, and hungry for new issuance. For example, the local bond market will be handed more than £23bn on December 7 in gilt redemptions and semi-annual coupon payments, according to Barclays Capital. Some of this may be funnelled back into the corporate market.Richard Bartlett, head of European corporate debt markets at Royal Bank of Scotland, argues that the drop in bond sales by banks and other financial institutions opens up a “void” for non-financial UK companies to exploit.Indeed, many investors argue that the main constraint on further sterling corporate bond sales is a lack of supply, given the healthy balance sheets of most companies, rather than a lack of demand.“There is definitely more room for more issuance to come next year,” Mr Pothalingam says. “Spreads remain attractive in investment grade credit markets assuming that Europe and the UK don’t fall into a deep recession.”
88;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-12-04T19:06:31Z;Sterling corporate bond issuance surges;;Sterling corporate bond issuance is soaring, but euro-denominated bond sales are at a six-year low – as more companies turn to the relative stability of the London market amid Europe’s financial turmoil,UK and international companies have sold more than $42bn worth of sterling-denominated bonds so far this year – a 41 per cent increase compared with the same period last year, according to Dealogic.Meanwhile, euro-denominated corporate bond sales have slumped almost a fifth, to $179bn – the lowest figure for the period since 2005. Dollar bond sales have increased 7 per cent.“We’ve seen a lot of international companies come to the sterling market this year,” said Jean-Marc Mercier, a senior debt banker at HSBC. “It’s seen as a more stable currency, and investors here are interested in new credits.”Corporate borrowing costs have climbed in the UK recently, but not to the same extent as in Europe, leading several continental companies to turn to London’s bond market, including France’s GDF Suez and EDF.UK investors are also open to longer-term bonds than the European market, adding to the UK market’s attractions.Companies outside of Europe have stepped up their sterling bond sales, as well. Recent issues include bonds from Amgen, the US biotech company, and America Movil, the Mexican mobile phone company. Petrobras, the state-controlled Brazilian oil company, is expected to sell a large sterling bond this week.“Given the increasing volatility in Europe, issuers are becoming more aware of the need to engage with more investor pools,” said Richard Bartlett, head of European corporate debt markets at Royal Bank of Scotland.Analysts have noted that London benefits from a stable of investors with deep pockets, who are now struggling to pick up large positions in existing bonds in the market, given the limp trading volumes.John Ream, a senior trader at Citigroup, said: “There remains a lot of cash in the large UK funds and the only way they can put it to work right now is through the primary market.”The Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme is also cited as a reason for the strong demand. When it buys gilts from banks and pension funds, some of this money is then rechannelled into the sterling corporate bond market, strategists said.Investors now appear to view the UK as a haven across a range of asset classes. In addition to corporate and UK government bonds, or gilts, exclusive London property and the currency itself are benefiting.“Sterling assets are certainly more appealing because the UK is outside the eurozone. A lot of investors are now looking more closely at location,” said Richard Batty, investment director at Standard Life Investments.
89;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-11-08T00:56:31Z;Amgen sells $6bn of debt to buy back stock;;Amgen, the biotechnology company, on Monday sold $6bn of debt to buy back its stock in a deal that pushed the limits of a recent trend of companies taking advantage of cheap debt to boost share prices.Amgen’s debt sale came on a busy day for corporate issuance in the US. Companies were rushing to sell bonds by year’s end after a backlog had built up amid volatility in recent months. Dealogic, the data tracker, was expecting $16bn of investment-grade bond deals to price in the US, which would make Monday the second busiest of the year.Amgen joins other corporate issuers that have taken advantage of cheap debt to reward shareholders this year as historically low rates for benchmark US Treasuries have enabled companies with investment grade ratings to borrow cheaply.According to Marc Zenner, head of corporate finance advisory at JPMorgan, at least $33bn worth of debt has been raised to finance share buy-backs this year. However, the figure could be much higher, he said, since many companies do not specify the use of proceeds when they sell bonds.Amgen on Monday announced plans to buy up to $5bn of common stock funded by Monday’s bond sale. This year is on pace to be the busiest for share buy-backs in the US since before the financial crisis.“This tender offer reflects Amgen’s confidence in the future outlook of our business and the company’s long-term value,” said Kevin Sharer, chairman and chief executive at Amgen.“Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to complete this transaction in an attractive interest rate environment while also preserving the flexibility to further accelerate the growth of our business through focused, strategic acquisitions.”The bonds were sold with several maturities, but the all-in interest cost of the $6bn transaction was 3.79 per cent, a person familiar with the deal said.Amgen’s deal was seen as particularly aggressive, prompting credit rating downgrades and causing the risk premiums or spreads on its existing bonds to US Treasuries to widen by as much as 70 basis points, market participants said.Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Amgen by one notch from A3 to Baa1, while Fitch Ratings cut Amgen’s existing $14.2bn of debt by two notches from A minus to triple B.Amgen’s shares were up 5.9 per cent on Monday, to $58.43.

Biogen Idec has been just such a company recently. As a result it is the best-performing large capitalisation healthcare stock in the world year-to-date, according to Capital IQ. The shares have risen by over two-thirds.On the risk side, revenues of Biogen’s fastest-growing drug, the multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri, have come to look much more sustainable. Investors and patients had been focused on the small risk of dangerous infections that accompanies use of the drug. But increased availability of a test for a virus implicated in the infections has made it possible for patients to gauge the risks ahead of time.More importantly, Biogen’s key pipeline product, BG-12 for MS, has had strong late-stage clinical results. It is delivered orally rather than by injection, making it easier to use, and it appears to be safer than the only other oral MS drug currently available, Novartis’s Gilenya. Credit Suisse estimates annual sales of the drug could be $3bn; Bernstein reckons $4.2bn. Significant figures, given that Biogen has a bit over $5bn in annual revenues currently.Risks have not disappeared: safety data about both BG-12 and Tysabri will continue to roll in, for better or worse. And MS patients and their doctors are notoriously careful about switching to new treatments, so adoption of BG-12 may be slow, if it is approved. Biogen’s shares trade at a significant premium to its big biotech peers such as Gilead and Amgen, suggesting that much of the upside from BG-12 and Tysabri is priced in.Biogen a year ago had the all the attributes of a great pharma value stock: products addressing serious medical needs, an innovation-driven growth story, and a low valuation.

92;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-02-22T05:02:19Z;Humana in pact with S Africa group;;Humana, the US health insurance company, is to form a $65m partnership with a South African company which offers incentives to its clients to live healthier lives and reduce medical costs.Discovery, quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, will initially gain access to 4m of Humana’s US customers, providing rewards including discounted hotel rooms and electronic goods for those who work out at gyms and attend health education courses.The action reflects the growing application of “nudges” to motivate people towards more healthy lifestyles, at a time of growing concern by employers of rising medical costs. Poor diet and lack of exercise has fuelled an epidemic of chronic diseases, triggering worker absenteeism and doctor consultations.It also marks an effort to respond to the fresh pressures on insurers to reduce claims and improve their competitive position, triggered by President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms.Humana will acquire a quarter of Discovery’s US subsidiary, Vitality Group, for about $15m and pledge up to $50m more through a joint venture in which it will hold three-quarters of the equity.Vitality will continue to separately provide services to existing corporate clients and develop new loyalty programmes.Discovery already has more than 1.7m clients worldwide, initially developing its incentives approach in South Africa in the late 1990s, and since expanding and modifying its model in the UK, China and the US.Its success in the US in recent years as a standalone insurer has been only modest, given both the complexities of the health insurance market and the absence until now of a partnership with a large provider to reach a significant number of clients.The link with Humana will initially give it access to the insurer’s 4m private clients, before expanding to more than 17m covered through its specialist optical and dental plans as well as its work through the government-backed Medicare programme for retired people.Shaun Matisonn, head of Discovery’s international operations, said the programmes in the US were devised to respect tough anti-discrimination regulations by rewarding healthy activities rather than behaviours which necessarily demonstrated improved medical outcomes.

This helped the index post a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,273.26, up 1.5 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,809.44, a gain of 1.4 per cent over the last five days.Markets were given a further lift after Hosni Mubarak stepped down as president of Egypt, ending the uncertainty that has worried the markets for 18 days. The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 2.6 per cent to 15.68.But the gains following the resignation were modest as investors struggled to work out long-term effects. “This is a short-term release for the markets, but it could be a long-term negative. We know we are losing a friend, but are we gaining an enemy?” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.Biotechnology stocks lost ground after Cephalon said its profits had fallen in the fourth quarter and that it had received a subpoena from the US Postal Service’s investigative arm seeking information about its cancer-pain drug Fentora.The shares were down 2.6 per cent to $58.56. Related stock Amgen lost 1 per cent to $53.74.In other earnings news, Expedia, the online travel company, reported a 30 per cent drop in net income for the fourth quarter. This fell short of expectations and sent shares down 17.1 per cent to $21.31. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also cut its recommendation to “neutral” from “buy”.Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator, saw a successful first day of trading after its initial public offering. The shares were up 3.5 per cent to $31.05 after the largest private equity-backed US offering at $30 a share, valuing the company at $21bn.US shares in Nokia were down 14 per cent to $9.36 after it announced a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft to make Windows its main phone operating system to compete against Apple and Google in the smartphone market.But investors in Apple and Google were unruffled, with Apple up 0.7 per cent to $356.85, while Google rose 1.3 per cent to $624.50. Microsoft, however, was down 0.9 per cent to $27.25.The wider markets were given little direction from the Commerce Department’s balance of payments data for December. The figures showed that the US trade deficit had widened more than economists had expected at the end of the year. However, exports as well as imports continued to rise, pointing to a strengthening economic recovery late last year.The week was dominated by a spate of deal activity which drove the S&P higher. In other earnings news, Panera Bread, a bakery chain, jumped 16.5 per cent to $116.11 after the company lifted its full-year earnings estimate for 2011 to as much as $4.45 a share.Another restaurant chain, Chipotle Mexican Grill, rose 4.7 per cent to $268.73 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings on an adjusted basis of $1.47, beating the average estimate of $1.30.On Monday Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore drilling company.Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn.Danaher was up 5.3 per cent to $51.61 over the week while Beckman Coulter was up 0.2 per cent to $82.78. Pride International gained 0.7 per cent to $40.08.This mergers and acquisition theme continued on Wednesday when NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange. NYSE gained 13.5 per cent to $38.31 over the week.Strong earnings results from McDonald’s and Walt Disney, up 3.7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over the week, also helped the wider market push forward to 2½-year highs.
94;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-02-06T17:36:58Z;Actelion needs a shot in the arm;Investors are no longer buying the standalone strategy;When Jean-Paul Clozel unveiled Actelion’s glitzy new business centre in December, he said the architecture stood for “innovation, openness and communication” and symbolised the core values of his company. Now, the chief executive and founder of Europe’s biggest biotech stands accused of precisely the opposite by its biggest shareholder.Elliott Associates, the recent owner of 6 per cent of Actelion, is demanding Mr Clozel, along with his chairman, resign and put the company up for sale.The $17bn ($10.6bn) investment fund only went public after saying Actelion’s management had refused to engage with it to discuss its dissatisfaction with the group’s share price performance.Actelion has responded by saying it had a two-hour meeting with Elliott and conveyed suggestions to the board, who back the incumbent management and the group’s strategy. That meeting was nothing but putting in face time.Like many peers running Swiss companies, Mr Clozel is hoping his safe base of long-term shareholders – who are notoriously loath to show hostility towards management teams they invest with – will rally around him. He will spew the tired argument that hedge funds are nothing but evil vultures after a fast buck and do not care about the heart and soul of the company. But behind the scenes, the long-only investors are as fed up with Actelion’s underperformance as their short-term rivals are.Tracleer, Actelion’s biggest-selling drug – and which accounts for about 85 per cent of group sales – comes off patent in 2015.Development of its sleeping pill almorexant – which had been slated as a potential multibillion-dollar blockbuster – has been discontinued.Investors are no longer buying the standalone strategy. They know there are potential buyers, including Amgen, Bayer and Bristol-Myers Squibb who could unlock value from Actelion’s pipeline. Those with cancer drugs could squeeze substantial operating synergies, others could give oxygen to Actelion’s anaemic distribution capability. Simply cutting costs and running Actelion’s capex more efficiently would add value.What is clear is that the activists are not going to give up, and momentum for change is growing fast.Mr Clozel appears to have two choices: meet its biggest shareholders in good faith and agree to a serious strategic review. Either that, or discover a cure for cancer in the next six months.lina.saigol@ft.com
95;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-02-04T00:01:35Z;Hedge fund urges Actelion heads to quit;;Elliott Associates, the $17bn US hedge fund, has called for the resignations from the board of the chief executive and chairman of Actelion, the Swiss biotechnology company, in a push for a sale of the company.In a letter sent to directors on Thursday, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, Elliott, Actelion’s largest shareholder, heavily criticised the company’s management.The board had made “little apparent progress” in addressing concerns about Actelion’s “strategic direction and corporate governance” the hedge fund said, adding that the company’s stock market valuation was as much as 50 per cent below where it could be.“This leaves us no choice but to air our concerns publicly,” the hedge fund wrote, noting that it would be using its 6 per cent stake in Actelion to force resolutions on to the agenda of the annual meeting on May 5.Actelion, Europe’s largest ­biotech company, at present ­valued at SFr6.7bn ($7.1bn), has been the subject of persistent takeover speculation since last autumn.Its management, led by Jean-Paul Clozel, founder and chief executive who owns a 4 per cent stake, has insisted the company remains independent.Robert Cawthorn, Actelion’s chairman, told the FT in December that Actelion was “not considering a sale”.Mr Cawthorn denied the company’s policy was at odds with shareholders. “Let me be very clear,” said Mr Cawthorn. “There has never been, nor will there be, any action by our board that will frustrate shareholders’ rights and interests.”Bankers say the company would attract substantial interest from large pharmaceutical companies were it to come up for sale.Both Amgen and Bristol-Myers Squibb would be interested, say people familiar with the matter.In its letter, Elliott called for the resignation of Mr Cawthorn and Mr Clozel from the company’s board and for the formation of a “Strategic Committee” to explore the future options for the company “in light of the many rumoured approaches by motivated acquirers”.The company generates more than four-fifths of its sales from Tracleer, a drug used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Actelion also has a drug used to treat Gaucher disease, a genetic condition, and at the end of June last year had four compounds in the final stage of regulatory testing.Actelion said: “We can confirm we have received a letter from Elliott to the board of directors. They will review the communication in question and respond in due course.”Additional reporting by Haig Simonian
96;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-01-25T22:29:26Z;US housing data weigh on Wall Street;;Investors on Wall Street took a negative view on a number of earnings reports, including from Johnson & Johnson, but the wider markets were flat after mixed economic data.The healthcare group posted profits down 12 per cent on the previous year and below analysts’ expectations. This was mainly due to a $922m charge related to the ASR hip recall from its DePuy subsidiary. The company also issued a downbeat 2011 earnings forecast of $4.80 to $4.90 a share, less than the $4.97 a share projected by analysts.William Weldon, chief executive, said that the company would continue to see near-term pressure on the business this year. Shares in Johnson & Johnson were down 1.8 per cent to $61.08.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,291.18 as a raft of mixed economic data from home and abroad failed to provide direction to the market.Figures from the Conference Board showed that US consumer confidence had increased by considerably more than forecast in December. But separate data showed that house prices were continuing to fall, according to the Case-Shiller index.Looking abroad, news that UK gross domestic product shrunk in the fourth quarter and that India had raised interest rates again weighed on sentiment, in particular dragging down commodity-related stocks.Murphy Oil, the oil and gas exploration and production company, was down 1.4 per cent to $71.04 while Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore and coal miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $81.74.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 11,977.19, maintaining the two-year highs reached in the previous session, while the Nasdaq Composite was fractionally up after a late rally to 2,719.25.The session was one of the busiest days for earnings reports, and overall the market reacted negatively to the results.While many results came in below forecasts, even many forecast-beating results failed to impress investors. Analysts said this had been one of the key stories of the earnings season so far, with many stocks like Schlumberger, Google, and F5 Networks losing ground on the day that strong earnings are released due to market expectations of blockbuster results.“Last quarter, expectations were lower so strong results were more of a market driver, but this quarter people are generally more optimistic so the earnings bar has been set higher,” said Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.Investors were disappointed by results from 3M, for example, even though the earnings came in slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations. The maker of office, medical and industrial products, posted a fourth-quarter profit of $928m, or $1.28 a share.The results topped analysts’ forecasts and 3M raised its 2011 earnings forecast, but its shares were down 2 per cent to $88.50.Shares in Texas Instruments also saw losses despite posting earnings ahead of expectations. The chipmaker reported fourth-quarter revenues of $3.53bn and earnings per share of 78 cents, which exceeded expectations of 64 cents a share. But its shares were down 1.9 per cent to $33.98.In other earnings news, American Express, the biggest US credit-card issuer by purchases, reported disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. A $74m charge tied to job cuts in its servicing network dragged on the figures, but even without the charge the company would have earned 94 cents a share, less than the average estimate of 96 cents by analysts. The stock fell 2.2 per cent to $44.80.Investors on Wall Street were also looking towards the State of the Union address which was to be delivered on Tuesday night. “President Obama’s State of the Union address is likely to be more pro-business in contrast to the anti-business tone of last year’s address,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.Also in earnings news, DuPont the world’s second-biggest chemicals maker by market capitalisation, was up 0.3 per cent to $49.04 after mixed results which saw revenue increase but profits fall due to charges.Verizon Communications was up 1.6 per cent to $35.79 after the company posted earnings per share of 54 cents on revenue of $26.4bn.In deal news, Amgen said it had agreed to buy BioVex Group, a private cancer drug company, for up to $1 billion, sending shares in Amgen down 0.2 per cent to $57.16.The biotechnology group said it would pay $425 million up front and as much as $575 million in additional payments.The deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, is due to be completed in March when BioVex will become a subsidiary of Amgen.The announcement came as Amgen reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results but gave 2011 earnings estimates that were less than analysts had estimated.
97;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2011-01-25T20:41:33Z;Boost for Europe venture capital after BioVex deal;;Europe’s venture capital community is celebrating a rare $1bn exit of a biotechnology investment, after US-listed Amgen agreed to acquire BioVex, a cancer vaccine developer that spun out of University College London a decade ago.BioVex has raised $150m from more than a dozen venture capital groups. It has developed a genetically-modified virus called OncoVex that destroys cancer cells when injected into patients suffering from skin, head and neck cancer.Amgen is paying $425m in cash, with as much as $575m of future payments being conditional on the company hitting certain regulatory and sales milestones. The deal represents one of the biggest exits of a venture capital-backed biotechnology company for many years and is a boost for the ailing European venture capital industry which has struggled with a dearth of big success stories.Founded by Robert Coffin, a former University College London researcher who is now its chief technology officer, BioVex has moved its headquarters to the US, near Boston, but still does research in the UK at a facility in Oxfordshire.The company has started advanced clinical trials of OncoVex in 80 hospitals around the world and if these are completed successfully, it aims to file for a biologics licence from the Food and Drug Administration in the US later this year.“OncoVex has demonstrated encouraging anti-tumour activity in clinical studies for the treatment of melanoma and head and neck cancer and BioVex is currently enrolling patients into pivotal Phase 3 trials in both indications,” said Roger Perlmutter, Amgen’s executive vice-president.The main venture capital backers of BioVex, who supported a $70m round of financing two years ago, include Scottish Equity Partners in the UK, Forbion in the Netherlands, Morningside of Hong Kong, Crédit Agricole of France and New Science Ventures of the US.The deal comes as Amgen seeks to refresh its pipeline with new experimental drugs, following a series of setbacks and pressures from generic rivals on the Nasdaq-listed group’s existing products. It also signals resurgent work around cancer vaccines.Vaccines already exist to prevent infections for Hepatitis B and HPV, which can cause liver and cervical cancer respectively.Dendreon last year received US regulatory approval for Provenge, a therapeutic vaccine to treat prostate cancer. Others including BioSante Pharmaceuticals have products in advanced clinical testing.
98;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-12-13T18:20:16Z;Actelion chiefs stick to independent line;;Actelion, the Swiss biotechnology group at the centre of persistent bid speculation, has stressed its determination to remain independent but acknowledged it would examine any serious approach.In an interview, Jean-Paul Clozel, Actelion’s chief executive and Robert Cawthorn, its chairman, dismissed market talk that they were looking for a white knight to take a minority stake to preserve the company’s independence.“Let me be very clear,” said Mr Cawthorn. “There has never been, nor will there be, any action by our board that will frustrate shareholders’ rights and interests.”Analysts have speculated that the company could be facing a bid from Amgen, the US biotechnology group. Mr Cawthorn declined to say whether Actelion had received an offer, repeating the company’s policy of not commenting on market rumours. He said he was “not aware” of any stake building.Actelion, Europe’s biggest biotech group, turned into a potential bid target after a string of setbacks as it tried to expand beyond Tracleer, its blockbuster treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The drug last year accounted for SFr1.5bn of Actelion’s SFr1.77bn sales. Sales of Tracleer are still growing, prompting group revenue forecasts of about SFr2bn in 2010. But the drug faces patent expiries in 2015-16, putting Actelion’s future at risk unless it can develop alternatives.A number of apparently promising new drugs, including an insomnia treatment, have been delayed or not met expectations. Actelion’s market capitalisation of SFr6bn would make it a relatively easy buy for one of the big pharmaceutical companies.Amgen has declined to comment on its intentions. Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly and Bayer, all mentioned in media reports as potential white knights, have refused to discuss the matter.The coming year may be decisive, with Actelion pushing ahead with a range of other products, including a successor to Tracleer, for which clinical trial results will be due in mid-2011.“The board and management are confident about the future prospects of the company as an independent entity and we’re not considering a sale,” noted Mr Cawthorn, a pharmaceuticals industry veteran.He dismissed suggestions of potential differences with Mr Clozel, which have been the source of some speculation by analysts. Mr Clozel and his wife, both former Roche scientists, were among Actelion’s co-founders in 1997.There have been suggestions that Mr Clozel, who is the only company representative on Actelion’s 10-member board, and his wife might be less willing to entertain an offer than the outside directors, because of their personal attachment to the company.Mr Cawthorn and Mr Clozel dismissed suggestions they were sounding out bigger companies to buy a minority stake.While acknowledging recent product setbacks, they stressed Actelion’s pipeline was full of potential. That pipeline meant talks with other drugs companies, including Amgen, were inevitable.“There is clearly a shortage of new products in this industry,” said Mr Clozel, in response to speculation about recent contacts with other groups.“We have a lot of interesting products,” he added. “As some of them are just too big for a company of our size to take on alone, we have contacts with many pharmaceuticals companies.” He denied such talks covered selling a stake.“That would limit our options,” said Mr Cawthorn. “We don’t want to do that and our shareholders don’t want us to do that.”
99;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-11-30T18:23:18Z;Drug groups’ investments pay off;;"The world’s largest dozen pharmaceutical companies are set to generate positive returns on investments from late-stage experimental drugs but with wide variations, according to a study by Deloitte and Thomson Reuters.By scrutinising each of the companies’ pipeline of late-stage drugs in test or submitted for regulatory approval, the two consultancies estimated internal rates of return on future lifetime sales of between 8.4 per cent and 18.4 per cent.The figures suggest there is greater value in the drugs under development than currently reflected in stock market valuations or in the weighted average cost of capital, a benchmark to assess whether the companies would have been better simply to invest their cash in the financial markets.The analysis – which was anonymised and estimated from public data – was designed to provide a new way to examine how to boost research and development productivity, at a time when investors and companies alike are frustrated by the high cost and low rate of success.Several companies including GlaxoSmithKline have recently begun publishing their own estimates of return on investment from research activities, in an effort to persuade shareholders of the value of their continued work in the development of new drugs.Julian Remnant, head of R&D advisory in the life sciences and healthcare practice at Deloitte, said: “In the future, we believe companies will set performance targets and drive R&D strategy and decision making around output-based value measures, such as internal rate of return.”The study used currently available standard industry benchmarks on success rates and cash spent on product development, rather than confidential precise in-house figures. However, Deloitte said its estimate for GSK was within one percentage point of the company’s own figures.It argued for new approaches by executives in judging how to allocate their spending such as internal rate of return across all research and development activities, in place of current practice which typically considers forecasts of the percentage of future sales revenue generated on each experimental product.It suggested the most effective way for companies to boost their rate of return would come through achieving greater success rates in late-stage testing and submission of experimental drugs; followed by simply cutting back on research and development.The companies selected, based on the largest spenders of research and development funds in 2008-09, were Pfizer, Roche, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Merck, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda and Amgen."
100;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:00:06+0000;Actelion;Swiss drugmaker is increasingly unlikely to remain independent;"Jean-Paul Clozel, chief executive of Actelion, may wish to keep the Swiss drugmaker independent, but that looks increasingly unlikely. As more suitors circled this week, its shares jumped 12 per cent, taking the total rise to 40 per cent since October. Said to be interested are Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline and Amgen, enough competition to result in a bid leaving Mr Clozel with few options.Valuing Actelion is tricky. Its Tracleer hypertension drug – which provides 85 per cent of its revenue – has five years left under patent. Almost all the rest of the company’s worth, though, is in drugs under development, and the chances of commercial success are hard to judge. Analysts generally take discounted future earnings from existing drugs and add probability-weighted expected earnings for the pipeline drugs. On average, they estimate the company is worth about SFr53 per share, or a total value of SFr6.9bn, assuming the current share buy-back erases net cash.But the traded price is already 5 per cent higher than this valuation; investors evidently expect a premium. Estimating this sweetener is difficult, given the wide variation in premiums paid for recent healthcare deals. Sanofi-Aventis offered 30 per cent more than the undisturbed share price for Genzyme. Johnson & Johnson paid a 58 per cent premium for Crucell, and BMS an 84 per cent premium for Zymogenetics.To get Actelion’s management on board, bids are likely to start at SFr65 per share – a 63 per cent premium to the undisturbed price. If a bidding war erupts, offers could rise to perhaps SFr75. The sellers may rejoice at this windfall, but with so much of the perceived value tied up in the pipeline, investors in the winner may have most to lose.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"
101;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;The funds that trade on synthetic deal activity;;Management, beware. Once a credible takeover rumour hits the trading floors these days, it can gather momentum at frightening speed, even resulting in the sale of a company.Take a look at Actelion. The Swiss biotech group has been subject to such heavy bid speculation in recent weeks that its shares have risen by 40 per cent since early October.Yet so far none of the companies mentioned as potential suitors, including Bristol-Myers Squibb and Amgen, has held serious takeover talks with Actelion, or put down an indicative offer.That did not stop hedge funds from piling into the stock the second the rumours hit their screens.One serious participant privately said last week that he did not bother to check whether there were any plausible bidders.A year ago, no risk arbitrageur would have played such a game.They would have waited for a deal to be announced – or at least some indication that preliminary talks were taking place – assessed the merits of the deal and looked at the chances of the transaction closing before buying shares.If they were traditional shareholder activists, they would have studied a target company for months before buying a stake and used that as leverage to meet management and push for change, rather than playing the spread on the difference between the share price and takeover price.The funds playing Actelion, however, are trading on synthetic bid activity, which shows just how desperate they are.The anticipated recovery in dealmaking has yet to materialise, and with few solid deals to trade on, they are playing rumours and speculation instead.As the old saying goes, every fund turns activist when they own the stock and nothing is happening.Having taken positions in Actelion early when no bid is on the table, they need a way out of their trades, and that means pushing for a sale.If they succeed, this could be the new shape of activism.If a Swiss biotech company can be a target, then a range of underperforming companies need to plan how to avoid similar treatment.lina.saigol@ft.com
102;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-11-17T23:19:28Z;Actelion rises as rivals start to circle;;Some of the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals companies are eyeing Actelion as the Swiss biotechnology company sought to calm the takeover speculation surrounding it.The board of Actelion has hired Moelis & Company to advise it on various options. The company said yesterday in a statement that it is talking to industry peers “as part of its ordinary course of business”.The company’s management remains reluctant to sell, people familiar with the matter warned, and it remains unclear whether the group’s deliberations will result in a deal.However, Amgen, the world’s largest biotech company, is circling Actelion, those people added, and is interested in engaging with the company.No approach had yet been made, they added.Actelion has not received any formal offer, people close to the company said.One route Actelion may consider is to enlist a larger pharmaceuticals group to take a substantial stake as a possible defensive move against a full takeover.Abbott Laboratories and Bristol-Myers Squibb, which are seeking to diversify and bolster their revenues in the face of patent expiries and competition from generic drugs, could also be interested in a tie- up with the company. Actelion shares jumped more than 9 per cent to SFr54.60 on Wednesday as takeover speculation surrounded the company, giving it a market value of more than SFr7bn ($7.1bn).Jean-Paul Clozel, chief executive, has repeatedly maintained that Actelion wants to remain independent and pursue research into new drugs.But the company has recently faced setbacks in its attempt to round out its drug portfolio. Earlier this year, its experimental drug Clazosentan, which is used to treat haemorrhages, failed a clinical trial.At the end of September, Actelion shares were trading below SFr40 in the wake of the trial’s failure.The company, which relies for the bulk of its sales on the heart drug Tracleer, last month unveiled a SFr800m buy-back programme, in a move widely seen as designed to fend off takeover speculation.The programme, representing about 12 per cent of the company’s issued share capital, will substantially reduce Actelion’s cash pile, which stood at SFr1.4bn at the end of the last quarter, including short-term investments.Mr Clozel, a former cardiologist, cofounded Actelion in 1997 and, after initially focusing on research and development, became chief executive in 2000.
103;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-10-26T20:44:46Z;US steelmakers dragged by weak forecasts;;Losses at AK Steel and US Steel and a strengthening dollar weighed on the materials sector.Materials stocks edged down 0.2 per cent, after falling sharply in early trade, as soaring raw materials costs and a sluggish economic recovery hit steel industry earnings.Steel companies in September made a round of pre-announcements predicting shortfalls in third-quarter profits, but investors still recoiled after disappointing earnings.AK Steel slumped 4 per cent to $12.84 after it reported a third-quarter net loss. US Steel also posted a net loss and warned that the fourth quarter would be similar because of the uncertain economy in North America and Europe. Its shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $40.85.But Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott said it was not just the steel company’s outlooks, some of which had been priced in, but also the strengthening dollar that was hitting materials stocks.DuPont, the chemical maker, lost 1 per cent to $47.22 even though it beat analyst expectations on profits and sales and raised its full-year forecast.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,185.64, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1 per cent to close at 11,169.46 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,497.29.Stocks pared their losses after data showed consumer confidence rebounded from a seven-month low in October and IBM announced extra money for share repurchases.Technology stocks had fallen in early trading, dragged down by a weak forecast from Texas Instruments, but the sector reversed and was up 0.1 per cent after the IBM board authorised an additional $10bn for share buy-backs.Shares in IBM edged up 0.6 per cent to $140.67 and, as one of the stocks with the largest market capitalisations, that helped the broader indices erase their losses.Chipmaker Texas Instruments slid 0.4 per cent to $28.88 after it warned that its fourth-quarter revenues would be hurt by slowing demand for chips for computers and televisions.In the third quarter, Texas Instruments beat expectations on revenue and earnings.But Christopher Danely, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said investors should pay attention to the reduction in lead times for chips which he said could indicate a drop in future order rates. He compared the current decline in lead times with a fall in 2003-04, which came before a dip in order rates.In industrials, Cummins sank 5.8 per cent to $89.00 after it reported a large rise in quarterly profit, beating expectations, but missing analysts’ sales forecasts.The conglomerate also raised its guidance for the full year on the back of strong international sales of its engines and power-generation products.Ford Motor also beat expectations with its record-breaking quarterly earnings as it persuaded US consumers to buy European-style smaller cars and benefited from a rebound in sales of pick-up trucks.The carmaker said it expected to slash debt in its automotive business by the end of the year. Its shares advanced 1.5 per cent to $14.36.In pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Amgen reported their earnings. Bristol-Myers Squibb announced better-than-expected earnings before the opening bell.Lower taxes and cost cuts boosted profits but revenues disappointed investors because of weak sales of Abilify, its schizophrenia treatment, which has been the company’s growth driver in recent years, as well as the costs of US healthcare reform. The shares lost 1.1 per cent to $26.86.AmGen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, slid after its sales came in weaker than expected. The shares were down 1.2 per cent to $57.26 after sales of Prolia, its new osteoporosis drug, were only a third of what analysts had projected.Outside of earnings news, the S&P 500 homebuilders index fell 1.1 per cent after house prices fell in August compared to the month before, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index of prices in 20 cities.
104;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-07-30T21:01:33Z;Growth fears leave Wall Street flat;;Wall Street finished flat on Friday after spending most of the day in negative territory because of concerns about the slowing rate of economic growth.The S&P 500 closed fractionally higher at 1,101.60, but down 0.09 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly lower, closing at 10,465.94, but up 0.4 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,254.70, but lower by 0.4 per cent for the five days. The S&P gained 6.9 per cent in July, its best monthly gain in a year.The market dropped 2.3 per cent at the open after GDP data was released but later trimmed losses.US economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent, coming in just below consensus forecasts of about 2.5 per cent. A larger trade deficit and slower growth in consumer spending meant that the economy expanded less than in the first quarter. The first-quarter figure was revised up to 3.7 per cent from 2.7 per cent.“The picture is of an economy that continues to shuffle along rather than sprint, which is probably not surprising after the leading economic indicators that we’ve seen out since May,” said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer for JPMorgan’s private wealth management business.But both the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index and the Chicago PMI gauge of business activity were slightly better than expected, going some way to soothing investors’ worries.The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector led the late day rally, up 0.7 per cent, on news that consumers were feeling less negative than predicted.In earnings news, Chevron reported a threefold rise in quarterly profit as increased output, higher energy prices and wider margins at its refineries helped it top analysts’ profit forecasts. Shares rose 0.3 per cent to $74.89.Insurers Metlife and Aon both rose after reporting better-than-expected second quarter results.Metlife was up 4.6 per cent to $42.06 after it moved back into the black, making second-quarter net income of $1.84 per share after a loss of $1.74 for the same period last year.Recent acquisitions helped offset a fall in commissions at Aon Corporation, the world’s largest insurance brokerage. Earnings per share were 63 cents compared with 50 cents for the same period last year. The shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.67.But Genworth Financial, the mortgage guarantor and life insurer, slumped 14 per cent to $13.58 after posting a weak second-quarter profit and issuing a cautious outlook.There was positive news from several pharmaceuticals. Merck & Co reported better-than-expected earnings on the back of strong sales of its treatments for diabetes, arthritis and HIV. But the shares fell 1.7 per cent to $34.46 because revenue missed estimates.Drugmaker Warner Chilcott rose 5 per cent to $25.60 after the company raised its full-year outlook.Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, rose 2.2 per cent to $54.53 after reporting a better-than-expected second quarter profit. It said that the launch of its new drug for osteoporosis was on track.Biotechnology company Geron jumped 17.3 per cent to $5.63 after it said that the Food and Drug Administration had lifted its hold on an early-stage trial of its embryonic stem cell-based therapy.Charles River Laboratories International fell 2.7 per cent to $31.08 after it agreed to end its merger agreement with Wuxi PharmaTech, paying $30m to break the contract. The company also announced a $500m share buy-back.In deal news, Walt Disneyhas sold film studio Miramax to Filmyard Holdings for more than $660m, ending months of talks between the media group and bidders. Disney shares fell 0.1 per cent to $33.69.
105;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-06-02T21:12:37Z;Energy shares lead rally on Wall Street;;"US stocks reversed course on Wednesday to rally strongly, led by gains in the energy and financial sectors as positive macro-economic news bolstered the bulls.However, concerns about the eurozone economy continued to weigh on investor sentiment.US pending home sales beat economists’ consensus estimates, boosting hopes that government tax credits had succeeded in helping steady the housing market.This is giving the markets a good excuse to climb higher, said Joe Heider, principal at Ohio-based Rehmann Financial, which manages more than $2.5bn in assets.“Despite a miserable May, the fundamentals remain strong and continue to improve,” he said. “The eurozone problems were overblown and now the market is looking more inward, focusing on domestic issues.”By the close, the S&P 500 had gained 2.6 per cent to 1,098.39, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced 2.3 per cent to 10,249.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.6 per cent to 2,281.07.The energy sector, which was heavily hit on Tuesday, spearheaded the day’s rally. Range Resources added 9.7 per cent to $47.92, Consol Energy gained 8.4 per cent to $37.10 and Peabody Energy rallied 7.7 per cent to $39.26.US-listed shares in BP were 3.1 per cent higher at $37.66, in spite of the US’s announcement late on Tuesday that it was opening a criminal probe into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Schlumberger rose 8.8 per cent to $56.30 and Halliburton gained 12 per cent to $23.68 as the leading oilfield contractors were added to Morgan Stanley’s short-term buy list.JPMorgan rallied 2.6 per cent to $39.55 as the second-biggest US bank by assets was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at UBS, with a target price of $50 per share.“We believe that the current share price is an attractive entry point that more than reflects the earnings-at-risk and partially overlooks potential offsets and better footing JPM has now versus mid-2008,” wrote the analysts, led by Glenn Schorr.Financials stocks were higher across the board. Bank of America rose 3 per cent to $15.89, Citigroup rallied 1.8 per cent to $3.92 and Goldman Sachs was 2.1 per cent up at $144.83.Industrial stocks benefited from a number of analyst upgrades. Mining equipment maker Joy Global was 8.7 per cent higher to $52.45 as it was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.Deere & Co, a maker of farm equipment, increased 5.2 per cent to $60.07 and was raised to “buy” from “hold” at Morgan Joseph with a target price of $75 per share.Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology group by market value, rallied 10.5 per cent to $56.09 after it received approval from US regulators for Prolia, its osteoporosis treatment, two months earlier than expected. Several analysts have cited it as Amgen’s single most important future growth driver. The drug is expected to generate peak sales of $750m to $1bn.Futures and options broker MF Global fell 3.6 per cent to $7.32 after it said it planned to sell up to $150m in shares to raise funds in an effort to restructure its capital base and reduce pressure it faces from rating agencies.The move, however, will negatively impact its earnings per share ratio.Interactive Brokers, a global electronic market maker and broker, added 2 per cent to $16.97 after it posted record brokerage activity last month.Chris Allen, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said: “We do expect some moderation in June but given the strength in May and our positive view on the environment for the market making business, we foresee upside potential for our second-quarter
estimates.”Advanced Micro Devices climbed 4.9 per cent to $8.54. The second-biggest maker of computer processors said it was set to launch the first working versions of its Fusion chips, which it says offer superior graphics features.Target, a value retail chain, gained 0.9 per cent to $54.37 as it confirmed it would begin selling Amazon’s Kindle e-reader in all its stores from Sunday. It is the only bricks-and-mortar retailer to sell the device. Amazon was up 2.5 per cent to $126.31."
106;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-05-30T22:29:13Z;Amgen ready to extend global reach;;Amgen, the US-based biotechnology group, is considering acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry as it expands its geographic reach and product range.While saying that a $20bn deal – the size that analysts say the company could easily finance – would “certainly be a very large acquisition” for Amgen, Kevin Sharer, chief executive, stressed that “expanding is important…and our industry is consolidating”.“We seek good companies at a fair price. We are looking for quality. If we find the right company, we could be quite aggressive. Now is a good time. We would not hesitate if we thought we had the right opportunity,” he told the Financial Times.Mr Sharer stressed that the company would look for targets outside the US and Europe.“We have a larger percentage of sales in North America than is representative of the market. There is a certain dynamic for more geographical balance. While the US and European markets are certainly the biggest…they don’t have the growth potential of some others.”His comments came as European regulators on Friday became the first globally to authorise Amgen’s product denosumab – known by the brand name Prolia – for osteoporosis, signalling the extension of the company’s products from specialist into primary care. Amgen has agreed to market jointly the drug in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico with GlaxoSmithKline, building on its UK partner’s strength in primary care, while keeping the rights for other markets – and the drug’s planned use for cancer – for itself.Amgen has traditionally focused on biological products for speciality care including for kidney disease, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. With growing indications of cut-price generic competition for its products, it has sought to diversify.Osteoporosis has proved an increasingly aggressive market, with drug companies including Sanofi-Aventis and Novartis offering innovative deals with healthcare systems.Mr Sharer would not say whether Amgen would offer similar deals, but said: “We try to be socially responsible in the way we price and ensure value is delivered to the payer. We will certainly be fully competitive in the market…and creative.”
107;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2010-05-19T20:51:27Z;Wall Street lower on Europe growth worries;;US stock markets reversed opening gains as traders sold shares tied to the global economy, ignoring the usually bullish signal of a stronger euro.“What’s interesting is that we’re still seeing the same risk-off trade,” said Jeremy Zirin, US equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “We’re shifting from structural concerns about the eurozone to worries about European growth rates and the global recovery.”After opening higher, the S&P 500 index was down 0.5 per cent to 1,115.05 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 10,444.37. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,298.37.Shares with significant European exposure were hit hard. Harman International, a maker of audio equipment, receives more than two-thirds of its revenues from Europe. Harman led S&P 500 decliners, falling 7.7 per cent to $31.73.Also weighing on sentiment was a weaker-than-expected consumer price index April report. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was just 0.9 per cent higher than this time last year – the smallest annual rise since 1966 – indicating a very mild uptick in economic activity.Industrial companies broadly declined. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, led the Dow decliners, losing 2.8 per cent to $61.44. Aerospace group Boeing fell 2.2 per cent to $66.21 and 3M, the diversified industrial, lost 1.1 per cent to $82.54.“Fundamentally, things are not changing yet but, since the market went up prior to the fundamentals improving, the market can also begin to discount a slight pullback prior to actually getting the data,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet, an agency brokerage.Losses were pared later in the afternoon once the S&P 500 neared 1,100, its 200-day moving average, but bounced higher soon after hitting it. “When sentiment is deteriorating, technical levels have outsized significance,” said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies.Support also came from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting notes, in which policy makers raised their 2010 growth forecast and reiterated their dovish stance.Quarterly net income at Deere & Co, manufacturer of agricultural equipment, jumped from $472m to $547m year on year. Shares reversed and were up 3 per cent to $58.87.Financial stocks took a breather amid encouraging signs on regulatory reform. They were the only S&P 500 economic sector to rise, adding 0.2 per cent.Opponents were fighting an effort to bring the bill to an up-or-down vote, and a push to include a provision authorising states to regulate credit-card interest rates looked to have failed.Visa added 4.1 per cent to $72.97, and MasterCard was flat at $202.45. Shares are still down 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, since an amendment to regulate debit card fees was added to the bill on Friday.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at UBS, reiterated his “buy” ratings on Visa and MasterCard, saying markets were pricing in “unrealistic bear case regulatory scenarios”.Capital One Financial, the consumer credit card lender, added 2 per cent to $42.38. American Express added 0.8 per cent to $40.17.Leading banks were stronger, in spite of pressure from Germany’s decision to limit naked short selling, which led to a drop in shares of European banks. Citigroup added 2.1 per cent to $3.81 and Bank of America led Dow risers, up 2.3 per cent to $16.31.Peabody, the biggest US coal producer, fell 1.8 per cent to $38.49, and rival Massey lost 4.2 per cent to $31.35 as natural gas prices rose closer to $4.30 per million British thermal units.Target, the big-box retailer, reported that net income rose 30 per cent from the first quarter a year ago thanks to stronger apparel sales. European sales worries, however, led shares down 0.4 per cent to $54.03. Walmart dipped 1.2 per cent to $53.04.Hewlett-Packard added 0.5 per cent to $47.00, after first-quarter income beat consensus estimates.Healthcare was also a source of some support. Amgenadded 1.1 per cent to $55.26. JPMorgan reiterated its “outperform” rating on Gilead, citing the likelihood of approval for a key drug, boosting the shares by 1.9 per cent to $39.01.
108;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:39:35+0000;Coca-Cola and industrials help stocks rally;;Encouraging results from Coca-Cola and renewed optimism in the industrials sector helped US stocks bounce back yesterday.Reports of a rescue package for Greece also reassured investors who had feared the country’s fiscal problems could spark a wider crisis across the eurozone.The S&P 500 gained 1.3 per cent to 1,070.52, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.5 per cent to 10,058.64 and the Nasdaq was 1.2 per cent higher at 2,150.87.“The recent bearish charge appears to have run into a brick wall,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Rumour-driven or not, investors’ jitters were abruptly abandoned as traders began to put faith in some kind of practical resolution for Greek state finances.”Strong demand from China, Brazil and India helped Coca-Cola to offset declines in North America and post quarterly results in line with estimates. The soft-drinks maker also gained market share during the period, both in the carbonated and non-carbonated segments. The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $54.01.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, McDonald’s reported that sales had risen 2.6 per cent at restaurants open for more than a year. While revenues continued to decline in the US, sales rose in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Shares in McDonald’s the rose 1 per cent to $63.57.Caterpillar added to the market’s gains after Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment to “overweight” from “underweight”. Analysts at the bank also upgraded the US industrial sector to “attractive” from “in-line”, citing stronger than expected order books. Caterpillar added 5.4 per cent to $53.53, while the S&P 500 industrials index rose 1.7 per cent.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, also benefited from an upgrade and was up 2 per cent at $75.72. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised their rating on the group to “buy” from “neutral”, saying it was well-positioned to gain market share in US corn seed.It emerged that India’s government rejected the country’s first genetically modified food after protests by farmers. Monsanto had supplied the gene for the test vegetable, and the government’s decision to halt production was considered a blow to the group’s prospects for growth in India.NYSE Euronext climbed 5.1 per cent to $23.65 after the transatlantic exchange operator posted a higher profit for the last quarter than analysts had been expecting. Cost-cutting had helped offset declining trading volumes and a diminishing share of the equities market.ADC Telecommunications also surprised the market by reporting a quarterly profit. Analysts had expected the telephone equipment maker to break even. Its shares surged 21.4 per cent to $6.53.Electronic Arts weighed on the market, tumbling 8.8 per cent to $15.96, after the video game publisher gave a disappointing forecast for next year. The group, which is the world’s second-largest player in the sector, blamed its lowered guidance on the lack of blockbuster titles, poor demand in Europe and the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements.Pulte Homes, the country’s largest housebuilder, posted a smaller loss for the last quarter thanks to tax benefits. Revenues rose 5 per cent in the period but the results were worse than expected. Shares in the Michigan group lost 0.5 per cent to $11.08.In the pharmaceutical sector, Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, reported encouraging results from trials of a bone-strengthening treatment. After early strength, the shares lost 0.4 per cent to $57.21.While financial stocks rebounded from the previous session’s lows, the sector still lagged behind the market.Lincoln National, one of the country’s largest life insurers, climbed 4.3 per cent to $24.50 after reporting a higher-than-expected profit for the last quarter.The group suffered from investment losses in the financial crisis but was given a $950m cash injection by the government and has also raised additional funds through a share offering.
109;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-12-07T21:34:13Z;US stocks lower as dollar regains strength;;"US stocks wavered between gains and losses on Monday as Wall Street absorbed last week’s surprisingly optimistic jobs report.The country’s unemployment rate dropped unexpectedly to 10 per cent on Friday but stocks initially fell as the data raised the expectation of higher interest rates.But the market was initially buoyed by news on Monday that China would maintain a “pro-active” fiscal policy in 2010 and keep monetary policy loose.“The market is trying to absorb a lot of things,” said Benny Lorenzo, chief executive of Kaufman Bros, a boutique investment bank and advisory firm in New York. “But the fundamental strengthening in the US economy and the Chinese saying that they will continue their pro-growth policy is winning out for the moment,” he said, commenting on the morning’s trading.However, stocks edged into the red as the dollar regained some of its early strength and the market digested comments by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.The S&P 500 eventually closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,103.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 10,390.11 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,189.61.Telecoms stocks outperformed the rest of the market throughout the session.Sprint Nextel, the country’s third-largest wireless carrier, climbed 13.3 per cent to $4.18 after Barron’s, the investor magazine, said the company could rise as much as 50 per cent due to its purchase of Virgin Mobile USA.Credit card companies also added to the early optimism after Bank of America-
Merrill Lynch raised American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services from “underperform” to “neutral”. BofA-Merrill said economic recovery should improve credit trends and increase consumer demand. American Express rose 0.3 per cent to $39.41.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Citigroup lost 0.7 per cent to $4.03 after it emerged that the bank was locked in talks with the government over how much money it needs to raise to exit the troubled asset relief program.Last week, Bank of America sold $19.3bn in securities as part of a plan to repay $45bn of federal funds.Separately, Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority, sold its stake in Citigroup for $4.1bn, making about $1.1bn in profit.New York Community Bancorp jumped 8.7 per cent to $13.40 after the company said it would offer 60m shares to boost its capital levels following its purchase of certain assets and deposits of AmTrust Bank.On Friday, the group bought an $11bn chunk of AmTrust in a deal assisted by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.McDermott International added to the market’s gains after announcing plans to split into two publicly listed companies, separating its power generation business from its offshore oil and gas operations.Following the deal, expected to be completed in under a year, the group’s shareholders will own 100 per cent of the two different companies. The group’s shares jumped 10.7 per cent to $22.86.In the pharmaceutical sector, Eli Lilly won approval from US regulators to extend the use of Zyprexa, its anti-psychotic medicine, to teenagers with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The drugmaker’s shares were down 0.9 per cent to $37.07 after early gains.Amgen, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, lost 0.7 per cent to $56.48 after it said it would increase its share buy-back programme by $5bn. The group’s shares have fallen this year after safety concerns over its anaemia drugs led to sales declines.Sunpower, the country’s second-largest supplier of solar cells, climbed 9.6 per cent to $24.45 after Barclays Capital raised the group from “equal-weight/neutral” to “overweight/neutral”.Its shares plunged last month after the group said it was investigating millions of dollars in accounting errors at its Philippines operations.Terra Industries, the fertiliser producer, rose 5.7 per cent to $41.27 after CF Industries Holdings lifted its offer to buy its smaller rival to about $4.6bn. CF gained 1.1 per cent to $89.56."
110;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-11-29T22:46:20Z;Soft-talking revolutionary;;"Takashi Shoda has chosen a quintessential English venue for his visit to London, holding court in a plush suite at the Ritz overlooking London’s Green Park. But he reveals his cultural roots when a waiter brings in a tray with green tea.The chief executive of Daiichi Sankyo, one of Japan’s largest pharmaceutical groups, has become accustomed to such cross-cultural experiences. Under his leadership, the company has undergone a merger with a former rival at home, forged US, European and Indian deals abroad, and adapted to a shareholder base of which nearly a third is now located outside Japan.“As a group, we are getting very big and we need to visit different stakeholders as much as possible,” he says. His latest week-long international tour, targeted at foreign investors and subsidiaries, took in the US, Germany and the UK.Mr Shoda speaks softly in Japanese, his phrases scattered with international business terms such as “road show”, and he clearly understands English well, replying to questions rapidly without the need to wait for his interpreter.During an hour-long conversation, Mr Shoda describes the four management revolutions he has witnessed in recent years: a changing relationship between younger and older employees; a series of partnerships and deals between east and west; a merger between two Japanese companies; and the acquisition of an Indian business.Much of the transformation reflects his efforts to adapt to his country’s waning international influence in drug development as the industry and science has evolved.“In the past, Japanese new drugs were third in the world,” he says. “We were very strong in medicinal and organic chemistry. But now biological medicines and antibodies have become very important.”He describes a rejuvenation of staff in Japan and the breakdown of long-established hierarchies based on seniority. “In the past, the level of respect shown to older people was greater,” he says. “The new generation of Japanese are quite different now. When we have town hall meetings, they are very outspoken.”“There is more promotion of younger people than 10 years ago,” the 61-year-old says. He stresses, however, that he is speaking in Asian terms, where he is a relatively young executive. Japanese pharmaceutical companies are still not as aggressive as their western counterparts, some of which have appointed chief executives in their early 40s.He suggests the change partly reflects the growing influence of western practices on his company, and the broader need for greater openness in order to innovate. “The era of trying to do everything in-house is gone,” he says. “Innovation means open innovation: partnership, networking, relationship with academics.“There used to be an NIH – not invented here – syndrome. If a drug project did not begin in-house, we were not interested. That is changing now. Management is constantly encouraging outsiders.”At this point, he opens a briefing book to a page with a multicoloured chart showing Daiichi Sankyo’s pipeline of experimental drugs. In-house products are shaded in green, those of U3, its German biotech acquisition, in orange, and its collaborations with Amgen of the US in pink.Such external deals have helped cement a more cosmopolitan culture internally. “What I see as most important is that we have a lot of breeze coming through the company. Our intranet portal used only to be in Japanese. Now it is in English.”One reason for this, he explains, is that historically Japan had a much more restrained business style. “Japanese young people were not able to express their opinions, while westerners were frank. But now we have the same teams working on the same projects. There is also more understanding on the part of westerners about Japan. Everyone is working towards bringing out medicines as soon as possible.”His third management revolution was in combining Sankyo and Daiichi, two long-established Japanese companies. Many of his western counterparts have gone through mergers, and still bear the dual names of the different parts. But none shares Daiichi Sankyo’s far more cautious approach. The deal was announced in 2005 but not completed until 2007.“Among the large companies, it is not very easy to get together,” he says. “Mergers affect employees massively. Consolidation is [easy to say] but it takes time [to achieve]. We took one and a half years to start the new company. We deliberately took time because it is like creating a new house, not just linking two old houses. There was human resources, IT systems – we created new systems from scratch.”In contrast with most western mergers, where the first company in the combined title often dominates, Daiichi Sankyo has been more of a blending of two cultures. Mr Shoda himself built his career at Sankyo.“It is our policy not to think of where people came from,” he says. “In senior positions, about half come from each. We were very much matched. Both companies were from Tokyo. Each has more than 100 years of history behind it.“But there were differences in management style: one had empowerment by division, the other was flat and horizontal. In one, there was not enough communication but speedy implementation; in the other, responsibilities were not very clear, and consensus-seeking meant slower action. We brought in good DNA and discarded bad DNA.” Diplomatically, he does not reveal which was which.Achieving critical mass was important to fund the pipeline of experimental medicines, he says. He is proud of that fact that his company reinvests 20 per cent of its sales in research and development, though he concedes: “That is higher than others as a percentage, but the absolute numbers remain low.”Mr Shoda – who is also president of the Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers’ association – is cautious about further consolidation in the country’s drugs sector. “[Consolidation] does not mean you just come up with new drugs if you have more money,” he argues. “If two companies don’t have good R&D and they get together for reasons of cost synergy [only], that is not a good consolidation. It would not work.”His final management revolution has proved perhaps the boldest and most challenging to date: the purchase last year of Ranbaxy, a family-held Indian generic drugs company. “The deal was not in the original scenario,” he says. “I was looking for some kind of partnership or alliance and then we had the opportunity, the number one company in India. I seized upon it.”The idea was to acquire a company that had Indian and international reach, but also to rechannel its expertise into Japan, where generic drugs are set to become significantly more important in the coming years as the country seeks to save healthcare costs. But the purchase brought with it a series of problems. US regulators barred Daiichi Sankyo from importing Ranbaxy’s drugs after concerns over the quality of the Indian arm’s manufacturing and the data it provided to inspectors. Ranbaxy has since posted a substantial loss.Mr Shoda has taken direct charge of the Indian company. “Everyone understands that things have changed,” he says. “That’s important. It is not still the family in charge. Ranbaxy has moved to a non-family management. There is an awareness that it has really reached a new era.”In the process, it may well end up transforming Daiichi Sankyo, too."

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Meanwhile, the Nasdaq slipped a faraction lower to 2,139.14. The Dow closed 0.2 per cent higher at 9,885.80 and touched a new intra-day high for the year.Among stocks in the spotlight, Black & Decker jumped 7.6 per cent to $50.82 after the company raised its third-quarter outlook, thanks to better sales and a weaker dollar. Barclays began coverage of the company with an Overweight rating and a price target of $55.In deal activity, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, agreed to buy Proteolix, a private company, for up to $810m. Shares in Onyx rose 5.1 per cent to $28.26.The third quarter earnings season starts in earnest this week and leading companies due with results include Intel and Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday; JPMorgan on Wednesday; while on Thursday, Goldman Sachs, Google, Merck, IBM, Citi, and Advanced Micro Devices report. The week is rounded off with earnings from Bank of America, General Electric, Halliburton and Mattel.ThomsonReuters estimates the earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies for the third quarter at minus 24.6 per cent. The estimated rate has been revised lower from 2.6 per cent at the start of the year, then minus 17.2 per cent at the beginning of April, and minus 20.9 per cent at the start of July.“The Financials sector (+58 per cent) is anticipating the highest earnings growth rate for the quarter, while the materials (-65 per cent), energy (-65 per cent), and industrials (-45 per cent) sectors are expecting the lowest,” say analysts at ThomsonReuters.While a negative quarter would extend Corporate America’s current run to nine consecutive quarterly profit declines, much attention will focus on an expected rebound in earnings next year.As a result, guidance from companies looms as being the key driver of sentiment for equities.“The most critical news is likely to be centred on initial guidance to next year’s business activity and its impact on the bottom line,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“With Street consensus bottom-up earnings growth projected to climb 26 per cent to 27 per cent year over year in 2010, there is not that much room for conservative outlook statements which may be deemed disappointing,” said Mr Levkovich.ThomsonReuters estimates earnings growth rates for the S&P 500 of 192 per cent for the fourth quarter, which benefits from an easy comparison with the fourth quarter of 2008. That is followed by a 34 per cent rise in earnings for the first quarter of 2010.The positive start for equities on Monday was also a function of various brokerage upgrades.Shares in MasterCard rose 0.7 per cent to $216, and Visa gained 1 per cent to $73.70, after they were upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” by Credit Suisse. The bank’s price target for MasterCard was raised from $210 to $255, while Visa was increased from $70 to $84.“An improvement in spending volumes should translate into improving revenue growth in the coming quarters which will increase investor confidence in a higher long term earnings growth rate,” said the bank. “Moreover, the secular shift from cash to plastic continues.”Over at UBS, shares in Advanced Micro Deviceswere raised from “neutral” to “buy” and th chipmaker closed up 0.4 per cent at $29.85.UBS also upgraded Amgen to a “buy” from a “neutral” rating. The stock rose 0.2 per cent to $59.51. Shares in Infosys dropped 0.8 per cent to $47.37 and pared an early rise after Wells Fargo upgraded the company. Abercrombie & Fitch rallied 2.3 per cent to $35.63 after the retailer was upgraded to a “buy”, while Occidental Petroleum rose 1 per cent to $80.31, in spite of being reduced from “buy” to “hold” by Citigroup. The bank lowered the target price for Oxy from $82 to $74.Meanwhile, KB Homes dropped 7.8 per cent to $15.17, after the home builder said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating possible accounting and disclosure issues.Shares in Google were up 1.7 per cent at $525.02.

113;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-09-30T01:03:30Z;Pharmaceuticals: Same end, entirely different means;;"Their headquarters stand less than two kilometres apart, on opposite sides of the river Rhine in the city of Basel in Switzerland.But the strategies adopted by pharmaceutical groups Roche and Novartis could not be more different. They exemplify the growing divergence in the sector, one that has been intensified by the financial crisis.Helped by strong cash flows from top-selling products, both companies have been able to finance substantial acquisitions designed to sustain high sales, profits and market capitalisation. Yet their approaches to achieving these common goals differ markedly.Roche has recently completed the takeover of Genentech. It long held a majority stake in its US-based biotechnology partner but was forced to launch a hostile bid last year to buy out minorities. The deal has reinforced and recentralised the focus of the combined group on speciality care medicines and diagnostics.Despite the recent success of Tamiflu, the antiviral drug now selling widely to treat pandemic flu, most of Roche’s income comes from hospital-prescribed biological treatments such as Avastin, which has ever wider applications in cancer and has been relatively shielded from post-patent competition.That has allowed the company to charge high prices and avoid the need for costly large primary care sales forces, often much criticised for their marketing tactics.But while Roche was planning – though it is now re-thinking – a new headquarters in a skyscraper, Novartis is completing a campus-style home.The scattered selection of low-rise buildings in widely varying styles symbolises its much more diversified approach to business.Novartis sells primary care as well as speciality drugs. It has also extended itself beyond prescription-based, patent-protected medicines.At the moment, it is in the process of acquiring Alcon, an eyecare company, adding to takeovers in recent years of Hexal – which made it the world’s second largest generic drug company – and of Chiron, to build its portfolio in vaccines.While Severin Schwan, who took charge of Roche last year, represents a new generation of recently-appointed pharmaceutical bosses drawn increasingly from law (in his case), finance and marketing, Novartis chief executive, Daniel Vasella, who was appointed more than a decade ago, is one of the few doctors still in charge.The two men represent many of the extremes of the divergence in approaches of drug companies.In the Novartis camp are GlaxoSmithKline, strong in over-the-counter drugs and generics; and Pfizer, broadening its activities with the acquisition this year of Wyeth, which will bolster its presence in vaccines and enable it to access the over-the-counter niche it had turned its back on only a few years before.Sanofi-Aventis has also expanded into generics and animal health through Merial, buying out its joint venture partner Merck, which itself will strengthen its position in animal health by taking over Schering-Plough. Such diversification lowers overall margins, but smoothes cash flow and the uncertainty of developing drugs.The “pure pharma” approach of Roche, on the other hand, is taken by a shrinking number of companies. This includes AstraZeneca, which has persistently rejected large-scale acquisitions since the purchase of the biologicals business MedImmune. Like Eli Lilly, which includes an animal health division, it labours under questions about its smaller scale, as it is over-shadowed by mega-mergers elsewhere.There is undoubtedly pressure to consolidate. “The changes in the macro-environment have transformed everything,” said Fred Hassan, head of Schering-Plough, earlier this year when explaining his agreement to the takeover by Merck. He argued that the financial crisis accelerated existing cost and pricing pressures.Further deals may draw in companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, Biogen Idec and Elan (in which Johnson & Johnson recently bought a stake). Generic companies Ratiopharm and Actavis are up for sale.The crisis has created a buyers’ market for “big pharma”, while many fledgling biotech companies have struggled to extend financing and been forced to seek outright purchasers rather than partners.Three other trends mark the sector. The first is growing pressure from payers in the US and beyond, with greater scrutiny of pricing. That, combined with drug patent expiries and uncertainty over replacement, is driving talk of more innovative commercial and research models. The short-term consequence is cost cutting, such as Eli Lilly’s recently announced 14 per cent headcount reduction by 2011.A second common factor is geographical expansion. As the US market stagnates, most growth is coming from middle income countries, from China to Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa. That requires new thinking about pricing to reach large but poorer pools of patients, often without state or private healthcare cover.Finally, as consultancies including AT Kearney and Roland Berger have highlighted, there is a shift away from central internal control of the drug development and distribution process towards external alliances and partnerships."

But after breaking into positive territory in late morning trading, the Nasdaq closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,138.04.Amgen, said its experimental bone-strengthening drug helped patients with a mix of advanced cancer types, lifting its shares 2.5 per cent to $62.31.Nektar Therapeutics also rose 13.1 per cent to $9.57 after the company entered into a licensing deal with AstraZeneca to develop two of its drugs.“With limited economic news ahead of Wednesday’s Fed decision, markets appear to be treading water for the most part,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.At least eight initial public offerings raising $3.5bn are also set to price in the US this week, in what will be the most active week for equity listings since December 2007. So far this year there have been 22 IPOs.In the technology sector on Monday, EU regulators released details of the alleged anti-trust abuses which led to the €1.1bn ($1.6bn) fine imposed on Intel in May.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, was fined after a long-running probe concluded that the company had abused its dominant market position and used illegal sales practices to encourage computer manufacturers to carry its products. The shares lost 0.1 per cent to $19.54.In spite of commodity weakness, Petrohawk Energy, the Texas oil and gas company, gained 2.7 per cent to $24.26 after the company announced it had agreed to sell its Permian basin properties for $376m to a private company.But Delta Petroleum added to the sector’s woes after it said an exploration well in the Columbia River Basin had brought up only water at the six lowest zones tested and that gas volumes were minimal. The shares fell 44.9 per cent to $2.21.Morgan Stanley raised its price target on General Electric to $19 from $17, saying that the company had been largely ignored by investors over the past two years due to high-profile mistakes and embarrassments at its subsidiary NBC Universal.Rising commodity prices and momentum from recent upgrades helped General Electric gain 12 per cent last week – its biggest weekly gain since May.The shares rose a further 1.6 per cent to $16.76 after early losses due to speculation that Vivendi, the French media company, could sell its 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal this year.Homebuilders fell back after last week’s gains. Data last week showed that US residential building had reached a nine-month high in August.KB Home, the Los Angeles housebuilder, lost 2.2 per cent to $19.77, while Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, fell 1.9 per cent to $21.78.Lennar added to the sector’s declines after the Florida homebuilder reported a larger-than-expected loss for its third quarter.The shares dropped 3.1 per cent to $16.02.

Analysts had been expecting initial jobless claims to rise.Homebuilders rallied after data showed new US residential building rose in August to a nine-month high. A separate study on Wednesday indicated confidence among US homebuilders rose for the third consecutive month in September.Beazer Homes, which operates in 17 states, rose 6.2 per cent to $5.13. Standard Pacific, which also provides mortgage financing, gained 1 per cent to $4.25.But after opening lower, Wall Street struggled to hold on to mid-morning gains.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 9,783.92 and the Nasdaq slipped 0.3 per cent to 2,126.75.On Wednesday, US stocks had rallied to their highest levels since October after industrial production data raised hopes of economic recovery.“The economic news has been primarily good,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com. “We’ve had a heck of a rally and you have a lot of money managers on the side who, whether they like it or not, are forced to participate. But at the same time, when it’s been rallying this much you’re definitely going to get a pause after a few days.”Financial stocks initially led the market higher. Citigroup rose 5.2 per cent to $4.42 after Rochdale Securities said the group’s shares could return to the $5 level and that a share offering or sale of stock by the government was unlikely.Optimism about economic recovery also lifted Bank of America shares 2.1 per cent to $17.61 and JPMorgan 0.7 per cent to $44.96.Rising commodity prices continued to prop up material and industrial companies in early trading before they led the declines in the afternoon. Nucor, the second-largest US steel
producer, rose 3.6 per cent to $49.84 after Citigroup upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold” on expectations the group could return to profit in the fourth quarter.While energy stocks also clung on to the fluctuating oil price, Ivanhoe Energy powered ahead of the sector, gaining 11.1 per cent to $2.41. The oil and gas exploration company said analysts had found one of its oilfields in Ecuador contained as much as 12.1bn barrels.But Peabody Energy fell 1.9 per cent to $39.86 and Patriot Coal lost 5.6 per cent to $12.76 after both were downgraded by UBS analysts, who said stock prices already reflected a recovery in the industry.After three straight days of losses, Oracle, the software company, fell another 2.8 per cent to $21.52. The California-based company has been facing a delay in closing its purchase of Sun Microsystems, and the shares took another battering on Thursday after the company’s first-quarter sales missed analyst estimates.In an effort to return to profitability, American Airlines said it had raised $2.9bn in cash and loans to increase its number of flights from Chicago, New York, Dallas and Miami. Shares in AMR, its parent company, soared 19.7 per cent to $8.80.The consumer staples index led the market during early losses, but from midday it remained in the red. Smithfield Foods added to the sector’s woes, losing 3.3 per cent to $13.71. The pork processor said a public offering of 21.66m shares was priced at $13.85 per share, below the closing price on Wednesday.FedEx shares also slipped 2.2 per cent to $76.46 after reporting first-quarter profit that matched forecasts on Wall Street but lower-than-expected revenue. The delivery company, which is considered a bellwether for US business activity, also reaffirmed its forecast.In the pharmaceutical sector, Immunogen said late on Wednesday that it had extended its licence for technology to develop anti-cancer drugs to Amgen, the biotechnology company. Immunogen rose 3.5 per cent to $8.24, while Amgen gained 1.4 per cent to $60.52."

Its higher profit forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations and the stock declined 6.2 per cent to $31.29.Nordstrom also fell as its new forecast could not counteract slightly lower profit than expected.The shares gave up 6.4 per cent to $27.87. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “People have assumed that the recovery will be consumer led. We have known for many months that that won’t be the case, but it is only just sinking in.”But Abercrombie & Fitch, which has suffered recently as cheaper competitors have eaten into its share of the teenage fashion market, bounced 3.9 per cent to $34.25. Its quarterly loss did not deter investors, who focused on some encouraging sales trends.Boeing slid further than the rest of the industrial sector after the company encountered fresh problems with its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.Boeing said it had stopped work on two parts of the fuselage but denied this would further delay the launch, which is already two years behind schedule. The shares fell 3.8 per cent to $44.87.Elsewhere, struggling DVD rental chain Blockbuster was one of the day’s heaviest fallers after it made a worse loss than expected on weak sales.The results forced

The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent lower at 1,973.16.Shares in Cisco recovered from early losses and rose 0.6 per cent to $22.31. John Chambers, chief executive of the IT networking company, forecast another drop in quarterly revenue, even though it announced better results than expected.Early trading was choppy as investors reacted to news on unemployment and retail sales.Figures showed that fewer people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, but the effect on stocks was hampered by a rise in the number of people continuing to claim benefits.“The jobs data show we are going in the right direction, and that we have hit the bottom, but we think earnings are going to be the driver of the next bull market as things return to normal,” said Frank Ingarra, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.Poor same store sales in July among 30 major retailers and mixed earnings, along with a JPMorgan downgrade of healthcare stocks, were factors in pulling the major benchmarks lower. Thomson Reuters reported a drop of 5.1 per cent in same store sales last month.However, amid the gloom, several retailers raised their full-year profit guidance.Gap, the clothing retailer, jumped after beating its forecasts for July sales and increased its outlook on quarterly profits. The shares rose 8.2 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s was also able to increase its outlook for second-quarter earnings, bringing them far above analysts’ expectations in spite of seeing weaker sales than had been predicted. Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $15.01.Target slipped 0.2 per cent to $41.71 after reporting lower sales than analyst estimates. The company said the dip in comparable sales from last year was in line with its own forecasts.BJs Wholesale Club, which has shown strength during the recession as customers snap up goods at wholesale prices, saw sales drop more than expected, hurt in part by lower petrol prices. The shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $31.24.Within the healthcare sector, which was lowered to underweight by JP Morgan, shares in Gilead Sciences fell 3 per cent to $45.45, while Amgen lost 2.6 per cent to $60.69.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.4 per cent to $69.73 while Chevron lost 0.8 per cent to $69.25.Telecoms were hurt as shares in MetroPCS, the low-cost mobile telephone operator, slumped 29.2 per cent to $8.99. The company revealed a steep drop in new customers and a rise in the number of subscribers leaving its service and its earnings fell well short of Wall Street’s estimates.Financial shares were generally lower, although Citigroup continued its recent run and closed up 6.2 per cent at $3.80.In the insurance sector, Prudential and Allstate both fell after reporting quarterly results.Prudential easily beat analysts’ profit forecasts but failed to raise the upper end of its full-year outlook and the shares slipped 2.7 per cent to $45.63.Allstate’s shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $27.27 after it missed Wall Street’s expectations, suffering from unexpectedly high pay-outs following recent storms in the southern states.Elsewhere Comcast, the cable company, was able to cut costs sufficiently to bring quarterly profits above analyst estimates. After a warning that the company was seeing a continuing slowdown in the growth in new customers this quarter, the shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at $15.05.Rival satellite television provider DirecTV’s stronger-than-expected revenues failed to translate into a rise in profits after one-off charges. The shares fell 3.6 per cent to $24.84.The first day of trading for CDC Software saw its shares close at $9.99, after being offered at a price of $12.
118;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-07-27T20:31:07Z;Late rally lifts Wall Street;;US equities posted small gains on Monday, as investors digested a mixed array of earnings results that overshadowed better news on the housing front.In New York, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 982.18 and closed at a fresh eight month peak.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 1,967.89, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to close at 9,108.51, with Verizon’s latest earnings weighing on sentiment.After the closing bell, Amgen provided some earnings cheer, as its second quarter earnings beat estimates and shares of the biotech company jumped in afterhours trade.The S&P 500 reached its high for the day, at 982.49, after reports that new home sales in June rose 11 per cent from May and inventories of unsold homes dropped to their lowest level since February 1998.While median home prices dropped 12 per cent over the past year, the data provided further evidence that the housing market may have bottomed said economists. The S&P home builders index rose 5.7 per cent.Among the 10 main S&P industry sectors, financials rose 1.5 per cent with information technology lagging by 0.3 per cent.Equity volatility edged up with the S&P Vix (volatility index) trading above 24, after touching a low of 23 last week.Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos believes a normal range for Vix, is between 18 and 22. He said there is still a risk that the S&P 500 could drop back to 825.In the past two weeks, the S&P has risen about 11 per cent beyond 950, the level that had capped stocks since the end of May.Traders believe that the benchmark is on course to reach 1,000, a level not attained since last November. In recent weeks, banks have been raising their year-end targets beyond 1,000 for the S&P.This week’s earnings results will determine whether equities can maintain their recent strong run, say analysts. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup said that while companies reporting earnings to date, some 40 per cent of the S&P 500, have beaten forecasts by about 11 per cent, the results are still down approximately 25 per cent compared with a year ago.“To be fair, margins have been resilient as corporate management teams have been very effective at delivering the bottom line,” he said.Mr Levkovich said that while some worry about the sustainability of growth, it is not an issue until the second quarter of next year and that latecomers to the market rally could miss out as “stock prices will not stand idly by as they generally trade in sync with earnings”.Analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management said: “With liquidity still supportive, high cash levels still waiting to be deployed and a less volatile environment, as well as improved earnings and a reasonable message from technical signals, the near-term environment appears favourable.”Earlier in earnings news, Honeywell reported a drop of 38 per cent for its second-quarter earnings and after an early fall, its shares rose 0.7 per cent to $34.24.The company’s revenue dropped more than a forecast $7.73bn, falling 22 per cent to $7.56bn versus $9.67bn for the same period a year ago.Shares in Verizon dropped 1.6 per cent to $31 after a 21 per cent drop in profits to $3.16bn.The telecoms group announced 8,000 job cuts, and revenue increased 11 per cent to $26.86bn, boosted by growth in wireless subscribers.Corning, the maker of liquid crystal glass, generated second-quarter earnings of $611m, which beat forecasts, but its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $16.50.Meanwhile, Radioshack, the electronics retailer, also beat estimates as it cut costs, but its shares dropped 6.6 per cent to $15.In deals, Agilent Technologies said it plans to buy Varian for $1.5bn in cash, or $52 a share. Agilent rose 1.8 per cent to $22.66. Varian surged 29.1 per cent to trade at $50.61.Shares in Mylan, the drug maker, fell 12.6 per cent to $12.10 as the company denied a newspaper report that its workers overrode government-mandated quality controls.
119;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-07-08T23:21:57Z;Wall Street rallies in choppy trade;;"US stocks rallied late on Wednesday to end a choppy session close to where they began as investors waited cautiously for the start of the earnings season, due to open after the bell with results from Alcoa.The aluminium maker gained 1.6 per cent on an otherwise bearish Tuesday after Klaus Kleinfield, the chief executive, said he was “very optimistic” about sales. The stock swung on Wednesday as investors bet on whether the company would beat its estimates, and ended the day 0.5 per cent up at $9.46.It then jumped in the post-market session after the company reported a narrower loss than had been expected.Meanwhile, NRG defied a bearish energy sector as the price of oil continued to tumble after the company rejected a fresh takeover offer from utility company Exelon as too low.The increased bid was made last week, but NRG rebuffed the offer on Wednesday, saying it fell “far short”. NRG gained 5.8 per cent to $23.35, while Exelon closed 1 per cent up at $48.21.Financial stocks also suffered, in spite of the promise of revenues from mortgage purchases, as new mortgage applications were shown to have risen 10.9 per cent last week.Investors were more concerned with predictions from the International
Monetary Fund that the global economic contraction this year would be slightly worse than previous estimates and that the recovery was “likely to be sluggish”.Those words were echoed by G8 leaders, who are meeting in Italy this week. A G8 draft document read: “Significant risks still remain to economic and financial stability.”Citigroup and Bank of America lost 2.6 per cent to $2.62 and $11.84, respectively.“The overwhelming theme is still one of trepidation,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “Moving into earnings season, a lot of people now think those green shoots were at best weeds. There doesn’t seem to be any
reason to buy financial stocks right now.” But the stock market was able to rebound off its lows during the afternoon after a well-subscribed auction of 10-year government debt reassured investors about the state of US finances.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 879.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 8,178.41 and the Nasq Composite index dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,747.17.“There has been a reassessment of the profit outlook as last week’s weak unemployment report suggested consumption is not going to be nearly as strong as stock prices suggested when the S&P was at 940,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.The most significant support came from the healthcare sector, where Amgen surged 13.9 per cent to $59.50 after the company said its lead experimental drug, which helps strengthen bones, performed better than a potential rival in a clinical trial.It was joined in early trade by Amylin, Alkermes and Eli Lilly, which rose after the companies said an application for a jointly developed weekly diabetes drug had been accepted by the Food and Drug Agency.But all three gave up those gains amid the wider sell-off. Amylin ended 1.4 per cent lower at $12.29, Alkermes was down 0.3 per cent at $10.23 and Eli Lilly was 0.2 per cent worse off at $33.42.There was some strength from copper miners after Citigroup upgraded Free-port McMoRan and Southern Copper. Both gained 0.2 per cent to $45.10 and $19.16, respectively.Consumer stocks were more resilient, however, with results from Family Dollar providing a boost.The budget retailer jumped 12.4 per cent to $31.18 after profits surged 36 per cent and the company said fourth-quarter profits would be in line with or above current estimates.But Pepsi Bottling Group fell in spite of beating analysts’ expectations as sales fell short of what investors had hoped. Its shares dipped 0.4 per cent to $33.53.In the technology sector, Google claimed first blood in its latest battle with Microsoft. Google plans to launch a PC operating system to rival Windows and saw its shares climb 1.5 per cent to $402.49. Those for Microsoft rose only 0.1 per cent to $22.56."
120;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-06-17T03:10:17Z;Economic data strengthen mood on Wall St;;US stocks made a modest rebound on Tuesday morning following the previous session’s sell-off.Commodities stocks remained volatile as the price of oil and metals snapped their two-day losing streak to head towards the highs set during last week. Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the last few sessions, picked up ground once more. AK Steel rose 6.3 per cent to $19.47 while US Steel, which is re-hiring workers in Illinois and Ontario to cope with higher demand, advanced 3.9 per cent to $38.54.Oil also rose, peaking back above the $72 mark after climbing $1.48 to $72.10 per barerel of US crude. That lifted energy producers, including ConocoPhillips, which was 1.9 per cent up at $43.90 and Schlumberger, which rose 1.3 per cent to $59.32.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April. But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.Economists said inflation remained a distant threat. “The continued moderation in the growth of broad money suggests there is little reason to fear that the Fed’s quantitative easing will lead to sharply higher inflation and interest rates,” wrote Capital Economics.Equities were also boosted by figures showing that builders started work on 532,000 homes in May compared with expectations of just 508,000. This lifted homebuilders before the bell after they were some of the previous session’s heaviest fallers, following an unexpected dip in confidence in the sector. Lennar picked up 6.6 per cent to $8.12 and DR Horton gained 3.1 per cent to $9.68.The positive economic data saw futures extend their early gains, but they fell again shortly before the open after industrial production in May was shown to have fallen more than expected. The markets then opened just about in positive territory.After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent up at 927.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,634.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,830.06.Best Buy, the biggest US electronics retailer, slipped after reporting earnings roughly in line with analysts’ expectations. The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, and even though it maintained its full year guidance, the shares fell 4 per cent to $37.11.Meanwhile shares in Adobe rose ahead of its earnings, which were due out after the bell. The company said it would start charging for the online version of its Acrobat reader program after moving the product out of public testing stage. The shares advanced 0.4 per cent to $28.93.Citigroup slipped 0.6 per cent to $3.35 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, told the Detroit Economic Club’s National Summit that companies were going to have to look away from American consumption for growth drivers as the US faces slower growth and less credit. The fall came in spite of reports that five companies were in the bidding for its Japanese asset management arm, a deal which could earn the bank $1bn.The telecoms sector suffered a difficult morning after Barclays Capital said investors were likely to move out of the sector, with continuing high unemployment making growth difficult to achieve. Barcap downgraded AT&T, which fell 1.1 per cent to $24.38 but retained its overweight rating on rival Verizon, despite cutting its price target to $34. Verizon’s shares were a fraction lower at $29.72.Research in Motion, meanwhile, maker of the Blackberry mobile device, unveiled a new model which aims to compete globally with Apple’s iPhone. Its shares gained 3.1 per cent to $82.86.Amgen, the Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company, climbed 2.5 per cent to $50.69 after its shares were upgraded by the broker Sanford Bernstein, which said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the next year.European stocks were higher early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 0.2 per cent at 865.01. Asian equity markets slid for a second consecutive session, with the Hang Seng index losing 3.1 per cent to 17,946.48.Bond yields were up, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising 2 basis points to 1.24 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note gaining 3bp to 3.74 per cent.The dollar was weaker against major currencies early in New York, losing 0.6 per cent against sterling to $1.64.Gold was trading $0.67 higher at $934.48 per troy ounce.Oil prices were up early in New York. US crude prices were $1.48 higher at $72.10 a barrel.
121;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-06-16T20:29:29Z;Wall Street slides on consumer spending fears;;US stocks lost early gains on Tuesday as they headed towards a second consecutive session of losses.Investors worried about the health of consumer spending after Best Buy reported weaker sales than expected and falling profits.The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, but instead it saw revenues fall as customers cut back on spending. The shares lost 7.3 per cent to $35.84.There was some positive news on the sector from Tyco Electronics, which makes electronic connectors. The company said sales had improved in consumer-related markets and profits may be almost three times higher than forecast. Its shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $19.98.But this could not prevent Best Buy’s weak sales from encouraging investors to sell shares in other retailers. Targetfell 3.7 per cent to $38.62 while Home Depot lost 2.7 per cent to $23.20.Stocks had been supported during the morning by rising commodity prices, but these fell again during the afternoon, extending the trend of the previous two sessions, dragging metal producers with them.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, dropped 5 per cent to $52.39 and Alcoa, which produces aluminium, declined 2.8 per cent to $10.90.Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the past few sessions, intially picked up ground after Nucor said orders had improved over recent weeks, helping it to project a narrower quarterly loss than expected.But Nucor was the only one to hold onto gains amid the sell-off and the shares closed 2.4 per cent up at $46.86.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 1.3 per cent down at 911.97, and 8,504.67 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.1 per cent to 1,796.18.“The market is rtrying to figure out right now whether this is some sort of correction that is building or if it is just a break in an extended recovery,” said Larry Coates, chief executive of Oak Value Capital Management.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April.But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.There was also a boost from figures showing that builders started work on many more homes in May than expected.But some analysts warned the headline figures on housing starts hid worrying trends.“Inventories remain high, and builders seem to be building to compete with cheap foreclosed houses, which will keep the pressure on prices,” said Brett Hryb, portfolio manager with MFC Global Investment Management.The positive effect of the economic data was further tempered by figures showing industrial production in May fell more than analysts had predicted.Healthcare was one of the few sectors to enjoy a positive day as investors bet President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms would have to be scaled back after the Congressional Budget Office said the current plan would leave 30m Americans uninsured.Health insurers have suffered on the White House plans, which include scaling back subsidies for those companies. But as the proposals came under attack, major insurers gained.Aetna rose 4.7 per cent to $23.58 and Coventry Health climbed 3.5 per cent to $16.71.The sector was further boosted by Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares climbed 3.6 per cent to $51.21 after they were upgraded by Sanford Bernstein. The broker said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the year.Citigroup dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, said companies would have to look elsewhere than American consumption for growth drivers as the US adjusts to slower growth and less credit.AT&T dropped 1.7 per cent to $24.22 meanwhile after its shares were downgraded by Barclays Capital, which said continuing high unemployment would make growth difficult.
122;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-06-12T01:46:02Z;Sanofi hobbled by lack of investor support;;There is probably nothing more frustrating for a chief executive than answering to uncommitted core shareholders. Ask Louis Gallois. The EADS chief has long sought to pull off a US acquisition to expand the Franco-German aerospace group’s defence activities and reduce its dependence on its Airbus civil aircraft business.But Mr Gallois’ core industrial shareholders – France’s Lagardère and Germany’s Daimler – have systematically blocked his ambitions. Not so much because they consider such a move risky, but because they are anxious for EADS to preserve its cash and are reluctant to dig into their own pockets to support the longer-term development of a company they are both keen to exit.Largardère wants to focus on its multimedia activities, while Daimler’s priority is its car business. Both have made it clear that they eventually want to dispose of their stakes. But in the current distressed aviation market, this is hardly the moment to sell. So their strategy seems to be to wait for the industry cycle to turn and the EADS shares to recover to enable them to dispose of their remaining stakes. In the meantime, the last thing they intend to do is increase their exposure to the aerospace business.The same fate now seems to have befallen Chris Viehbacher, the new chief executive of French pharmaceutical group Sanofi-Aventis. The former top GlaxoSmithKline executive was recruited last year by the group’s core shareholders – the French oil major Total and the L’Oréal shampoo group – to shake up the pharmaceutical company’s strategy and revive its languishing share price.Like other big international drug companies, Sanofi-Aventis is under pressure to replenish its pipeline as patents expire on its best-selling drugs. The company has been seeking to develop new drugs to replace these blockbusters, but the productivity of its own research and development departments has been disappointing. All in all, Sanofi now needs to make acquisitions to compensate for the sales it stands to lose from patent expiries – let alone to ensure its future growth.Mr Viehbacher has wasted little time in embarking on his new mission. From the beginning he said his strategy would be to make small to mid-size deals to boost the company’s drug development and pipeline. He has already made several such acquisitions. But it also seems he had been entertaining grander plans.With his peers engaging in a significant new wave of consolidation, Mr Viehbacher could hardly sit back in his Paris office and look out of the window across the Seine. After all, Sanofi-Aventis, with its low debt, has all the financial resources to mount a mega-acquisition. Although the company on Thursday flatly denied that Mr Viehbacher had proposed making a big US acquisition to his board, that does not mean he did not consider one and informally discussed it with board members. Rumours on Thursday suggested he might have been thinking of Amgen, the big US biotechnology company with a market value of about $50bn.The obvious conclusion is that Total and L’Oréal simply did not want to know.The reason is that both companies, which have both repeatedly said they want to dispose of their remaining Sanofi stakes in a gradual and progressive manner, are above all interested in avoiding risky operations that could affect the recovery in Sanofi’s share price.Download debacleThe entertainment business applauded the French government’s initiative to introduce legislation to crack down on the illegal downloading of music and films as a breakthrough in their battle against internet piracy.Unfortunately, for both the industry and President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government, they had not banked on the French Constitutional Court ruling this week that such legislation would contravene basic civil rights, as defined in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. On this basis, the country’s top court, whose judgment cannot be overturned, argued that free access to online services was a human right.What this means is that only a judge – and no longer the state regulatory agency the government is setting up – will have the power to cut off offenders from the web. This will undoubtedly make it all the more difficult, if virtually impossible, to enforce the new legislation given France’s overstretched and lengthy judicial system.As a result, Mr Sarkozy is now caught in a difficult position as his government rewrites the law. He wants to please his friends in the arts and entertainment world, not least his wife. But he will also have to heed the civil rights sensibilities of France’s rising political class – the Greens who scored so strongly in the European elections.european.view@ft.com
123;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Pharmaceuticals’ stronger prescription;;David Brennan may have flown to George W. Bush’s adoptive state of Texas last weekend for his inaugural speech as president of the US pharmaceutical industry’s trade grouping but, he wryly observes, his handover in a year’s time will take place in Chicago, home of President Barack Obama.The nod to the new political order would be fitting. In the period between the two events, Mr Brennan will have plenty to cope with in his day job running AstraZeneca, a big drugmaker, as he and his peers brace themselves for the impact of healthcare reforms set to take place while Mr Obama is in the White House.“It’s no longer a question of ‘if’, it’s a question of ‘how’ it takes place,” he says, echoing the sentiments of other pharma chiefs, all of whom are scrutinising changes planned for the world’s largest market, which still accounts for nearly half of global drug sales.Under Mr Obama, they face wide-ranging reforms to the system of regulation, pricing and use of medicines. The revamp comes at a time of a broader shake-up in an industry whose products are facing ever greater competitive pressures, amid doubts over its ability to develop innovative replacements. Rarely have the tensions in the industry been so great or the diversity of strategic responses so varied.In public, the industry’s response to the intended reforms has been cautiously positive. The day after Mr Obama’s election last November, PhRMA, the organisation now chaired by Mr Brennan, launched a pre-emptive advertising campaign stressing its existing efforts to make healthcare affordable and drugs available to the uninsured. “We have the potential to get a better healthcare system,” he says, adding that the industry has to “demonstrate real value with differentiated medicines”.The markets have so far proved less enthusiastic. After several months during which the industry outperformed most other sectors because of its relatively recession-proof sales, the mood switched as Mr Obama made clear he would pursue his campaign pledges for healthcare reform. Some saw the shadow of a repeat of “Hillarycare”, when Hillary Clinton began her ill-fated efforts to reform the system in the mid-1990s.The reality this time is more nuanced. Bernstein Research, an investment house, recently dubbed the short-term impact as small enough to be “nearly a rounding error to earnings per share”. Morgan Stanley analysts see material effects only after 2011, instead stressing broader structural pressures affecting the industry.A number of the president’s actions should be largely positive for producers as well as patients. If it goes ahead, his plan to extend healthcare coverage to the 47m Americans who are uninsured should lead to more medical consultations and thus additional prescriptions for the industry. Mr Obama has already taken some initial steps to broaden protection, by championing the extension of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, adding a further 4m to the existing 7m children from families with modest incomes who are provided with medical care.Separately, as part of his recent fiscal stimulus package, he has included $10bn (£6.8bn, €7.5bn) a year in extra funding for the US National Institutes of Health to kick start further academic work that will help spark collaborations and ideas for future pharmaceutical developments. Couple that with Mr Obama’s demand for swift repeal of Mr Bush’s ban on federally funded stem cell projects and his particular stress on finding a cure for cancer, and the atmosphere for basic biomedical research in the US has been given a considerable boost.Just as important, in applied research, Mr Obama’s stimulus earmarks $17bn to convert patient records into electronic form, allowing far more detailed analysis of medical conditions and outcomes. A further $1.1bn on “comparative effectiveness” research will help identify the best treatments already in use.But increased medical cover, through programmes such as Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor, will further increase the role of the public sector, which already accounts for the majority of US drug purchases. The result will be to boost the government’s bargaining power. Mr Obama’s proposals increase the mandated rebate that companies must give on their drugs for Medicaid patients from 15.1 per cent to 22.1 per cent. Up for fresh scrutiny is the agreement in a former Republican-brokered Medicare reform that Washington would not become directly involved in price negotiations.Pricing pressure will also intensify in other ways. Mooted measures at the Food & Drug Administration have raised the spectre of the import into the US below current prices of medicines sold more cheaply abroad, including in neighbouring Canada. Some of the most expensive medicines on the US market – biological drugs such as monoclonal antibodies for cancer – seem set to face price competition after a long period when the difficulties in characterising and safely replicating these products has guaranteed the makers a virtual monopoly even beyond the life of their patents.Following the lead of European regulators two years ago, who argue that the scientific obstacles can be overcome, Mr Obama has pledged his support for “biosimilar” legislation. That would create a framework for the first time for regulators to approve lower-cost equivalent drugs produced by competitors. Companies such as Amgen, largely built on biological drugs, will face unprecedented price pressures.Comparative effectiveness research is also likely to pull the US in the direction of an international trend towards “health technology assessment”, such as that practised by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which provides advice based on both efficacy and cost as to whether the National Health Service should approve a particular drug. This would add to pressure on drugs that fail to demonstrate a clear treatment benefit over alternatives. Furthermore, whatever form government purchasing takes, private US health insurers are also imposing tougher conditions, removing drugs they consider less efficacious from their formularies or requiring patients to contribute to their costs directly.The pharma industry has long argued that falling prices will threaten its ability to invest and develop new medicines. Higher prices in the US, the claim goes, reflect an unwillingness by other nations to bear their share of the costs of research and development.But that attitude is being questioned. A recent study by McKinsey, the management consultancy, suggests that drugs in the US cost 50 per cent more than their equivalents in other developed countries. It argues that prices include a substantial premium even after adjusting for America’s higher comparative wealth and higher marketing costs and even assuming the entire pharmaceutical industry’s global research and development cost has to be absorbed by the US.Companies are responding to the pressures in a variety of ways. All are cutting costs, outsourcing production and reducing staff. Up to 50,000 jobs could go across the sector over the next three years, says Mr Brennan. As happened in the mid-1990s, the indications of political reform have also proved a catalyst for mergers. Fred Hassan, head of Schering-Plough, which recently agreed a $48bn takeover by Merck, says: “We were in line with our strategic plan and doing well with good growth, but the changes in the macro-environment have changed everything. There are rising hurdles to get new products approved, and more and more large-scale trials. You have to have more staying power, and size helps.”Andrew Witty, GlaxoSmithKline’s chief executive, has stressed the importance of diversification by product and geography, as well as the need for more complex pricing to reflect the new environment. GSK has launched Promacta, its platelet-boosting drug, at $3,000 a month in the US, while arguing it represents a therapeutic improvement on more expensive rival products already on the market. “Enough is enough,” he says. “You’ve got to balance affordability and a holistic view.”He is emblematic of a new generation of pharma industry leaders, many with operating experience outside the US, who see the importance of new commercial models and greater diversification as the secret to their survival. Instead of large-scale deals, he has overseen bolt-on acquisitions to buy others’ brands – from patented drugs to consumer health products – in parts of the world where he believes he can make them work better.Novartis has opted for diversification to reduce the uncertainties in developing patented drugs. It is adding Alcon, an eyecare business, to its diverse portfolio, after four years ago becoming the world’s second largest generic drugs business with the purchase of Hexal of Germany. Sanofi-Aventis seems set to follow suit.Other companies prefer to stick with patented medicines, albeit with a growing emphasis on expanding their markets outside the US and diversifying from chemical-based to biological drugs and vaccines. “Our primary priority is to strengthen our pipeline,” says Mr Brennan, adding that he prefers licensing deals and only small-scale acquisitions. “Our view is more oriented to collaboration than consolidation.” His approach is shared by Eli Lilly but other midsize companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Biogen-Idec and even Amgen could yet be drawn into consolidation.In the middle are companies such as Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker, which recently reversed a strategy of focusing on innovative medicines with its $68bn takeover of Wyeth. In so doing, it has bought itself a little more time from patent expiries of some of its top-selling medicines and the possibility of quick savings from cost cuts. “There is a tremendous opportunity right now,” says Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer’s chief executive. “It’s certain [US healthcare reform] will cost us money at first, but we need the confidence to take a long-term view.”The problem is that – just like despondent patients – few companies appear to have found a formula that works for any great length of time. There is much talk about providing incentives for researchers and emulating the entrepreneurial environment at the smaller biotech companies for which many of them previously worked.Most companies are expanding their partnerships with external researchers and some talk about working more closely with other companies, academics and regulators alike. Mr Brennan says his priority in the coming months is to ensure the industry is “engaged in the agenda on shaping healthcare reform”. But while both that process and efforts to stimulate research and development go on, pressure on pricing grows ever stronger.
124;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;A dose of pharmaceutical competitiveness;;"Last December, only weeks after Barack Obama had won the race for the US presidency, Richard Clark, the head of Merck, arranged a meeting with Fred Hassan, his opposite number at Schering-Plough.In the world of pharmaceuticals, the meeting would mark a significant change of era. The two men’s offices are a few miles apart in New Jersey, historic centre of gravity of the US industry, and their companies have similarities and a history of co-operation.But, for Merck, the proposal was radical. In spite of its decades-long tradition
of “going it alone”, with research and development largely done by in-house scientists, Mr Clark suggested a merger. The move produced Monday’s $41bn deal to buy Schering-Plough.The transaction, in the wake of Pfizer’s $68bn take­over of Wyeth unveiled in January, and Roche’s ongoing $46bn hostile buy-out of minorities at Genentech, could trigger further consolidation in the sector.For Merck, there is a clear logic. Like other large groups, it faces patent expiries on existing drugs and is struggling to find replacements. With the downturn driving down cash returns and depressing equity valuations, it is an attractive time to do a deal.Joining pipelines improves prospects of bringing drugs under development to market, while diversifying into less profitable but less uncertain products, such as over-the-counter medicines and animal health.The combination allows Merck to reduce costs, with planned annual savings of $3.5bn from 2011.It has already co-operated with Schering-Plough, notably in the development of Vytorin, a medicine to lower cholesterol. “We’ve always been impressed with Fred’s leadership and our two cultures are very similar,” says Mr Clark.The key question, which explained the lengthy negotiations before the deal’s announcement, was price. The company was being courted by another New Jersey peer, Johnson & Johnson, which some analysts argue was a closer fit.Schering-Plough has a healthier pipeline of drugs in development than many groups, and is under less pressure from patent expiries. But Mr Hassan says: “We were in line with our strategic plan and doing well with good growth, but the changes in the macro environment have changed every­thing. There are rising hurdles to get new products approved, and more and more large-scale trials. You have to have more staying power, and size helps.”The final shape of the deal is not yet clear. Schering-Plough technically acquires Merck, although the latter is clearly the dominant partner.A primary aim was to avoid triggering a “change in ownership” clause, which would have forced Schering-Plough to hand over its joint development of Remicade to its partner Johnson & Johnson. That clause may yet be contested.Peter Kim, Merck’s head of research and development, argues that while there is
a strong fit between the medicines on which the two companies were working, there are very few duplications or overlaps that would spur antitrust regulators to demand sell-offs.Merck could either combine or sell off the two animal health businesses, for instance. In any case, its management will face considerable distractions as it attempts to combine the companies – a process for which it has little experience on which to draw.A broader question is how far the deal – or the forces that drove it – will lead to still more consolidation in the sector. “These things always come in threes,” one large institutional investor said on Monday. “Valuations are not high and it’s a very good time to act.”Mr Obama’s commitments to healthcare reform suggest there is likely to be further pressure to cut medicine prices, compounding existing long-term trends. And getting drugs through the regulators is becoming more difficult and costly.Bristol-Myers Squibb could be next, with interest from both AstraZeneca of the UK and Sanofi-Aventis of France – both of which are partners with the US company in drug development. Amgen and Biogen Idec are also cited. “The problem is we are running short of buyers,” the investor said."
125;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-02-01T23:32:40Z;Sanofi to join Pfizer on acquisition trail;;Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceuticals company, is gearing up for acquisitions to expand and diversify operations under its new chief executive.In the wake of Pfizer’s $68bn takeover of Wyeth last week, Sanofi-Aventis has held talks with bankers about possible deals.The move would mark the latest in a spurt of consolidation in the pharmaceuticals sector, at a time when the short-term financial strength of some of the larger companies provides opportunities to address long-term structural problems.In a presentation to staff last Friday ahead of his first public statement when the company announces full-year results next week, Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi-Aventis’s chief executive, indicated that he was interested in acquisitions to both expand and diversify its range of businesses.Mr Viehbacher, who was hired last autumn from GlaxoSmithKline after Sanofi-Aventis dismissed Gerard Le Fur, is keen to make his mark with a similar but still bolder version of the strategy adopted by Andrew Witty, who beat him to the top job at GSK in late 2007.UBS estimates that Sanofi-Aventis could raise €17bn-€20bn ($22bn-$26bn). The company reported third-quarter cash-flow generation of €1.9bn, against a backdrop of falling debt.Bristol Myers Squibb – which had previously been considered a merger partner and with which Sanofi-Aventis jointly controls the rights to the blood-thinning blockbuster Plavix – is one takeover option. Other US targets frequently discussed Amgen and Biogen Idec, which would help diversify its portfolio. But there are also several niche companies in which Sanofi-Aventis may take an interest, including generic drugs companies Actavis and Ratiopharm, and Crucell, the last significant independent vaccine maker.A number of large pharmaceuticals companies held back awaiting Pfizer’s move, fearing otherwise that they would be drawn into expensive bidding wars.With Pfizer’s management time and cash now committed to Wyeth, Roche freshly launched on a $42bn hostile bid for Genentech, and other large companies such as Novartis, Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca already absorbing recent acquisitions, the field of rivals has suddenly narrowed.GSK looks set to extend its cost-cutting programme, including thousands of redundancies, in the latest industry response to increased competition from generic drugs manufacturers.
126;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;Pfizer seals $68bn Wyeth purchase;;Pfizer on Monday unveiled a $68bn takeover of Wyeth, reasserting its flagging position as the world’s largest pharmaceuticals group and paving the way for a fresh bout of consolidation across the sector.The acquisition – to be paid for using equal amounts of cash, equity and debt – creates a group with $71bn in sales from a broad range of products and plans to save $4bn in annual operating costs by cutting 15 per cent of its combined workforce.Pfizer had been under growing investor pressure to boost its performance as a series of top-selling drugs come off patent, led by the loss of exclusivity in 2011 of Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering medicine that contributes a quarter of current annual sales.In a sign of its difficulties, the company reported a 4 per cent fall in fourth-quarter sales to $12.4bn and a 90 per cent drop in net income to $266m after a $2.3bn settlement with the US ­district attorney of Massachusetts probing its marketing ­practices for painkiller Bextra.The scale of the new group and the restructuring it will trigger are likely to spark other pharma­ceuticals mergers and acquisitions that have been held back while waiting for Pfizer.Bankers said that the transaction would also boost confidence by demonstrating that cash-rich companies could still find opportunities amid the market turmoil.“This is the first time in months that we have seen an old-fashioned M&A deal, complete with financing and it has cheered the market,” one banker said.The deal is the eighth-largest M&A involving a US target, according to Thomson Reuters, which estimated that the seven advising banks could earn as much as $150m in fees.It is also the third largest globally in the sector after Pfizer’s $89bn acquisition of Warner Lambert in 1999 and the $79bn GlaxoSmithKline merger in 2000.Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer’s chief executive, said: “The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth provides a powerful opportunity to transform our industry …This is a very positive sign for the American economy and American business, and shows that the banks are doing what they are supposed to be doing.”Sanofi-Aventis, of France, which appointed a new chief executive, is among rivals likely to launch takeovers, while long-cited targets include Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Amgen.

128;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T21:41:39+0000;Pfizer nears purchase of Wyeth;;Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals group, is in talks to acquire rival Wyeth in a deal that would be worth more than $60bn.The two companies have been in on-off talks for six months, people close to the situation said, but these accelerated in recent weeks. A deal could be announced as soon as Monday.However, those people cautioned that they were still negotiating final terms and any agreement between the two companies could still fall through.Pfizer, which is sitting on a $25.5bn cash pile, is understood to be offering about 40 per cent shares and 60 per cent cash. It is being advised by Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. Wyeth is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Evercore. All declined to comment.The move comes as the world’s leading pharma companies face a slowdown in growth as revenues come under threat from the expiry of patents, shrinking pipelines and increased generic competition.If successful, the deal could mark one of the biggest in a year where merger and acquisition activity across all industries has suffered a steep decline because of the difficulties of financing and could spur a wave of industry consolidation.Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering Plough have all been cited as potential targets, while Roche Holding, the world’s biggest maker of cancer medicines, was still trying to put together the financing to acquire fully Genentech, the biotechnology company in which it owns a majority stake, which could be valued at $44bn.However, Pfizer has been facing greater pressure than many of its peers, because its blockbuster anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor – which accounts for almost a third of the group’s revenue – goes off-patent in 2011.Tim Anderson from Bernstein Research said: “[Pfizer] essentially has no realistic way of replacing the many drugs that are scheduled to go generic apart from doing a mega-merger.”A deal between Pfizer and Wyeth would yield a more diversified company with an attractive franchise in vaccines, as well as a move into consumer health products with more than $70bn in sales and billions of dollars in targeted cost savings.The deal could affect Wyeth’s plans to consider the acquisition of Crucell, a Dutch vaccine maker.Pfizer and Wyeth may decide that a takeover of Crucell would be too complicated. But given Crucell’s status as one of the only independent vaccine makers, Pfizer could also opt to fold it into its business.04-Nov-99111,792Warner-LambertPfizer17-Jan-0079,628SmithKline BeechamGlaxo Wellcome26-Jan-0471,294AventisSanofi-Synthelabo15-Jul-0259,826PharmaciaPfizer21-Jul-0842,581Genentech (44.1%)Roche Holding09-Dec-9839,875AstraZeneca Group17-May-9933,816HoechstRhône-Poulenc20-Dec-9931,868Pharmacia & UpjohnMonsanto07-Mar-9627,018Ciba-GeigySandoz23-Mar-0619,284Schering (92.4%)Bayer26-Jun-0616,600Pfizer (consumer healthcare business)Johnson & Johnson27-Mar-0114,961AlzaJohnson & Johnson
129;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2009-01-04T23:31:53Z;Pfizer eyes merger deal with large rival;;Pfizer, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical group, is willing to acquire a large rival drugs company to improve its financial health, in a move that could trigger a fresh round of mergers within the sector.Jeff Kindler, chief executive, said: “The real goal is to grow revenues …We are open to opportunities and constantly looking at those which are big, small and inbetween.”His comments stand in stark contrast to those of his peers, who have increasingly focused on small-scale deals and partnerships while turning against the “mega-mergers” that created the current industry groups including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, GSK and Sanofi-Aventis.But any large-scale acquisition by Pfizer could drive a fresh round of consolidation in the sector, as other companies await the US group’s move before responding with deals of their own. Unlike most other sectors in the current downturn, pharmaceuticals boasts many companies that can still fund deals through substantial cash reserves.Mr Kindler’s remarks reflect Pfizer’s strong need to compensate for a forecasted sharp drop in sales as its existing patented drugs become exposed to competition. These include anti-cholesterol treatment Lipitor, the world’s top selling medicine with more than $13bn in annual sales, on which exclusivity ends in 2011.He stressed that “We are always open to opportunities to enhance licensing, alliances and acquisitions, but whatever we do – small or large – has to meet the criteria of shareholder value.”Investors have argued that Pfizer could strengthen its expansion into biological medicines by purchasing Amgen, the largest independent quoted US biotech group, which has developed a range of promising medicines.
130;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;Merck joins rush to develop generics;;Merck on Tuesday became the latest big pharma group to move into generics, a sharp break from its roots.In an update for investors, the US pharmaceutical company said it would create a division called Merck Bio-Ventures as “a leading provider of follow-on biologics”, with the aim of launching one drug and having a further five in development within four years.The move reflects growing recognition by the drugs industry of a profitable new niche.While all chemically-based innovative brands are subject to low-cost generic competition as soon as their patents expire, Merck would become one of a far smaller number of companies starting to challenge the developers of more complex biological medicines.Such developers have been largely shielded from price competition but US regulators are planning to ease the rules, after similar measures undertaken by European regulators, which has led to the launch of “biosimilars” in the past two years.Moving into the generics niche is particularly bold for Merck, which has traditionally focused on innovative, chemical-based medicines developed in-house.Richard Clark, chief executive, said: “Next year will continue to be a period of fundamental transformation that establishes Merck as a different competitor for the next decade.”The development marks a particular threat to Amgen, the world’s largest free-standing biotech company, with Merck’s first planned product identified as MK-2578 for anaemia, a direct challenge to Amgen’s best-selling drug Aranesp.A number of pharmaceuticals companies have been expanding into the generics sector, notably Novartis, through its acquisition of Hexal in Germany in 2006, and Daiichi Sankyo, through its purchase this year of Ranbaxy of India.Both GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis have also extended their generics activities, although so far concentrating on the development of cheaper versions of chemically-based medicines.Vijay Karwal, managing director with RBS Global Banking & Markets, said big pharma may be better placed than traditional generics companies to benefit from easing of rules because they have more technical expertise.However, Ronny Gal, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, questioned whether Merck was “best positioned” for the move, giving its traditional resistance to litigation around patents, and lack of experience in low-cost manufacturing and pricing. “It’s not really their gig,” he said.Merck will use biological expertise it acquired with the purchase of GlycoFi for $400m in 2006.
131;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2008-10-23T23:30:10Z;Wall St volatile on mixed earnings and jobs news;;"US stocks were mixed after another highly erratic session on Thursday as investors considered whether relatively upbeat corporate earnings showed the global economic slowdown may not be as grim as the market’s brutal sell-off has implied.The session began in upbeat fashion. Dow Chemical, Altria and Eli Lilly were up 10.5 per cent to $24.43, 1.5 per cent to $19.58 and 4.3 per cent to $33.48, respectively, after overshooting analyst estimates.However, the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent to 908.11 points having swung between losses of 4.3 per cent and gains of 2.9 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2 per cent higher at 8,691.25 points but the Nasdaq Composite Index ended 0.7 per cent down at 1,603.91 points.Financials were one of three sectors to drag on the market, down 0.9 per cent. Goldman Sachs tumbled 5.3 per cent to $108.58 after it emerged that the bank was planning to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in response to the deteriorating environment.The sector was also hit by further stress in money markets after signs of improvement this week. The rate at which banks lend to each other over the long-term rose for the first time since the fresh round of government intervention in the banking system this month.General Motors lost 1.5 per cent to $6.10 after it emerged that the group was to begin involuntary lay-offs.The news from Goldman and GM came after first-time unemployment benefit data jumped more than forecast. “There is every reason to expect hiring to drop in the wake of the disaster in the stock markets and the continued tightening of credit,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics.The rise came after the benchmark S&P 500 index fell to a fresh five-year low in the previous session after poor figures from companies such as AT&T and Boeing.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 14 per cent, to 79.43, which continued to signal a heightened level of distress. It had fallen as much as 7.5 per cent in the session.Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that the global financial crisis was a “once-in-a-century credit tsunami” and he foresaw more
lay-offs.Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that this quarter, companies could no longer “have good earnings and expect that your stock’s going to go higher”.Coca-Cola Enterprises tumbled 18.5 per cent to $9 after the soft-drink bottler and distributor lowered its profit forecast for the year, while the consumer discretionary sector was another key weight on the market, off 0.5 per cent.Homebuilders were among the hardest hit sectors. Pulte Homes dropped 18.5 per cent to $8.11 after posting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.Online retailers tumbled in sympathy with Amazon, which earlier rose as much as 1.8 per cent to $50.91 after the group lowered guidance for the fourth quarter. It ended the session 0.7 per cent higher at $50.32 while Ebay rose 1.9 per cent to $15.32.Xerox slid 3.4 per cent to $7.71 after the office supplier posted weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.Energy was the biggest winner, up 6.6 per cent overall, helped by oil’s edge towards $70 a barrel as well as positive results in the sector. National Oilwell Varco advanced 9.4 per cent to $26.78 after profit topped forecasts.Chevron and Exxon Mobil jumped 8.2 per cent to $66.77 and 9 per cent to $70.39, respectively. Transportation stocks enjoyed an early boost on the back of well-received earnings.Union Pacific, one of several hard-hit railway stocks, jumped 2.4 per cent to $58.25 after the railway company unveiled better-than-expected results.United Parcel Service gained 3.8 per cent to $48.13 after its drop in profit was not as bad as feared.Amgen climbed 11.8 per cent to $55.55 after the world’s largest biotechnology company forecast optimistic full-year earnings on the back of a fivefold increase in quarterly profit.In technology, Microsoft, which lost 7.8 per cent in the previous session, recovered 3.7 per cent to $22.32 ahead of results due after the bell."
132;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2008-08-03T17:57:31Z;A healthy attitude to risk;;"Severin Schwan’s bright, blue eyes betray no strain in spite of weeks squinting down microscopes, peering into fermentation tanks and staring at assay trays.Since becoming chief executive of Roche in April, the 40-year-old Austrian has been on a whirlwind tour to gauge for himself what is widely viewed as the world’s most successful big pharmaceuticals company.He has heard biologists tell how the company could extend its leadership in cancer into auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. And he has travelled well beyond Roche’s headquarters in Basel – where a curvaceous new 42-storey skyscraper will eventually symbolise the group’s status as the world’s most profitable drugmaker – to Genentech and Chugai, Roche’s majority-owned associates in the US and Japan.Such peregrinations have not stemmed from a need for frequent flier miles or because the new chief executive has just parachuted in from outside. The understated and soft-spoken Mr Schwan is a company veteran, having joined Roche 15 years ago after studying business and law in Innsbruck. He decided not to pursue law, regarding it as too narrow and country-specific, in favour of commerce, and has worked for no other company since.Mr Schwan’s youth, his non-scientific background and – less important nowadays – the fact he was not Swiss meant his elevation to chief executive came as a surprise. His career began in finance and continued through administration, including stints at foreign subsidiaries. Even his last job, which provided the springboard to the top, was running diagnostics, by far the smaller of Roche’s two divisions, accounting for only about a quarter of group sales.He ducks the question how such an outsider beat more seasoned rivals such as Erich Hunziker, Roche’s respected chief financial officer, and William Burns, the head of pharmaceuticals. Instead, Mr Schwan stresses his suspicion of metrics and the importance of teamwork – both to define his management style and what Roche requires.“I spend a lot of time with people at the front: I’m not interested in PowerPoint presentations but prefer to go to the source, spending time with a project leader in his research lab or meeting a multiple sclerosis patient and his physician in the hospital. You can learn a lot from people in a true dialogue: for me this means listening and asking questions,” he says.Collaboration is paramount for Roche. The group has a decentralised structure and – at least until this month’s bid to buy out minorities at Genentech – a hands-off relationship with subsidiaries that analysts say has been a major contribution to its success. The federated structure has fostered focused research, with each company concentrating on specific areas, but has also been supple enough for collaboration on marketing.Development of Avastin, for example, the breakthrough cancer treatment discovered by Genentech, was accelerated by a division of labour between it and Roche, with each concentrating on different types of the disease. Acterma, a novel rheumatoid arthritis treatment discovered by Chugai and already on sale in Japan, is now being prepared by Roche for Europe and the US.Mr Schwan says such teamwork is essential in a knowledge-based business such as pharmaceuticals, where scientists need the freedom to think. “When I toured our labs, I grasped the potential and the enthusiasm of our people. We have to capitalise on that. If you tell your people all the time what to do, don’t be surprised if they
don’t come up with new ideas. Innovative people need air to breathe.”He accepts there has to be broad guidance too and makes clear that teamwork also requires results. “Our culture of working together at Roche is based on mutual trust and teamwork. An informal, friendly manner supports this: at the same time, this must not lead to negligence or shoddy compromises – goals must be achieved and, at times, tough decisions have to be implemented.”His strategic priority now as chief executive is to reinforce the co-operation between Roche’s scientists involved in discovering new drugs and their counterparts in diagnostics.Many pharmaceuticals analysts believe such proximity has become inevitable as leaps in molecular biology help drug researchers identify much more closely the chemical and biological characteristics of the new treatments they are seeking, allowing them to focus their research efforts much more accurately. Diagnosis also aids the efficacy of new drugs by helping identify the sorts of patients most likely to benefit. “You need diagnostics to develop tailor-made medicines,” Mr Schwan says.He tried to encourage teamwork when still rising up their ladder in diagnostics. “But such efforts were largely on a one-off project basis. After taking over diagnostics in 2006, I tried to do things more systematically. And, as chief executive of the group, I now want to do that more than ever.”The process has already started. At Roche’s big biotech production site at Penzburg in Germany, for example, researchers from pharmaceuticals and diagnostics work together on new cancer treatments under one roof rather than being separated as in the past. With Mr Schwan as chief executive, such contacts will be deepened.“This also has to do with encouraging people to take risks: innovation needs courage. And if something goes wrong, let’s put the issue on the table, learn from it and resolve it together. In our
sort of business, it’s extremely important to be willing to celebrate failure.”Celebrating failure may sound extraordinary coming from the chief executive of a company with SFr46.1bn ($44bn, €28bn, £22bn) in sales and SFr11.4bn in net profits. But Mr Schwan uses a recent example to illustrate his point. For much of last year, Roche was locked in a bitter legal dispute with its US rival Amgen over the intellectual property rights to their two competing drugs for anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease.Roche’s lawyers were convinced of the merits of their case and pushed the legal battle to the limits. In the end, a US court sided with Amgen, barring Roche’s Mircera drug from the all-important US market.Mr Schwan did not admonish the lawyers for poor judgment: just the opposite. He made a point of congratulating them for pursuing what they believed was the correct outcome. “No one in group legal has been punished or censured,” he says.“Risk aversion is typical of the culture of a big company. People believe they’ll never advance by sticking their necks out. We want to develop a culture of encouraging risks to distinguish ourselves. We want quality, not quantity.”"
133;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2008-07-29T20:51:54Z;Wall St shrugs off writedowns and housing data;;US stocks shrugged off news of further writedowns in the financial sector and some weak housing data to make steep gains on Tuesday due to a sharp drop in oil prices and decent earnings reports.Oil prices fell about $3, prolonging a four-week slump that has seen prices tumble from more than $145 a barrel to about $122.That news, and an unexpected rise in the Conference Board’s gauge of consumer confidence, helped trigger broad equity advances.Nine of the 10 top industry groups were in positive territory. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.3 per cent, industrials gained 2.7 per cent and technology posted a 2.1 per cent rise.The moves helped offset news of an $8.5bn stock offering from Merrill Lynch. After the close on Monday, the brokerage also announced a further $5.7bn in writedowns on certain mortgage securities.The International Monetary Fund said the US housing crisis could continue for some time and stood by its estimate that losses for the banking system could reach $1,000bn, sending financials into a tailspin.As if to underline that thesis, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite home price index dropped 15.8 per cent in May compared with a year earlier.That was the biggest decline since 2001, but was smaller than expected, and housebuilding stocks rallied 9.1 per cent.The news from Merrill heartened some analysts.Meredith Whitney, of Oppenheimer, noted that the stock was closer to “fairly valued levels” and applauded the “purging of assets as an attempt to cut its losses and focus on stabilising its platform and righting the franchise towards growth”. Analysts at CreditSights, a research provider, noted the moves made Merrill “more appealing as a takeout candidate.”Investors seemed to agree and Merrill’s shares overturned early losses to gain 7.8 per cent to $26.25. The S&P 500 financials index surged 7.5 per cent, led by an 8.2 per cent advance for regional banks and a 9.7 per cent gain for diversified banks such as Wachovia and Wells Fargo.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2.3 per cent higher at 1,263.2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.4 per cent at 11,397.56 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,319.62.The second-quarter earnings season continued apace. So far, about 255 companies in the S&P 500 have reported and, on average, earnings have dropped 22.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Financials were the worst performers, posting a 90.2 per cent decline, but excluding that sector, profits rose 8 per cent.Overnight, Amgen, the biotechnology company, reported that net income fell 7.7 per cent due to poor sales of certain anaemia drugs. But the fall was smaller than expected and it raised its full-year earnings forecasts. Amgen’s shares rose 3 per cent to $62.28.In the consumer staples sector, Colgate-Palmolive also beat expectations, posting a 19 per cent increase in profit as it passed on costs to the consumer and achieved strong sales in Asia and Latin America. Colgate’s shares rose 8.2 per cent to $74.15, leading the broader sector to a 2 per cent gain.In the consumer discretionary sector, McGraw-Hill said profit fell 23 per cent, but the education and financial services company re-affirmed its 2008 earnings forecasts and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $39.78.The drop in oil prices proved a boon to the likes of Dillard’s and General Motors. The pair added 8.3 per cent to $10.43 and 8.2 per cent to $11.90 respectively.Consumer-facing technology groupsbounced back from Monday’s sell-off. Ebay, Apple and Dell climbed 3 per cent to $25.52, 1.7 per cent to $157.08 and 3.3 per cent to $24.01 respectively.In industrials, transportation stocks led the gainers with a 4.5 per cent advance. Ryder System added 5.7 per cent to $68.35, UPS added 3.3 per cent to $63.31. FedEx rose 5.2 per cent to $82.12.Material stocks were among the leading gainers, advancing 2.2 per cent thanks in part to US Steel. The company said second-quarter profits more than doubled on higher steel prices. US Steel’s shares rose 14.1 per cent to $165.76.The oil moves were less positive for energy stocks. ConocoPhillips dipped 2.4 per cent to $80.27 while Schlumberger slid 1.4 per cent to $96.23.
134;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2008-07-28T22:31:26Z;Wall St falls amid gloomy US housing forecasts;;"Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as investors digested mixed results, a rise in oil prices and a report from the International Monetary Fund arguing that the US housing crisis could continue for some time.The day began well after Kraft, the foodmaker, said that second-quarter profits rose from $707m last year to $732m because it passed on the rising costs of food and fuel to customers. Kraft rose 4.9 per cent to $30.83.The results helped the consumer staples sector advance, but only until chicken producer Tyson disappointed the market with its third-quarter results. It said profits fell 92 per cent to $9m, hit by the rising cost of food for poultry. Tyson shares dipped 7 per cent to $15.09.Verizon Communications’ second quarter results were better than expected but left investors uninspired. Verizon shares fell 2.5 per cent to $33.60 dragging the telecoms sector down 2.4 per cent.Financials made early gains after lawmakers voted in favour of a housing bill designed to support the mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and prevent foreclosures for about 400,000 homeowners.But enthusiasm for the sector wore off after the IMF said that financial markets remained “fragile” and warned that “a bottom for the housing market is not visible”. The IMF stood by its prediction that losses from US mortgage woes could total about $1,000bn.American International Group fell 12 per cent to $23.96, Citigroup 7.5 per cent to $17.89 and JPMorgan 4.7 per cent to $37.66. The S&P 500 financials index fell 2.3 per cent and an index of investment banking stocks fell 4 per cent.Merrill Lynch fell 11.6 per cent to $24.33. Over the past 10 days the brokerage has gained and lost about 30 per cent of its value.Consumer discretionary and industrials stocks fell back 2.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively on the news and the slide was reinforced by a small rise in the price of oil.General Motors and Ford fell 7.6 per cent to $11 and 5.9 per cent to $4.75 while General Electric dipped 3.6 per cent to $27.69. An index of homebuilder stocks slid 5.4 per cent.At the close, all 10 leading industry groups were in the red dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.9 per cent to 1,234.38 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.1 per cent to 11,131.08 points and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 2 per cent to 2,264.22 points.Last week, stock markets fell as financial stocks came under pressure in a volatile period of trading, taking their cue from poor housing data, predictions of further credit-related losses and concerns that an earnings-induced rally was overdone.Second-quarter earnings season kicked into high gear last week and the news has been mixed. Of the 236 companies in the S&P 500 to have reported, earnings, on average, have dropped 23.3 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Financials have been the worst performers, posting a 92.3 per cent decline. Excluding the sector, profits rose 9.5 per cent.Brian Belski, sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, noted that investor reactions had been “volatile”, that many companies had offered below consensus guidance for the full year, but that pockets of strength were being overlooked.“Strength in actual technology earnings for the second quarter has been cast aside by increasing doubts surrounding forward guidance . . . [although] technology is by far the strongest sector in terms of exceeding forward guidance so far this year,” Mr Belski said.That continued as technology stocks slipped. Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $20.12, Apple lost 4.8 per cent to $154.40 and Google fell 3 per cent to $477.12. Earnings news should remain in the headlines this week as about a quarter of the S&P 500, including Disney, Motorola and Viacom, report.Amgen shares rose 12.2 per cent to $60.48 prior to its results after a study showed that its treatment for a bone-thinning disorder helped prevent fractures. A number of analysts also upgraded the stock. The news helped hold losses in the healthcare sector to 1 per cent.But Vanda Pharmaceuticals slid 70.2 per cent to $1 after regulators rejected the company’s Iloperidone schizophrenia drug. Vanda will halt development of the drug “pending further review” of the FDA’s rejection letter.Energy stocks were among the best performers, down only 0.5 per cent, as refiners suffered from the rise in oil prices. Tesoro fell 1.1 per cent to $15.30; Exxon Mobil slid 1.3 per cent to $80.68."
135;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
136;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2008-04-10T20:42:13Z;Upbeat Wal-Mart lifts Wall Street;;US equities overcame a wobbly start to close higher on Thursday as improved profit forecasts from Wal-Mart and a series of upgrades for technology shares helped damp fears that first-quarter corporate earnings will take a pummelling.Wal-Mart said sales in March rose 0.7 per cent helped by grocery and flat-panel television products and it raised earnings estimates for the first quarter.Its shares rose 1 per cent to $54.66 and its rival Costco added 0.7 per cent to $66.52.Technology stocks were the best performers, however, as analysts edged back from the most pessimistic earnings predictions.Cisco Systems shares rose after Morgan Stanley said the maker of networking equipment may beat consensus revenue estimates in its third quarter. Cisco added 2.2 per cent to $24.04.Lexmark International, the printer maker, and Apple, the consumer technology giant, were also upgraded. Lexmark was among the top gainers in the S&P 500, adding 8.4 per cent to $32.91, while Apple rose 2.1 per cent to to $154.55.Long-suffering semi-conductor stocks also rallied after an analyst at Banc of America said that indicators suggested a bottom might be near for the sector. The S&P 500 Semiconductor index, which has lost about 16 per cent of its value since December, clawed back 2.8 per cent.Intel climbed 3.1 per cent to $22.08 while LSI rose 5.1 per cent to $5.61.The benchmark S&P 500 rose as much as 0.9 per cent before paring those gains at the close. The index finished the day 0.5 per cent higher at 1,360.55, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,351.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.4 per cent to 12,581.98.Wal-Mart’s success came at the expense of high-street retailers as consumers squeezed by higher energy prices and falling confidence downshifted to the mass retailers in search of value.Data showed that same-store sales at chain retailers fell 0.5 per cent in March, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Apparel and department store sales were particularly badly hit, dropping 11.2 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively. Gap shares fell 2.2 per cent to $18.47 but Dillards climbed 3.1 per cent to $21.14 and JC Penney added 3 per cent to $40.07.For the most part, the first-quarter earnings season has been a downbeat affair and it hit a nadir on Wednesday when United Parcel Service, a bellwether of the US economy, predicted profits would fall as a domestic slowdown took effect and rising energy prices increased costs.Since the start of the year analysts have consistently revised forecasts downward, but at the start of the week they were still predicting first-quarter earnings growth of about 7 per cent for the S&P 500, excluding financials.Amid the broader market rally, financials were a weak spot. Banks and brokerage stocks were hit by a muted report on Lehman Brothers and news that it had bailed out five of its debt funds affected by the paralysed credit markets.Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said Lehman’s survival strategy of deleveraging and derisking would reduce long term returns. “This new harsh reality is sobering to those looking for a quick fix for the financial sector.”Lehman shares swung between losses and gains but by session end were down 0.7 per cent at $40.25.Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.1 per cent to $170.55 and an index of investment banks, which has fallen for six out of the last seven sessions, lost 2.4 per cent.In the healthcare sector Amgen bounced 5.7 per cent to $43.98 after analysts said efforts to overturn an injunction banning Roche from selling an anaemia medicine that violates patents owned by Amgen were unlikely to succeed.Deal activity also provided momentum. In pharmaceuticals, Tak­eda, the Japanese company, proposed a takeover of Millennium Pharmaceuticals for about $8.8bn in cash. Millennium shares rose 48.9 per cent to $24.34.Meanwhile, reports that Yahoo was edging towards a three-way alliance with Google and AOL to protect its independence or at least force its unbidden suitor, Microsoft, to pay more, buoyed related stocks.Yahoo climbed 3 per cent to $28.59, while Time Warner, which owns AOL, added 1.2 per cent to $14.61. Google rose 1.1 per cent to $469.08 and Microsoft moved up 0.8 per cent to $29.11.
137;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2008-02-05T05:20:28Z;Takeda buys Amgen’s Japan arm;;Takeda, Japan’s largest pharmaceutical company, on Monday moved to shore up its pipeline as it announced an agreement to buy Amgen’s Japan subsidiary as well as the commercial rights to nearly 13 of the biotechnology company’s experimental drugs for up to $902m.As part of the deal Amgen will receive an upfront payment of $200m as well as $340m in estimated development costs and $362m in expected milestones over the several years.Takeda will also pay as much as $275m to become Amgen’s global partner for the oral agent Motesanib Diphosphate, currently in phase two of its development as a treatment for cancer.The sale of Amgen’s Japan subsidiary is part of a global cost-cutting program at the world’s largest biotechnology company to offset a decline in revenue and a drop in profit growth.The deal widens Takeda’s pipeline of drugs as the company prepares to deal with future competition from generics companies as drugs come off patent. Actos, the company’s diabetes tablet, and one of its leading drugs, is a profit staple but its patent expires in 2011.Fumiyoshi Sakai, a pharmaceuticals and biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse, said that Takeda’s deal with Amgen would enable it to “buy time,” as developing technology from scratch takes years.The Tokyo-based unit develops products including biotechnology-based treatments for diseases including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.Apart from Motesanib Diphosphate, the remaining molecules included in the partnership are biologics.Takeda has cash reserves of about Y1,700,000bn and could make further acquisitions.“Takeda needs a pipeline, but more than that they need a compound,” said Mr Sakai. “Japanese companies are chasing these human antibody-type drugs because they feel they’re behind some of the US and European pharmaceutical companies in this technology.”“The deal with Amgen is a step in the right direction but it’s not enough,” he added. “Business-wise it’s better than nothing and will probably be taken positively.”Amgen was forced to restructure last year as questions over the safety of its anti-anaemia treatments caused a reassessment on how they, and similar products by Johnson & Johnson and Roche, should be used.Amgen’s outlook for this year remains cautious. It expects earnings, excluding items, to remain flat at best or fall up to 7 per cent at worst.Last year, Amgen’s profits increased 4 per cent to $4.8bn while earnings per share increased 10 per cent to $4.29. The group forecast earnings this year to fall to a range of $4 to $4.30 per share.The group expects sales this year to fall slightly to $14.2bn-$14.6bn, compared with $14.8bn last year.

A quarter-point rate cut by the Bank of England and no change by the ECB were overshadowed by comments from Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president. He fuelled fears about the outlook for inflation with an unexpectedly hawkish statement.Germany’s Xetra Dax closed flat at 7,940.58, having risen to within striking distance of the 8,000 level which it has breached three times this year.Financial stocks were Europe’s biggest gainers after smaller-than-expected subprime writedowns from RBS removed some of the uncertainty that has been hanging over the sector. Allied Irish Banks rose 3.1 per cent to €15.58, Bank of Ireland gained 3.7 per cent to €10.83 and Anglo Irish Banks added 2.4 per cent to €10.97.France’s Société Générale gained 2.6 per cent to €105.11, BNP Paribas added 1.5 per cent to €76.87. Swiss titans UBS and Credit Suisse rose 0.9 per cent to SFr56.10 and 0.9 per cent to SFr68.50 respectively.Roche, the world’s biggest maker of cancer medicines, dropped 3.2 per cent to SFr204.5 after the US Food and Drug Administration failed to give the green light to its breast cancer treatment, Avastin, citing an increased risk of fatalities. Analysts quickly cut their forecasts and price targets for the company.German pharmaceutical group Merck also saw its shares falter after the European Commission granted its American competitor, Amgen, conditional approval for a colon cancer drug. Merck slid 2.9 per cent to €87.90.TNT rose 4.4 per cent to €28.98 after the Dutch government postponed plans to end the logistics company’s remaining mail monopoly in the Netherlands. Postponing liberalisation of the mail market until 2011, the limit likely to be set by the EU, could add €1 a share to TNT’s valuation, according to Piethein Leune of ING.Swatch climbed 4 per cent to SFr341 after the world’s largest watchmaker announced its “best ever” November sales. Traders said the update suggested the company was maintaining the pace of its first half organic sales growth of 20 per cent.Citigroup initiated coverage on Wednesday with a “buy” recommendation and SFr370 price target, noting that the shares were trading at a 10 per cent discount to the rest of the luxury goods sector.Airlines gained after Air France-KLM said it would make a bid for lossmaking Italian airline Alitalia, a long-awaited move which is only expected to face a serious challenge from small Italian airline Air One. Air France rose 2.4 per cent to €23.81 while Alitaliagained 3.1 per cent to €0.87.France Telecom fell 3.8 per cent to €24.70 after Exane BNP Paribas downgraded its recommendation from “neutral” to “underperform”. Traders were underwhelmed by France Telecom’s financial targets for 2008 delivered at Wednesday’s investor day.ArcelorMittal rose 1.5 per cent to €72.18 after the world’s largest steelmaker announced an expansion of its investments in Kazakhstan. It plans to spend $400m to $500m to increase coal output and invest a further $200m to expand capacity at its steel mill.
139;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Wall St gives up gains as oil rises above $80;;"US stocks lost steam late on Wednesday, as investors watched oil prices rise above $80 a barrel for the first time, and the dollar set a record low against the euro.The S&P 500 index closed unchanged at 1,471.56, down from a high of 1,479.50 early in the day. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,592.07 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent lower at 13,291.65.No significant US economic reports were released on Wednesday and Federal Reserve officials had begun their customary period of silence ahead of next week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.The economic calendar is light until Friday when the latest retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation reports arrive. These will provide policymakers with their last pieces of data before they meet to discuss monetary policy.At this juncture, investors expect at least a 25 basis point cut in the 5.25 per cent Fed Funds rate. But given the continued strains in global money markets facing financial institutions, some economists and investors are calling for at least a half-
percentage point easing.Tom di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co, said: “The financial markets and the economy need a 50 basis point cut.“There will be disappointment if the Fed cuts 25 basis points.”Until next week’s FOMC meeting, stocks are likely to lack direction, and volatility should remain near recent highs, say traders. Volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index was down 0.9 per cent at 25.04 after a rise to 26.21 in early trade.Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities, said: “Volatility is unlikely to diminish nor are volumes likely to pick up before the Fed cuts rates, but, once it does, I think it is reasonable to expect the equity markets to steady.” He said earnings and valuations would then probably determine the outlook for stocks.“For Wall Street, the price-earnings ratio is at the low end of the range for this bull market,” said Mr Lenhoff. “Even if earnings expectations are revised to reflect half the growth that is now expected over the next 12 months, we are still talking about a forward price earnings ratio of around 15 for the S&P 500.”Meanwhile, the dollar set a record low against the euro, and the dollar index was flirting with its record low set back in 1992. In general, equity investors have viewed the ongoing decline in the dollar this year as a boon for stocks that have international operations.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said: “A slow, steady decline in the dollar can help equities, but ultimately it will be inflationary for the economy and restrict the Fed’s ability to cut rates.“A weaker dollar will help large-cap and growth stocks at the relative expense of small companies and value.”On Wednesday, the S&P 100 index rose 0.1 per cent, while the Russell 2000 index of small companies lost 0.6 per cent.The Nasdaq 100 index of large technology companies has risen 13.2 per cent this year and leads the main US benchmarks by a healthy margin.Among big tech companies, Apple rose 1 per cent to $136.85 after UBS raised its price estimate to $182.Another asset market influencing stocks was oil. US crude futures rose to a record intra-day high of $80.18 a barrel after weekly stockpiles fell more than expected.In turn, energy stocks were firmer, with Exxon Mobil up 0.8 per cent at $87.65, but the transport sector was under pressure. The Dow Transports Average fell 0.8 per cent. The American stock exchange oil index was up 0.7 per cent at 1,397.13, shy of this year’s high 1,522.10 set in July.Texas Instruments was 1.7 per cent lower at $35.12. The mobile phone chip maker nudged third-quarter forecasts higher, but some of the upward guidance was derived from an asset sale, rather than operations.The S&P financials sector, which rallied 1.3 per cent on Tuesday, fell 0.2 per cent on Wednesday. Countrywide continued its decline and the mortgage lender lost 1.5 per cent to close at $16.62. This week, the stock has fallen 8.7 per cent amid concerns about its ability to access funding.Amgen rose 3.3 per cent at $55.64 after its anaemia treatment drug received a favourable ruling from the US Food and Drug Administration. Johnson & Johnson rose 0.7 per cent to $62.51."
140;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-09-10T22:53:27Z;Similarity is breeding tougher competition;;As pharmaceutical companies struggle to respond to the intensifying threat to their medicines from generic rivals, one company has taken the view that if it can’t beat them, it had better outdo them.Through its Sandoz division, Novartis is gearing up to launch in Europe a ground-breaking cut-price “biosimilar” version of erythropoietin (Epo), the drug that made Amgen of the US one of the few successful large biotech groups.“It’s important for us to communicate and get clearly across that we have a means of reducing the cost of this product significantly – with benefit for payers and patients,” says Andreas Rummelt, head of Sandoz.The move is a first significant step towards head-to-head competition in the fast-growing $55bn annual worldwide market for biological medicines.Such drugs’ complexity and the more recent filing dates of their patents have until now shielded their developers from direct commercial threat.The attraction of biosimilars is clear. Innovative drugs require a full programme of development and clinical testing, which the industry claims costs $1bn for each successfully launched product.Conventional generic medicines can piggyback, demonstrating that they generate the same result or “bioequivalence” in a patient at a cost of just a few million dollars. That allows manufacturers sharply to undercut the price and remain profitable.Biological medicines rest in between conventional generics and newly developed drugs. Mr Rummelt estimates that each costs “double digit millions”, since they require substantial manufacturing investment and must still be tested in expensive clinical trials.Sandoz’s initial challenge with its Epo alfa was regulatory approval. No two biological medicines are ever exactly alike, explaining why the label “biosimilar” (or “biological follow-on” in the US) has been applied.Emea, the European medicines agency, had to develop “regulatory pathways” governing approval of each category of biological medicines.It did so despite warnings from the biotech industry about the dangers of copies of its products. A case widely cited – including by Amgen – is that patients treated with Epo made to its own specifications by Johnson & Johnson, its European partner, suffered rare side effects that caused the drug to be pulled from the market.Sandoz’s next hurdle will be persuading doctors to prescribe its drug across the EU. France has already ruled out “substitutability”, which would allow prescription of an original Epo to be switched for a cheaper biosimilar. With physicians and patients shielded from the cost, competitive pricing may prove only a limited selling point.Sandoz’s human growth hormone Omnitrope – a much simpler biosimilar that did not require a separate regulatory pathway and was approved last year – provides an indication of the difficulties ahead.It remains a small and slowly growing part of the market, with most sales to new patients rather than to existing patients who switch products.A second problem for Sandoz is that drug development does not stand still. Other generic companies have filed for approval of rival Epos. Roche has its own Epo beta – approved as an original drug rather than a generic, though subject to litigation with Amgen over the patents.Shire this year launched Dynepo, or Epo delta, while Amgen has introduced an improved form of its Epo drug Epogen called Aranesp.A final issue for Sandoz will be what Mr Rummelt calls “the $100m question”: when and if the US follows Europe in launching a regulatory pathway for biosimilars. The Food & Drug Administration has moved slowly, and enabling legislation now seems unlikely this year.Annual Epo sales worldwide are just $7bn, with $3bn in Europe. While patents are expiring on other biological products, Ronny Gal, an analyst with Bernstein Research, argues that the market will only really open up once patents expire on more lucrative drugs such as those to treat cancer and auto-immune diseases.Biosimilars may be coming, but for now almost as slowly as the lengthy development cycle of the new drugs they are designed to replace.
141;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-09-10T22:45:18Z;Novartis to launch generic bio drug;;Novartis is to shake up the market for Amgen’s blockbuster Epo drug for kidney patients by launching a cut-price generic equivalent in Europe as soon as next month, a senior company executive said on Monday.Andreas Rummelt, head of Sandoz, Novartis’s generics arm, said the Swiss group’s version of Epo alfa would be put on sale in the UK and Germany in the coming weeks, and was likely to be priced about 25-30 per cent cheaper than the original medicine.The launch marks the first significant move in an important shake-up for the biotechnology industry, which has long operated without the threat of lower-priced generic rival products even after its medicines come off patent.It follows Novartis’s breakthrough with final European regulatory approval granted at the end of last month to authorise its Epo alfa as a “biosimilar” version of Amgen’s Epogen.This came after Novartis demonstrated similar safety and efficacy, but without having to go through the full clinical trials required for a new patented drug.Biotech companies such as Amgen are now facing the need to restructure as their drugs come off patent, but have warned that biological medicines are far more difficult to make and replicate than chemical medicines long subject to cut-price generic competition.Amgen has already introduced a newer Epo called Aranesp still on patent, which it markets as superior, although its original off-patent Epogen still accounts for $2.5bn in annual sales.Sandoz’s version, which will be initially sold under its Hexal corporate brand, will also present a fresh competitive challenge to two other innovative Epo products, Roche’s Epo beta and Shire’s Epo delta.Mr Rummelt said he would be surprised if the launch would trigger a price war with rival products, but there could be competition over “additional support services, how to dose and devices”.Sandoz has already gained approval for Omnitrope, its biosimilar human growth hormone.However, Epo is the first of a newer generation of more complex and profitable biological medicines set to face competition now that European regulators have established a “pathway” for approval.He said that Omnitrope had cost more than $100m to develop, partly because it was a pilot project, and that other biosimilars such as Epo would cost “double-digit millions”.That makes them considerably more expensive than a few million dollars for traditionally chemically based generic medicines, but still attractive at only about a tenth of the cost the industry says it takes to develop a new patented medicine successfully.
142;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-09-04T14:46:01Z;Rule changes ease pharma pain;;Many of the world’s biggest companies have rushed to India to establish research and development centres. Cisco, SAP, Suzuki, Yahoo and Alcatel are among the heavyweights that have collectively pledged to invest billions of dollars.Notably absent from the rush are global pharmaceuticals companies. Many fled India in the 1980s when the country would not grant patents on pharmaceutical products. But since 2005 a new, stronger Indian patent regime, enacted as part of World Trade Organisation negotiations, has rekindled interest.Lingering concerns over how New Delhi will implement the new rules has curbed investment from global pharmaceutical makers in drug development. Apart from UK drugmaker AstraZeneca, which in 2003 revealed a $40m tuberculosis research centre in Bangalore, few are setting up facilities.Drugmakers are, however, finding other ways to leverage India’s large pool of English-speaking, lower salary scientists to help bring down soaring development costs.Some are forming “research-based” partnerships with Indian companies. Merck of the US last year partnered Advinus Therapeutics, a local company backed by Tata, one of India’s largest conglomerates. Merck and Advinus will collaborate on early-stage development of drugs for metabolic disorders, with Merck retaining the right to advance research into late-stage clinical trials. GlaxoSmithKline and Ranbaxy have also teamed up.But the most dramatic change has been in clinical trials conducted in India. Global drugmakers have aggressively ramped up clinical trials in the country through their own local operations or by outsourcing to third parties. The number of ongoing clinical trials in India has surged from 40-50 in 2003 to about 270 in the pipeline now, according to Clinicaltrials.gov, a website operated by the US National Institutes of Health.Clinical trials, the lengthy studies in which experimental medicines are tested on patients, are 40-60 per cent cheaper to conduct in India than in the US, according to iGate Clinical Research, an Indian company that conducts trials. India’s large, diverse population, private sector hospitals and English-speaking physicians also provide a sound infrastructure for conducting trials.Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, pioneered the use of India for clinical trials in 1995, well ahead of the current wave. Given weak patent protection at the time, Pfizer began trials with complex, hard-to-copy medicines. Eli Lilly soon followed.Apart from Pfizer and Eli Lilly, no others ventured into clinical trials for years “for one reason: intellectual property”, says Dr Vasudeo Ginde, president of iGate Clinical Research.In anticipation of the new patent regime, others began testing the waters with new clinical trials in 2003. Those active in the country now include Amgen, Biogen, Johnson & Johnson, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline.Dr Hasit Joshipura, managing director of GSK’s India unit, says 8 per cent of the parent group’s trials are now conducted in India. GSK India, which leads the domestic pharmaceutical market in total sales, conducted 15 global clinical studies last year, compared with three before 2005.But hurdles stand in the way of India reaping a larger portion of the $9.5bn contract clinical research industry, two-thirds of which is still based in the US.The rapid growth of clinical trials has sparked ethics and transparency concerns.India currently permits phase two and phase three clinical trials, which involve testing on patients who have the ailments the relevant drugs are designed to address. Phase one trials, where drugs are tested on healthy people, are not allowed.There have been allegations that some low-income, illiterate patients are not aware of what they are signing up for. The New England Journal of Medicine published an article in 2005 on clinical trials in India entitled “A New Colonialism?” But Dr Ginde of iGate says patients who sign up for trials do not tend to be of low economic status.To add transparency, the World Health Organisation this summer added India’s government-backed clinical trials registry to its own global database. The WHO says the registry requires researchers to submit details about their trials, which are vetted by an Indian government regulator, to ensure that the companies will be “more accountable to the people who consent to participate in trials”.Concerns over intellectual property in India also remain. The US-India Business Council, a lobby group that represents 250 US companies, says a lack of full protection over data gleaned during studies, or “data exclusivity”, will limits appetite for clinical trials in India.Novartis is also unhappy with a clause in the new patent laws denying protection to incremental innovations to existing drugs. The company filed a legal challenge to the provision, alleging India was not complying with WTO regulations, after the government rejected a patent application for the anti-cancer drug Glivec.A court ruled against Novartis last month, prompting the Swiss drugmaker to say it would shift planned investments elsewhere. Daniel Vasella, chief executive, told the Financial Times: “This [ruling] is not an invitation to invest in Indian research and development, which we would have done.”The court decision was a bitter pill for others to swallow as well.Gregory Kalbaugh, director and counsel at the business council, says: “Most companies would like to invest in India.” But remaining unease over India’s patent laws “is causing a great deal of worry amongst our companies”.Some believe the western drugs companies are merely posturing. Dr Ajit Dangi, director-general of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, which represents domestic and multinational companies, says: “One such case shouldn’t deter people from investing in India. I don’t think anyone will pull out. [But] they might evaluate the market more cautiously.”
143;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-08-29T20:28:13Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rebounded strongly on Wednesday after sharp falls in the leading indices on Tuesday.Markets were lifted by the release of a letter from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to Charles Schumer, chairman of Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, saying the Fed is closely watching financial markets and is ”prepared to act as needed” should the economy be threatened.Shares were also bolstered by a resurgent technology sector, Altria’s long-awaited spin-off of Philip Morris International and some better-than-expected earnings results.Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said US shares had in effect “recovered from a sullen, late-session tantrum” on Tuesday, sparked by the release of somewhat dour minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last meeting.She said it showed how at times the markets had strayed from examining fundamentals. “Investors seem more preoccupied with watching a circus freak show than the main attraction of the economy.”The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,463.76 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,563.16.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.9 per cent higher at 13,289.29 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 2.5 per cent at 787.32.The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was up six basis points at 4.57 per cent.Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index fell by 10.2 per cent to 23.63 after two days of sharp rises.The Nasdaq was boosted by healthy rises in several technology shares. Seagate Technology shares rose 3.8 per cent to $25.39 after the leading maker of computer hard-disk drives raised its first-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late on Tuesday and several analysts lifted their price targets for the company’s stock.Apple was another strong performer, climbing 5.7 per cent to $134.08 after the company issued invitations to an event next week at which it is widely expected to unveil a new version of the iPod digital music and video player.Google rose 1.3 per cent to $512.88 after the internet search engine said George Reyes, its chief financial officer, would leave by the end of the year.Mr Reyes sparked a sharp drop in Google shares in February 2006 when he made off-the-cuff comments about the company’s need to “find other ways to monetise our business”.Oracle was another technology company in investors’ sights after SAP, the German software maker that it is suing for alleged theft of program codes, offered to settle. Its shares closed 4 per cent higher at $20.13.In other sectors, Altria Group rose 1.1 per cent to $69.80 after its expected announcement that it would spin off Philip Morris International, its tobacco unit. Altria also raised its quarterly dividend by 8.7 per cent to 75 cents a share.In earnings news, Big Lots had its biggest rise since March, gaining 9.9 per cent to $28.91 after the biggest US seller of discontinued goods reported second-quarter earnings above expectations.Borders Group shares rose 1 per cent to $14.94 after it reported a second-quarter net loss of $25.1m compared with a net loss of $18.4m last year. The slimmer-than-expected losses prompted Standard & Poor’s to upgrade the shares from “sell” to “hold”.“While industry conditions remain as challenging as ever, and we expect Borders Group’s turnround to take longer than management projects, the recent 35 per cent slide in share price mitigates further downside risk,” said Michael Souers, the ratings agency’s specialty retail analyst.In a sign that the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis continues to cloud investor sentiment, State Street shares fell 0.3 per cent to $61 on concerns about how credit-market turmoil has hit its managed funds.Mortgage applications fell by 4 per cent in the week to August 24, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.Dillard’s shares fell 0.6 per cent to $24.20 after it posted a hefty second-quarter net loss.Amgen was in the spotlight after a US federal court ruled that Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, had been infringing one of the biotechnology company’s patents. Its stock rose 2.4 per cent to $50.19 by the close of trading.Boeing shares were up 1.3 per cent to $96.90 after it said it had secured a $515m Nasa contract to produce the upper stage of the Ares I crew launch vehicle.Shares in PDL BioPharma plunged 20.3 per cent to $18.80 after the developer of technology for cancer medicines announced a restructuring and was downgraded by JPMorgan Chase.
144;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-08-16T20:40:48Z;Bargain hunters push S&P 500 higher;;US stocks closed mixed on Thursday after another volatile trading session in which financial stocks led a dramatic late rally.Countrywide, the beleaguered mortgage group, prompted an early plunge in stocks by saying it would have to draw on $11.5bn of credit and an official reports showed new homebuilding dropped to a 10-year low while building permits were at an 11-year low in July.But after the late rally, the S&P 500 finished the day 0.3 per cent higher at 1,411.26 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to close at 12,845.78. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.3 per cent at 2,451.07 and the Russell index of smaller companies was 2.3 per cent higher at 768.83.The Chicago Board Options Exchanges Vix index, a measure of equity volatility, soared to its highest level since 2002. The index finished 0.5 per cent higher at 30.83, having hit an early high of 37.50.The early market panic over the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis was exacerbated by William Poole, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve, who denied that the subprime issue pointed to a systemic crisis in the financial system and said only a “calamity” would justify an interest-rate cut.Markets were not calmed by a senior Federal Reserve spokesperson in Washington saying Mr Poole’s views were not representative of the central bank’s policymaking Open Market Committee as a whole.“While Fed officials are proceeding as if the calamity has yet to occur, it would appear that some in the market believe the calamity is simply yet to be fully appreciated,” said analysts at Interactive Brokers.In early trade, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell to more than 10 per cent below the 52-week highs they hit in mid-July. That is a drop investors usually define as a market correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to 9.5 per cent below its 52-week high.Nerves were not soothed by the Federal Reserve pumping more liquidity into the system on Thursday morning. The New York Fed announced an overnight repurchase agreement worth $12bn and a 14-day repurchase worth $5bn, while signalling that it expected to make similar repurchases on a more regular basis over the coming days.Attention continued to be focused on Countrywide Financial after the mortgage lender said it had been forced to tap an $11.5bn credit line to fund operations. It also had its ratings downgraded by Fitch and Moody’s. The shares were down 11 per cent by the close to $18.95, following a 13 per cent fall on Wednesday.Traders seized on a statement by Fannie Mae that it was in “constructive” talks with regulators about the need to lift its portfolio cap. Shares in the mortgage finance company rose by 6 per cent to $65.15. That lifted other financial stocks, with Bear Stearns up 12.9 per cent to $116.44, Lehman Brothers rising 6.2 per cent to $54.75 and Merrill Lynch up 3.2 per cent to $71.13.An hour before the opening bell, the Commerce Department released a gloomy report on US housing starts, showing that construction of new homes last month dropped to its lowest level in 10 years. The figures underlined the woes that have beset the homebuilding and mortgage sectors in recent weeks.Following disappointing quarterly earnings from other big retailers, JC Penney reported second-quarter financial results ahead of analysts’ estimates, with profit increasing 1.7 per cent to $182m, or 81 cents a share, from $179m, or 76 cents, for the same period last year. The retailer’s shares closed up 2.5 per cent at $64.14.Amgen was in the spotlight after the biotechnology company cut its profit guidance on lower-than-expected sales of its anaemia drug and said it planned to reduce its workforce by up to 14 per cent. Its shares dropped 2.3 per cent to $49.41.Cognex fell the most since October 2006, losing 11.9 per cent to $19.09. The maker of machine vision systems said third-quarter sales would be $50m-$55m, below analysts‘ average estimate of $58m.Lamson & Sessions posted its highest gain since 1980, rising 31.4 per cent to $25.80 after the maker of electrical outlet boxes agreed to a $27-a-share bid by Thomas & Betts, whose shares finished the trading day 3.7 per cent lower at $52.84.
145;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-08-16T00:22:46Z;Amgen to cut costs amid falling revenues;;Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, announced on Wednesday it would drastically tighten its operations to offset lower revenues from its anti-anaemia drugs, cutting staff by 12-14 per cent, or 2,200-2,600, and reducing expenditures by $1.9bn next year.The California-based company also said it would cut back on research and development and close some of its production facilities.Additionally, Amgen cut its earnings outlook for the year to between $4.13 and $4.23, per share from its earlier forecast of $4.28.Controversy erupted this year over the anti-anaemia drugs Epogen and Aranesp, two of the company’s most important products, after a study raised concerns that Aranesp may aggravate conditions in cancer patients by feeding tumours.After the Food and Drug Administration slapped a starker warning label on Aranesp, insurers backed out of covering the drug, leading to a 10 per cent drop in the drug’s sales in the second quarter to $949m. US sales fell by 19 per cent.Medicare and Medicaid Services also said it was considering limiting coverage of the anti-anaemia drugs.“This has not been an easy year or one that we expected,” Kevin Sharer, chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday.“The initiatives announced today respond to that new reality by talking account of reduced revenues and appropriately lowering costs across the company,” he said.Amgen’s shares closed down 1.4 per cent at $50.59 on Wednesday, after the company said it was holding a conference call but before the actual announcement.Aranesp was Amgen’s top-selling drug in 2006, bringing in $4.1bn in total sales and $2.8bn in the US. Oncology patients, to whom the study results were most relevant, accounted for $2.1bn of the US sales.Epogen and Aranesp began as treatments for anaemia in chronic kidney patients or to offset the anaemia caused by chemotherapy, but Amgen pushed to broaden their use to non-chemotherapy cancer patients and those with heart conditions.A 2006 study by the Danish Head and Neck Cancer group found that cancer patients taking Aranesp fared significantly poorer, sparking the troubles for Amgen.
146;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-06-22T21:13:33Z;Novartis wins approval for key generic;;Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company, on Friday won regulatory approval in Europe to launch the world’s first significant generic biological drug.Emea, the European medicines authority, gave the green light to a generic version of Amgen’s drug epoetin to treat anaemia in patients with kidney problems and cancer, in a move likely to lead to the launch of a cheaper version of the drug by the end of this year.While low-cost generic equivalents are rapidly launched after patent expiries on chemical-based “small molecule” pharmaceuticals, ”biosimilars” have until now been blocked by concerns that protein-based “large molecules” are far more complex and never identical.The decision creates a challenge to the global market for the epo alfa groups of drugs, sales of which are estimated at $7bn a year.It will also create a far broader precedent for the launch of biosimilars for other biotechnology products as they come off patent, in a market already estimated to be worth $55bn in annual sales.It will also add pressure to US regulators, which have proved far slower than the Emea in creating a regulatory “pathway” that defines the data required by biosimilar manufacturers to show that their drugs are safe, effective and of high quality.“This is a major step forward for biosimilars,” said Frances Cloud, analyst at Nomura Code in London.Novartis still needs to formally receive endorsement of the regulator’s decision by the European Commission, which in 2003 overturned the Emea’s approval of Omnitrope, its human growth hormone drug pending the development of a clear pathway. After that was put in place, Novartis gained approval for Omnitrope last year but it was viewed as a far more simple biotechnology product that set less of a precedent for a new generation of protein-based medicines.In a sign of growing interest in the market by generic manufacturers, the Emea received four applications for biosimilars – including Novartis’s epo – during 2006 and anticipates 12 submissions this year.
147;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-05-18T20:57:59Z;Bull run continues on Wall Street;;Wall Street’s bull run continued this week, with the exception of the technology sector, as deals and earnings news pushed the S&P 500 index to within sight of its all-time high.Late on Friday, the S&P had risen 0.65 per cent to close at 1,522.75, a gain of 1.1 per cent over the week. The benchmark notched its seventh consecutive weekly rise and closed at its highest level since setting its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Energy and telecoms stocks were the best performing sectors, while information technology was the laggard among the 10 major groups within the S&P.Higher oil prices and a further rise in bond yields were unable to weigh on stocks.“We are seeing so much consolidation and the market has also shifted its focus to the economy,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The market can absorb higher oil prices and bond yields if the economy is looking stronger.”Blue chips remained the bull’s prime choice this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 13,500 points for the first time and set a series of record closes as its run of strength since the end of March continued.On Friday, the Dow rose 0.6 per cent to finish at 13,556.53, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.A feature of the market’s current rally has been strong buying of large blue chip stocks. This positive sentiment was nurtured this week when high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett, Edward Lampert and Carl Icahn revealed their latest stock selections in regulatory filings.Railroads were a prominent sector, boosted by investment from Mr Buffett and Mr Icahn, and the S&P railroad index rose 3.8 per cent this week. Mr Lampert’s disclosure of a stake in Citigroup helped the bank’s shares rise by 3.6 per cent to $55.By contrast, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was bedevilled by weakness among many semiconductor stocks amid a general rotation out of tech. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.7 per cent this week. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.75 per cent to close at 2,558.45, but slipped 0.15 per cent for the week.The Russell index of small companies fell 0.7 per cent for the week.Leading declines among chip makers was Micron Technology, down 6.9 per cent to $11.47, after the group said it planned to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.One ray of light among chip makers was Advanced Micro Devices, up 6.2 per cent to $15.59 this week, as it rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games.In another week replete with deals, Microsoft said it would purchase Aquantive, the digital marketing group for about $6bn on Friday.It is the largest acquisition yet made by Microsoft, and its stock fell 0.5 per cent to $30.83, while Aquantive soared 77.8 per cent to $63.79 on Friday.“We view the acquisition as a necessity for Microsoft to compete against Google in online advertising, an estimated $40bn market growing at a 20 per cent rate through 2010,” said Jim Yin, systems software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in General Electric rose 1.2 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, as the conglomerate moved towards selling its plastics business for $11bn to Saudi Basic Industries.In other acquisition activity this week, Cardinal Health bought Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn. Viasys rose 38 per cent to $43.53, and Cardinal Health rallied 3.9 per cent to $71.77.Mylan Laboratories, the drugmaker agreed to pay $6.6bn for the generic drug business of Germany’s Merck KGaA. Shares in Mylan fell 11.8 per cent to $19.75.Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash.

Shares in the information technology company gained 13.4 per cent to $27.78 this week.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen fell 4 per cent to $54.04 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.In earnings news this week, Intuit said late on Thursday that its third-quarter profit climbed 23 per cent and the software maker raised its fiscal 2007 profit above analysts’ forecasts. Shares rose 13.85 per cent to $31.56 on Friday, and were up 13.2 per cent for the week.Compuware rose 9.9 per cent, to $11.06 and reached a five-year high of $12.56, as its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results exceeded expectations.Agilent rose 4.9 per cent to $38, after it reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and raised revenue outlook for the year.Hewlett-Packard, down 1.5 per cent at $44.58, was the worst Dow performer this week as its second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year-earlier period.Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter due to variable weather and a weaker housing market. The stock closed out the week a fraction higher at $38.62.
148;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-05-15T22:22:21Z;Tech stocks weigh on Wall St;;Shares in Wall Street were mixed on Tuesday, as blue-chips vaulted further into record territory, while losses in technology weighed upon broader benchmarks.News that consumer price inflation moderated last month helped stocks avert a tough start when Wal-Mart and Home Depot disappointed investors with their first-quarter results ahead of the opening bell. The mood turned bullish, however, after the release of benign inflation data for April. Annual core inflation – which excludes food and energy prices – rose less than expected.“Investors are making an interest rate play as the fall in annual core inflation takes us closer to the Fed’s comfort zone and they could be in a position to cut rates later this year,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at Avalon Partners.The moderation in annual core inflation to 2.3 per cent in April from 2.5 per cent during March is seen providing the Federal Reserve with some flexibility should the economy slow further in coming months, economists said.“This report is definitely a positive surprise for us on the inflation front,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.But Treasury bond yields rose, suggesting the data did little to raise traders’ hopes of a near-term rate cut. The rise in yields in spite of continued weakness in the housing market helped clip the early gains seen in stocks said traders.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,501.19, still adrift of its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000. Materials and telecom stocks were the best performing groups within the index, while the technology sector was in negative territory, weighed down by a 1.1 per cent fall in the Philadelphia semiconductor stock index.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,525.29.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed in record territory on Tuesday and rose 0.3 per cent to 13,383.84. The blue-chip barometer established an all-time intraday high of 13,481.60 and set its 22nd record close for the year. The Dow managed to absorb disappointing results from two members, Wal-Mart and Home Depot.The world’s largest retailer said its first-quarter earnings rose 8.1 per cent, matching estimates, but investors were disappointed with Wal-Mart’s warning that second-quarter results would come in at or below forecasts. Its shares fell 0.5 per cent to $47.62.Meanwhile, Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter. The home improvement chain blamed variable weather and weakness in the housing market for failing to beat estimates. Its shares lost 1.8 per cent to close at $38.30.Shares in Agilent rose 5.2 per cent to $37.78, after it posted a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and said its revenue outlook indicated a strong second half to the fiscal year.Ingersoll Rand shares jumped 5.8 per cent to $49.29 after the machinery and heavy equipment maker said it was looking to sell some of its businesses.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen were 3.7 per cent lower at $54.01 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.Johnson & Johnson, whose anaemia drugs was also in focus at the FDA last week. It fell 1.3 per cent to $61.82. The company was the worst laggard in the Dow.DaimlerChrysler reported that first-quarter profit rose in spite of a wider loss at its Chrysler group, which it agreed on Monday to sell to a private equity firm. Shares in the carmaker closed 0.8 per cent higher at $84.80. Other car makers were higher, with General Motors up 4.4 per cent at $31.97 after it was boosted by a brokerage upgrade. Ford rose 2.3 per cent to $8.91.In deal news, Beckman Coulter, the biomedical instrument maker, said it would not raise its $90-a-share bid for Biosite, the medical diagnostic company that has backed a $92.50-a-share offer from Inverness Medical Innovations .Shares in Biosite fell 3.1 per cent to $91.71. Beckman shares were up 2.3 per cent at $66.08, while Inverness slid 2.7 per cent to $39.89.
149;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-05-11T20:52:38Z;Wall St rallies on inflation data;;Wall Street rebounded on Friday, and that enabled the S&P 500 index to narrowly maintain its weekly winning streak that began at the end of March.A sharp sell-off on Thursday saw the major benchmarks suffer their largest one-day decline in two months following weaker-than-expected chain store sales.Investors were also worried that inflation concerns at the Federal Reserve could impede a rate cut later this year.Analysts described the pullback as a healthy correction and, indeed, buyers emerged on Friday, buoyed by an unexpected cooling in core production inflation for April.Moreover, the continued run of inconclusive economic data appears to be putting a ceiling on long-term interest rates, allowing the continued availability of relatively cheap financing, fuelling the boom in mergers and private equity buy-outs.Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman, said: “There is a powerful structural force between buyouts and robust stock buybacks by companies that is reducing the supply of outstanding shares in the market.”He said that until there was an event that forced corporate bond rates to rise from current historically low levels compared with Treasury yields, “the acquisition boom will swamp economic fundamentals”.As stocks rose on Friday, the S&P edged out of negative territory for the week.At late-afternoon, the S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 1,505.85, for a gain of 0.015 per cent this week.Technolgy and materials stocks were a bright spot among the main industry groups in the S&P. In contrast, healthcare and consumer staples stocks were the worst-performing stocks during the week.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1 per cent to close at 2,562.10, but lost 0.4 per cent this week.The Russell 2000 index of small companies was 0.4 per cent lower this week, after setting a record close on Wednesday.Blue chips maintained their recent streak, and on Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.8 per cent to 13,326.22, a rise of 0.5 per cent since Monday. The Dow set its 21st record close this year at 13,362.87 on Wednesday.Deal activity this week was led by Alcoa’s hostile $27bn bid for Alcan, its Canadian aluminium producer rival.Alcoa rose 6.6 per cent to $38.03, and is up 27 per cent in 2007, while Alcan had soared 31.2 per cent to $80.05 for the week.In other deals, Armor Holdings agreed to be bought by UK defence contractor BAE Systems for $4.1bn. Armor rose 3.7 per cent to $85.17 this week, and is up 55 per cent so far this year.Deal chatter in the steel industry pushed shares in AK Steel 14.9 per cent higher to $35.59, while US Steel posted a 6.4 per cent gain to $111.08.Countrywide Financial rose 8.1 per cent to $41.08 this week as the mortgage lender is seen as a likely buyout candidate in the wake of the recent deal for student lender SLM.Trading activity before the recent $25.2bn buyout of SLM, also known as Sallie Mae, was the latest target of regulators as they investigated suspicious option trades. SLM’s shares fell 1.2 per cent to $54.15 this week.On Friday, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange made a revised bid for CBOT Holdings, the rival derivatives exchange.CBOT’s board accepted the new bid valued at about $9.2bn, and rejected the competing unsolicited offer made by the Intercontinental Exchange of about $10.1bn launched in March. Shares in CME jumped 7.7 per cent to $536.30 on Friday, while CBOT rose 3.8 per cent to $201.35 and ICE rallied 4.2 per cent to $140.55.Hopes for News Corp’s recent $5bn bid for Dow Jones receded this week, as Dow’s share price slipped 4.8 per cent to $53.10, below the $60-a-share offer.News Corp was 1.2 per cent lower at $23.30 this week, and it reported a 6.2 per cent rise in profits for its fiscal third quarter, meeting estimates.Shares in Yahoo lost 3 per cent to $30.05 this week as hopes for a merger with Microsoft faded.Cisco weighed on the Nasdaq this week. Its fiscal third quarter profits rose 34 per cent from a year ago, but the company disappointed investors with its revenue guidance.The computer network operator fell 4.6 per cent to $26.63.In other earnings news, Whole Foods’ first quarter profits fell 11 per cent year on year, missing estimates amid slowing sales growth and rising costs. Shares in the organic food retailer slid 9.5 per cent to $40.97.This week, same-store sales figures for April arrived and 85 per cent of retailers missed their forecasts. The sector was hit hard, with shares in Jones Apparel down 5.7 per cent at $28.85.A notable laggard this week was Dendreon. The drugmaker plunged 68.5 per cent to $6.11, after the Food and Drug Administration sought more information about its prostate cancer vaccine.Shares in Johnson & Johnson and Amgen slid 3.4 per cent to $62.27 and 11.7 per cent to $56.30, respectively, after an FDA panel said their anti-anaemia drugs should face further restrictions.Barr Pharmaceuticals rallied 10.2 per cent this week to $54.83 as the company reiterating its earnings outlook on Wednesday.
150;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-05-10T20:36:05Z;Wall St slides on retail worries;;Wall Street suffered its largest one-day decline in nearly two months on Thursday, as sentiment soured in the wake of much weaker-than-expected monthly retail sales in April.Traders said the poor shop sales and a worse-than-forecast US trade deficit in March provided some investors with an excuse to sell stocks after the market’s recent strong performance.The sharp pull-back in share prices failed to attract significant buying on the dip, as was seen on Tuesday.At late-afternoon, the S&P 500 had closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,491.47, its worst daily loss since a 2 per cent fall on March 13. Energy and healthcare stocks led the major industry groups lower.The Nasdaq Composite was 1.65 per cent weaker at 2,533.74.Since the rally in stocks that gathered steam in late March, analysts say some investors have missed out on gains and have been looking for a buying opportunity in the event of a pull-back.“Our conversations with institutional clients yield interesting anecdotal evidence that many investors have not been positioned long enough, and thus haven’t experienced robust portfolio performance,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“Indeed, it has been pretty commonplace to hear fund managers complain that the market needs to take a breather or consolidate gains, a tone that implies a desire to buy more shares, but at lower prices than today’s.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,215.13, after it had set its 21st record close for the year on Wednesday.Major retailers reported same-store sales figures for April on Thursday, and the Thomson Financial same-store sales index fell 1.8 per cent last month against an expected 0.4 per cent rise.Of the 51 retailers who revealed their sales, 85 per cent missed their estimates, according to Thomson. “Most retailers have missed expectations and blamed the Easter effect and unfavourable weather,” it said.David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said the much weaker-than-anticipated chain store sales had led the bank to reduce its forecast for total US retail sales in April, due on Friday. The bank expects headline and ex-auto sales to fall 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart was in the spotlight with a sales fall of 3.5 per cent last month, worse than expected. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $47.75.JC Penney closed down 1.8 per cent at $76.80, and Federated Department Stores fell 3.9 per cent to $42.10 after posting weaker than forecast sales.Shares in Gap fell 0.8 per cent to $18.28 after the clothing retailer said April sales fell 11 per cent.In contrast, Costco beat estimates as it delivered a 7 per cent rise in like-for-like sales. Its shares closed a fraction higher at $54.95, down from a high of $56.21 earlier in the day.Thomson said sales prospects for May were looking better and that “the majority indicated stronger sales towards the end of the month, when weather improved.” Mr Greenlaw said: “The near-term health of discretionary buying will probably be closely tied to developments at the gas pump. Some relief on that front finally appears to be in sight, but probably not for a few more weeks.”In earnings news, Whole Foods’ first quarter profits fell 11 per cent year on year, missing estimates amid slowing sales growth and rising costs. Shares in the organic food retailer slid 10.2 per cent to $41.15.EchoStar Communications said first quarter earnings rose 6.7 per cent, but missed estimates and shares in the satellite-television provider rose 0.3 per cent to $48.32.Shares inJohnson & Johnson and Amgen both slid 2.5 per cent to $62.50 and 9.1 per cent to $57.33 respectively, after a Food and Drug Administration panel said their anti-anemia drugs should face further restrictions.Viacom said first quarter net income fell 36 per cent, amid higher production and restructuring costs at MTV. Its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $41.49.Shares in Sara Lee fell 0.4 per cent to $17.02, after the maker of food and household goods said its third quarter profit nearly tripled.Meanwhile, Hershey said higher dairy costs would damp profits this year, sending shares down 3.8 per cent to $52.93.Shares inBarr Pharmaceuticals rose 2 per cent to $53.28 after a broker upgrade in the wake of the company reiterating its earnings outlook on Wednesday.
151;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-04-05T20:32:53Z;Wall Street posts modest gains;;Wall Street stocks rose modestly on Thursday, with investors in a cautious mood ahead of monthly employment data due on Friday when the market will be closed in observance of Easter.Technology shares were in focus after upgrades for some companies and weak earnings from Micron Technology.Meanwhile, DaimlerChrysler jumped 5.25 per cent to $84.80 after Kirk Kerkorian’s Tracinda Corp made a $4.5bn offer for Chrysler.At the closing bell, the S&P 500 index was up 0.3 per cent at 1,443.76, buoyed by health care stocks including Amgen, up 2.9 per cent at $58.33.The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,471.34.In earnings news, Micron posted a loss for the second quarter, but said the worst of pricing weakness for the maker of flash memory was past. Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to a “sell” from “neutral” and cut its price target to $10 from $12. Shares in Micron fell 4.6 per cent at $11.51.Boosting sentiment for technology was Research In Motion, up 2.3 per cent at $145.77, after Goldman raised its earnings estimates for the maker of the BlackBerry hand held personal organiser and maintained a price target of $185 a share.Meanwhile, another tech bellwether, Yahoo, was up 1.1 per cent at $31.96. Goldman raised its price target on the internet search group to $35 from $31.50.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.25 per cent to 12,560.20, with tech giant Hewlett-Packard, up 1.7 per cent at $41.80, and General Motors, up 2.8 per cent at $31.90, leading blue chips higher.Meanwhile, Constellation Brands reported a 26 per cent rise in profit during the fourth quarter. Strong wine sales compensated for lower sales of imported beer and its share price was 3.2 per cent higher at $21.49.Sealy slid 4 per cent to $17.14 after the mattress maker said first quarter profit rose 7 per cent, but sales growth was maintained by reduced prices.Both the Dow and the Nasdaq have now risen for the past six trading days and stocks have repaired most of the damage inflicted by the sell-off in late February and early March.While the cash equity market is closed on Friday, stock futures will trade during the morning, enabling investors to take account of any dramatic deviation in the data, according to traders.“Any moves will play out in S&P futures,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “Unless there is a dramatic result, there should be little impact for stocks.”Economists expect March payrolls to have expanded by 135,000, and that the unemployment rate will rise to 4.6 per cent from 4.5 per cent.A much weaker result would fan concerns that the economy is slowing faster than expected, analysts say.Jim Caron, co-head of global interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley, said the unemployment rate and hourly earnings are important components of the report for investors. “We still think that the trend favours tight labour markets and rising wages, that is the lynch pin to the economy these days.”Once the payroll report is out of the way, equity investors will focus on the earnings season, which begins in earnest next week when Alcoa releases its first quarter results on Tuesday.At the start of the year, analysts expected first quarter earnings growth in the region of 8.7 per cent according to Thomson Financial. That call has been reduced to 3.6 per cent.“It could be difficult for the market to make further gains if we see disappointing earnings results,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards, said low earnings expectations were “pretty much baked into the cake”. He added: “We are at a point in the cycle when earnings growth slows, but the market can still do well this year if inflation moderates.”

The rally pushed the benchmark index above its 30-day moving average, an encouraging technical sign for bulls.“What the market needed was for the Fed to show some flexibility in these troubling times, and they did just that,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The markets are starting to stabilise and put into perspective some of the concerns that led to the recent sell-off.”The S&P closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,436.11, its fifth successive day of gains that put it up 3.5 per cent on the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent on Friday to 12,481.01.The recovery came as Blackstone, the buy-out group, prompted reflection on the recent private equity boom by filing for an initial public offering to raise $4bn.Energy stocks made the biggest gains this week, buoyed by both rising oil prices and broad strength in equities. The S&P Energy index stands at its highest point since December,
17.3 per cent above its low for the year.Exxon stock surged 7.4 per cent to $75.02 this week, while Chevron rose 8.3 per cent to $73.70. The odd one out in the sector was Halliburton, the oil services group, which slid 3.1 per cent to $31.08 after warning about weak US demand.Homebuilders began to make headway on the back of sound housing data.Sales of existing homes and housing starts were both in excess of depressed expectations.Concerns about tighter mortgage lending standards hitting demand for homes checked the gains. The S&P Homebuilders index rose
2.4 per cent this week, but remains more than 20 per cent off its high for the year.KB Home, which said it still envisaged instability in the market, rose 3.3 per cent to $46.86.Morgan Stanley was the latest investment bank to dispel fears about possible subprime mortgage losses. Shares in the group soared
9 per cent to $81.10 after it reported a 70 per cent jump in first-quarter profit.Beleaguered subprime mortgage group Accredited Home Lenders jumped
8 per cent to $11.77 after Citadel, the hedge fund, said it had bought a 4.5 per cent stake in the company.“When the guy delivering your milk is talking about subprime mortgages, it tells you that the problems may have been over-exaggerated,” said Mr Hogan. “This is not going to wreak havoc with the financial system.”Technology stocks had a patchy week. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,455.18 on Friday, up 3.5 per cent on the week.The sector was lifted by software groups Oracle and Adobe and the flash-memory maker SanDisk, which all reported strong earnings on Monday. Oracle, boosted by reports that it was suing its German rival SAP, finished the week 9.2 per cent higher at $18.24.But Motorola’s woes eventually soured the mood. The company admitted that performance at its mobile devices division had been “unacceptable” as it gave a profit warning. Motorola fell 2.5 per cent to $17.75.The troubles dragged down chipmakers, with Broadcom falling 5.3 per cent to $32.32. Palm also suffered losses. The fortunes of the maker of the Treo phone waxed and waned this week as rumours of an impending offer swirled round the market. Motorola was considered a potential buyer. Palm stock fell from a high of $19.45 to stand 1.5 per cent up on the week at $18.10.Vonage stock plunged 25.9 per cent to $3 on Friday after a judge blocked the company from infringing patents owned by Verizon when directing its customers’ internet telephone calls to landlines."
153;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T19:36:57+0000;Amgen runs into regulatory problems;;Amgen faces increased regulatory scrutiny over its blockbuster drugs after recent studies raised concerns that the anti-anaemia products might feed tumours in cancer patients.The Food and Drug Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission are informally investigating the safety record of Epogen and Aranesp, Amgen’s biggest drugs that stimulate red blood cell production whose global sales are expected to exceed $7bn this year.Amgen on Wedbnesday said the FDA was seeking to add a “black box warning” – the strongest possible – over using the anti-anaemia drugs for kidney and cancer patients.The FDA has also called an experts’ panel in May to review the drugs and their potential dangerous side-effects when used in cancer patients – such as enhancing tumours or accelerating the disease and death.Amgen said that it was co-operating “fully” with the SEC and “looked forward to” providing new data to the FDA.Amgen has sought to broaden the use of its anti-anaemia drugs, which were initially used to treat anaemia in chronic kidney patients, to treating anaemia in cancer patients or patients with heart illness. But questions have dogged its push over whether boosting red-blood cells might feed tumours and cancer.Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, is planning to sell a similar drug in the US, while Johnson & Johnson already sells a similar treatment called Procrit.Results from several negative trials have recently appeared, including data from Roche’s drug in lung cancer patients. But a study by the Danish Head and Neck Cancer group raised concern to a fever pitch and also led some investors to ask why Amgen had not revealed its own results earlier.Amgen put a stop to a study last year after finding Aranesp-taking cancer patients had fared suffered worse than those on alternative medications.In addition, two landmark studies late last year raised concerns that aggressive treatment of anaemia in kidney patients could increase, rather than lower, heart risks.
154;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-02-14T21:53:49Z;Generic drugs law plans threaten makers;;Big pharmaceutical companies are facing a barrage of legislative proposals that could have a dramatic impact on the industry’s future earnings power and open doors to one of its biggest threats: generic drug manufacturers.A proposal set to be unveiled on Wednesday by Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential hopeful, and a bipartisan group of lawmakers would allow generic drugmakers to manufacture cheaper versions of biotechnology drugs produced by companies such as Amgen and Genentech.The proposal, which aims to cut the cost of high-priced biotech drugs, would empower the Food and Drug Administration, the US chief drug regulator, to approve the generic versions of biotech drugs, also known as follow-on biologics. Opponents, led by the Biotechnology Industry Organisation (Bio), say the proposal raises safety questions and threatens to hamper the willingness of branded biotechnology companies to innovate.“I think it is natural that those who pay for healthcare – whether it is the government or insurance plans or individuals or employers – are looking for savings. What we have to be careful about is that we don’t put the savings cart before the safety horse,” says Jim Greenwood, chief executive of Bio.Although the proposal was introduced and failed to pass under the Republican-controlled Congress, some analysts say increasing pressure from voters about the high cost of drugs could give new impetus to proposals that might strengthen the generic industry and lead to cheaper drugs.A separate effort by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Senate that would prohibit big branded drugmakers from paying generic rivals to stay out of their markets is also gaining traction. If passed, the law would close the door on a practice that some regulators have complained allows branded drugmakers to thwart competition and keep drug prices artificially high.The fight between branded drugmakers, including biotechnology groups, and generic drugmakers centres around two issues: the requirements determining how quickly a so-called biogeneric is approved, and what exactly constitutes a generic version of a biotech drug.Both issues stem from branded drugmakers’ argument that biologic drugs are reproductions of human proteins, whose structures are complex, never clearly defined and dangerously variable in their production from company to company. Biologics are made by using living cells that are genetically triggered to produce a specific protein identified to help an illness.The generic drug industry counters that it is not as complex as biotech drugmakers contend and that they can safely produce their own “generic” versions of the branded biologics to treat disease. However, they add that in order to be able to offer them at lower-cost generic prices the US regulators must give them a fast-track approval process.Generic versions of traditional pharmaceuticals are approved without the need for long, expensive clinical trials, but biotech drugmakers argue that the variability in producing proteins from live cells warrants that generic drugmakers should prove in expensive clinical trials that their protein is equivalent.Last year, European regulators laid guidelines for approval of follow-on biologics. But without new legislation in the US, many analysts estimated that biogenerics might not reach the world’s biggest drug market until at least 2010 as the FDA carefully worked to codify rules on how to approve follow-ons to biotech treatments.
155;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-01-26T21:40:10Z;Wall Street down on higher rates, volatile oil;;"US stocks were not for the faint-hearted this week. Sentiment swung wildly as investors got to grips with mixed results and guidance from several companies, volatile oil prices and rising bond yields.The Vix index, a market measure of volatility, reflected this. It swung from a low of 9.87 to a peak of 11.60 on Friday, and rose 7 per cent for the week.After setting a six-year high during the week, the S&P 500 retreated on Friday to close at 1,422.18, down 0.1 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent over the five days as Treasury yields reached their highest levels in five months.“Rising rates are an expression of economic strength,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. But he said such strength ran counter to the Federal Reserve’s “soft landing” scenario and had “upset” investors.A clear trend this month has been the desire of investors to snap up recent underperformers if their earnings exceeded expectations.Jack Caffrey, senior equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, said: “People are afraid of missing out, and when they hear good news they want to boost their portfolios with stocks that promise out-performance.”The situation was illustrated this week when Ebay beat earnings and raised guidance for 2007. The online auctioneer rose 6.8 per cent to $31.65, having fallen
30 per cent during the previous 12 months.Better than expected earnings from Yahoo boosted its shares by 1.4 per cent to $28.04 this week. After tumbling 35 per cent in 2006, the stock has risen 10 per cent this month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,435.49 on Friday, a loss of 0.65 per cent for the week. A drag on the Nasdaq was Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares fell 3.7 per cent on the week to $71.50, after earnings failed to beat estimates.Other technology companies moving higher amid better earnings and guidance this week included Sun MicroSystems, up 9.7 per cent to $6.33, RF Micro Devices, up 13 per cent to $7.85, and Citrix Systems, up 8 per cent at $31.10. Microsoft beat earnings estimates but fell 1.6 per cent to $30.60 after setting a multi-year high of $31.48 on Thursday.Advanced Micro Devices, slid 8.5 per cent to $16.22 after the chipmaker missed its earnings estimates. Sun also said it would use chips from Intel in its servers, a move that could erode maket share for AMD said analysts.In contrast, Texas Instruments rose 9.3 per cent to $31.02 as the chipmaker produced stellar earnings. Shares in Corning surged 9.7 per cent to $21.20 after the maker of glass and fibre optics products also beat estimates.Blackstone increased its offer for Equity Office to $54 from $48.50 a share as it countered a rival buy-out offer of $52 a share. Shares in Equity Office rose 5.2 per cent to $55.22 this week.Countrywide jumped 4.2 per cent, to $42 on Friday after the Financial Times reported that the mortgage lender was in talks with Bank Of America about a possible $30bn deal. BofA shares fell 0.7 per cent to $52.04 on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a record close during the week, only to retreat. It fell 0.1 per cent to 12,487.02 on Friday, a loss of 0.6 per cent over the week.AT&T led Dow constituents reporting earnings this week. Better revenue growth sparked a 3.8 per cent rise to $36.40 and shares hit a multi-year high of $37.70 on Thursday.Caterpillar shares rose 2.5 per cent to $61.09 on Friday after it raised sales guidance for 2007.McDonald’s weighed on the Dow as its shares slid 4.2 per cent to $42.93. Its quarterly earnings met estimates that were recently upgraded and had sent the stock to a multi-year peak of $45.06 more than a week ago. Topping the Dow this week was General Motors, up 4.4 per cent to $32.93, although the stock fell from a peak of $33.30 after it announced a delay in filing its fourth-quarter earnings.The company reiterated that it expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2006.In stark contrast, Ford announced an annual loss of $12.7bn, the largest in its
history. The shares rose 1.4 per cent to $8.42.Analysts at Gimme Credit said Ford had managed investor expectations well: “We all know this is just the first quarter in what will be a gruelling, physical game.”"
156;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-01-25T23:25:46Z;Amgen rules out big acquisitions;;Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, ruled out big acquisitions in the coming year as it announced that earnings were slightly up in its fourth quarter.Analysts have said that the sector is ripe for heightened merger and acquisition activity this year as pharmaceutical companies seek to buy growth to supplement their own research and development.Amgen completed several smaller biotech acquisitions last year including the $2.2bn acquisition of Abgenix in the middle of last year, and the $290m buyout of Avidia in October.In 2001 Amgen bought Immunex, which makes Enbrel, an arthritis and psoriasis drug, for $17bn.But Kevin Sharer, the company’s chief executive, said that the time was not right for a larger-scale acquisition.“Each year we try to make acquisitions. But we are not at all seeking a big, transformative acquisition,” he told the FT.Earnings in the fourth quarter rose 1 per cent to $833m, or 71 cents a share, up from $824m, or 66 cents, last year as sales of Amgen’s top-selling medicine Aranesp rose sharply.Excluding stock options charge of $227m, earnings per share were 90 cents a share, falling 3 cents short of analysts’ estimates.The company said that the miss was entirely down to the company’s deal with Cytokinetics, the biotechnology drug developer, earlier this month.Sales were up 17.9 per cent to $3.74bn. Research and development costs shot up 59 per cent to $1.03bn.Earnings for the year were down 20 per cent at $2.95bn on stock options charges. Sales were 15 per cent up to 13.9bn. R&D spending was up 39 per cent for the year, but the company said that next year research spending would grow less quickly, and closer to the level of sales growth.Sales of Aranesp, the anti-anaemia drug, were 27 per cent up at $1.11bn. Aranesp faces a significant challenge this year with Roche’s Mircera product seeking regulatory approval. Amgen has slapped a patent-infringement lawsuit on Roche for the drug and the trial will start in September this year.Mr Sharer said that the company had made provisions for damage limitation should the drug be judged fit for use, including a long-term agreement with its top customer.“Our objective is to prevail in the case, much less to limit damages,” said Mr Sharer. “We’d much rather protect our market.”The company said that its new colon cancer treatment Vectribix made $39m in the fourth quarter. The company says it anticipates up to $2bn sales for the drug in future years, but that it was not going to be a top performer in 2007.
157;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2007-01-22T21:49:56Z;Wall Street down on earnings fears;;Wall Street was on the defensive on Monday as technology shares continued their recent slide.Since the earnings season began last week, technology shares have erased their strong start to the year. In the S&P 500, the information technology sector fell 0.9 per cent and closed in negative territory for the year for the first time.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8 per cent to close at 2,431.07. That reduced its gain for 2007 to 0.6 per cent, down from just under 4 per cent this month.Stocks have been hit by concerns over earnings and uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year.Citigroup remained positive, saying “a defensive stance is inappropriate at this juncture and weakness should be bought, not sold”.After 13 quarters of double-digit earnings growth, analysts say companies in the S&P 500 are on course to report average earnings growth of less than 10 per cent.“If corporate profits ultimately revert to more normal margins, it is hard to argue that much in the market is cheap,” said Gordon Fowler, chief investment officer at Glenmede.He said “the catalysts for lower margins – a significant economic slowdown, spiralling labour costs and profligate capital spending, do not yet seem in place”.The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,422.95.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent at 12,477.16. Transport stocks remained under pressure, in spite of oil prices reversing earlier gains. The Dow Transportation average slid 1 per cent, for a gain of 5.5 per cent this year.Weighing on the Dow was Boeingafter a downgrade for the airline to “market perform” from “outperform” by Wachovia. Boeing shares fell 3.4 per cent at $85.60.Shares in another Dow member, Pfizer, lost 1 per cent to $26.95 after the drug company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 15 per cent and said it would cut 10,000 jobs and close plants to save $2bn a year.Helping the Dow was Citigroup whose shares rose 0.3 per cent to $54.95 after it said it would buy the mortgage unit of ABN Amro for about $3bn. The bank also said Sallie Krawcheck would become chairman and chief executive of its global wealth management division, leaving her post as chief financial officer.News that Sun Microsystems would use chips manufactured by Intel, along with those produced by Advanced Micro Devices, sent shares in AMD 1.1 per cent lower to $17.53. The company reports earnings on Tuesday.Intel fell 0.1 per cent to $20.79, against a 0.9 per cent slide in the Philadelphia semi-conductor index. Sun shares were down 0.4 per cent at $5.75. Shares in Amgen were up 2.1 per cent at $75.85 after analysts said the company looked likely to win a long patent battle with Roche Holding AG.
158;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-12-13T22:44:55Z;View from the Top: Kevin Sharer;;"FINANCIAL TIMES: Thank you for joining us Mr Sharer.KEVIN SHARER: My pleasure.FT: We’ve recently had midterm elections and the Democrats are taking control of Congress.What sort of an impact do you think that will have on your industry?SHARER: Well, I think the debate will intensify around the price of drugs. As speaker Pelosi has said that one of our First One Hundred Hour actions was going to direct the government to directly negotiate Medicare part D for drugs. Now that’s going to be the major effect. I think the other things were on drugs safety. Patents importation will be debated as they were before. But the participation of the government in direct negotiation of prices is the big question.FT: And how do you expect that debate to go?SHARER: It’s hard to predict. I think it’ll be most likely a resolution passed directing the Secretary of HHS to look into it, but we’ll find out that the pharmacy benefit management companies are doing a really good job negotiating prices on behalf of the government, so the savings that could be had are going to be smaller than the people might think.FT: Do you think, just in terms of the politics, that there’s a danger that Big Pharma will become the next corporate villain, following in the footsteps of Big Tobacco and fast foods?SHARER:- I think that the “big pharma” companies have been making progress recently on their image. I think that we’ve been good at making drugs available for patients who can’t afford it. We supported the Medicare Part D Act, which is really helping out seniors. The beneficiaries like it. I think our image is improving and we are the companies that are trying to cure cancer and all these other awful diseases so I think we are making progress, but we have to pay attention.FT: And what about the pricing of drugs? You caused a little bit of a flurry when you under-priced one of your drugs below the price of a drug of one of your rivals. Do you see more downward pressure on drug prices?SHARER: I think downward pressure on drug prices is a constant around the world. I think that we’re are going to have to prove that our products are not only safe and efficacious, but they are worth it in a value sense either in a life benefit or a cost offset. Health budgets around the world are squeezed; it’ll just raise the bar for us in the industry to prove that our medicines are worth it. But I think that prices for drugs have to let us recoup the money that we spend for research and development which is a billion or two billion dollars per drug, so its inextricably intertwined. We have to get the return back to take the big risk.FT: And how about a more profound discussion of healthcare and how it’s provided in the United States? We see Hillary Clinton very present on the political scene and maybe remember her earlier discussions of a really national healthcare policy. Do you see that as a possibility going forward?SHARER: I don’t think America wants to have a national healthcare system. I think people really value their ability to choose their own provider and to be able to get the best possible care. However, in saying that, we do have real budgetary issues. Every politician that I see, every policy maker asks the question: “What can we do about healthcare?” There’s not a simple, soundbite answer. It’s probably many things, but I think the hybrid system America has of some private enterprise and some government, that hybrid is going to continue and we’ll try to squeeze inefficiencies out of the system and we are going to try to make people who make decisions about their own healthcare bear probably a bit more of the consequence, economically, of their choice. I think things like in Detroit where many, many years ago a bargain was made where they was basically free healthcare, that just can’t stand, and we’ll work at it incrementally. I do not think there’s any appetite for a sweep in reorganisation in healthcare. I don’t it would work.FT: Your business is dependant ultimately on having brilliant scientists. There are a lot of concerns about whether the American educational system is turning out enough people who have enough of a science background. Is that a concern that you share?SHARER: I share the concern about the education system in America broadly, as it relates to scientific talent for Amgen. We are able to attract the people that we need and they are out there. We’ll go where we have to in the world. I think, however, the number of scientists and engineers that are being produced by the United States is something of concern and yes, Amgen is worried about that.FT: And are immigration rules ever a problem for you? Are you concerned that not enough scientists from outside the United States are being let into the country?SHARER: From an Amgem point of view, we have once in a while an issue. It’s not a structural issue for us, it’s not a systemic issue, but I know in just talking to some of my colleagues in other parts of the business community there are real issues about that. For America to be competitive we have to be able to be the most innovative country in the world and I think that is our, if you will, core competence: innovation. And innovation takes talent and a lot of other things but it starts with talent.FT: And what about restrictions on scientific research? Is America a sufficiently open place for science to be done, particularly in biology in this competitive global economy?SHARER: I think America is pre-eminent in biology and is pre-eminent in a lot of aspects of innovation, but there’s certainly choices to be made, debates to be had around ethical issues, but I don’t see any restrictions that are happening, save the very, very early research about stem cells that are of real concern, and on that basis I find it unfortunate that the government has adopted the policies they’ve adopted, but I think the scientific world will figure out a way to advance science.FT: And how much of a problem are those restrictions on stem cells and do you maybe see public opinion forcing a change in the rules?SHARER: I think when this administration is gone the rules will change.FT: What about the global scene, the global competition? Where do you see the biggest competition for you, for America?SHARER: I think if you look right now in a broad industrial sense, it’s only industry-by-industry. Automotive I think we are getting out-competed, there are probably a few other industries but if you look at it broadly particularly in the area in which we work in biotechnology area, America is clearly pre-eminent by any measure. It’s a complicated series of factors that we really need to protect. It has to do with the size of our market, our intellectual property, the fact we are a nation of laws, we will pay for innovation, there is venture capital, inventors can get money back from the stock market. It’s a lot of factors that are unique in America, and I think this idea of risk capital, the idea of people willing to take a risk and start companies is a real bulwark for us and that’s how Amgen started and I think we’re pre-eminent in that sense.FT: One of Amgen’s central characteristics as a company has been its emphasis on science and innovation. Are you worried about preserving that as the company gets bigger?SHARER: Yes, I do worry about it. We are a science-based company and our R&D strategy is to develop innovative medicines for grievous illness, and if you sort of tease that out what it means is we are trying to understand biology that’s new and we are trying to take bets on products that we are not sure if they work. That’s the highest risk possible-kind-of-strategy you can have, but I think that’s what society wants us to do if we are going to conquer Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cancer, diabetes, and the other scourges of our time. And so, there’s a real energy around here about science. There’s an energy about taking a risk, and the board of directors backs us all the way in making huge investments and we hope they pay off. They have in the past; sometimes they will in the future, sometimes they wont. I think the recent Pfizer announcement illustrates as well as I could the nature of the risk of our industry.FT: How do you interpret that Pfizer announcement? I mean, what’s behind that sort of thing happening to a company and having such a big impact on it?SHARER: Well, I think that in Pfizer’s case they did everything right in the sense that they were trying to push the science in medicine. They ran a very big trial, which was proper, trial. They had a data safety monitoring panel and tragically for patients that drug just didn’t work and they stopped the trial. It’s the nature of our business. From Pfizer’s point of view they’ve obviously got a real problem in their future revenue stream because this drug was going to plug a hole, if you will, that Lipitor was going to create when it goes off patent. So I understand the challenge. There’s no easy fix for it, but we are a really, really high-risk business and these things happen.FT: Particularly when it comes to this sort of serious life-threatening illnesses that you specialise in, there are some debates about clinical trials and who should be admitted. Do you foresee any changes to how those are run?SHARER: I think that its important that clinical trials be based upon proper science, which means it’s evidence-based medicine. We have to have the right numbers in the trials. We have to have accurate data. It has to be with the highest integrity collected and there are scientific aspects of how many people do you need and how much disclosure should you have. I’m all for transparency and I’m all for full disclosure and then we really value people who are willing to participate in clinical trials. In a lot of cases it’s a pretty selfless thing to do. I really appreciate that.FT: Some major voices in American business and politics recently have been raising concerns about the competitiveness of US capital markets, tying it partially to Sarbanes-Oxley. What has your experience been and do you share the worry that American capital markets are becoming less competitive in this global economy?SHARER: I probably don’t have the same perspective that some of the voices that you refer to have, but I can say that on the boards of companies that I serve and in Amgen’s case, that has not been the case. Certainly Sarbanes-Oxley has issues with it, but the general thrust of the idea for accuracy, timeliness and transparency can only be good. And I think that long term, those kind of ideas are going to be important to preserve the integrity of the capital markets. So from my point of view, I haven’t seen that kind of difficulty yet.FT: Thank you very much.SHARER: My pleasure.More on Kevin Sharer"
159;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-10-19T11:02:08Z;Bourses remain softer on mixed earnings;;European stocks remained under pressure on Thursday, as mixed earnings reports and a higher oil price ahead of any possible agreement over oil supply among OPEC members weighed upon sentiment.In the earnings spotlight were Nokia, SAP and Ericsson, while Atos Origin was the subject of reports that Blackstone, a US private equity firm was planning a takeover of the French information technology company worth round €3.6b.Shares in Nokia slumped 5.5 per cent after the Finnish mobile handset maker missed earnings expectations.SAP were off 2.2 per cent after the company reported a cautious outlook despite beating quarterly forecasts. Ericsson was up 1.3 per cent, reversing pre-open losses, as the mobile network equipment maker produced earnings that shaded analyst expectations.Analysts at Deutsche noted they view SAP “as a buy going forward given underpinning from the product upgrade cycle.” In terms of Ericsson, the bank said, “after a good run,” shares in the company “may pause for breath.”Meanwhile, shares in Atos surged 13.8 per cent amid talk of a potential buyout.Midway through the trading session, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 5.59 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 1,435.95. The index remains near a five and a half year high reached earlier this week. Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax was down 13.19 points, or 0.2 per cent at 6169.53. France’s CAC 40 index was lower by 17.28 points, or 0.3 per cent at 5344.Germany’s Fresenius Medical Care was up 2.6 per cent after the company announced it had entered a a new sourcing and supply treaty with Amgen in the US.Also setting the pace was Metrovacesa, the Spanish property group. Amid bid speculation, the shares were up 2.75 per cent at €125 extending a gain of 8.7 per cent on Wednesday. The rise over the past month is over 50 per centMaintaining this week’s torrid pace was Fiat, with the Italian car maker’s shares up 2.2 per cent at €13.82 after they hit a four and a half year high on Wednesday. Investors believe the company may announce the sale of its Iveco truck division, although the company denied plans of asset sales on Wednesday.JP Morgan, which has an “overweight” rating on Fiat, said it expected the company to double its third-quarter operating profit.Akzo Nobel was on the rebound, up 2.1 per cent after taking a tumble on Wednesday when the Dutch pharmaceutical group warned of a delay to the launch of its anti-schizophrenia drug, asenapine. The company’s third-quarter operating profits also missed expectations.Among financials, Spain’s Banco Popular was enjoying a gain of 1.8 per cent, after its third quarter earnings eased ahead of expectations. Still, Goldman Sachs, downgraded the bank to “sell” from “neutral” and it also reduced Banco Sabadell to “neutral” from a “buy”. Stating it favoured global orientated banks, Goldman raised Banco Santander to a “buy” from “neutral”.In the loss column, was Finland’s Fortum, down 1.8 per cent after the utility reported earnings that were just under analyst’ estimates. Shares in Nestle were of 3.5 per cent after the company reported earnings in line with forecasts. Analysts at Bear Stearns noted “investment risks” for Nestle include “european consumption remains in the doldrums.”Shares in Telecom Italia were down 1.8 per cent as Mediobanca and Generali joined the telecom’s largest shareholders in a pact to stymie any hostile takeover.Meanwhile, Safran was off 2 per cent, reversing a 5.7 per cent gain on Wednesday. Rumours of a possible merger between the French jet engine maker and defence electronics group Thales, boosted the stock during the prior session. Safran was formed in May 2005 through the merger of Snecma and Sagem, following fierce opposition by Snecma to an approach by Thales. But the defensive combination has often been criticised and there is known to be friction between the Snecma and Sagem camps.
160;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-10-10T23:00:02Z;Genentech benefits from new eye drug;;Genentech on Tuesday showed further evidence of the muscle of big biotechnology, raising its expectations for profit growth this year to 65-70 per cent on better-than-expected quarterly earnings.Its third-quarter profit soared on the blockbuster launch of Genentech’s Lucentis, a new drug for a serious eye disease, and continuing strong growth from its cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs.Third-quarter profit, excluding exceptional items rose 66 per cent to $637m compared with the period last year. Earnings per share were 59 cents, significantly higher than Wall Street forecasts. Genentech’s revenues in the quarter rose 36 per cent to $2.38bn.The group benefited in the quarter from a strong start for Lucentis, a treatment for leaking blood vessels in the eye that can cause blindness, co-marketed internationally with Novartis of Switzerland. Lucentis US sales outpaced investor forecasts, reaching $153m in the quarter – its first full quarter on the market after a June 30 approval and launch.The strong showing prompted Genentech, which is majority-controlled by Swiss drugmaker Roche, to raise its profit outlook for the year. Its new forecast of 65-70 per cent earnings growth is up from the previous forecast of 55-60 per cent and marks the latest in a string of increased targets.Genentech and US rival Amgen are by far the world’s largest biotech groups. The quarter highlights how the big biotechs are juggling cost growth with intense capital expansion, huge research and clinical trial programmes and the need to market new products.David Ebersman, chief financial officer at Genentech, said: “We’re trying to be ahead of it as much as possible.”
161;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
162;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-10-10T20:47:02Z;Icahn/ImClone;;Carl Icahn can claim another victory. Just three weeks after the veteran activist was elected to ImClone’s board, he has moved within an inch of dominating the biotech company. Mr Icahn has only a 14 per cent stake but he and his allies now hold four board seats. That is almost half the 10 currently filled, following the resignations of ImClone’s chairman and another director in the face of the activist onslaught.It is hard to disagree with Mr Icahn that ImClone’s old board has a sorry record. The company gained notoriety in 2002, following insider-trading fraud by its boss, who – along with domestic diva Martha Stewart – ended up in jail for it. It has been through a series of management reshuffles since, while its share price is down almost two thirds from its 2004 peak.Troubles with colon cancer drug Erbitux are largely to blame, most recently the embarrassing loss of a patent lawsuit and the threat of a branded competitor from rival Amgen. But so is a lack of planning for just such contingencies, especially as Erbitux remains ImClone’s only major product.All this, however, could also complicate any plans Mr Icahn might have to sell on the company to a major drugs maker. Installing a new chief executive with experience in biotechnology might boost morale and help ImClone retain staff, but delivering results will take time.Mr Icahn has also set quite a high hurdle for potential suitors, having dismissed a recent paper bid of $36 a share, reportedly from Sanofi-Aventis.That would be 16 per cent above ImClone’s current price or roughly 27 times next year’s forecast earnings. While drugs makers might be keen on filling gaps in their pipeline, they would be ill advised to offer much more than that for what remains a troubled business.
163;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-09-21T14:49:29Z;Wall Street led higher by Oracle;;US stocks closed higher on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged and strong earnings from Oracle buoyed sentiment.Software maker Oracle reported a 29 per cent rise in its first quarter profits, as the company’s chief executive claimed it was gaining market share from rival SAP. Its shares surged 11.2 per cent to a five-year high point of $17.93.Morgan Stanley rose 0.7 per cent to $72.35 after it reported a better-than-expected 59 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings. The results helped lift other investment banks. Legg Mason added 3.3 per cent to $100.22, and Bear Stearns gained 3.2 per cent to $139.50.Darden Restaurants pushed up 6.8 per cent to $41.50 after it reported that first-quarter earnings rose 3.5 per cent and raised its earnings guidance for 2006, based on bullish forecasts for revenue at its Olive Garden restaurant chain. It was the biggest daily gain for the shares since December.NCR rose 5.3 per cent to $38.14, after it announced its data analysis unit Teradata had won a contract to support logistics centres for the US Navy.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent, or 6.86 points, at 1,325.17, at one point in the day reaching its highest level since February 2001.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, or 30.52 points, at 2,252.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent, or 72.28 points, to 11,613.19 – within 110 points of its historic high point.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee on Wednesday decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent“The moderation in economic growth appears to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market,” said the Federal Reserve, adding that inflation pressures seemed “likely to moderate over time”.The major indices pulled slightly off their highs immediately following the Fed’s decision.“They remain committed to inflation control as job number one,” said Stuart Schweitzer, Global Markets Strategist for JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management. Mr Schweitzer believes the cooling housing market may lead the Fed to ease rates in 2007. “I think they’ll ease before the middle of next year. Although well advanced on some measures, the housing slowdown is only just beginning to impact the broader economy.”Crude oil futures continued to sink, weighing on the energy sector. ExxonMobil fell 2.8 per cent to $28.29, and Weatherford International slid 5.4 per cent to $38.12.Tobacco group Reynolds American sank 4.9 per cent to $61.36 after Citigroup cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “hold”, saying product shortages were forcing customers to switch brands.
164;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-07-20T23:00:29Z;Amgen lifts outlook as profits beat estimates;;Amgen on Thursday raised this year’s profit outlook to 17-20 per cent growth after a strong second quarter, confounding suggestions that the world’s biggest biotechnology group’s size could slow it down.The group raised its forecast to $3.75 - $3.85 per share from its previous guidance of $3.60 - $3.70, or 11-16 per cent growth, due to factors including better efficiency and continued growth of its biggest products. Aranesp, a treatment for anaemia, and Neulasta, a treatment to boost white blood cells, reached $1bn in quarterly sales for the first time in the past quarter.Excluding one-time items including acquisition charges, Amgen’s second quarter profit increased 12 per cent to $1.24bn, which was significantly above Wall Street expectations.Total sales rose 14 per cent to $3.6bn. Aranesp sales jumped 26 per cent and Neulasta increased sales 12 per cent.Kevin Sharer, chairman and chief executive, said: “We raised our adjusted EPS guidance for the year despite a significant increase in R&D (research and development) investment. This reflects our confidence in our ongoing business performance.”Its shares were trading 4 per cent higher at $66.56 in after-hours trading in New York.The group is expanding quickly and increasing expenditures to hire people, to fuel its research laboratories and to run numerous “mega trials’ for promising experimental drugs in development. R&D expense rose 29 per cent and general corporate and marketing expense rose 24 per cent in the quarter.Amgen also acknowledged a few recent dark spots. A promising cancer drug AMG706 could face delays because of enlarged gall bladders in mid-stage clinical trial patients.Enbrel also faces ongoing competitive markets in rheumatoid arthritis and dermatology.A competitive threat also continues to loom over its biggest drug Aranesp. Roche could launch a competitive drug that Amgen claims is merely its drug packaged differently and vows to fight in court for patent violations, or seek an injunction on its sale.Amgen said the outlook in Europe for generic versions of complex proteins looks more favourable for branded drugs now. Potential generic versions of biologic treatments made from replicated human proteins have appeared poised to come in Europe sooner than the US.
165;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-06-04T17:13:35Z;Book review: America lags on the superhighway;;"When countries are ranked by their ability to exploit new technologies, the US is almost always at the top of the list. In most cases the impetus has come from entrepreneurial newcomers, such as Intel in semiconductors or Amgen in biotechnology, not from established companies. This distinctively American phenomenon is usually attributed to a combination of two factors: a large and competitive domestic market and a set of institutions, including the financial system, that supports new ventures.Yet there is one recently developed technology in which the US has been a notable laggard. Broadband, which provides high-speed access to the internet, was invented in the US, as was the internet itself. Since most of the hardware suppliers are based in the US, one would expect the market to expand more rapidly there than elsewhere. Yet the leaders in the diffusion of broadband are South Korea and Japan, with the US trailing a long way behind. Moreover, the growth of broadband in these countries is due in part to the activities of mould-breaking entrepreneurs, just the kind of competitor that one normally associates with the US.How did this come about? As Martin Fransman points out in his introduction to this admirable collection of country-based essays, telecommunications is a very different business from, say, personal computers. It is a network-based industry characterised by economies of scale and high barriers to entry. Although the sector has been privatised and partially deregulated in most industrial countries, the old incumbents, such as BT Group in the UK and the successor companies to AT&T in the US, still retain, by virtue of their past investments in infrastructure, a good deal of monopoly power.To break this power requires two things: forceful intervention by governments to prise open the bottlenecks that inhibit competition in new services, and the willingness of entrepreneurs to take advantage of the opportunities thus created.A country that scores well on both fronts – in spite of its reputation for close ties between government and big business – is Japan. NTT, former telecoms monopolist, has come under intense pressure in broadband from new entrants, including the entrepreneur Masayoshi Son, who started a broadband service in partnership with Yahoo in 2002. His unconventional sales methods quickly won him a sizeable share of the market. But his move into broadband, and that of other new entrants, was helped by the Japanese government, which ordered NTT to open up its local exchanges for use by outsiders (“local loop unbundling”) and to charge very low prices for access.NTT is still a powerful company but competition has forced it to cut prices and improve its service. In South Korea – the world leader in broadband diffusion – the first mover was Thrunet, a new entrant based on cable; although it ran into financial problems it set a pattern of low prices to which the incumbent, Korea Telecom, had to respond.In these two countries the regulators took a tougher line with the old monopolists than their counterparts in Europe. In the UK, for example, Oftel (now part of Ofcom) was too soft on BT in the early days of broadband, although recent regulatory changes should ease the path for new entrants. A far worse case is Germany, where Deutsche Telekom has faced little competition either from cable-based operators or via the unbundling route. The authorities seem to want to preserve it as a national champion, making sufficient profits at home to support its international ambitions.France is also addicted to national champions, yet in a surprisingly liberal move in 2002 the authorities introduced aggressive policies to unbundle the local loop. Ambitious newcomers such as Iliad have been able to challenge France Telecom, and to make France’s broadband performance one of the best in Europe.What is striking about France is that it drew on Korean and Japanese experience, not that of the US. The break-up of AT&T in 1984 was meant to usher in a new competitive era in US telecoms, but fragmented regulation affords ample scope for lobbying, and the telephone companies have been remarkably astute in holding on to their local monopolies. In broadband, the bulk of the market is in the hands of two sets of incumbents: the regional telephone operators and the cable networks. They do compete against each other but, as Fransman remarks, “this is oligopolistic competition where neither side has an interest in rocking the boat through disruptive activities”.There is an encouraging lesson from the broadband story. Disruptive innovation gives the capitalist system its vitality, but it does not have to be confined to the US. Other countries can create the conditions in which innovators can flourish, as long as governments have the will to create appropriate incentives. Get policies and institutions right, and the entrepreneurial response should follow, even in old Europe.The writer is senior fellow at the ­Institute of Management, London School of Economics"
166;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T20:10:10+0000;AstraZeneca in £567m deal to buy rest of CAT;;AstraZeneca on Monday confirmed that it would buy the UK’s Cambridge Antibody Technology as the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical group moves to strengthen its pipeline of new treatments and expand its reach in biological drugs.The deal, which values CAT at £702m ($1.32bn), will see AstraZeneca pay £13.20 a share, or £567m, for the 80.8 per cent of shares that it does not already own. The price represents a 67 per cent premium to the CAT’s share price before the acquisition was announced.Analysts said that while the premium paid for the UK company was one of the highest for a biotech, it was fair given CAT’s technology platform in monoclonal antibodies – an area that has become increasingly important to large pharmaceutical groups.Jonathan Senior, an analyst at Evolution, said: “AstraZeneca could get a lot of drug candidates out of this and CAT also has a promising asthma treatment in there.”AstraZeneca said it would use CAT to create a new biological arm, based in CAT’s Cambridge headquarters.David Brennan, chief executive, said that by 2010 he expected one in four of the drugs in development at the group to be biological. “The number one priority for us is to strengthen the pipeline,” he added.But AstraZeneca executives stressed that the deal was not simply about buying CAT products in development, but a technology platform they could apply across all AstraZeneca’s research.Some analysts questioned whether the addition of CAT would allow AstraZeneca to fill gaps in its therapies pipeline quickly enough, given that the majority of products in CAT were at a very early stage.Ben Yeoh, pharmaceutical analyst with DrKW, said: “It’s not going to solve their long-term problems, but it is a step in the right direction.” He added it was likely that AstraZeneca would have to continue adding acquisitions.The pharmaceutical group has already spent more than $2bn since December in an attempt to prop up its pipeline. Jon Symonds, AstraZeneca’s chief financial officer, on Monday held out the prospect of further acquisitions.He said that with $6bn in free cash flow last year, the deal did not “really jeopardise our ability to transact where there is short, medium or long-term capacity to add value”. AstraZeneca also reported that it would be offering special retention payments. But Peter Chambré, chief executive of CAT since 2002, revealed that he would not be staying on at the group.AstraZeneca shares closed flat at £28.57, while CAT closed 508p higher at £12.99.CAT was advised by Morgan Stanley, while AstraZeneca was advised by Goldman Sachs.

UBS raised its price target on the stock from $39 to $42, saying Yahoo’s earnings results were solid across the board and its search results were more than respectable.Solid growth in Yahoo’s online-advertising business boosted expectations for Google’s quarterly earnings, due today. Google shares rose 1.6 per cent to $410.50. Ebay rose 3.8 per cent to $40.35.Higher than expected quarterly earnings from chipmaker Texas Instrument and technology products and service provider United Technologies sparked further optimism for growth in the technology industry. TI shares rose 1.3 per cent to $34.45, having climbed 3.8 per cent in the previous session.United, which was upgraded by Merrill Lynch from “neutral” to “buy” jumped 6.6 per cent to $62.80.Overall it was a strong day for technology stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,370.88.However, gains in the wider market were checked by the release of higher than expected core consumer inflation data for March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a choppy session 0.1 per cent higher at 11,278.77 and the S&P 500 nudged up 0.2 per cent to 1,309.93.The advance came in spite of another spike in oil prices. Crude oil hit new highs after the Energy Department reported a drop in oil and gasoline inventories.The Amex oil index was up 0.9 per cent to 1,163.28.Elsewhere, Allstate led insurers higher after its first-quarter results topped analysts’ expectations as fewer catastrophes and less frequent claims helped increase profit. Wachovia raised its rating on the stock to “outperform”. The stock climbed 5.5 per cent to $54.82.Motorola slumped 6.6 per cent to $22.49 after the mobile phone maker reported a slight dip in first-quarter profit.Amgen reported higher first-quarter earnings, but revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts, pushing shares down 3.8 per cent to $68.30.Coca-Cola, which narrowly beat Wall Street forecasts with its 10 per cent jump in quarterly profit, rose 0.9 per cent to $41.69.JPMorgan Chase, which reported a 36 per cent rise in first-quarter net income, edged up 0.1 per cent to $42.62.Interest in exchange stocks continued after International Securities Exchange, the options exchange, said it was launching its own stock exchange. The move sent ISE shares up 8.5 per cent to $45.27.CBOT Holdings, the futures exchange, delivered a 69 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, but its shares reversed earlier gains to trade 3.9 per cent lower at $115.30.

We are deeply committed to the highest standards of ethical business conduct, and we cannot and will not tolerate behaviour that falls outside these standards.”Merrill has found itself at the heart of one of the largest alleged Wall Street insider trading schemes in decades.Stanislav Shpigelman, a 23-year old analyst in the M&A department, has been accused by prosecutors of participating in a $6.7m international scheme allegedly organised by Eugene Plotkin, a Harvard graduate working as an associate in the fixed income division of Goldman Sachs.Details of the alleged scheme have been particularly troubling for Merrill, because they involve the disclosure of information about many large M&A deals that the bank was working on.Prosecutors allege that Mr Shpigelman would offer Mr Plotkin tips about deals that he was working on or hearing about at Merrill, in exchange for cash payments.These deals included Procter & Gamble’s $58bn purchase of Gillette, Adidas’s takeover of Reebok, and even a deal that was never finalised – Amgen’s attempt to buy Celgene, a rival biotechnology group.Goldman appears to have been less damaged because although Mr Plotkin, 26, was an employee, he has not been charged with using any of Goldman’s confidential information in his trading.To many on Wall Street, the case highlights the extent to which teams of junior bankers are entrusted with extremely sensitive information, and the challenges facing investment banks in making sure that this material is not passed around for the wrong reasons.Typically, bankers are given training courses on how to deal with confidential information as part of their orientation.But one New York-based securities lawyer says that may not be enough: “It is difficult, maybe impossible, to fully monitor insider trading. You can give compliance speeches, prepare special courses, have people sign documents, but if they want to commit fraud, they will.”Lawyers for Mr Shpigelman and Mr Plotkin did not return calls seeking comment.
169;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-04-11T22:28:11Z;Goldman and Merrill staff charged with insider trading;;Prosecutors on Tuesday accused three employees at Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs of taking part in a “massive” $6.7m international insider trading scheme involving the sharing of tips on sensitive mergers and acquisitions by Merrill clients.Michael Garcia, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, said Stanislav Shpigelman, a 23-year-old investment banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, gave Eugene Plotkin, an associate in the fixed income division of Goldman Sachs, and another person, information on six different pending mergers in exchange for cash payments.The indictment paints a picture of Wall Street go-getters who hoped to find other ways to maximise their gains, including helping other individuals get jobs at investment banks in the hope that they would later share insider tips with them.It is alleged that Mr Plotkin and David Pajcin, another former Goldman employee who was previously arrested by the FBI and is co-operating with the investigation, used the information to buy stocks based on knowledge of the deals before they were publicly announced. The tips included information about Procter & Gamble’s takeover of Gillette, Novartis’s takeover of Eon, the merger between Cinergy and Duke Energy, and Adidas’s takeover of Reebok.In the case of Reebok, prosecutors allege that an account in the name of Sonja Anticevic had purchased nearly 2,000 “out of money” call options for Reebok stock for $130,000 two days before the deal was announced. The sale of the call options ultimately reaped a $2m profit following a surge in Reebok shares. An investigation into the account found it was controlled by the three defendants, according to the complaint.It alleges that Mr Plotkin first introduced Mr Pajcin to Mr Shpigelman in 2004, at a Russian day spa called Spa 88 in lower Manhattan. At a later meeting, the Merrill employee told the others he had flown to Ohio, where P&G is based, to deliver documents related to the Gillette deal. It is alleged Mr Pajcin told an FBI agent that he and Mr Plotkin shared the information with other traders, including a dancer from New York and “foreign tippees” from Germany and Switzerland.Mr Plotkin, a Harvard graduate who worked at Goldman since 2000, and Mr Pajcin are alleged to have hatched another scheme to trade on information from BusinessWeek magazine, which they obtained in early copies by bribing two employees at the print plant where the magazine was produced.The two are said to have made $340,000 from buying the stocks before the column was public and later selling them. Prosecutors allege that the two print plant employees gave Mr Plotkin and Mr Pajcin the named of stocks that were mentioned favourably in the magazine’s “Inside Wall Street” column.The two men named in the complaint could not be reached for comment.

Although the numbers largely met analysts’ forecasts, investors had become used to the company trumping such predictions.“Google doesn’t play the game of steering financial analysts to make estimates. Therefore analysts have to make up their own,” said Richard Holway, director of Ovum, the consultancy. Google has said such quarterly earnings guidance encourages a short-term approach.UBS slashed its stance on the company from “buy” to “neutral” and cut its price target by $75 to $425. “Our downgrade is based primarily on concerns over international revenue growth and the rising investment needed to potentially improve performance in key international markets,” analyst Benjamin Schachter said. Google last week made a push into China.However, Jefferies & Company said the sell-off was not justified. “We believe that Google fundamentals remain solid and that this stock pull-back offers an attractive buying opportunity,” said analyst Youssef Squali.Google fell as low as $387.52, although the stock recovered to end down 7.1 per cent at $401.78.In the wider market, a strong performance from Boeing sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent higher to 10,953.95. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,282.46, while an afternoon rally helped the Nasdaq Composite gain 0.2 per cent to 2,310.56.Aerospace group Boeing rose 4.8 per cent to $71.62 as it more than doubled quarterly profit and raised earnings guidance.Other S&P 500 gainers included Time Warner, the media and entertainment group, up 3.9 per cent to $18.22 after its earnings beat estimates.Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology group, jumped 4.5 per cent to $76.19 after Roche of Switzerland said it would not launch Cera, a rival to Amgen’s Epogen drug, until 2010, later than had been thought. Epogen is used to treat anaemia in dialysis patients.Monster Worldwide, the owner of the Monster.com jobs website, surged 14 per cent to $48.50 amid the flow of advertisements to online.However, Symantec, the No.1 maker of anti-virus software, fell 6.8 per cent to $17.13 after disappointing earnings.BlackRock, the investment manager, lost 2.4 per cent to $129.54 on reports that takeover talks with investment bank Morgan Stanley had foundered on a disagreement over valuation.JetBlue lost 14.2 per cent to $11.18 as higher fuel costs dragged the discount airline into the red..
171;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-01-27T00:42:11Z;Amgen needs to stay ‘small’ as it grows;;Amgen painted the future landscape of big biotech on Thursday, showing off impressive growth forecasts tempered by the challenge of rising drug development costs and generic competition.The world’s biggest biotechnology group talked frankly about the challenges of its increased bulk while pointing out the necessity of scale to fund large-scale clinical trials that can maximise the potential profits from discoveries in its laboratories.“[The challenge will] take everything we’ve got,” said Kevin Sharer, Amgen chief executive, adding that the company could only avoid growth problems seen by older, big pharma drugmakers by staying “small and hungry in feel and behaviour” as it grew.Amgen forecast that earnings this year would increase 11-16 per cent to between $3.55 and $3.70 per share, in line with Wall Street predictions.This would come on the back of revenues of $13.9bn-$14.4bn, or an increase of 12-16 per cent this year over last.Its shares closed almost 5 per cent lower at $71.90 on Thursday.The group has three fast-growing blockbuster biotech drug franchises: Aranesp for anaemia, Neulasta/Neupogen for chemotherapy and Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis.But this year brings new hurdles as the company’s sales figures start to rival some of the oldest names in pharmaceuticals.Amgen must add resources to its efforts to develop new drugs. Research and development costs this year are expected to rise as much as 40 per cent to more than $3bn.
172;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2006-01-11T20:49:45Z;How big pharma is picking the best of biotech;;"Someone in pain will spend money to ease it. Nobody knows that better than a pharmaceuticals executive. Now, as big drugs manufacturers agonise over their potentially life-shortening lack of future products, they are strengthening their relationship with the sector that has become best placed to offer relief.Biotechnology companies are attracting fresh capital and concluding deals as their larger brethren?s appetite for innovation grows. In the closing days of 2005, three deals from AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, underlined the trend. Earlier in the year Pfizer, the industry leader, had spent $1.9bn (?1.1bn, ?1.6bn) to buy Vicuron, known for its anti-infective treatments. This week, as the pharmaceutical world gathered for JPMorgan?s healthcare conference in San Francisco, there was a palpable sense of excitement about the industry?s new-found potential.Joe Anderson, a partner with Abingworth, a UK venture capital firm, who is attending the conference, says: ?Big pharma is cash-rich and product-poor, while biotech is a source of innovation. It has become a sellers? market.?But if the general pattern is to create a more lucrative and balanced relationship between maturing biotech Davids and struggling pharmaceutical Goliaths, there are also significantly divergent strategies. In a business where success is always a long shot, the debate over the most productive relationship between the two is intensifying. For many years, in an industry dominated by organic chemistry, big pharma had the edge in innovation. Large companies were able to marshal the substantial resources needed to conduct research and development in-house. A series of mega-mergers allowed them to increase their critical mass and market share and boost their research ?pipelines? of new drugs still further. Today, that model seems increasingly imperilled.Many of their medicines were mass-marketed ?me-too? drugs for primary health care. They were commercially attractive but only modestly innovative. The bigger companies have found it harder to ride more recent waves of scientific research, which have centred on so-called ?large molecules? such as proteins and the breakthroughs yielded by the science of genomics.The statistics tell the story: ?99 per cent of the world?s biomedical research takes place outside our research labs,? says Ray Hill, in charge of licensing for Merck, which has shed its image as a company that developed all drugs in-house and is today seeking outside partners far more actively. He also highlights the ?democratisation? of research. Many tools that were once only available to large companies can now be bought ?off the shelf?, while contract research organisations have allowed smaller businesses to outsource activities for which they lack the necessary skills.Another factor in favour of biotech is culture. The mega-mergers created a smaller number of large, unwieldy corporate research and development centres, where science often took second place to bureaucracy and innovation was stifled. That can prove deadening in an industry where, as a West Coast saying puts it, ?people have more loyalty to their technology than to their companies?. The mantra now is ?small is beautiful?.GlaxoSmithKline, the UK-based group, was among the bigger companies that over the past five years have flattered the biotech sector with imitation. It has restructured its large research laboratories into small entrepreneurial units called CEDDs: Centres of Excellence for Drug Discovery. It has created a CEDD focused explicitly on collaborations and re-launched an in-house venture capital business to identify and invest in biotech companies with promising projects.While the balance of power had shifted towards biotechnology companies in recent years, investors were often unable to reap the rewards. Drug research remains risky, lengthy and costly; for every success there are dozens of failures and endless calls for refinancing.Biotech companies may have proved strong in the early-stage scientific research for drugs but big pharma had far superior resources and expertise when it came to funding clinical trials, chaperoning medicines successfully through regulatory hurdles and marketing them.But that disadvantage is finally being overcome as more than a decade of substantial financial support starts to pay off. A growing proportion of drug applications filed with the US Food and Drug Administration comes from biotechnology companies.That upswing has coincided with a crisis for big pharma, particularly in the US. In the next few years, the largest groups collectively stand to lose tens of billions of dollars as long-
standing ?blockbuster? drugs launched a decade ago come off patent, while the flow through the replacement-drug pipeline remains a trickle.For now, however, big pharma remains cash-rich from drug sales. Additional resources have been released by the US Job Creation Act of 2004, which created billions of dollars in tax breaks on repatriated earnings for companies reinvesting in the US.The result has been a spending spree in recent months, typified by Pfizer, which last summer paid a premium of 74 per cent to Vicuron?s average share price over the previous three months to buy the company. ?Big pharma is going for much bigger deals and acquisitions,? says Fintan Walton of Pharma-Ventures, a consultancy. ?They are out there to land-grab the sector by taking out biotech.?The increasing competition is reflected not only in rising prices for transactions but also in larger up-front fees when drug companies enter partnerships with biotechs to develop promising individual drugs rather than purchasing businesses outright. ?At the beginning of last year, payments were typically $10m, and now we are looking at $50m-$60m because of the scarcity of late-stage products,? says Samir Devani, an analyst with Code Nomura.Despite the excitement, however, there is no wholesale bonanza. The pattern of deals is increasingly complex. One of the most revealing examples was last month?s purchase of Abgenix, a therapeutic antibodies company, for $2.2bn. The buyer was not a traditional large pharma company, but Amgen, a biotechnology company based near Los Angeles.Such deals have sparked a new-found confidence, with biotech companies holding out for better terms or attempting to go it alone. Michael Ashton, head of Skye Pharma, says: ?We?ve walked away from $90m deals. We want $1.2bn products.? But his company, focused on development rather than early-stage research, highlights just how divergent companies dubbed ?biotech? can be.At one extreme, there are those that have become giants in their own right, led by Amgen and Genentech. Both rank in the top dozen pharma companies by market capitalisation. At this scale, convergence is taking place.David Allsop, a vice-president from Biogen Idec, another of the handful of biotechs in the big pharma league, acknowledges: ?We need an influx of people with pharma experience if we are going to be successful.?Other giants also defy the conventional biotech mould. Chiron, which has just been bought by Novartis of Switzerland for $5.5bn, specialises in vaccines. Gilead, its near neighbour just outside San Francisco, developed the antiviral ?small molecule? drugs Tenofovir for HIV and Tamiflu against influenza, the latter licensed to Roche.Such large players remain the exception. Among the thousands of biotech companies, just a handful have a market capitalisation above $8bn and the bulk remain privately held. Far from contemplating ambitious expansion most are preoccupied with simple survival. A number that have tried to go it alone, attempting to bring their drugs to market and sell them without partnerships with larger groups, have lacked the money, strategy or management expertise to succeed.Fred Hassan, chief executive of Schering-Plough, the New Jersey-based pharma group which aims to increase its biotech portfolio to a third of revenues, argues: ?Amgen is the dream of these smaller biotechs but the vast majority will go with partnering. It?s very hard to keep burning cash.? In Europe, the challenges for biotech companies are if anything even greater. There is less money and fewer clusters of companies or well-funded research universities than exist on the US west coast or in Boston ? and a smaller base of experienced management.For most biotech companies, Amgen and its ilk may remain a pipe-dream. But Mr Anderson maintains: ?They should try to retain the value of the drug for as long as possible, because the economics of a deal with big pharma has become very attractive.?The lesson for big pharma, on the other hand, seems to be the need to exercise humility and imagination in collaborations with biotechs ? eschewing any attempt to impose existing models of research. Martin Reeves from Boston Consulting Group cites Genentech, which is controlled but left autonomous by Roche, as a model.Jason Owen-Smith, a sociologist from the University of Michigan who has studied the evolution of the sector, agrees. ?If your goal is to develop new market-leading drugs, collaboration is essential with a diverse range of partners. You need continually to innovate, which is impossible to do under one roof.?And for investors in all but the largest and most diversified biotechs, the market is still one best suited to experienced professionals able to distinguish promising science from the multitude of candidates they study. As Tom Dietz from Pacific Growth Equities, a San Francisco venture capital firm, puts it: ?We?re still on the cusp in the biotech sector. We?re out of the Wild West, but people still carry guns. The industry will not be mature for a long time.?FROM SNAKEBITE SERUM TO THE SHOCK OF THE NEWAndrew Heath, chief executive of Protherics, has had the luxury of spending the past month deciding what to do with a large cash injection, following a licensing deal with AstraZeneca for its treatment for septic shock.?It?s something that has widened options for us,? says Mr Heath, who alongside a ?16.3m up-front payment, managed to negotiate milestone payments that could take the total value of the deal to ?195m.Protherics is also in line to receive 20 per cent royalties on sales of the treatment, called CytoFab. To underscore the tie-up, AstraZeneca has taken a 4.3 per cent stake in the UK company.The sums commanded were helped by the late stage that product development had reached and its niche application. At the moment there are no safe and effective treatments for septic shock.But Mr Heath says he believes that another deciding factor for AstraZeneca was Protherics? own ability to manufacture the treatment, which is based on the milk of Australian sheep. ?Large pharma groups like AstraZeneca are not in the business of keeping herds of sheep, so that is something that we can do. We were also able to convince them that we could manufacture the product because we had the existing expertise.? It is part of what he sees as a big pragmatic shift in thinking by big pharma.One of the immediate effects of the deal for Protherics was a sudden rise in share price that has boosted its market capitalisation to some ?217m ($383m, ?316m) from ?137m. That has put it on the radar screens of potential investors in the US.The deal also opens up fresh avenues previously barred by a lack of resources. ?One of the limiting factors in biotechnology is cash and we are much stronger in cash now,? says Mr Heath.For now, he is looking to move the group, traditionally known for its snakebite antidotes, into other therapeutic areas such as cancer ? and accelerate its growth plans.?The cash will allow us to fund our oncology work and it means that we can move to the next step of our development just that little bit quicker.?But Mr Heath admits his fondness for an integrated model under which it would discover, develop and then market its own products. ?I?m a strong believer that you have to have some products to sell further down the line,? he says. ?You can?t become a sustainable company by simply being a platform for others.?GENENTECH PROFITS FROM PUTTING THE SCIENCE FIRSTMany pharmaceutical executives would envy the view from Joe McCracken?s room overlooking the San Francisco coastline, but the vice president for business development at Genentech insists the best offices in his company are reserved for scientists.Thirty years after the mother of all biotechnology companies was founded, Genentech?s sprawling campus bears all the hallmarks of West Coast informality, enterprise and wealth more generally associated with the high-tech sector. Staff benefit from subsidised canteens, car washing facilities and Friday socials, while earning healthy salaries and stock options.A beacon to smaller and more recently-created peers ? many of them staffed by Genentech alumni ? the company now rivals the far longer-established giants, with a market capitalisation of $95bn. During its period of growth, it has benefited from the ?protection? of Roche of Switzerland, the ?big pharma? group that acquired the company in 1990 and which today, though it has reduced its stake, still holds the majority of the shares.While Genentech is proud of its autonomy in research and management, Roche has provided financial stability, is represented on the company board and markets the company?s drugs abroad. In exchange, Roche has benefited richly from Genentech?s expertise in recent years, filling its pipeline with ?blockbuster? specialist drugs such as the Avastin and Herceptin cancer treatments.The deal marks Genentech out from Amgen, the other West Coast giant, which turned 25 last year. Amgen, worth $96bn, has maintained its independence from any large corporate shareholder and has grown through diversification and several large acquisitions.Art Levinson, Genentech?s founding chief executive, still dominates his company. While he is a savvy businessman he is still ?passionate about the science?, reflecting his academic background.Some top scientists have been granted the status of ?Genentech fellows?, allowing them to draw the salaries of vice presidents without having to take on management responsibilities. Others are allowed to spend a significant proportion of their time working on non-company research projects. ?We try to stay focused on the areas in which we have expertise: molecular oncology, immunology and the biology of tissue growth and repair,? says Mr McCracken. ?At Genentech, the scientists are the grand poo-bahs.?Like Amgen, the group has created an in-house venture capital fund, but it is less than a tenth of the size and is designed principally to foster the creation of new start-ups. ?We like it to be modest so we don?t have to worry if it?s losing money,? he says.His biggest concern for the sector is that the increasing focus by financial investors and pharmaceutical groups on later-stage projects may come at the cost of the early-stage drug research and development.TEN YEARS ON, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY IS HOTTING UP? A new excitement surrounds biotechnology companies, with a wave of deals and optimism about flotation valuations.? The activity reflects a search by ?big pharma? to replenish pipelines of coming drugs as patents on existing ones expire.? A sellers? market is playing to biotech?s strength as companies start to mature.? Big capital injections began a decade ago.? It is far from a bonanza for all: many biotech companies languish.?

173;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2005-12-15T00:19:24Z;Amgen to buy Abgenix for $2.2bn;;Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology group, on Wednesday agreed to pay $2.2bn in cash to acquire Abgenix, a much smaller rival that develops therapeutic antibodies including a promising product for the treatment of colorectal cancer.The companies already had close ties because of a co-development agreement for the key product, panitumumab, which recently completed final phase III trials and will be filed for regulatory approval this week.The price of the acquisition underlines how big drugmakers - and Amgen has steadily climbed into those ranks - are prepared to pay heavily for high-margin, innovative drugs. The timing shows how they are increasingly wary of committing too early, particularly as regulatory review becomes more stringent due to recent drug safety concerns.Kevin Sharer, Amgen’s chief executive, on Wednesday acknowledged he had waited until after panitumumab’s final clinical trial results came in, so as to have “more certainty” as to the drug’s market potential.Buying the 50 per cent of panitumumab it did not own gives Amgen control over its first cancer treatment drug. Oncology is a key component to Amgen’s solid roster of blockbusters to treat anaemia.The deal also underlines Amgen’s strategy of expanding through small acquisitions targeting one or two specific drugs rather than attempting large takeovers.Mr Sharer said in an interview it was better to do a “clean deal” for a smaller company than “bet the ranch on a big one”.Under the terms of the deal, Amgen, which is based outside Los Angeles, is paying $22.50 a share in cash to take over Abgenix. This represents a 54 per cent premium over Abgenix’s closing share price of $14.65 on Wednesday.Amgen hopes that panitumumab can be effective in many cancers and reach sales in excess of $2bn per year. Panitumumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signals that allow cancer cells to grow.It could compete with Erbitux, by ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and has the potential to be the first epidermal growth factor inhibitor to treat cancer and help patients with metastatic colorectal cancer survive after the failure of chemotherapy.Beyond gaining full control of panitumumab, the takeover will allow Amgen to stop paying royalties on future sales of denosumab, a product for the treatment of osteoporosis that was developed using an Abgenix technology.Amgen also gets XenoMouse technology, used by many other companies to develop monoclonal antibodies to form biotechnology therapies.The sale of Abgenix, if completed, could be a model for consolidation in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries.“Any company with a product that has promise for the future would have to take a look at their options,” said Mr Sharer, referring to smaller biotechnology companies like Abgenix.The deal is expected to reduce Amgen’s earnings per share by up to $0.10 in 2006 and 2007, not affect profits in 2008 and lift them the following year.Morgan Stanley advised Amgen. Goldman Sachs advised Abgenix.

Clothing and shoe retailers saw tidy gains but general stores also advanced.Aeropostale, up 10.12 per cent at $22.19, led the charge. Guess was not far behind, up 12.9 per cent to $31.60.Other retailers propelled higher by the broad sector rally included DSW, up 8.6 per cent to $22.75, and Men’s Wearhouse, up 10.65 per cent advance to $28.77.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, fell 0.23 per cent to $47.69 after it reiterated its forecast for same-store sales. Rival Target, a rival, declined 0.3 per cent to $56.80, while Saks fell 0.6 per cent to $18.22.Stocks received a further boost from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who told Congress that the world’s largest economy was still sound, in spite of hurricanes and energy price increases.Against this background, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent, or 49.86 points, to 10,522.59 by the close, while the broader S&P 500 put on 0.4 per cent, or 5.18 points, to 1,219.94. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.74 per cent, or 15.91 points, to 2,160.22.Leading the gains on the Dow was Merck, up 3.8 per cent at $29.48 after a jury found the drugmaker not guilty in a trial related to the side effects of its Vioxx painkiller.Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker and also a Dow component, was up 1.25 per cent to $21.87.Boeing, up 1.2 per cent to $65.50, and McDonald’s, 3 per cent stronger at $33.23, were also among the main gainers on the Dow industrials.Among the companies announcing earnings yesterday, Sara Lee shares increased 2 per cent to $17.87 after the panties-to-pastries group topped analyst forecasts.On the downside, Montpelier Re Holdings shares plunged 13.64 per cent to $18.55 after the reinsurer posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.Comcast, the largest cable TV systems operator in the US, fell 5 per cent to $27.36 after it reported that third quarter profit growth was essentially flat.The news came even as revenue from digital cable and high-speed internet services was showing improvement.Guidant traded down 4.7 per cent to $57.57 after Banc of America slashed the medical device maker’s price target to reflect the uncertainty surrounding Johnson & Johnson’s $25.4bn bid for the company.

The Nasdaq Composite index was 0.9 per cent higher, or 17.61, at 2,064.83.However, over the week the Nasdaq Composite was 1.6 per cent lower and the S&P 500 index 1.1 per cent down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average appeared less bruised, off only 0.4 per cent since last Friday.Among the 10 industry groups of the S&P 500, utilities were the worst performers, falling 5.5 per cent, followed by energy with a 4.7 per cent retreat. Healthcare, financials and consumer staples performed best in that their losses were less than 1 per cent for the week.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach and Co, saw Friday’s market resilience as a sign of better things to come, even though headline inflation was sharply higher last month.“We are seeing a bottoming-out process. The market has already discounted factors such as . . . interest rates and weaker earnings guidance, and is trying to stabilise,” he said. “The market can do one thing only now: focus on the economic rebound that should take place in the first and second quarters.”However, Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, saw further falls on Wall Street. He pointed to the fact that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are now close to falling below their 20-month moving average, something the Dow has already done.“That is the line of demarcation between a bull and a bear market. We could see all three major indices moving below their major support levels. The market is at a crossroads right now.”Mr Johnson further warned that investors who had been lured back into the market in the belief that October is normally a strong month could turn tail if things do not pick up quickly. “If the market does not find the strength to really start rallying next week there is very much a risk of an exaggerated sell-off,” he said.Semiconductor stocks, as reflected in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange chip index, finished the week 3.7 per cent lower.In the wake of Xilinx’s announcement of a quarterly revenue decline, which cost its stock a 16 per cent tumble to a 30-month low on Monday, the sector received a broad downgrade from analysts at Prudential on Wednesday. Xilinx’s shares lost 18.5 per cent on the week by midday yesterday.This saw Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lose 0.8 per cent while Advanced Micro Devices, its nearest rival, lost 12.5 per cent despite having forecast above-expectations earnings the day before. For the week, Intel declined 2.9 per cent while AMD lost 11 per cent.Apple Computer did nothing to help techs when it reported fourth-quarter revenues below expectations, and fell 4.5 per cent on Wednesday. However, the shares bounced 9.1 per cent a session later to finish the week 4.6 per cent ahead.The auto sector attracted a fair amount of attention after the widely anticipate bankruptcy filing by component maker Delphi last weekend. The company, which is the largest supplier to General Motors, said it needed to extract significant concessions from its unions to become competitive.The filing triggered concerns that GM itself might be in jeopardy, and the carmaker’s shares lost 9.9 per cent on Monday. For the week, they lost 5.8 per cent.Adding to the sector’s woes was Dana, which fell 34.3 per cent on Monday after it warned its third-quarter results would be delayed. The decline pulled Visteon, a leading supplier to Ford Motor, 5.3 per cent lower in the same session. Another rival, Arvin-Meritor, lost 7.4 per cent. For the week, Dana lost 31.8 per cent, Visteon fell 11.5 per cent, Arvin lost 7.2 per cent and Ford was 6.2 per cent behind.Away from cars, Johnson & Johnson fell 3.6 per cent on Thursday after it sued Amgen for anti-competitive practices. It was 3.6 per cent higher for the week.
176;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2005-10-13T20:34:40Z;Wall Street recovers as oil price softens;;Wall Street closed flat on Thursday as a late rally fuelled by a pullback in oil prices balanced earlier worries over mounting inflationary and interest rate pressures.The US Labor Department said import prices rose at their fastest pace for almost 15 years in September – 2.3 per cent – led by higher prices for energy. Import prices already had risen 1.2 per cent in August and are now 10 per cent higher than a year ago.This added to jitters ahead of Friday’s release of September consumer inflation data. “This gives us concern that the overall CPI [consumer price index] is going to see a bigger pop,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.However, the previously bearish Mr Pado argued that Wall Street was now approaching an “extremely oversold” level with much of the bad news now discounted, and it could be in for a technical bounce, potentially followed by a seasonal November rally.With oil prices falling, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered to close just 0.32 of a point lower at 10,216.59, with the S&P 500 off 0.84 of a point, or 0.1 per cent, at 1,176.84.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 9.75 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,047.22, aided by Apple Computer jumping 9.1 per cent to $53.74, reversing two days of selling.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, rose 1.2 per cent to $32.05. It said sales at outlets open for at least a year were 3.9 per cent higher in September than in the same month last year.Johnson & Johnson, another Dow component, rose 3.6 per cent to $64.02 amid reports that it had filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Amgen, accusing the latter of illegally bundling products to force cancer clinics to use Amgen’s Aranesp drug rather than J&J’s treatment. Amgen reversed earlier weakness to close 1.4 per cent firmer at $75.82.Nabi Biopharmaceuticals rose 4 per cent to $11.81 on good results from a consistency study for its staphylococcus vaccine.But trading in scandal-hit derivatives broker Refco was halted after it plunged a further 27.2 per cent to $7.90, and shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell 2.7 per cent to $310.40 as the CME placed restrictions on Refco’s broker dealer.Google, the search engine, fell 1.2 per cent to $297.44 and cable company Comcast lost 2.6 per cent at $27.20 on reports that the pair were in discussions to buy a stake in Time Warner’s America Online business for $5bn. Time Warner firmed 0.6 per cent to $17.59 on the news.Houston oil company Bois d’Arc Energy rose 5.2 per cent to $14.95 after reporting that three of the four wells it had drilled recently in the Gulf of Mexico have been successful.Central Coast Bancorp leapt 25.1 per cent to $24.30 as Rabobank, the Dutch financial services group, said it was buying its California-based peer for $371m in cash, or $25 a share.Bell Microproducts plummeted 24.9 per cent to $7.36 as it forecast third quarter earnings of 7-9 cents a share, well below market forecasts of 16 cents.
177;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2005-07-20T21:00:32Z;Wall Street bounces back after GM disappointment;;Shares staged a strong recovery on Wednesday after Wall Street was knocked off course by an unexpected loss from General Motors and disappointing results from two leading tech companies.Before the start of trading, GM reported a financial performance that even the car marker’s chief executive described as “very disappointing”, sending shares down 0.7 per cent to $36.58.The markets then spent much of the first half of the day in negative territory as results from Yahoo and Intel raised concerns about revenue growth.Intel made a slight recovery but was still 4.4 per cent down at $27.44 after the chipmaker announced earnings on Tuesday that satisfied expectations on Wall Street. Margins, however, were less than expected.It was a similar story at Yahoo, which hit earnings forecasts but missed revenue targets. The internet search engine saw shares close 11.5 per cent down at $33.40. Google also fell 0.7 per cent on the news, down to $312.Analysts said the market had become overly-sensitive to poor earnings figures and that recent upward momentum would be sustained.“The earnings numbers have been getting better and better all week and that has raised expectations too high,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist, at Wells Capital Management. “Even when Yahoo met expectations it still got hit. But despite the bad headlines the market is basically unchanged.”By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had recovered and up 0.4 per cent at 10,689.15. The S&P 500, which had been down 0.3 per cent, was up 0.5 per cent at 1,235.2 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent at 2,188.57.Alan Greenspan helped dispel the market’s suddenly bearish mood when he testified to Congress. The Federal Reserve chairman said the outlook for the US economy was good and that the central bank should keep tightening interest rates.The S&P 500 was also bolstered by a good performance from the world’s largest biotechnology company. Amgen saw its share price jump by 15 per cent to $81.17 after reporting a 38 per cent increase in second-quarter profit and raising its full year forecast.PepsiCo shares slipped after Dominique de Villepin, the French prime minister, condemned speculation that the soft-drink maker was ready to take over Danone, the French food group.Mr Villepin said he would defend the interests of one of the “flowers of our industry”. Danone shares rose in Paris, while PepsiCo’s fell 1.7 per cent to $54.60.Eastman Kodak fell 2.2 per cent to $28.10. The world’s largest photography company announced its third consecutive quarterly loss, saying it would cut 10,000 more jobs.Maytag shares fell 11 per cent to $15.61 after Chinese company Haier announced it had given up trying to takeover the US appliance maker. Shares in Whirlpool, which offered $1.35bn earlier in the week, were up 0.9 per cent at $76.10.
178;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T20:07:31+0000;Wall St shrugs off hangover of rising oil prices;;For once the markets were not totally in thrall to oil prices during a week that saw a surge of investor optimism after an extended period of worrying that rising energy costs would eat into corporate profits.Instead, the market was energised by better than expected jobs figures and some good earnings results – not least from Apple, which reaped rich rewards from the enduring popularity of its iPod music player system.Owen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, said traders had not been as jittery about oil prices as in previous weeks.“The market seems to be taking it in its stride because it is so weather- related. It goes up when a storm is brewing in the Gulf but when it passes oil falls back off again.” Although the rising oil price helped the energy sector, the week finished with uncertainty hanging over CNOOC’s $18.5bn attempt to takeover Unocal.A crucial board meeting by Unocal executives ended on Thursday night with no public statement about the competing bid from Chevron. During late morning trade yesterday CNOOC’s New York listed shares were down 1.6 per cent on the day at $59.90 – down 3.6 per cent on last Friday’s close.Technology and healthcare stocks performed well during the week.Leading the pack were Advanced Micro Devices and Apple. A record five-fold increase in sales of iPods sent Apple shares soaring, up 7.8 per cent at $41.23 compared to last week.AMD reported better than expected profit as strong sales of personal computers and corporate servers offset losses from flash memory chips for consumer gadgets. AMD shares rose 1.3 per cent during the week to $19.18.The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 3.9 per cent to 459.85 during the week on the back of AMD’s results.Intel was up 4.7 per cent to $19.71 over the week while Texas Instruments, which is to publish its results this month, gained 2.3 per cent to $30.42.Amgen, the biotechnology company, rose above the $70 mark, with a 1.4 per cent gain during the week taking it to $70.10 a share.Mergers and takeovers also helped to bolster the healthcare sector with VNU, the Dutch owner of AC Nielsen, agreeing to buy IMS Health in a $7bn deal.VNU was up 3.7 per cent over the week at $12.47 while IMS was up 5.1 per cent at $27.22.It was also a good week for PepsiCo when the world’s second-largest soft-drinks maker reported better than expected quarterly profits due to strong growth in its international business, taking it to $55.71 – a 4.1 per cent gain since last Friday.“All these good results have reassured the market that growth is not going to fall off a cliff,” said Mr Fitzpatrick.Investors also cheered strong economic reports, including a slight narrowing of the US trade deficit, and government data showing retail sales rose 1.7 per cent in June even as inflation remained under control.Among various bits of data released yesterday the government said producer prices had held steady over the last month and the Federal Reserve announced that industrial production rose 0.9 per cent in June, compared to a 0.3 per cent rise in May.By late morning yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen slightly to 10,626.82 and the broader S&P 500 was down at 1,225.57. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,148.76.Over the week the Dow was up 1.7 per cent, the S&P advanced 1.1 per cent, after attaining a four-year high on Thursday, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.7 per cent.Among the stocks to disappoint this week was General Electric. Yesterday General Electric announced profits that only met analysts expectations and warned third-quarter earnings may fall short of some forecasts.By late morning yesterday shares in the company had slipped 1.2 per cent to $35.19.Yum! Brands, the owner of Pizza Hut and KFC, saw its shares fall more than four per cent after it lowered its forecast for the year. Across the week its share price fell 1.6 per cent to $51.03.Shares of DreamWorks Animation SKG also took a tumble after the maker of Shrek said it would post a second-quarter loss. The shares dropped 13.8 per cent to $23.10 over the week.
179;AMGN;Amgen Inc;2020-04-23T22:37:00+0000;'If the science looks good, I'll go after it';;"Scientists are rarely picked to head big corporations - and for good reason, says Art Levinson, Genentech's chief executive. The laboratory's atmosphere of irreverence does not always play well in corporate meeting rooms. ""I can be more abrasive and probing than people expect a chief executive to be,"" says the 54-year-old former researcher. ""A lot of people just think it's weird.""Weird or not, many chief executives would like some of the success Genentech has experienced. With revenues for last year forecast close at to $4bn, Genentech is the largest biotechnology company in the world after Amgen and is widely considered to have the most promising pipeline of drugs in the industry.Avastin, Genentech's drug for colon cancer, was approved early this year and is expected to become one of the best-selling cancer drugs on the market, with potential annual sales of billions of dollars.Yet imitating Genentech appears difficult. ""You'd think with the kind of success we've had that more people would see us as a model, but I just don't see a lot of companies moving in our direction,"" says Mr Levinson.Few companies are as focused on science as Genentech. Images of the DNA helix are embedded along the corporate offices' walkways and huge posters of patients on successful clinical trials are plastered on the walls of company shuttle buses. The company puts a priority on research and has become a magnet for serious researchers. Genentech staff say the company is more like a university than a corporation. Not surprisingly, researchers revere the man responsible for this unusual corporate environment. Avi Ashkenazi, a senior scientist at the company, went so far as to call Mr Levinson ""my hero"".Genentech has been able to recruit some of the top names in academia, including Marc Tessier-Levigne, a former neurologist at Stanford University, and Andy Chan, a former immunologist at the University of Washington. Mr Levinson believes peer recognition is a key motivator for researchers, and he gives them the opportunity to build a reputation for themselves. Genentech, unlike pharmaceutical companies, encourages employees to publish in-house research work in scientific journals.""At pharmaceuticals, they don't want any of their findings to get out until they've got a patent,"" says Mr Levinson. ""But by that time the work is no longer ground-breaking; no one cares about it any more.""Genentech researchers are told to spend at least 25 per cent of their time on pet projects that may have little to do with overall corporate strategy. Napoleone Ferrara, a Genentechresearcher, stumbled on the mechanism for Avastin while performing experiments of his own choosing.""You don't get 40 motivated people by telling them to get behind someone else's idea,"" says Mr Levinson. ""Hopefully, everyone is working on their own ideas, even if it's just a different aspect of the same project.""Most pharmaceutical companies consider the potential size of markets before they invest in a drug candidate. Mr Levinson says he doesn't care. ""If the science looks good, I'll go after it,"" he says. ""A lot of people thought we were crazy to develop a drug that works only in 20 to 25 per cent of breast cancer patients - Herceptin.""It is a formula that has worked commercially, because patients and doctors are willing to pay for cutting-edge science. Sales of Herceptin are expected to reach more than $500m this year.At the same time, Mr Levinson can be brutal in killing projects he thinks are going nowhere. His presence at the company's weekly science meetings is as much feared as appreciated, because the CEO takes pleasure in asking tough questions. Genentech will not move compounds into the clinic - by far the most expensive phase of drug development at $30m to $100m for each product - until scientific arguments for pursuing the drug are airtight.Genentech's rapid growth has handed Mr Levinson his greatest challenge - keeping a focus on creativity. Headcount which has gone up by about 22 per cent a year for the past two decades, means more time is spent administrating. Mr Levinson communicates with his direct subordinates mostly by e-mail - often on portable wireless devices - to avoid spending time on unnecessary face-to-face meetings.While many executives view a company's geographic expansion with favour, Mr Levinson says he will keep Genentech's research facilities based in San Francisco to minimise travel commitments. ""Most business travel is far less productive than it is meant to be, so I travel less than half as much as my typical colleagues,"" he says. When he does travel, it is usually to attend scientific meetings.Even when discussing issues such as budgets and marketing, Mr Levinson says he thinks like a scientist. ""As scientists, we don't automatically accept anything, even a specific retirement plan or marketing campaign,"" he says. ""This is a highly questioning atmosphere, and that's what makes us successful.""One area Mr Levinson refuses to delegate is recruitment. Hiring new talent is a priority, made more important by Genentech's decentralised approach. ""People who like a hierarchical environment don't do well here,"" says Mr Levinson. ""My job is to get the best scientists in and let them do their thing.""STARS OF SCIENCE GUIDE A SEATTLE STUDENT TO THE CEO SLOT• Born in Seattle, Art Levinson studied at the University of Washington with plans to become an astronomer or a physician. ""Every kid I knew went to the University of Washington. It was the only place I applied, and it never entered my mind to go anywhere else.""• In his junior year a course with Lee Hartwell, the geneticist and Nobel laureate, changed his mind, and he took a PhD in biochemistry at Princeton University.• 1970s: Levinson worked in the University of California lab of Harold Varmus, who later won the Nobel Prize for his work on oncogenes - the genes present in th e cells of humans and other animals that can cause cancer.• 1980: He became one of the first scientists at Genentech, the fledgling biotechnology company. In 1990 he became head of research, and five years later chief executive.• Does he have a hero? ""Maybe Steve Jobs of Apple Computer. He's really an out-of-the-box thinker."" (Levinson serves on Apple's board).

• Career highlight: Levinson cites his work in Varmus's lab which formed the basis for research on Herceptin. ""The success of Avastin [Genentech's colon cancer drug] was pretty good too, because there is a certain pleasure one gets when you defy everyone's expectations, and scepticism on that drug ran high."""
