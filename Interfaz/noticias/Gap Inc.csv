0;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-01-16T22:04:11Z;Gap scraps plans to spin off Old Navy;Retailer blames ‘cost and complexity’ as it does a U-turn on split;Gap has abandoned plans to break itself up and announced another senior executive departure, in another sign of how retailers are struggling with their strategic responses to upheaval in the industry.The New York-listed company, valued at almost $7bn, had laid down plans almost a year ago to separate its Old Navy division from the rest of the group, which includes Banana Republic as well as its namesake brand.However, the retailer said on Thursday that the “cost and complexity” of the proposed separation meant it was no longer worth pursuing. It also said weaker operating results spurred the change of course.The rethink comes just over two months after Art Peck, chief executive, who had championed the split, stepped down. The group has yet to appoint a permanent replacement. On Thursday, the company also said that Neil Fiske, head of the Gap brand, was leaving.The announcements, along with the disclosure that earnings this year would be better than previously expected, sent the company’s shares up as much as 7 per cent in after-hours trading.The idea behind the split was to unlock value at Old Navy, whose value-oriented offering has allowed it to cope better than its stablemates with the pressures in retail. Mr Peck had argued that Old Navy had a different business model to — and its customers had little in common with — the group’s more expensive brands.Investors initially welcomed the plan, pushing the stock up 16 per cent in a single day after it was announced.However, Old Navy’s results have since deteriorated along with those of the wider group. Figures released soon after Mr Peck’s announced departure in November showed the division’s third-quarter like-for-like sales fell 4 per cent compared with the same period a year ago.Wall Street’s enthusiasm about the plan faded, with a succession of analysts questioning the value it would create for shareholders. Since the day-one jump when the company set out the plan, Gap shares had fallen 37 per cent.Robert Fisher, Gap chairman, a member of the company’s founding family who has also been serving as interim chief executive, said on Thursday that the original objectives of the plan “remain relevant”. The preparation work had “shone a bright light on operational inefficiencies” at the group, he said.Directors, he added, were focused on appointing new leadership “with the appropriate experience necessary to lead a portfolio of retail brands and to support our transformation efforts”.Gap said it now expected its full-year earnings ending in February, adjusted for exceptional items, to be “moderately above” its guidance of between $1.70 and $1.75 a share.The upgrade on Thursday, which followed a reduction in earnings forecasts in November, was thanks to less aggressive promotions over the holiday period than the company had expected, particularly at Old Navy.
1;GPS;Gap Inc;2019-11-08T22:16:49Z;Gap: swinger through the wringer;Group being squeezed by fast fashion chains at one end and premium brands at the other;Gap has sent its chief executive Art Peck packing. His departure after just four-and-a-half years should come as no surprise. Mr Peck is just the latest in a line of executives who tried and failed to help the US apparel retailer recapture the magic of its glory days. He is unlikely to be the last.Having defined American casual cool in the 1990s (remember those khaki swing ads?), Gap lost its way in the early 2000s. Over the next 15 years, it cycled through two CEOs. Neither had much in the way of fashion retail experience. Under Mr Peck, the company, which also owns Banana Republic and Old Navy, has continued its downward spiral. Like-for-like sales have failed to grow for four consecutive quarters. Operating margins fell to just 8.2 per cent last year, from 9.6 per cent in 2015. The stock has shed 60 per cent of its value under his tenure.Efforts by Mr Peck to shrink the company’s footprint and cut costs were akin to kicking the can down the road. Neither really addressed the company’s fundamental problems: unappealing clothing and an over-reliance on rampant discounting. Then there are the fashion missteps — like making blazers with armholes not big enough for an average woman.Still the timing of Mr Peck’s departure is not ideal. It comes just as the all-important holiday shopping season gets underway. His exit also puts in doubt the company’s plans to spin-off the better performing Old Navy brand next year. An expectation this will now be scrapped helped drive down the stock’s share price on Friday.Like other mid-tier brands such as J.Crew and Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap is being squeezed by cheaper fast fashion chains at one end and premium brands at the other. The rise of social media and fashion blogs means people want the latest style as soon as they see it. This has benefited the likes of Zara which has a nimbler supply chain.The problem for Gap is that its decline now looks hard to arrest. Whoever ends up replacing Mr Peck will have his or her work cut out.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
2;GPS;Gap Inc;2019-11-07T22:19:19Z;Gap chief to step down as retailer sends profit warning;Company cut its 2019 earnings forecast after comparable sales declined;Gap said on Thursday its chief executive Art Peck would step down, as the retailer struggles to win back customers amid softer sales.Shares in the company dropped more than 8 per cent in after-hours trading, after Gap announced Mr Peck’s departure and warned that its profits this year would be smaller than forecast.Gap, the owner of Banana Republic and Old Navy, has recorded weaker sales in recent quarters with mall traffic on the decline and consumers shifting more of their spending online. Gap said comparable sales — an important metric for retailers — were down 4 per cent in the third quarter, versus Wall Street’s expectations for a 2.2 per cent drop.Robert Fisher, a member of Gap’s founding family who now serves as non-executive chairman, will replace Mr Peck as chief executive on an interim basis following a brief transition period. Mr Peck, who took the helm at Gap in 2015, will also give up his seat on the board.“Under Art’s tenure as CEO, we have made progress investing in capabilities that bode well for the future such as expanding the omnichannel customer experience and building our digital capabilities,” Mr Fisher said in a statement.Gap cut its forecast for full-year earnings to a range of $1.70 to $1.75 per share on an adjusted basis, versus prior guidance for $2.05 to $2.15. Analysts were looking for $2.07.It also projected adjusted earnings per share of between 34 cents and 36 cents in the third quarter, well below analysts’ estimate of 55 cents.The company announced this year it would spin off the better-performing Old Navy to focus on turning around its other stores.Its namesake locations fared worst in the September quarter, with comparable sales down 7 per cent. Comparable sales at Banana Republic and Old Navy slipped 3 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.“This was a challenging quarter, as macro impacts and slower traffic further pressured results that have been hampered by product and operating challenges across key brands,” said Teri List-Stoll, chief financial officer.Gap’s shares have declined nearly 30 per cent on the year.
3;GPS;Gap Inc;2019-08-01T21:41:30Z;US retail stocks slump as Trump widens tariff net;Consumer goods from clothing to electronics are among those facing 10% tariff;More than $20bn was knocked off the value of US retail stocks on Thursday as President Donald Trump’s plans to slap a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods sparked concerns on Wall Street over how the industry would cope.Shares in several of the sector’s biggest names, including electronics chain Best Buy, clothing retailer Gap and department store Kohl’s, closed down more than 7 per cent after the president tweeted that the US would place a 10 per cent levy on another $300bn worth of imports from next month.“This is a much bigger problem” than previous rounds, said Jan Rogers Kniffen, a retail consultant, because the new round would cover a wider range of consumer goods, from clothing to electronics.US retailers have been trying to contain the fallout from the existing tariffs by shifting sourcing and production away from China and pushing suppliers to absorb their share of the costs. However, analysts warned that the latest wave could force them either to raise prices or take a hit to profit margins.Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, said: “Things like sneakers that have avoided the earlier round of tariffs are vulnerable . . . A lot of the things on that list will hit the consumer.”Other stocks particularly hard hit in the market rout included Abercrombie & Fitch, down 11 per cent, American Eagle, down 8 per cent and Macy’s, down 7 per cent. Overall, the S&P 500 retail index was off 1.3 per cent.The new tariff threat comes despite an intense lobbying effort from corporate America to convince the White House to avoid escalating the trade war with Beijing. Retailers were among scores of companies who pleaded in testimony to the Office of the United States Trade Representative last month that their particular products should be excluded.Steve Pasierb, chief executive of The Toy Association, a trade body, had warned that the tariffs would “devastate” his industry. He argued it was unfeasible for members to shift much of their manufacturing outside China given limited facilities in other countries.On Thursday, he added: “Facts, logic, detailed financial explanations, testimony, and first-hand stories from toy company and retail employers here in the United States apparently still cannot prevail over the power of the tweet.”The industry immediately hit out at the announcement, made mid-afternoon in a series of presidential tweets. Matt Priest, head of the trade body Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said in a statement that he was “dismayed” that “political considerations are outweighing economic common sense”.Noting that 70 per cent of shoes sold in the US come from China, Mr Priest added: “This move will noticeably raise the cost of shoes at retail, and will have a chilling effect on hiring in the footwear industry.”Several retailers, including Macy’s, have already warned that annual profits would be put at risk if Mr Trump followed through on his threat to introduce additional tariffs, although the 10 per cent levy he announced on Thursday was smaller than the previously threatened 25 per cent and the president also delayed the start of the tariffs to September 1.Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research for Boston Partners, said the tariffs would further undermine investor confidence in a retail sector that is already under pressure from the relentless rise of Amazon.“This is not good — tariffs are taxes, and they cost,” he said. “There will be more uncertainty about the future and businesses will back off on spending because of trade and growth concerns.”The latest round of tariffs threatened to dent the strong role consumers have played in supporting the US economy, said Nela Richardson, investment strategist for Edward Jones. “The consumer is the pillar of strength. Business confidence is slipping but the consumer is propping up the US economy.”David French, senior vice-president of the National Retail Federation, said: “The administration is doubling-down on a flawed tariff strategy that is already slowing US economic growth, creating uncertainty and discouraging investment.”
4;GPS;Gap Inc;2019-05-30T21:15:39Z;Gap reports sales slump — and its shares slump, too;All three of its brands, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Gap, are shrinking;Gap’s chief executive warned of an “extremely challenging” period for the clothing retailer as weaker-than-forecast sales and a profit warning for the full year sent its shares tumbling 10 per cent.All three of divisions of the company, which is planning to break itself up in an effort to revive its long-declining fortunes, posted falls in quarterly like-for-like sales. It is the latest sign of trouble in US retail, with several big name groups disappointing Wall Street in recent days.The biggest decline was at the eponymous Gap brand, down 10 per cent, yet they also fell 1 per cent at its better-performing Old Navy division and 3 per cent at Banana Republic. Across the group they fell 4 per cent in the three months to the start of May, wider than the 0.9 per cent dip analysts had forecast, according to S&P Capital IQ.Art Peck, chief executive, said in a statement that the company would press ahead with its plan to separate Old Navy from the rest of the group. “This quarter was extremely challenging, and we are not at all satisfied with our results,” he added. “We are committed to improving our execution and performance this year.”Gap’s flagship brand was once synonymous with all-American style but peaked in the 1990s. Shoppers have defected to trendier rivals such as H&M and Zara. The rise of ecommerce has added to the pressure.The San Francisco-based company has shaken up its management and rejigged its product offering as part of a turnround effort, but financial results have continued to underwhelm.Gap said on Thursday it now expected diluted earnings per share for the year to come in between $2.04 and $2.14. Three months earlier it forecast $2.11 to $2.26.Net sales in the first quarter fell 2 per cent from last year to $3.7bn. Lower expenses helped net income improve from $164m last time to $227m.Shares in the Gap, which have lost 56 per cent of their value since 2014 highs, shed another 10 per cent in after-hours trading.
5;GPS;Gap Inc;2019-04-09T19:43:53Z;Gap CEO gets pay raise amid retailer’s struggles;;Gap chief executive Arthur Peck received a 33 per cent increase in compensation last year, even as the retailer’s stock floundered.Mr Peck received about $20.8m in 2018, including a 9.3 per cent pay raise to $1.5m and stock awards of $15.1m — more than double the previous year’s amount. His compensation totalled $15.6m in 2018.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gap also said chief financial officer Teri List-Stoll’s total compensation in 2019 more than doubled to $7.5m, while Mark Breitbard, president and chief executive of Banana Republic, saw his compensation slip to $4.8m from $7.3m.Shares in Gap lost nearly a quarter of their value last year as a decline in sales at the group’s namesake brick-and-mortar chain worried investors. The San Francisco-based company said comparable sales at Gap locations dropped 5 per cent year-over-year in fiscal 2018. Comparable sales across the company were flat, with Banana Republic and Old Navy showing gains. Total revenue and earnings also grew, aided by higher online sales.Gap announced in February it would split the company into two, separating the better-performing Old Navy from its other brands. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2020. Shares rallied 16 per cent a day after the news but are still flat on the year.

7;GPS;Gap Inc;2019-02-28T21:47:41Z;Gap reveals plans to split in two;Shares leap 25% on separation of better-performing Old Navy division from laggards;Gap laid down plans on Thursday to break itself up, separating Old Navy from the rest of the group, showing the lengths to which retailers are going to stay in investors’ favour as changing shopper habits upend the industry.Shares in the clothing retailer leapt by 25 per cent in after-hours trading to $31.74, after the near-$10bn market capitalisation company disclosed plans to spin off Gap, Banana Republic and other assets from the better-performing Old Navy division.Gap’s flagship brand was once synonymous with all-American style but peaked in the 1990s. Shoppers have defected to trendier rivals such as H&M, Zara and Uniqlo. The rise of ecommerce has added to the pressure.Pursuing a separation is the most compelling path forward for our brandsThe company, based in San Francisco, has shaken up its management and rejigged its product offering in an effort to revive its fortunes. But financial results have continued to underwhelm.Figures on Thursday showed like-for-like sales at the Gap division dropped 5 per cent last year. About 230 Gap stores are to be closed over the next two years.The group has found more success with the budget Old Navy business, whose annual sales of $8bn compare with $9bn for the company’s other brands combined. Founded in 1994 and named after a bar in Paris, Old Navy operates more than 1,000 stores. Like-for-like sales rose 3 per cent last year.The remaining company will include Gap, Banana Republic and several other brands, and will be renamed after the separation. Art Peck, chief executive, will run the new entity while Sonia Syngal, who heads Old Navy, will lead the brand once it is a standalone company.Robert Fisher, chairman, said in a statement that “pursuing a separation is the most compelling path forward for our brands — creating two separate companies with distinct financial profiles, tailored operating priorities and unique capital allocation strategies”.Shareholders will receive shares in both NewCo and Old Navy in equal proportion. The transaction is not expected to complete until next year.
8;GPS;Gap Inc;2018-08-24T16:50:28Z;Victoria’s Secret/Gap: underwired, overplayed;Rebranding might help inject a modicum of freshness;Recent television reboots of Murphy Brown, Roseanne and Full House are feeding into nostalgia for 1990s television in America. Little such sentimentality exists, however, for American fashion. The downward spiral of L Brands, parent company of lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, continued this week.Victoria’s Secret, L Brands’s largest unit, reported that like-for-like sales at its physical stores fell 5 per cent in the second quarter. That, even after sales in the same quarter in 2017 were down 11 per cent on the previous year. Its shares have fallen 70 per cent in the past three years as the problems become clearer.Style tycoon Les Wexner made Victoria’s Secret into a symbol of glam but accessible sexiness. Younger women now prefer the practicality and prices of upstart brands, leaving L Brands’s heyday a distant memory.L Brands has done its best to keep up. It created a Pink line for younger women. But the inertia of physical stores and its established brand are an anchor. By cutting capex, the company has been able to keep its dividend, but the yield has jumped to 7 per cent, signalling the payout is tenuous.Gap, another ’90s legend, has its own problems. Second-quarter comparable sales fell 5 per cent. Since hitting a low in May of 2016, its shares are up 60 per cent. The difference? Gap’s biggest banner is now chic cheap brand Old Navy, whose revenue is 60 per cent greater and operating margin multiples higher than Gap’s.Jefferies analysts note that even with such momentum, Gap and L Brands trade at roughly the same earnings multiple of 11 times. A reasonable sum of the parts valuation puts Gap’s total value 50 per cent higher than its price currently. Perhaps investors are not attuned to the different sides of the business given that it shares its name with the weakest unit. A rebranding would inject a modicum of freshness.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.
9;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
10;GPS;Gap Inc;2018-08-24T15:40:35Z;Gap shares fall 11% on flagship brand woes;;Gap shares tumbled on Friday after retailer’s latest results showed that its namesake brand continues to flounder, with sales falling more than expected.Shares in the San Francisco-based company were down as much as 12 per cent to $28.60, before trimming that decline to 11.1 per cent at pixel time, and on track for their worst day since May 2018.The fall came after the retailer said late Thursday that comparable store sales in its Gap brand fell 5 per cent in the second quarter, steeper than the 2.6 per cent slide that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had predicted.On Gap’s earnings call chief executive Art Peck said the brand’s performance was “unacceptable”. The company said the drop reflected “a conscious choice to optimise margin dollars as we continue to manage through inventory” and added “quarter by quarter, we expect performance to improve and we believe the worst is behind us”.However, the size of the miss disappointed Wall Street and even prompted Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies to write, “Dear BOD [Board of Directors] . . . please change the name of the company to Old Navy”.Old Navy, the retailer’s largest division, has remained the bright spot in Gap’s portfolio. Mr Konik, who retained his “buy” rating on the stock, added that better than expected earnings and reaffirmed guidance show: the Gap brand doesn’t matter”.Including Friday’s dorp, Gap shares are now down 16 per cent year-to-date.
11;GPS;Gap Inc;2018-08-23T21:02:37Z;Gap brand sales sputter, sending shares lower;Retailer’s total revenues top view, fuelled by Old Navy;Retailer Gap on Thursday said its revenues topped Wall Street’s view, driven by Old Navy, while sales at its namesake brand continued to slip.Comparable sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, rose 2 per cent across the company, exceeding analyst estimates for a 1.5 per cent increase, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.At its Old Navy brand, the company’s largest division, comparable sales rose 5 per cent and at Banana Republic, they rose 2 per cent. However, its Gap brand saw comparable sales fall 5 per cent.Net sales rose 8 per cent from a year ago to $4.1bn, ahead of analyst estimates. Old Navy proved to be the bright spot once again, with overall revenues at the brand rising more than 13 per cent to nearly $2bn.The Gap brand has struggled to revive sales and in June tapped former Billabong chief executive Neil Fiske as its global head. His predecessor Jeff Kirwan had overhauled the brand’s operating model to make it more nimble and responsive to consumer preferences.Gap and other retailers have been competing against fast fashion names like Zara and H&M and online competitors like Amazon, which are growing their fashion and clothing offerings, to lure in customers. Stores that sell basics like T-shirts and denim have also faced increasing competition from athletic clothes makers as consumers embrace the athleisure trend, swapping out denim for tights and yoga pants.That is part of the reason that the retailer’s store openings have been focused on Old Navy and Athleta, its workout brand, while its closures have weighted towards Gap and Banana Republic stores.“We delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth, led by the strength of Old Navy,” said chief executive Art Peck. “Our balanced growth strategy supports continued growth and improved profitability, and our investments are focused on leveraging the advantages of our scaled operating platform and accelerating the impact of our significant data assets.”In the thirteen weeks ended August 4, the company reported net income of $297m, up from $271m in the year-ago quarter. That translated to earnings of 76 cents a share, compared with 68 cents a share in the prior year quarter and exceeded analyst projections of 72 cents.Looking ahead, the company affirmed its outlook for full-year earnings between $2.55 to $2.70 a share and comparable sales to be flat to up slightly.Gap shares, which are down nearly 5 per cent year-to-date, fell 7 per cent in after-hours trade.
12;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Gap taps Billabong executive as global brand chief;;US retailer Gap has named Neil Fiske, the recently departed chief executive of Australian surf and beachwear retailer Billabong, as the new global head of its namesake brand.Mr Fiske will formally take the reins at the Gap brand on June 20, reporting to Gap president and chief executive Art Peck.Mr Peck said in a statement:“Neil brings significant retail and apparel experience to Gap Inc. and a track record of transforming and repositioning brands. He is an experienced leader who deeply understands the mechanics of this business, the value of an omnichannel strategy, and the need to build a progressive and relevant brand. I believe Neil is the right leader to strengthen Gap brand.”Mr Fiske left Billabong in April, where he had served as chief executive since 2013. He has also had stints at retailers including Eddie Bauer and Bath and Body Works.He said in a statement: “Gap is a truly iconic brand that is loved by its customers across the globe, and I am excited about the significant opportunity ahead for us. The brand has made some important progress and I look forward to working with the team to drive improved performance, operational excellence, great merchandising, and distinctive and powerful marketing.”Mr Fiske’s predecessor, Jeff Kirwan, left the company in February. While Gap has made some progress in its effort to slow sliding sales across its retail portfolio — which includes Old Navy and Banana Republic — its eponymous brand has remained challenged, amid changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. The company said last month it expects Gap global comparable sales to fall 4 per cent this year.Gap shares, which rose 51.7 per cent last year, are down 5.4 per cent so far in 2018. The shares were flat in after-hours trading at $32.23.
13;GPS;Gap Inc;2018-05-24T20:59:12Z;Gap earnings, sales miss as namesake brand weighs;;Gap shares fell sharply in extended trade after the retailer reported weaker than expected same-store sales in the first quarter, dragged down by its namesake brand, and earnings that missed analyst expectations.Shares in the retailer behind Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and Gap fell as much as 11 per cent before trimming their losses to trade 8 per cent lower at $30.35 on Thursday evening. The retailer said overall same-store sales, a gauge of performance in stores open at least 12 months, rose 1 per cent in the first quarter. While that marked the sixth straight quarter of same-store sales growth, it was below the 1.67 per cent increase that analysts had forecast.Same-store sales declined 4 per cent at the Gap brand. They were up 3 per cent at both its Banana Republic brand and Old Navy, the retailer’s largest division.Total sales rose 6 per cent from a year ago to $3.8bn when excluding the impact of new revenue recognition standards. That was ahead of analyst expectations for $3.6bn.Net income rose to $164m, or 42 cents a share, compared with $143m, or 36 cents a share, in the year-ago period. That missed expectations for earnings of 46 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The company also said its gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 37.7 per cent. Excluding the new revenue recognition standard, margins fell 120 basis points from a year ago to 36.7 per cent.Gap, like other retailers, has suffered amid a decline in mall traffic and rising competition from online retailers. Its more affordable Old Navy brand was successfully revived by former brand head Stefan Larsson, and its Athleta brand has benefited from the athleisure trend that has popularised wearing work out clothes outside the gym.Gap’s efforts to refresh products at its underperforming brands have yielded mixed results. The retailer is reducing the number of Gap and Banana Republic stores while expanding its more successful Old Navy business, opening 60 new stores across North America this year.The retailer affirmed its full-year diluted earings per share outlook in the range of $2.55 to $2.70 a share, compared with analyst estimates for $2.60 a share.Gap shares are down 3.1 per cent year-to-date.
14;GPS;Gap Inc;2018-02-20T17:18:40Z;Gap shares decline after brand chief departs;;Gap shares fell on Tuesday after the retailer said the president and chief executive of its eponymous brand will leave the company.Shares in the San Francisco-based company tumbled as much as 7.6 per cent to $30.75 before trimming those losses to trade down about 3.5 per cent. The moves come after the retailer behind brands including Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta said Jeff Kirwan would be leaving the company.Mr Kirwan took the reins at the Gap brand in December 2014 — a move orchestrated by Gap Inc’s chief executive Art Peck — and helped overhaul its operating model to become faster and more responsive to consumer preferences while shrinking its store fleet. However, the brand has struggled to revive sales, with like-for-like sales declining on a quarterly basis for much of the last four years.“While I am pleased with our progress in brand health and product quality, we have not achieved the operational excellence and accelerated profit growth that we know is possible at Gap brand,” Mr Peck said. “As we move into the brand’s next phase of development, Jeff and I agreed it was an appropriate time for a change in leadership.”Retailers have struggled to lure customers to their stores as mall traffic has declined amid a surge in online shopping. They also face competition from fast-fashion brands like H&M and Zara that mimic runway looks quickly and at lower costs. Their troubles were compounded by the rise of athleisure as Americans increasingly swapped denim for more comfortable athletic gear.Gap is currently looking for a new president. Brent Hyder, current executive vice-president of global talent and sustainability at Gap, will oversee the brand.

Analysts with Wells Fargo noted that lower inventory levels heading into the weekend allowed retailers to rein in some of the intense discounting that has weighed on the industry.“Adding a little more fuel to the fire, we believe Black Friday Week was a success that should give investors a little more confidence as we move deeper into the holiday,” said Ike Boruchow, an analyst with the bank. Mr Boruchow, citing ShopperTrak data, that noted foot traffic at malls declined by the least since 2013.The S&P 500 retail index rose as much as 1.3 per cent on Monday to 1,676.53, a new all-time record, before paring its advance to 0.6 per cent. For the year, the index has climbed 24 per cent, outpacing the broader S&P 500. Much of the gains this year have been propelled by companies like Amazon, although Gap, Best Buy and Home Depot are also up more than 25 per cent.Susan Anderson, an analyst with B. Riley FBR, said that customer traffic in Victoria’s Secret, American Eagle Outfitters and Gap-owned Old Navy were among the best she viewed at a mall over the weekend.“We think Thanksgiving-Black Friday was strong even though it continued to be diluted by online sales and earlier sales that began in early November and heightened the weekend before Black Friday,” Ms Anderson added.The advances follow a difficult year for traditional retailers, with many stores labouring under high debt burdens as the threat from online competitors intensifies. Online shopping is expected to eclipse $100bn in sales during the crucial US holiday shopping season this year, according to Adobe Analytics, a 14 per cent jump from the year prior. GBH Insights, a market research firm, estimates that Amazon has captured 45 to 50 per cent of ecommerce sales so far this holiday season.Total sales for the industry over the holiday period are projected to rise by as much as 4 per cent, to $682bn, according to the National Retail Federation.The rise by retailers on Monday contrasted with a tepid day for the broader market, with the S&P 500 flat at 2,601.85. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent lower at 6,877.75 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 23,588.30.
16;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Gap shares sitting pretty after forecast boost;;Gap shares jumped higher in after-hours trading on Thursday after the US retailer lifted its earnings forecast following sales growth that exceeded analysts’ expectations.The company — which operates clothing stores under the Banana Republic, Old Navy and namesake Gap brands — on Thursday said that comparable sales — a key industry metric — rose 3 per cent in the third quarter. That’s a significant reversal from the 1 per cent decline it saw in the same period last year, and better than the 1.3 per cent gain that analysts surveyed by Factset were expecting.Among its brands, Old Navy comparable sales saw a 4 per cent gain, level with last year’s rise, while Gap increased 1 per cent, versus a 4 per cent drop last year. Banana Republic also staunched some of its bleeding, dropping 1 per cent compared to last year’s 6 per cent slide.Gap said it was the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth, a welcome trend as it looks to shore up its performance amid a challenging environment for retailers.Net sales rose to $3.84bn in the quarter, compared to $3.80bn in the year-ago period. Analysts had been looking for $3.7bn in revenue.Net income of $229m trumped expectations for a $213m profit, while diluted earnings per share of 58 cents beat out predictions for 54 cents.The gains prompted Gap to boost its forecast. It is now looking for GAAP earnings per share of $2.18 to $2.22 for 2017, and has raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.08 to $2.12, versus previous forecasts for $2.02 to $2.10.Gap shares were up more than 7 per cent in after-hours trading.
17;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-09-12T17:30:25Z;Old Navy is the undervalued ‘crown jewel’ in Gap’s fleet: Jefferies;;Old Navy is set to buoy its parent company Gap higher.Analysts at Jefferies raised their price target on Gap shares from $35 to $39 on Tuesday, after the company’s announcement last week that it was going to boost investment in the fastest growing parts of its business — including value-focused family-friendly apparel chain Old Navy, athleisure gear line Athleta and its e-commerce platforms — and trimming back the footprint of its low-growth Banana Republic and flagship Gap lines.For the first time in its history, Gap recently divulged margins within its collection of divisions — and “what’s clear is Old Navy is generating ~3/4 of profits”, the Jefferies note said.“This data point is seminal when considering the entire org(anisation) is valued like (the) Gap division drives the bus”, when that division only accounts for roughly 7 per cent of profits currently, Jefferies analysts wrote.The company said it has 1,051 Old Navy stores and 834 Gap stores in North America as of end of July.With the strategic focus shift, the Old Navy “powerhouse” has a path to becoming a $10bn chain, given its “compelling value leadership” and “mid-teens margins” — and the fact that its larger format stores are generally less tied to shopping malls, where foot traffic has been falling.Wall Street is still too focused on the performance of the namesake Gap line and not enough on the “crown jewel” of Old Navy, Jefferies analysts concluded — leaving its shares undervalued, particularly if the strategic shift pays off.Last week’s announcement pushed Gap shares to their best one-day gain in 11 months.. On Tuesday, after the thumbs-up from Jefferies, its shares rose another 7.3 per cent, bringing its total year-to-date gains to 24.5 per cent — a welcome bounce for a company that has been battered by broader retail headwinds as the sector adapts to shifting customer habits.Charts courtesy of Jefferies
18;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-09-06T19:40:31Z;Gap poised for best day in 11 months on plans to add stores;;Investors are stocking up on Gap after the retailer said it will shift focus to growth opportunities, including improved online shopping options and new stores for its fastest-growing brands, while also closing underperforming Banana Republic and Gap stores.Gap shares rose more than 7 per cent on Wednesday after the announcement, putting them on track for the biggest one-day gain since October 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.It’s a vote of confidence from Wall Street for the US-based company, which has been working to shore up sales amid tough times for retailers, which are confronting falling mall foot traffic, pressure from online shopping and competition from fast-fashion retailers like H&M and Zara.Gap chief executive and president Art Peck said in a statement on Wednesday that Gap has “made significant process evolving how we operate” over the past two years. “With much of this foundation in place, we’re now shifting our focus to growth. We will leverage our iconic brands and significant scale to deliver growth by shifting to where our customers are shopping — online, value and active.”Gap will “accelerate work” on its digital channels, including the planned rollout of a buy-online, pick-up in store service, as well as new ways to personalise online shoppers’ experience.It is also planning to open about 270 new stores over the next three years, focused primarily on its Old Navy family-friendly apparel brand and Athleta, which sells activewear. Over the next few years, Gap said it expects Old Navy sales to top $10bn and Athleta to climb to $1bn.At the same time, it is aiming to close 200 underperforming locations for Banana Republic and its namesake Gap brands.Although its shares have taken a hit amid the retail downturn over the past several years, Gap has shown some glimmers of hope over the past few months. It lifted its full-year outlook last month after posting better-than-expected second quarter results, led by Old Navy, while sales growth at Gap and Banana Republic contracted less than analysts had expected.Over the past year, its shares have risen 9.9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
19;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-09-01T20:28:13Z;Lululemon shares regain vigour in better day for retailers;Shares of the once-high flying maker of yoga pants helped by stronger sales;Have US retailers finally hit the bottom? It is a question at the top of investors’ minds as shares of some of the country’s largest apparel retailers climbed following stronger-than-expected results at Lululemon, as well as an analyst upgrade of venerable brand Gap on Friday.Lululemon, the maker of leggings and crop tops favoured by the Soul Cycle set, eclipsed Wall Street profit expectations in its second quarter, sending its shares 7.2 per cent higher to close at $61.68.The company, which at one point was valued at nearly $12bn, said profits fell 9 per cent from a year earlier to $48.7m, or 36 cents a share, in the three months to the end of July. Earnings per share beat analysts’ expectations by a penny.Despite the drop in profits, sales jumped nearly 13 per cent from a year earlier as same-store sales — a key industry metric — increased 7 per cent. The gains were driven by a rise in revenues from its website, which benefited from a warehouse sale during the quarter.“Lululemon put up very respectable growth in [the] second quarter, especially against what is a crowded landscape and a maturing cycle,” said Michael Lasser, an analyst with UBS. “Strength across geographies and key segments suggests Lululemon’s digital reimaging is gaining traction.”Gap shares gained 2.7 per cent to $24.25 after analysts with Citi upgraded their view on the company to “neutral” from “sell”, citing the company’s roughly 4 per cent dividend yield as a key reason to support the stock.“Concerns of a slowdown at Old Navy now appear more priced in” to the stock, said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. “And we can’t overlook that Old Navy results have been better than we expected as value continues to win.”Separately, shares of Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands rose 3.4 per cent to $37.46 on Friday after the company said same-store sales fell 4 per cent in August, in-line with Wall Street forecasts.“We like the improvement in Victoria’s Secret comp and merchandise margin and expect same-store sales to continue to improve as we cycle the swim and apparel exit and bralette ramp,” said Susan Anderson, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. “We believe L Brands’ solid brands continue to resonate well with consumers and expect more normalised results in [the] second half once these pressures ease.”Overall, apparel retailers in the S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent on Friday. Shares of Foot Locker climbed 3.2 per cent on the day to $36.34, Express advanced 4.7 per cent to $6.67 and Guess gained 4.1 per cent to $15.99.The retail sector has found itself vulnerable to a growing list of short sellers who believe a further wave of consolidation is still to come, after bankruptcies in 2017 surpassed last year’s total.The S&P 500 and Dow both rose 0.2 per cent to 2,476 and 21,987, respectively, while the Nasdaq nudged up 0.1 per cent to 6,435.
20;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-08-17T20:50:16Z;Gap shares back in fashion after rosier outlook, earnings beat;;Gap shares surged in extended trading after the retailer mounting a turnaround posted better-than-expected second quarter results, led by Old Navy, and lifted its full-year earnings outlook.Shares in the San Francisco-based company surged as much as 16 per cent before paring those gains to trade 6 per cent higher after reported that comparable sales, a measure of sales in stores that have been open at least 12 months, rose 1 per cent. That represented the third straight quarter of positive comparable sales growth but was slower than the 2 per cent growth posted in the first quarter.Gap, like other clothing retailers, has struggled to stave off competition from online retailers and fast fashion rivals — like Zara and H&M that copy runway looks at a fraction of the cost — and lure shoppers back to its stores. Moreover, a string of fashion misses at its Banana Republic had also eroded sales at the brand.Comparable sales rose 5 per cent at Old Navy, the retailer’s largest division, topping expectations for a 3.1 per cent gain. Meanwhile, same-store sales slid 1 at the Gap Global brand and 5 per cent at Banana Republic, compared with Wall Street estimates for a drop of 2.2 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively.Net sales slid 1.3 per cent from a year ago to $3.79bn, just ahead of analysts estimates of $3.77bn.Net income rose to $271m or 68 cents a share in the three months ended July 29, compared with $125m or 31 cents a share in the year ago period, which reflected a 29 cents charge associated with restructuring plans. Stripping out a 10 cent benefit from insurance proceeds related to the fire that occurred on the company’s Fishkill distribution center campus, earnings of 58 cents in the second quarter were better than expectations of 52 cents.That came as the company noted a fourth straight quarter of gross margin expansion, which improved to 38.9 per cent, from 37.7 per cent in the year ago period.“With a third consecutive quarter of comp sales growth, we are seeing our investments in product, customer experience, and brand equity begin to pay off,” Art Peck, chief executive, said.And following the “strength” of the first half the company raised its adjusted full-year earnings outlook to a range of $2.02 to $2.10 a share, up from its previous projection of $1.95 to $2.05 a share. That was above the $2 a share that Wall Street had forecast.Gap shares are up 1.1 per cent so far this year having tumbled nearly 50 per cent in the prior 2 years.
21;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-08-01T12:10:50Z;Under Armour launches restructuring after posting quarterly loss;;Shares in Under Armour tumbled nearly 9 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the sportswear maker reported its second straight quarter of losses and launched a major restructuring plan that would slice its 2017 operating profit by half.The Maryland-based company also lowered its full year sales expectations amid tough trading conditions in its important North American market.Under Armour, which rose to prominence on the back of its sneakers partnership with NBA superstar Stephen Curry, has struggled over the past year as the so-called athleisure trend in which sportswear is worn outside of the gym fades.This shift in consumer shopping habit comes even as Under Armour has to contend with an ever growing number of new entrants in the sportswear market. Alongside traditional rivals such as Nike, Adidas and Lululemon, general retailers like Gap and Old Navy have also been making an aggressive push into atlethicwear with their own lines of high tech joggers and sportsbras.Analysts have also expressed concern that Under Armour spends too much in relation to the revenue it generates – a point that was underscored by the company’s latest results.For the three months to end of June, net revenue rose nearly 9 per cent to $1.08bn, slightly ahead of the $1.07bn the market was expecting. However sharply higher operating costs pushed Under Armour into a loss of $12.3m for the quarter, compared to a profit of $6.3m in the prior year period.In a bid to turn things around, the company said on Tuesday that it will overhaul its business to better respond to shifting consumer tastes and build up its online strategy.“We are utilizing 2017 to ensure that operations across our diverse portfolio of sport categories, distribution channels and geographies are optimised as we are building a stronger, faster and smarter company,” said chief executive Kevin Plank.As a result of the revamp, which will result in $110m-$130m of pre-tax charges, the company now expects operating income for the year to come in between $160m-180m, compared to its previous forecast of $320m.Earnings per share in 2017 will be between 18 cents to 21 cents, compared to the 42 cents analysts had projected.Net revenues meanwhile are expected to grow 9-11 per cent versus the previous expectation of 11-12 per cent growth, “reflecting moderation in the company’s North American business.”
22;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-06-05T23:31:08Z;J Crew’s long-time chief executive to step down;Move by Mickey Drexler comes two months after struggling group’s creative lead departed;Mickey Drexler, J Crew’s long-time chief executive, is stepping down as the maker of preppy knits and oxford shirts struggles to stay relevant with modern shoppers.The 72-year-old retail veteran, who has been credited with transforming companies like Gap and J Crew into American staples through the past two decades, is to be succeeded by James Brett, former president of retail store West Elm, the clothing company said on Monday. The move comes just two months after the departure of Jenna Lyons, J Crew’s high-profile creative lead, and as the company looks to revive sluggish sales in a cut-throat retail environment. Mr Drexler, who led the New York-based company for 14 years, wanted to step away from daily operations and the company began searching for a successor last year, according to someone familiar with the matter. “This is an exciting time for J Crew as we continue to make significant changes to position our company for long-term success,” said Mr Drexler, who will retain his chairman title and who owns about 10 per cent of the company. He told WWD, a trade publication: “I am relaxed-ish . . . I thought it was time to move on.” I am relaxed-ish . . . I thought it was time to move onThe son of a garment buyer, Mr Drexler joined J Crew in 2003 and has spent nearly four decades working for retail companies, including Gap, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s.Mr Brett will take over as chief executive in July and also join J Crew’s board of directors. He has been president at West Elm, a subsidiary of Williams-Sonoma, since 2010. He has also held roles at retailers including Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and JC Penney. The leadership changes come as the retailer, which is backed by TPG Capital and Leonard Green, looks to restructure its debt and boost sales. J Crew reported a 3 per cent decline in total revenues last year, while like-for-like sales, a closely watched metric, slid 7 per cent. J Crew’s sales have slowed after its shift to more high-fashion garb failed to appeal to its customer base. The company also faces a challenge to stay relevant as shoppers move online to Amazon, and fast-fashion stores such as H&M mimic runway looks at a cheaper cost. The company is projecting total revenue for the year to be either down or up in a low-single digit percentage range, and comparable store sales overall and at J Crew locations to decline within a range of mid- to low-single digits.J Crew in April said it would cut 250 jobs across its corporate headquarters.
23;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-05-19T20:40:39Z;Foot Locker feels the squeeze on slowing sales;S&P 500 and Dow rebound after rocky week for equities;Foot Locker shares were under the gun on Friday after the US-based athletic-footwear chain failed to regain lost ground on sales and profits following a slow start last quarter.The company’s shares fell 16.7 per cent to $58.72 on Friday, after it said sales in March and April failed to fully offset a sluggish February, which it attributed to a later-than-usual disbursement of income-tax refunds that delayed shoppers’ ability to splurge on the latest releases of trainers.Richard Johnson, chief executive, described the three months ending April 29 as a “roller-coaster ride” for the company, which until recently has managed to avoid the worst of the retail slump thanks to younger consumers’ taste for trendy trainers. Last month, however, it issued a surprise profit warning after February comparable-store sales — a key industry metric — declined in the low-teen percentage range, Mr Johnson said during a call with investors.February is typically one of its best months, and although sales rebounded moderately in March and April, it was not enough to fully offset the slow start, translating to a rise of just 0.5 per cent during the quarter, Mr Johnson said. With sales continuing to trend below expectations, Mr Johnson said that the company was now expecting second-quarter comparable sales to be up in the low single digits, with earnings per share remaining relatively flat compared with the same period a year earlier.“While we remain optimistic that we can accelerate our momentum over the second half of 2017 to reach mid-single digit comparable sales gains, we are developing a plan B, so to speak, to pace the recent sales trends,” Mr Johnson said.The company’s revenue for the quarter came in at $2bn, largely in line with expectations and a 0.7 per cent improvement over last year’s first quarter. Profit, however, fell short of expectations, at $180m, or $1.36 a share, versus the $191m and $1.39 a share reported during the year-ago period.Mr Johnson said that while the first quarter was one of its most profitable ever, “it did fall short of our original expectations”.The results show that Foot Locker is not immune from the malaise that has afflicted many US retailers over the past quarter, particularly those that still rely heavily on brick-and-mortar stores.After a grim few weeks for the sector, the news hasn’t been all bad, after San Francisco-based Gap reported late on Thursday a 2 per cent jump in like-for-like sales during the three months to the end of April. This compares with the 5 per cent drop recorded in the prior year and handily beat expectations for an 0.2 per cent decline.The company — which operates its namesake Gap stores among others — was boosted by Old Navy, its largest division. Same-store sales at Old Navy rose 8 per cent, although it was the sole bright spot, with sales at Gap and its upmarket Banana Republic brand both declining 4 per cent. While the company’s shares ticked up in after-hours trading on Thursday night, investors tempered their enthusiasm and sent the stock down 3.9 per cent to $22.28 on Friday.At the close of trade Wall Street had made gains as investors took a welcome breather following a wild week of political news that prompted a midweek sell-off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 20,804, and the S&P 500 also gained 0.7 per cent to 2,381. The Nasdaq ticked up 0.5 per cent to 6,083.
24;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-05-18T20:56:37Z;Old Navy helps Gap buck wider retail slump;;Old Navy continues to be lone bright spot for Gap, with a strong sales gain at the low-cost label powering the group to a first-quarter sales and profits beat.The San Francisco-based company, which also owns the Gap and Banana Republic chains, reported a 2 per cent jump in like-for-like sales during the three months to end of April. This compares to the 5 per cent drop recorded in the prior year and handily trounced expectations for a 0.2 per cent decline.Shares in the company jumped 6 per cent in after-market trading before trimming some of those gains to trade up 2.4 per cent.Demand for $6 sunglasses and $15 halter tops helped drive same-store sales up 8 per cent during the quarter at Old Navy, the company’s largest division. By contrast, the company continues to struggle to revive growth at its flagship Gap stores and its more upmarket brand Banana Republic. Same-store sales at the two chains both fell 4 per cent during the period.Still the gains at Old Navy were enough to help total group revenue eke out a slight gain to $3.44bn compared to last year. Net income, meanwhile, climbed to $143m, or 36 cents a share, from $127m, or 32 cents a year in the year-ago period.The market had expected a revenue drop to $3.39bn and net income of $116m, or 29 cents a share.“We are pleased with our positive comp and earnings growth this quarter,” said chief executive Art Peck. “We’ve made substantial improvements in product quality and fit, and our increasing responsive capabilities are enabling us to better react to trends and demand.”Gap’s out-performance comes amid a trying time for the retail sector, which is facing an unprecedented period of upheaval thanks to declining mall traffic, shifting consumer shopping habits and intense price competition from online stores and off-price retailers.Macy’s and Kohl’s kicked off a disappointing quarter for department stores when they reported results last week, while Ann Taylor owner Ascena Retail issued a profit warning this week amid collapsing sales.By contrast, big-box retailers that have been aggressively investing in their online businesses have fared better, with both Target and Walmart posting earnings that came in above expectations.Mr Peck cautioned on Thursday that the retail environment remains “challenging”. However, the company reiterated its full-year earnings guidance.
25;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-04-04T17:28:58Z;Gap CEO Art Peck’s compensation up 45% in 2016;;It’s nice to be a CEO.Gap’s chief executive Art Peck received $8.9m in total compensation in fiscal 2016, up 45 per cent from $6.1m the previous year, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And his 2015 pay was up nearly 75 per cent from the prior year.That comes as Gap shares fell 41 per cent in 2015 and 9.2 per cent last year, as retailers have struggled to fend off competition from online retailers and fast fashion names like H&M and Zara.Tuesday’s filing showed that Mr Peck’s base salary rose about 2 per cent to $1.3m last year, while his stock and option awards combined increased by about 37 per cent from a year ago. Mr Peck, a company veteran who was appointed chief executive two years ago, also received $917,511 in non-equity incentive plan compensation.Under his leadership the retailer has shuttered stores, dismissed its creative heads and in the last quarter, returned to sales growth. Gap now expects comparable sales to be flat to up slightly in 2017, after falling 2 per cent last year and 7 per cent the year before that. But sales at Banana Republic continue to suffer and the retailer is benefitting from easier comparisons.Shareholders have often bristled at sweetened remuneration packages for CEO’s heading companies that are struggling to right the ship. Recently, Canadian drugmaker Valeant gave its CEO Joe Papa $62.7m in compensation for 8 months on the job, while Pearson chief John Fallon’s pay rose 20 per cent last year despite a record loss for the publisher and former owner of the FT.

Mr Breitbard had also served as chief creative officer of Old Navy and held other leadership positions at Levi Strauss and Abercrombie & Fitch.Mr Breitbard will replace Andi Owen who left the company last month. Mr Peck announced Ms Owen’s departure in January, noting that she had helped improve the brand’s aesthetic and product quality but that there was “significant work to do in order to consistently win with customers” and that both agreed that “now was an appropriate time for a change in leadership”The appointment comes as Gap is trying to revive sales at Banana Republic, its smallest division, that has been hamstrung by a string of product misses. While like-for-like sales at Gap rose 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, they fell 7 per cent in its Banana Republic division.Gap like other clothing retailers has been hurt by rising competition from online retailers like Amazon and fast-fashion names like H&M and Zara that mimic runway looks for a fraction of the cost. Shares fell more than 46 per cent between 2015 and 2016.The company managed to post its first quarterly revenue growth in eight in the final three months of 2016 and has seen its shares advance nearly 6 per cent year-to-date.
27;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-02-23T21:48:13Z;Gap shares perk up as it aims to reverse sales slowdown in 2017;;Will 2017 be the year that US retailer Gap gets back to growth?The company saw its shares rise 1 per cent in after-hours trading after it said it expects comparable sales, a key industry metric, to be flat to up slightly in 2017, after falling 2 per cent in 2016 — and 7 per cent the year before that.Over the past few years, Gap — like many mall-based retailers that rely heavily on foot traffic — have been losing ground to fast-fashion retailers like H&M and Zara and online retailers like Amazon.But recently it has been focused “on improving the quality and relevance of our products, increasing our responsiveness to trends and demand, and creating more synergy across channels to deliver the experiences our customers want and expect, however they choose to shop,” said chief executive Art Peck.That has led to a strong finish for 2016, including during the critical holiday shopping season, Mr Peck said in unveiling the company’s earnings for the three-month period ending January 28.Over the past quarter, comparable sales were up 2 per cent, compared with a 7 per cent decline the year before, and revenue clocked in at $4.43bn, a 1 per cent improvement over the same period a year earlier. Earnings per share were 55 cents, and net income was $220m.For fiscal year 2017, Gap said it expects earnings per share to come in at $1.95-$2.05, an improvement over the $1.69 it posted for FY 2016. However, it warned that net sales could be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations, particularly as the US dollar gather strength.Gap shares have fallen more than 10 per cent over the past 12 months.
28;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-02-06T22:16:47Z;Upbeat guidance gives Gap shares a lift;;Gap shares were back in vogue on Monday after the retailer behind Old Navy and Banana Republic lifted its outlook for fourth quarter earnings above Wall Street’s estimates.The San Francisco-based company said it expects to report adjusted full-year earnings in the range of $2.01 to $2.02 a share, above its previous expectations for earnings modestly above the high end of its previous guidance of $1.92 a share. It also topped analysts’ estimates of $1.96. For the fourth quarter, earnings projections in the range of 50 to 51 cents a share in the fourth quarter were ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts of 45 cents.Gap also said that net sales climbed 2 per cent to $828m from a year ago in January and 1 per cent to $4.4bn in the fourth quarter.“Against a challenging retail backdrop, we’re pleased to report growth in our top-line and comp sales during the critical holiday quarter,” said Art Peck, chief executive officer. “We remain focused on actions that will strengthen our brands and recapture market share.”Indeed, Gap said same-store sales rose 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 7 per cent drop in the year ago period. Like-for-like sales rose 5 per cent at Old Navy, the company’s largest division, were flat at its eponymous brand and 3 per cent at Banana Republic.That was welcome news to shareholders, who sent Gap shares 3 per cent higher in extended trading to $23.68. While Gap had easier year-on-year comparisons, department stores and retailers have widely posted disappointing results during the key holiday period.For the month of January however, Gap sales did disappoint. Overall same-store sales rose 1 per cent last month, below analysts’ estimates for a 2.1 per cent gain, according to Bloomberg data. A 2 per cent rise in like-for-like sales at Old Navy missed expectations for a 4.7 per cent gain. Sales at Banana Republic slid 4 per cent, steeper than analysts’ estimates for a 2.5 per cent drop, while sales at Gap Global exceeded estimates, rising 3 per cent, topping expectations for a 1 per cent gain.Gap shares declined 41 per cent in 2015 and were down more than 9 per cent last year as the company, like other clothing retailers, suffered from changing millennial preferences and growing competition from e-commerce.Fast fashion retailers like H&M and Zara that mimic catwalk styles for a fraction of the cost have also taken a toll on the retailer. And a string of product misses at its Banana Republic brand hurt sales in recent years and prompted brand president Andi Owen’s exit last month.Gap shares are up 2.4 per cent so far this year.
29;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-01-24T21:42:22Z;Gap says Banana Republic brand president to depart;;It’s clearance time at Banana Republic.The retailer’s parent company Gap Inc said on Tuesday that Andi Owen, Banana Republic’s global brand president, would depart at the end of February.Ms Owen joined Gap in 1991 and has held a number of leadership roles throughout the company, including executive vice president and general manager for Gap Global Outlet and senior vice president and general manager for Banana Republic.Gap chief executive Art Peck called Ms Owen an “accomplished leader” and said that during her career she has “led critical work improving the brand’s aesthetic and product quality and moved the brand to a full omni-channel assortment.”“While these improvements have been important steps forward, we have significant work to do in order to consistently win with customers, Andi and I agreed that now was an appropriate time for a change in leadership.”The last few quarters have been a tough slog for Banana Republic, which is one of the core brands under the Gap umbrella. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Gap said that like-for-like sales at Banana Republic – which aims for a more upscale, professional audience than sister brands Gap and Old Navy – had fallen 8 per cent compared to a year ago, amid an overall retail environment that Mr Peck described as “challenging”. A string of acknowledged fashion misses have weighed on the brand, although it said last year that it hoped to woo shoppers with its spring fashions.In announcing its holiday sales figures earlier this month, Gap said that while comparable sales for all of its stores were up 2 per cent over November and December compared to a year earlier, Banana Republic comparable sales were down 7 per cent, compared to 9 per cent a year earlier.Gap shares were down 0.34 per cent in after-hours trading.
30;GPS;Gap Inc;2017-01-05T21:44:04Z;Gap shares jump as holiday sales top forecasts;;At least one retailer seems to have made Santa’s nice list.Gap shares jumped more than 10 per cent in extended trading after the retailer — known for stores including Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand — posted better-than-expected like-for-like sales overall during the holiday period and lifted its earnings guidance.The San Francisco-based retailer said same-store sales, a key industry metric, climbed 2 per cent over November and December, which chief financial officer Sabrina Simmons attributed to “improved momentum over the holiday season”. In December alone, comparable sales rose 4 per cent, topping analysts’ estimates for 1.7 per cent growth.Old Navy, the retailer’s largest division, posted a 12 per cent gain in comparable-store sales, eclipsing estimates for a 2.3 per cent gain. Sales at the Gap brand rose 1 per cent, beating expectations for a 3.9 per cent decline. Only Banana Republic posted a disappointing result, with sales falling 7 per cent against expectations for a 5.3 per cent drop, as it has struggled with a string of fashion misses.The improvement in sales prompted Gap to guide for full-year adjusted earnings “modestly above the high end of our previous adjusted guidance range of $1.92″.The better-than-expected numbers follow a string of disappointing holiday sales reports and profit warnings from major department stores including Macy’s and Kohl’s.Gap, however, has benefitted from easier comparisons, as its total same-store sales were down 5 per cent a year ago in December 2015.Gap and other retailers have lost ground as online shopping has put much more pressure on brick-and-mortar stores. They have also faced pressure from the success of fast-fashion rivals like H&M and Zara, which mimic runway styles for a fraction of the cost. That pressure saw Gap shares tumble 41 per cent in 2015, although that decline slowed to about 9 per cent last year.
31;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-11-18T18:39:10Z;Gap shares plunge on weaker sales and dour guidance;Earnings miss by Abercrombie & Fitch suggests apparel retailers face another tough holiday season;Heading into the all-important Christmas holiday shopping season, shares in Gap plunged after the struggling apparel retailer delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year sales decline and warned that trading conditions remained “challenging”.The stock, which hit a near 14-month high ahead of its third-quarter earnings report on Thursday, fell as much as 17.1 per cent to $25.45 on Friday as the comments, along with news of a bigger than expected number of store closures, underscored Gap’s daunting task of getting people back into its shops.The decline marks the shares’ biggest one-day drop since May 2011 and knocked almost $2bn off the company’s market value.The retailer behind Banana Republic, Old Navy and the Gap brand said sales declined 1.5 per cent to $3.8bn for the three months to October 29.Gap said that like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, fell three per cent in the quarter, with a fire at its distribution centre in Fishkill, New York, in August resulting in a 2 percentage point drag.Same-store sales declined in two out of three of Gap’s divisions, with Gap and Banana Republic both experiencing an 8 per cent drop in comparable sales during the quarter. Old Navy, the retailer’s largest division and the main source of growth in recent years, was the only bright spot, notching up a 3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales.Profits in the third quarter slid to $204m, or 51 cents a share — in line with forecasts and compared with profits of $248mm, or 61 cents a share, in the year-ago period.“The apparel environment continues to be challenging,” said Art Peck, Gap’s chief executive, during a call with analysts. “Traffic remains challenging and, as a planning assumption, we believe that will carry forward as well . . . Obviously, we’re doing work to try to beat that trend. But we understand the fact that traffic is likely to continue to be challenging.”Elsewhere, Abercrombie & Fitch added to the markets’ concerns that apparel retailers will face another tough Christmas holiday season this year after it recorded third-quarter results that badly missed forecasts on all fronts and also sounded the alarm over the trading environment for the remainder of the year. The stock fell almost 15 per cent to $14.44, leaving it with a market capitalisation of just above $1bn. At their peak in 2007, the shares were trading at almost $86.The comments from Gap and Abercrombie weighed on the wider apparel sector. Shares in Urban Outfitters were down more than 4 per cent at $37.21 while those for American Eagle Outfitters dropped almost 3 per cent to $17.80.Among the day’s gainers, Salesforce.com’s shareholders were floating on air after the cloud software company lifted its full-year outlook. Shares in the San Francisco-based company rose more than 3 per cent to $77.51 after the group lifted its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to a range of 97 to 98 cents a share, from 93 to 95 cents previously. That topped Wall Street estimates of 95 cents.In the broader market, the Nasdaq Composite briefly hit an intraday record high in early trading in New York before paring back to trade 0.2 per cent lower at 5,322.29 by midday. Trading was more subdued as investors took a breather from the so-called Trump trade.The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent lower at 2,182.58 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by a similar margin to 18,870.43.
32;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-10-07T15:02:24Z;Gap rallies on upbeat Old Navy sales;;Gap shares rallied on Friday after the US retailer unveiled upbeat September sales figures at its Old Navy brand.Same-store sales, an important metric for retailers, climbed 4 per cent last month at Old Navy, or about 6 per cent excluding the impacts of a fire that struck at a distribution centre in upstate New York. That widely beat estimates of a 0.7 per cent rise, and also the 4 per cent pace logged last September.“The results at Old Navy are encouraging and we believe [the fall product line-up] is both appealing and well-assorted,” said Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe.The performance at Old Navy is closely scrutinised by analysts since Gap’s higher-end name brand and Banana Republic have faced increased pressure from a shift by consumers to discount retailers, as well as fast-fashion groups that look to emulate runway styles at an inexpensive price point.Still, Mr Jaffe noted that Gap’s troubles are still probably not yet out of the way: “We anticipate continued challenges in the near term at both the Gap and Banana divisions, despite management’s best efforts to improve product,” he said.The group’s overall same-store sales were down 3 per cent in September, or flat excluding the impact of the fire.Shares in Gap, which is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings in mid-November, rallied 13.9 per cent on Friday to $25.90. They were still down by 8 per cent over the past 12 months.
33;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-09-06T06:00:15Z;Mutual fund managers find summer rewards in emerging markets;Top performers return more than 20% in 14 weeks between Memorial and Labor Day holidays;The summer of 2016 may have ended as one of the quietest and least volatile for US markets in memory, but there has been money to be made nonetheless. Just ask the fund managers who specialise in emerging markets or precious metals.In the 14 weeks between the Memorial day and Labor Day holidays — that period where market lore tells investors to “sell in May and go away” — the top-performing mutual funds managers returned more than 20 per cent this year.And even larger profits were available for the buyers of some exchange traded funds and individual stocks.The gains have gone disproportionately to asset classes that benefit from low interest rates, as markets settled into a view that the US Federal Reserve will keep rates low in the short term and may not ever raise them back to historical norms.“There is a lot of money in play on that single factor,” said Shanquan Li, manager of the Oppenheimer Gold & Special Minerals Fund, whose 27.4 per cent gain since Memorial day on May 30 is the best performance of all US mutual funds with over $1bn in assets.Mr Li’s $1.3bn fund invests in mainly small- and mid-cap gold mining stocks, to magnify the impact of changes in the gold price, which has risen 9.3 per cent over the summer. With rates staying low, the lack of yield on precious metals is less of a deterrent to investors, some of whom also see gold as a hedge against any inflation generated by loose monetary policy.Gold-focused mutual funds from Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and Tocqueville Asset Management are also among the best performers, according to data from Morningstar.Meanwhile, emerging markets have seen growing interest throughout the summer, as US fixed-income investors sought higher yields overseas and equity investors expected capital to continue flowing into emerging economies and forecast China would continue to stimulate demand.Two “smart beta” mutual funds from Pimco, which buy emerging markets stocks, are in Morningstar’s top 10, but the biggest gains have fallen to buyers of exchange traded funds designed to give exposure to individual countries.Investors’ enthusiasm for the change of political leadership in Brazil— plus early signs of an earnings recovery at the country’s recession-hit companies — has generated a 31 per cent gain for an iShares fund that tracks the country’s stock market. China funds also surged in value.After a sharp rise in the wake of the UK Brexit vote, volatility in the US stock market remained subdued as the summer came to an end, but individual stockpickers were still able to enjoy gains of more than 50 per cent on large-cap stocks.Chesapeake Energy, whose large debt burden has frightened many long-term investors out of the stock, jumped 59 per cent, the most by any S&P 500 constituent. It has been pulling itself back from the brink of bankruptcy, thanks to a debt restructuring and the sale of assets. And Seagate Technology, whose business manufacturing computer disks is under pressure, soared on news of a restructuring that involves laying off 6,500 employees, about 14 per cent of the workforce.Investors have also warmed to microchip stocks such as Micron Technology and Nvidia, and to retailers, including Gap and Nordstrom.The question is how markets will fare as traders and investors return to work following the extended break, and some strategists are warning that summer trends may cool, particularly the enthusiasm for emerging markets.“I believe there is a ‘one-offness’ to what has happened,” said Bhanu Baweja, strategist at UBS. “Emerging markets have had a tremendous and exceptional fair wind this year. We have seen the biggest decline in US real interest rates in years, but even if rates stay low, that is now priced in.”
34;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-08-09T20:33:49Z;Gap shares slide as turnround effort stalls;S&P 500 and Nasdaq rise to record intraday highs;Gap was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on Tuesday after the retailer’s latest sales figures showed that the turnround at the company has yet to take hold.Its shares dropped 6.2 per cent to $24.01, taking its fall this year to 2.8 per cent, after the retailer behind Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand, said like-for-like sales fell 2 per cent globally in the second quarter and were down 4 per cent in July.Gap had previously attributed weak sales at Banana Republic to a string of fashion misses and had said that there would be a turnround by spring when the company brought out its latest designs. But the retailer said that company faced “challenging” traffic conditions in May and July and that it was “maintaining a cautious view of the retail environment in the second half”.“The comment of challenging traffic in July [versus] better performance during the clearance month of June suggests that Gap may still be struggling to break free of its promotional spiral,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.The company said same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 9 per cent at Banana Republic in the second quarter. And things did not improve in July, with sales falling 14 per cent from a year ago, wider than analysts’ estimates for a 6 per cent drop.At Old Navy, the company’s largest division, same-store sales were flat in the second quarter and July, missing expectations for a 1 per cent gain last month.At its Gap brand, comparable sales fell 3 per cent in the quarter and were down 4 per cent in July from a year ago — wider than the 1 per cent drop analysts had forecast for the month.However, the company did say it expected adjusted earnings in the range of 58-59 cents a share in the second quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates.The sell-off in Gap shares arrived as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose to all-time intraday highs, before paring back gains by the close of trading. The Nasdaq Composite settled 0.2 per cent higher at 5,225.48 while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were little changed at 2,181.74 and 18,533.05, respectivelyThe tough retail environment was also highlighted by US handbags and accessories company Coach.The retailer, which is trying to reverse two years of falling sales, saw its shares fall 2.2 per cent to $40.52 after it issued a tepid outlook for fiscal 2017.Revenue for next year will rise by a low to mid single-digit percentage pace and net income is expected to post double-digit growth, it said. That compares with market expectations for a 4 per cent revenue gain and a 15 per cent jump in adjusted earnings.Elsewhere, cruise line stocks were facing rough seas. Shares in Norwegian Cruise Line dropped the most in three months after it cut its earnings forecast for this year and abandoned its financial targets for 2017.The Miami-based company said recent terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels and Turkey had caused a sharp fall in demand from North American travellers for Mediterranean cruises, while the weak pound had taken a bite out of the value of its overseas sales.Norwegian shares, down nearly 35 per cent this year, fell 11.8 per cent to $37.91. Shares in rival cruise operators Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruise also took a knock, falling 3.1 per cent to $45.05 and 6.8 per cent to $68.98, respectively.
35;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
36;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-08-08T20:50:22Z;Gap shares fall as Banana Republic pain continues;;Gap unveiled preliminary results for the second quarter on Monday and investors were unimpressed.Shares in the company behind Banana Republic, Old Navy and its eponymous brand fell more than 4 per cent in extended trading after Gap said like-for-like sales fell 2 per cent globally in the second quarter.Gap had previously said that a string of fashion misses had weighed on sales at its Banana Republic brand late in 2015 and earlier this year and that sales would turn round with Spring designs.But the company said same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 9 per cent at Banana Republic in the second quarter and were down 14 per cent in July.At Old Navy, the company’s largest division, same-store sales were largely unchanged in the second quarter and July.At its Gap brand, comparable sales fell 3 per cent in the quarter and were down 4 per cent in July.Gap, like other clothing retailers in the US, has been hurt by rising competition from online retailers and from fast fashion companies like Zara and H&M that mimic runway styles at a cheaper price. Moreover, the spending habits of American consumers have veered more towards experiences than clothing, posing another headache for apparel companies.Gap shares are up 3.7 per cent so far this year.
37;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-07-08T20:36:06Z;Financials jump ahead of earnings updates;Strong US jobs report helps erase post-Brexit loss for S&P 500;Financial stocks enjoyed a rally on Friday on short covering ahead of second-quarter earnings reports next week.With a decline of 3.9 per cent, the financials sector of the S&P 500 has been the clear laggard this year amid scaled back expectations for rate rises and market turmoil following the oil slump and growth fears emanating from China.By the close on Friday in New York, financials had gained 1.8 per cent. “They have been beaten up a lot,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “I am not sure if it is aggressive accumulation as much as risk avoidance with some short covering ahead of the weekend.”According to FactSet, financials are expected to report a 4.8 per cent decline in earnings year-over-year in the second quarter.JPMorgan Chase rose 2.1 per cent to $61.83, Wells Fargo added 2.1 per cent to $47.79, Citigroup was up 1.7 per cent to $41.98 and Bank of America Merrill Lynch added 1.2 per cent to $13.17.Goldman Sachs increased by 2.3 per cent to $150.38 and Morgan Stanley added 2.7 per cent to $26.37.A strong jobs report for June helped to erase all the losses that the S&P 500 and other US benchmarks have suffered in the wake of the UK’s surprise vote to leave the EU.The S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent at 2,129.9, having briefly climbed above its record close of 2,130.82 earlier in the day. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.6 per cent to 4,956.8.Payrolls in the US grew by 287,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said — over 100,000 more than had been forecast by analysts.But traders were reluctant to call the jobs report a sign of renewed expectations for rate rises.“I don’t know if it improves expectations but it doesn’t lower expectations,” Mr Kinahan said, adding that the focus would be on upcoming data releases for clues as to the trajectory of moves by the Federal Reserve.In the meantime, shares of retailer Gap rallied sharply after the company behind Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand reported same-store sales in June that topped expectations.The San Francisco-based company said like-for-like sales rose 2 per cent last month, driven by strength at Old Navy. Gap shares rose 5 per cent to $22.72.Shares of Synchrony Financial, the former store credit business of General Electric spun off in 2014, jumped on news that its board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents a share and a share repurchase programme of up to $952m for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. The stock gained 5 per cent to $27.31.“We believe [Synchrony’s] capital plan is likely to be received positively given it is slightly better than some of the Street assumptions,” Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at KBW, said in a note.Alcoa was also a strong gainer, up 5.1 per cent to $9.82 ahead of its earnings report set for Monday.The energy sector made gains of 1.3 per cent after coming under pressure on Thursday as US oil prices fell below $45 a barrel to a two-month low after a weekly report showed a much smaller than expected decline in stockpiles. US oil prices were back up above $45 on Friday.

The departure of Stefan Larsson for the top job at Ralph Lauren last year and a string of style misses at Banana Republic had also weighed on its shares.

The market has been nervous ahead of next week’s UK referendum on EU membership, which has driven up volatility. The Vix index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” approached 23 this week, its highest level since February. The barometer eased back below 20 on Friday, its long-term average.Weakness dictated IT companies on Friday, with the S&P 500’s largest sector lagging the broad market. The tech sector has fallen 3.1 per cent this month after May’s robust performance. Financials, down 4.4 per cent, followed by tech are the worst performing major S&P groups for June.Alphabet, parent of Google, dropped 2.6 per cent to $691.72 a share, software maker Microsoft fell 0.5 per cent to $50.13 and the social network company Facebook slid 1.2 per cent to $113.02.Apple fell 2.3 per cent to $95.33, pressured after a Bloomberg report that it may have to interrupt sales of iPhones in Beijing after an authority ruled it had violated a competitor’s patent.The business software company Oracle, rose 2.7 per cent to $39.68, however, after outlining a shift to cloud computing services.Healthcare shares also weakened. Merck, the drug manufacturer, dropped 2.8 per cent to $55.89, Pfizer fell 1.5 per cent to $34.22 and Johnson & Johnson lost 1 per cent to $115.48.At the close the S&P 500 stock index was 0.3 per cent lower at 2,071.2, its sixth decline in seven trading sessions after touching a 2016 high on June 8. The index sits 2.8 per cent below its record peak of May 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 17,675.2, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.9 per cent to 4,800.3.Energy was the only sector to gain on Friday, buoyed by firmer oil prices. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, settled 3.8 per cent higher at $47.98 a barrel.Oil and gas benefited most, with Murphy Oil climbing 4.9 per cent to $29.34, Marathon Oil up 3.9 per cent to $13.16 and Devon Energy 3.4 per cent higher at $35.98.Oilfield services companies, which work under contract with producers to help them drill, also gained. Transocean climbed 7.5 per cent to $11.31 and National Oilwell Varco was up 3.9 per cent to $35.18.Patches of strength appeared among US retailers. Gap rose 4.1 per cent to $20.13, retail chain Nordstrom climbed 1.9 per cent to $37.48 while Bed Bath & Beyond climbed 3.3 per cent to $43.85.Shares of cosmetics maker Elizabeth Arden soared 49.1 per cent to $13.88 after beauty company Revlon said it would buy the company for $14 a share.

40;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-06-10T14:00:42Z;Stefan Larsson — a dose of high street reality for a fashion icon;He respects the Ralph Lauren legacy but has space to move, too, writes Jo Ellison;As Ralph Lauren is fond of saying, Stefan Larsson is the “first CEO I ever had”. Until last October, Mr Lauren acted as chief executive of his fashion house. The appointment of Mr Larsson, a Swede with 18 years’ experience in retailing, first at H&M and then reviving Gap’s Old Navy brand, drew speculation that the 76-year old American designer might be retiring.In fact Mr Lauren stayed on, as chairman and chief creative officer. But it now falls to Mr Larsson, 41, to deliver the bad news. During a three-hour presentation to investors this week, Mr Larsson, who wears heavy-rimmed spectacles of the architect school and has collar-length curls, outlined the “Way Forward” plan, the first of the radical changes he plans for the ailing $8bn business, where sales and profits have fallen by 50 per cent in two years.The “Way Forward” plan will involve 50 store closures, 1,000 job losses and a restructure to remove three of the nine layers of management that stand between Mr Larsson and “the actual doer doing the work”, as he puts it. It will also mean a refocus on the best-selling “core” products of the Ralph Lauren brand — classics such as the “blazer, the double-breasted jacket, the chinos and biker jacket”.Clothing production lead times will be cut from 15 to nine months, to maximise the time that full-price stock stays in store, and a “continuous test pipeline” will be introduced, where certain lines will be ushered through development on to the shop floor within eight weeks.Mr Larsson couched his language in corporate jargon which belied the severity of the cuts: $180m to $220m in annual costs on top of existing plans to reduce costs by $125m. The coming months will be fairly brutal at Ralph Lauren.Mr Larsson is one of a new breed of chief executives to have crossed over from everyday retailers into the exclusive world of luxury. He brings with him an invigorating sense of urgency, a democratic attitude and openness to disruption — but he is making changes that reflect broader trends in luxury retailing. By concentrating on the main Ralph Lauren lines, for example, Mr Larsson is following other brands in cutting down the number of collections on offer: this traditional luxury brand business model has confused millennial consumers shopping online.During Larsson’s time at H&M, the retailer became known for its very successful collaborations with leading designersDespite the brand’s recent woes, Mr Larsson’s task is an enviable one. Ralph Lauren has a celebrated ethos and look and is instantly recognisable as the home of preppy style and chic Americana. And Mr Larsson was a huge admirer of Mr Lauren long before he worked for him. Just as the US designer worked his way up out of the Bronx, Mr Larsson once dreamt of escaping the small Swedish town of his childhood.Like Mr Lauren, he considers himself an entrepreneur. Mr Larsson paid his way through business school (and acquired a Polo jacket) by forming a company that produced contacts’ books of his fellow student’s details: like an analogue Facebook “but not as pretentious”. He only joined Stockholm-based H&M because the management persuaded the 25-year-old to join a team that would transform the then “scrappy” company into one of the biggest fashion retailers in the world.An elegant man, Larsson is dismissive of retailers who sell “clothes by the pound”. During his time at H&M, the retailer became known for its very successful collaborations with leading designers, and Mr Larsson was impressed by how those sought-after collections transformed the public’s perception of the brand and made it “cool and relevant”.His interest in product design then transformed Old Navy, previously considered a “problem” business. “He is one of the rare people who is good with numbers, but he is also good with fashion,” says a former colleague. “He always had a soft spot for high fashion: even at H&M he wouldn’t walk around wearing a T-shirt for £4.95.”Mr Larsson is a quieter, far less flamboyant character than Mr Lauren, who revels in the mythology of his rags-to-riches success. Mr Larsson, meanwhile, avoids the limelight. His family — he has three young children — will soon relocate to New York from San Francisco, and he is fascinated by how the next generation, tomorrow’s consumers, will be “the authors of their own lives” through their use of social media.He works with a small, loyal team, and he works fast. “He has a nose for finding the right people,” says the colleague. “He’s not someone who wants to get along with everybody, he’s super political, he has an agenda and he knows the only way to do it is to go fast. He has no scruples about getting rid of people, and putting his own team in. It’s important to him to make change.” That change is under way and one of his first big hires was a former H&M colleague.Despite having to answer to Mr Lauren, it is said that Mr Larsson has negotiated a contract allowing him to act without express permission from the boss.The new chief executive is, however, well aware of Mr Lauren’s influence, and very respectful of his legacy. “Ralph Lauren is not the standard model,” he told the Financial Times. “I was sitting in the Polo restaurant [owned by the company] recently and looking at the clientele. It’s so mixed, it appeals to all ages. I saw how much they love Ralph Lauren. Now we just have to create the same desire about the product.” He concluded: “Ralph is the originator of iconic style, so we have it all. We just need to continue to evolve from that core.”The writer is the FT’s fashion editor
41;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-06-07T17:15:17Z;Ralph Lauren warns of 2016 sales decline;New chief Stefan Larsson vows to close stores and cut costs;Ralph Lauren warned that sales would decline in the “low double digits” this fiscal year, initially wiping nearly a tenth off the value of the luxury brand, as the recently-installed chief executive from Gap’s Old Navy brand outlined a plan to cut costs.The turnround plan involves eliminating between $180m and $220m in annual costs including through shutting about 50 of its full-price stores, 10 per cent of the total, and reducing inventory. It comes on top of an existing plan to reduce costs by $125m.The cuts will lead to a $400m charge in the year ending March plus a further $150m from reducing inventory. Ralph Lauren also said it would streamline its supply chain operations. High hopes have been pinned on Stefan Larsson, who had breathed new life into Gap’s Old Navy brand, to get Ralph Lauren’s back office into shape in an increasingly difficult environment for fashion retailers.However, investors were not initially impressed by the plan with shares falling 10 per cent. By lunch time in New York the shares had clawed back much of the lost ground to be 2 per cent lower at $94.38.Recent retailer earnings in the US have highlighted the winners from the losers in an industry where consumers are willing to spend selectively.Younger generations are increasingly shifting to online purchases and shunning department stores that do not offer enjoyable shopping experiences. Retailers such as Macy’s, where Ralph Lauren sells a significant amount of its clothes, are struggling to stem a decline in sales.It has given off-rack (brands sold at a discount) stores an edge, while fast fashion brands such as H&M, where Mr Larsson cut his teeth in retail, continue to win over the millennial consumer.“We will build on our strengths, refocusing on our core brands and instilling a financial discipline that is highly focused on return on investment, Mr Larsson said.The aim at the company, where founder Ralph Lauren last year relinquished his role as chief executive, is to revive operating margins to the mid teens in 2020 after expecting them to decline to 10 per cent this year from 10.7 per cent in the year just ended.
42;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-06-03T20:31:25Z;Banks slide after weak US jobs report;Utilities make ground even as the broader market retreats;Bank stocks fell and utilities rallied on Friday after the May employment report showed the slowest pace of US job growth since 2010.The S&P 500 banks index of 17 lenders fell as much as 3.9 per cent at one point, and closed the day down 2.3 per cent. It was the biggest one-day drop for the index since early April as the jobs data cast doubt over the timing of the next interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve.Lower expectations of a rate rise this summer, with interest rate futures showing odds of a shift in July at one-third, soured bank shares. Lower interest rates put pressure on banks’ margins. This is due to them generating profits on the difference in the rates they charge for loans and what they pay for deposits.Citigroup shares fell 3.4 per cent to $45.39. Meanwhile, Bank of America shares slid 3.5 per cent to $14.42, JPMorgan shares shed 1.8 per cent to $64.64 and shares in Wells Fargo slipped 1.8 per cent to $50.19.By contrast, interest rate sensitive utilities rallied as Treasury bond yields fell sharply. The S&P 500 utilities index rose 1.7 per cent — its biggest one-day gain since January. AES Corporation led the index with a 3.5 per cent gain, pushing its shares to $11.22.Dividend paying utilities typically benefit in a low rate environment as investors flock to the sector in search for income.“We have been in this oscillating environment for seemingly years now,” said Peter Stournaras, portfolio manager of the BlackRock Large Cap Series Funds, noting that good news and expectations of a rate rise hurt utilities and that a dose of bad news tends to drive a reversal. “Asset prices are at the will of monetary policy right now,” he added.Some, however, warned that investors were letting monetary policy cloud other factors that could sway the fortunes of these sectors.“Transaction activity has picked up in profitable areas like high yield and there are indications of a backlog in refinance activity at some institutions,” said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Brean Capital. “Those would be positive for bank earnings and outweigh current interest rate concerns.”The disappointing jobs report sparked a modest retreat across the broad market. At the close, the S&P 500 had dropped 0.3 per cent to 2,099.1 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower at 17,807.1. The Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.6 per cent to 4,942.5 as technology shares faltered.Elsewhere, Gap shares advanced 4.2 per cent to $19.09, after the apparel retailer reported better than expected like-for-like sales in May. Sales slid 6 per cent in May, which was narrower than the 8 per cent fall that analysts were expecting. The company said that comparisons were made harder by the timing of the Memorial day holiday which shifted to June this year.Broadcom shares jumped nearly 5 per cent to $162.56 after the semiconductor maker reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates. These were Broadcom’s first results since it completed its merger with Avago Technologies.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
43;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-06-02T20:36:19Z;Gap rises as May sales results better than feared;;Gap shares jumped late on Thursday after the embattled retailer disclosed a slimmer-than-expected fall in May sales.The San Francisco-based group said its like-for-like sales, a key metric for retailers that tracks sales at stores open at least a year, slid by 6 per cent in May, steeper than the 1 per cent decline in the same month in 2015. However, the drop was shallower than the 8 per cent Wall Street forecast.The better-than-expected figures came as like-for-like sales across all of its brands fell in May by a slimmer-than-expected margin:Gap’s stock has shed about half of its value of the past 12 months as the retailer has faced heavy competition from fast-fashion groups like Zara, as well as off-price retailers such as TJX Cos.The shares, however, rallied by 6.2 per cent in after hours trading on Thursday.
44;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-05-19T22:34:08Z;Gap cut to junk by S&P;;Standard & Poor’s cut Gap’s credit rating into junk territory late on Thursday, following a similar move last week by Fitch, leaving the struggling apparel retailer as one of the credit market’s most recent “fallen angels”.New York-based S&P reduced the group’s rating on Thursday to “BB+” from “BBB-” on concerns that its ” weakened operating performance” may last for another year at a minimum.The news came shortly after Gap said it would close 75 stores, including all 53 of its Old Navy stores in Japan, as it looks to right the ship. It also said that its sales declined by 6 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the group’s fiscal first quarter as like-for-like sales at its eponymous brand, Old Navy and Banana Republic all declined.“We think negative same-store sales across all its three major brand … and continued margin decline is likely for the rest of this year despite closing 15% of its North American Gap stores last year and its recent announcement of closing selected Old Navy and Banana Republic stores internationally,” said S&P credit analyst Helena Song.The San Francisco based group joins a handful of other US companies that have been stripped of their investment-grade rating by S&P this year including, including copper miner Freeport McMoRan and oil exploration and production company Continental Resources.Gap’s shares have skidded by almost a third this year, while the price of its 5.95 per cent coupon bonds maturing in 2021 have dropped by 7.1 per cent over the same period.
45;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-05-19T20:27:23Z;Gap to shutter Old Navy stores in Japan;;Gap has said it expects to close 75 stores this year, including all 53 of its Old Navy stores in Japan, as it focuses on markets that are more favourable to its growth.The retailer behind Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand said Japan remains important for its Gap brand and that these measures would result in annualised cost savings of about $275m and drive an operating margin improvement of nearly 2 percentage points.The closures would also result in a sales loss of about $250m, the San Francisco-based retailer said. Gap also expects to record $300m in pre-tax costs tied to these and efforts to streamline its business, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.Gap, which issued a profit warning earlier this month, had said at the time that it was evaluating its fleet of Old Navy and Banana Republic stores outside of North America. The company said on Thursday that growth ambitions for Old Navy, the retailer’s largest division, will now be anchored in North Amreica and China.Art Peck, chief executive, said:As the pace of change across the apparel industry increases, now is the time to accelerate our transformation by scaling our product and operating capabilities across our global portfolio.By taking every opportunity to exploit our strategic advantages, our brands will be able to more fully harness the power of the enterprise to better serve their customers across channels and geographies.The news came alongside first quarter profits that fell to $127m or 32 cents a share in the three months ended in April, down from $239m to 56 cents a share in the year ago period. This was in line with the forecast it issued earlier this month, which was shy of analysts estimates at the time of 44 cents.Net sales slid 6 per cent to $3.4bn.Gap has come struggled to bring shoppers back to its stores as it faces increased competition from fast fashion retailers like H&M and Zara that mimic runway styles for cheap and the rise of ecommerce, which has lowered the barrier to entry in the apparel space.Gap shares have tumbled 30 per cent so far this year, but were up 3.6 per cent in after hours trading on Thursday.
46;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-05-13T18:58:57Z;US retail: in a box;Ecommerce is hardly a pot of gold;Successful retailing has two pillars. The aesthetics must to be right, and the supply chain must run smooth. America’s big apparel merchants, such as Macy’s, Gap, Nordstrom or Kohl’s are wobbly on both. All four announced sales shortfalls this week.No one disputes that the big chains have a glamour problem. Basics that are cheap and cheerful, found at the likes of H&M or Zara, and the fancier stuff on a discount rack at, say, TJX have beaten the middlebrow fare of department and speciality stores.Next, consider the choice of sales channel. Incumbents have started to boast of their “omnichannel” capabilities, with online and store sales complementing each other. This could have been one channel too many. Focus on online innovation may only have distracted from the creeping rot on the store side. Consultant Green Street Advisors thinks that anchor tenants in shopping malls would need to shutter a fifth of their stores to reach the productivity levels — sales per square foot — of a decade ago.Money has flooded into internet retail start-ups, but in the US there is no independent online fashion success story to match the UK’s Asos. Most are either flops (fab.com, Gilt Group) or burning millions in venture capital trying to get off the ground (Jet.com). The challenge of handling fast home deliveries is its own headache. The profits have slipped away from the big rag merchants. Will they reappear? Perhaps, once a lot of stores have shut and a lot of start-ups have wound down. Until then, invest elsewhere.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
47;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-05-12T20:41:58Z;Kohl’s shares drag US department stores lower;Stocks slip as Apple’s decline weighs on broader market;Shares in US department stores faced a second day of declines after Kohl’s reported a bigger than expected drop in first-quarter sales and profits.Kohl’s shares fell 9.2 per cent to $35.15 — taking its decline since the beginning of last year to more than 40 per cent — after the Wisconsin-based company said same-store sales, a key indicator of demand, dropped 3.9 per cent during the March quarter, compared with expectations for a 0.7 per cent rise.Total sales fell 3.7 per cent to $3.97bn during the period, well below market forecasts for a slight increase to $4.13bn.Net income meanwhile tumbled 87 per cent to $17m, partly as a result of one-off costs related to store closures. Meanwhile, gross margin fell 139 basis points to 35.5 per cent as the company resorted to heavy discounting to clear inventory.The dour news sent shares of Sears 10.7 per cent lower to $11.39 and shares in JC Penney down 1.2 per cent to $7.80. Nordstrom shares were little changed at $45.20.Kohl’s downbeat results arrived a day after Macy’s lowered its profit forecast.“Apparel is fighting an uphill battle. As evidenced by surprisingly weak April trends at L Brands, pressure at Macy’s and department stores, and specific issues at Gap, retail is in the midst of a transition,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen.Meanwhile, Ralph Lauren shares advanced 2.8 per cent to $86.86 after the retailer reported adjusted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped expectations but the news came alongside an otherwise grim quarter.The company, best known for its preppy polo shirts, reported adjusted earnings of 88 cents a share, ahead of analysts’ expectations for 83 cents.But like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, fell 6 per cent during the fiscal fourth quarter, worse than expectations for a 5.1 per cent decline.Operating margin at its retail business, which accounts for nearly half of group revenue, fell to -1.1 per cent, compared with 3.4 per cent in the year-ago period.Elsewhere, Apple’s shares extended their 2016 sell-off as analysts remained wary about slowing iPhone sales growth. The California technology group last month disappointed investors by disclosing the first year-on-year drop in iPhone sales in the device’s history.Investors were concerned that consumers in developed countries are not overly eager to upgrade their smartphones while demand for Apple’s most important product has waned in emerging markets like China that are experiencing growth slowdowns.“We remain cautious on iPhone growth this year given slowing smartphone market growth, elongating refresh cycles and Apple’s peak share at the high end,” said Sherri Scribner, an analyst at Deutsche Bank this week.Apple’s shares briefly fell below the $90 mark in New York trading for the first time since June 2014, according to Bloomberg data. They ended the day with a 2.4 per cent decline at $90.32.Apple’s decline weighed on the broader market with the Nasdaq Composite 0.5 per cent weaker at 4,737.33. Meanwhile the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were nearly unchanged at 2,064.11 and 17,720.50, respectively.
48;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-05-11T13:27:19Z;Gap junked by Fitch, outlook stable;;More grim news for Gap.Ratings agency Fitch has cut Gap’s long-term rating from ‘BBB-’ to ‘BB+’ — or one notch into junk territory — a day after the retailer said it would miss first quarter profit estimates and issued disappointing April sales figures.The agency said the rating outlook remains stable. Fitch said:The downgrade reflect’s Fitch’s reduced confidence in the stabilisation of sales, expectations of continued gross margin volatility, and belief that Gap will need to continue using real estate actions and large-scale cost reduction programs to protect EBITDA in the face of sales declines.Fitch expects that Gap’s gross margin will have declined to 35 per cent in 2016, from a peak in the 40 per cent range in 2009 – 2010.Wall Street analysts have previously warned that the San Francisco-based company, which had long term debt of $1.3bn as of January 30, has already cut so much out of its expense base over the past several years that there is not much more it can do to offset gross margin pressure.The retailer behind Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand, has struggled to lure customers back to the brand as it faces increased pressure from the rise of ecommerce and fast fashion retailers like Zara and H&M, that quickly move runway looks to the stores at a low price.Gap’s woes have seen its credit default swaps, or the price of insuring its debt, climb to a 13-year high.Fitch is the first ratings agency to have junked Gap. S&P and Moody’s still have investment grade ratings on the company’s debt.

By afternoon trading they were trading about 12.4 per cent lower.Investors soured on Gap shares after the retailer warned late on Monday that the company would miss on first quarter profits and revealed weaker than expected same-store sales in April.
50;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-05-10T18:13:35Z;Gap shares fall after profit warning;Clothing retailer’s brands out of fashion with spring shoppers;Gap shares fell to their lowest level in more than four years on Tuesday, a day after the US clothes retailer reported a drop in April sales and warned it would miss first-quarter profit estimates.The group behind the Old Navy, Banana Republic and Gap clothing brands said late on Monday that it expected diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2016 to be in the range of 31-32 cents — well below analysts’ consensus estimate of 44 cents.Comparable sales, a key industry metric, fell 5 per cent over the same period.The news sent shares in the San Francisco-based down as much as 12.8 per cent, to $19.01, in early trading on Tuesday.Gap reiterated that gross margins had suffered because the company entered April with more inventory than planned. But analysts were unconvinced.“Gap has already cut so much out of its expense base over the past several years that we believe there is not much more it can do to offset gross margin pressure,” said Daniela Nedialkova at Atlantic Equities. “With consumers’ appetite for discretionary goods clearly slowing in the last couple of months, and the intense competition within the apparel space continuing, we cannot see the end of promotional pressure on gross margins, at least in the near-term, either.”Gap said that March and April had proved “a tepid macro environment for apparel retail” and sales at stores open at least a year had fallen 7 per cent last month — compared with analysts’ forecasts for a 1.1 per cent gain.Art Peck, who was appointed Gap’s chief executive last year, had previously said unpopular styles damaged the group’s sales and its spring ranges would resonate better with customers. However, an April revenue breakdown showed that like-for-like sales at Banana Republic and Gap fell 7 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, against analysts’ expectations for a 5.1 per cent decline and 3.2 per cent growth.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales at Old Navy, the company’s largest division, fell 10 per cent, missing forecasts of a 2.6 per cent gain.“Old Navy’s significant deceleration was most notable, supporting our thesis that the brand is off track,” said Kimberly Greenberger, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.Old Navy had been one of Gap’s best-performing brands when it was run by Stefan Larsson. His departure for the top job at Ralph Lauren last year was perceived by many to be a blow to the group. Sonia Syngal, a company veteran, was promoted to the role of Old Navy’s president earlier this year.Gap said it was now identifying opportunities to “streamline its operating model to be more efficient and flexible”, with more details expected when the company reports first-quarter results next week.In recent times, the group has faced growing competition from ecommerce rivals and so-called fast fashion retailers that mimic catwalk looks at a low price — such H&M, Zara and Forever 21.Gap shares are down more than 50 per cent since the beginning of 2015.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

However, the disappointing April sales figures show that Gap still has some way to go in luring consumers back to the brand.Gap shares have declined nearly 12 per cent so far this year, following a 41 per cent decline in 2015.

Sales were up 14 per cent last year. At its Gap brand, same-store sales slid 3 per cent.Gap shares have declined more than 43 per cent since the beginning of last year. The retailer previously stated that product misses had hurt sales and that its spring assortment would resonate better with customers.Michael Binetti, an analyst at UBS, said he now expected April to be “an even tougher retail environment” as traffic at the retailer was “down significantly exiting March”.Additional factors were “our early April channel checks that suggest traffic is slow throughout retail”, and “our weather expert’s forecast that April will be much colder than normal [a negative for softlines retail]”.Gap’s sell-off came alongside a rebound in US markets following the previous day’s sharp decline. US stocks began Friday with a strong rally but by the close much of those gains had been pared back.The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 per cent to 2,048, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.2 per cent to 17,577, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 4,851.The S&P 500 energy sector led the way higher on Friday, climbing 2 per cent, on the back of a sharp rise in energy prices.West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, climbed 5.3 per cent to $39.24 a barrel and posted its best weekly rise in a month.All the sector’s 38 components were in the black. Murphy Oil, an exploration and production company, was one of the best performers, rising 5.1 per cent to $25.69. Williams Companies, an energy pipeline operator, advanced 3.4 per cent to $16.24.Financials showed a modest rebound from their sell-off on Thursday, which had been driven by renewed concerns over the strength of the global economy and the pace of Federal Reserve rate rises this year.Citigroup gained 0.5 per cent to $40.48, helping to reverse a nearly 4 per cent fall in the last session.The volatility for the sector comes less than a week before JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US lender by assets, kicks off bank earnings season. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citi report next week as well.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said this week that they expected “weak results” from the big banks this quarter because of ongoing struggles in the trading business.

Higher inventories, which in turn drive discounting, have been a headache for retailers.Gap has previously stated that product misses had hurt sales and that its spring assortment would resonate better with customers and bring shoppers back to the brand.The news came alongside same-store sales that fell 6 per cent in March, worse than estimates for 5 per cent drop and compared with a 2 per cent increase in the year ago period.

That pushed Gap shares 4 per cent lower in extended trading.The news came alongside profits of $214m or 53 cents a share in the fourth quarter, compared with $319m or 75 cents a share in the year ago period. Sales slipped 6.9 per cent to $4.4bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of 51 cents a share, on sales of $4.4bn.Sales at stores that have been open more than a year fell 7 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared to a 2 per cent gain in the year ago period.Same-store sales at Banana Republic fell 10 per cent, versus flat the previous year; declined 6 per cent at Gap, following a 5 per cent drop in the prior year period; and were flat at Old Navy compared to a 5 per cent gain in the fourth quarter of 2014.Art Peck, chief executive, said:With a year of transition behind us, I’m confident that we have the right strategies in place to fuel our long-term growth.We made significant progress in 2015 transforming our product operating model, enabling us to be more responsive to trends and market conditions, and consistently deliver on-brand product collections.The retailer has previously said that product misses had hurt traffic and that spring would be a key turning point for the retailer but analysts have warned that hopes for an immediate product-driven turnaround in spring could prove overly optimistic.Gap has faced increasing competition from fast fashion retailers like Zara and H&M as the rise of ecommerce has increased competition for clothing retailers. The company lost Stefan Larsson, who helped revive sales at Old Navy, the company’s largest division, to Ralph Lauren last year.Gap shares have declined nearly 35 per cent since the start of last year."
55;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-02-09T18:01:33Z;What caused Gap shares to pull back?;;Gap shares are all over the shop.Shares in the retailer which were up as much as 3 per cent on Tuesday, were down 2 per cent to $23.51 by noon. But what prompted the stock to jump and then drop?The company behind Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand revealed a better-than-expected full-year profit outlook late Monday, alongside declining comparable sales for all its brands.Shares popped as some had expected the retailer to cut its full-year earnings forecast. Moreover, the retailer had previously warned that product misses had hurt traffic especially at Banana Republic and that spring would be a key turning point for the retailer.But as investors and analysts digested the report shares gave up their gains.Betty Chen, an analyst at Mizuho, warned of the low quality of the EPS guidance and the optimism tied to a turnaround in spring:While the company was able to deliver slightly better than expected fourth quarter OpEPS guidance, we believe the earnings will be of low quality and consist of further opex cuts and share repurchases. Importantly, the January sales shortfall represents another month of sequential comp deceleration at all three brands as we believe hope for an immediate, product driven turnaround in Spring 2016, may prove optimistic.Kimberly Greenberger, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said late Monday:We expect the stock to trade modestly higher tomorrow given the buyside likely expected a meaningful cut to full-year EPS. However, we still think investors need to see stabilisation in the business over the next few quarters to make the bear case… appear less likely.Lindsay Drucker Mann, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said:Deceleration at Banana Republic and Old Navy heightens recent concerns – Both brands decelerated on a 2-yr basis and threaten to offset anticipated improvement at Gap.

An unseasonably warm winter also weighed on its sales. While the decline in Gap sales appears to be slowing, analysts have warned a turnaround at the retailer could be halted if Old Navy, its largest division, starts to falter.

59;GPS;Gap Inc;2016-01-08T21:18:45Z;Gap retreats amid Old Navy disappointment;Strong December US jobs report fails to push Wall Street higher;Investors soured on shares in Gap after the US retailer reported December same-store sales that missed estimates, noting that traffic continued to be “challenging” last month and was “especially disappointing” at Old Navy.Gap shares fell 14.3 per cent to $22.91 after the retailer said comparable sales, a key industry metric, fell 7 per cent at Old Navy, the company’s largest division.Old Navy, a former darling in the retailer’s portfolio of brands, faced tougher comparisons as like-for-like sales were up 8 per cent in the year-ago period. But the unseasonably warm weather also took a toll because of the brand’s exposure to sweaters and outerwear.The report also showed that Gap did not receive much support from its other brands. Comparable sales fell 9 per cent at Banana Republic and 2 per cent at the Gap brand.Total same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 5 per cent in December, worse than analysts estimates for a 3.9 per cent decline.The retailer, which has faced increasing competition from fast-fashion retailers such as H&M and Zara, has relied on the strength of the Old Navy brand during its turnround, and its disappointing December figures have delivered a blow to its share price.“Our worst fear was that Old Navy would underperform significantly and that’s happening,” said Susan Anderson, an analyst at FBR. “If Old Navy starts to go downhill, then all bets are off on a company turnround.”Gap shares fell more than 40 per cent last year.Shares in The Container Store dropped 41.1 per cent to $4.22 after the purveyor of storage items issued a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook and received an analyst downgrade.The Texas-based company said it expected earnings in the range of 19 to 22 cents a share, below estimates for 29 cents. Meanwhile, it expects same-store sales to decline between 3 and 5 per centThe news came alongside disappointing third-quarter results. The retailer swung to a loss of $1.7m, or 4 cents a share, compared with a profit of $6.2m, or 13 cents a share in the previous year. Sales rose 3 per cent to $197m. This missed analysts forecasts for earnings or 5 cents a share, on sales of $200.3m.“At a time when the consumer’s willingness to invest in the home is high, The Container Store has struggled to gain traffic and comp store sales,” Daniel Binder, an analyst at Jefferies, said. “We believe this reflects increased competition in the home furnishings space, which may require more aggressive tactics if The Container Store wants to stem share loss.”An analyst downgrade only served to exacerbate the retailer’s woes. Analysts at JPMorgan cut the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” and removed their price target.Shares in Qorvo fell 2.5 per cent to $44.49 after the chipmaker lowered its revenue guidance for the fiscal third quarter late on Thursday. The Apple supplier said it now expected December quarterly revenue of about $620m, compared with its previous expectations for $720m to $730m.This was also below analysts’ forecasts for $723.8m.

60;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The departure of Stefan Larsson, the former president of Old Navy, for the top job at Ralph Lauren last year was perceived by many to be a blow to the retailer. And December’s disappointing figures are likely to raise questions about sales trends at the brand.“Our worst fear was that Old Navy would underperform significantly and that’s happening,” Susan Anderson, an analyst at FBR, said. “If Old Navy starts to go downhill then all bets are off on a company turnround,” she added.

Comparable sales, an important industry metric, fell 8 per cent.Same-store sales at its Banana Republic brand tumbled 19 per cent, compared with growth of 2 per cent during November 2014.Dorothy Lakner, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, said the retailer’s stores were usually busy the day after Thanksgiving, “even if customers were looking for clearance bargains”. However, “this Black Friday, they simply didn’t show up”.Same-store sales at the Gap brand fell 4 per cent, on top of a 4 per cent decline the previous year, while Old Navy sales declined 9 per cent, following 18 per cent growth last year.Ms Lakner said the Old Navy model was “being implemented at Gap and Banana as we move into 2016 and should lead to turns there”.Barnes & Noble fell 16.68 per cent to $10.04 after the US bookseller swung to a loss in the fiscal second quarter and said sales of Nook, its ereader, had tumbled.The New York-based company reported a loss of $39.2m, or 52 cents a share, in the three months ended in October, compared with a profit of $12.3m, or 12 cents a share, in the period a year ago.

63;GPS;Gap Inc;2015-11-18T17:28:10Z;Warming US economy leaves retailers cold;Some of the biggest names at the mall report sluggish sales as their critical holiday season starts;The US economy is brightening, but consumers are not spending on clothes. As stores approach the critical holiday shopping season, third-quarter sales at some of the biggest names in retailing have been sluggish.Groups from Macy’s to Urban Outfitters have reported falling revenues and missed analysts’ estimates in recent days, pushing the S&P Retail Select Industry Index down 8.5 per cent last week to mark the sector’s worst week since May 2012.Urban Outfitters earlier this week reported a same-store-sales increase of just 1 per cent, short of analysts’ expectations for a 3.4 per cent gain, which sent the stock sharply lower as the fashion and accessories chain perplexed the market with a plan to buy a restaurant chain.Even Nordstrom, the usually resilient upmarket department store chain, has not been able to produce buoyant sales. “There area a number of [broad] economic indicators that look real positive for the US and the consumer and spending” Blake Nordstrom, co-president of the eponymous department store told investors, “yet all we can tell you is in our business we saw a slowdown and it was across the board.”Top line US consumer spending expanded 3.2 per cent in the third quarter, government data show. This helped the US market shine a little brighter than many in a global economy showing muted growth, saddled with slowing emerging market expansion and a eurozone struggling to find momentum. But the slower growth elsewhere has had an impact on tourist sales in the US, Macy’s has complained.Wage growth at home has shown signs of improvement, though plenty of people in lower income brackets are still very much feeling the pinch.If Mr Nordstrom is correct, and consumers are starting to hold back, that is worrying for other retailers, which are already struggling to differentiate themselves in an environment where the winners are either fast fashion companies, such as H&M and Forever 21, or groups with strong brands such as Nike.They are also having to compete for dollars that are going on higher rent and healthcare costs. Lower fuel prices have boosted consumers’ disposable income, but the benefit is being spent on activities such as dining out and entertainment a JPMorgan Chase Institute report showed. Auto sales have also been robust.As retailers enter the two-month holiday shopping period, which can account for as much as 30 per cent of annual sales, many of them now have lots of inventory to whittle down. Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell said, “we worry that promotional activity will likely lead to a fight to the bottom on margins, which could potentially lead to misses in fourth quarter”.Neil Saunders, an analyst at research group Conlumino, added in a recent report: “American consumers remain caught in a netherworld of being less gloomy than they were in the depths of the downturn, but far less optimistic than they were in the period before it. Many are uncertain about the future and this is colouring their spending habits.”Gap is being attacked from all angles. Its main brand has lost ground to fast fashion chains among younger shoppers, who prefer a wider choice of styles and do not want a brand name emblazoned across their clothing. At the same time, it has failed to cash in on the rise of athletic leisure wear — jeans sales are suffering, while yoga pants are increasingly being seen as acceptable at the office.It recently lost the head of Old Navy, Stefan Larsson— credited with turning round that brand — to Ralph Lauren, and the company appears to be caught in a cycle of constant promotions. Its third-quarter sales fell 2 per cent compared with last year, after dropping by the same amount in the second quarter, amid shrinking demand for its Gap and Banana Republic brands.It is closing 175 stores, leaving 800 in North America, and shedding head office staff as it seeks to to focus more closely on higher-growth areas such as e-commerce, factory outlet stores and international operations.Bridget Weishaar, an analyst at Morningstar, argues that once Gap has improved its supply chain and inventory management, and invested more in blending its online and bricks-and-mortar offerings, its 13 per cent average operating margin should start catching up with the high-teen levels seen at Inditex and H&M.All US clothing retailers are struggling with the same fundamental trend — the share of consumer spending devoted to apparel has fallen from 5.4 per cent in 1990 to 3.3 per cent last year.In the fight for that shrinking pie, Nordstrom has largely long been regarded as a winner.So its slowdown in same store sales growth to just 0.9 per cent in the third quarter took the market by surprise, not least because analysts approve of its business model, expansion plans and ecommerce arm.With little sign of rivals taking up the slack, and Macy’s warning that its full-year sales could fall as much as 3.1 per cent instead of the earlier forecast 1 per cent, Nordstrom’s surprise weakness suggested a “potential cautionary tale of the US consumers’ health”, wrote Deutsche Bank’s Mr Trussell.Nordstrom is slashing inventory and cutting costs, but analysts expect further challenges in the fourth quarter. This has weighed on its shares and bonds in the past week.But its troubles are not as great as those of Macy’s, whose struggle to lift sales on the back of investing in the in-store experience has left its credit default swaps trading at their widest in three years. Conlumino noted that Macy’s did not really have the financial muscle to upgrade all its stores, while it is also rolling out “off-price” stores, with lower-price ranges, to compete against Nordstrom’s off-rack stores and TJX, a growing area.“The wider truth is that Macy’s remains a business that is somewhat out of kilter with what modern consumers want,” Conlumino’s Mr Saunders said.Retailers face another threat besides the rise of ecommerce: back-breaking levels of debt.Companies in the sector have racked up nearly $183bn in debt to fund share buybacks, increase dividends and plot their expansions — more than double the level before the financial crisis and up 68 per cent from five years earlier, according to Barclays Indices.For the likes of Neiman Marcus, owner of the high-end Manhattan department store Bergdorf Goodman, the timing could not be worse. Executives find themselves using their cash to fund interest payments when analysts argue they should be investing in their underlying businesses to bolster sales.Neiman Marcus was forced to postpone a planned initial public offering this year amid wider market volatility, weighing on its $4.7bn in long-term debts.Previously, investors took the view that the gradual US recovery would allow retailers saddled with debt from leveraged buyouts — including Neiman Marcus, J Crew and Toys R Us — to begin to reduce their obligations. But with malaise hitting big rivals including Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s, a unit of Macy’s, upmarket Neiman has struggled to balance debt payments with its other priorities.The Texas-based retailer warned in September that same-store sales growth had slowed in its latest quarter, rising 1.9 per cent from a year earlier. In contrast, between fiscal 2012 and 2014 Neiman averaged comparable revenue growth of 6.1 per cent.“Retail is tough and it’s hard to make money,” Mary Bowers, portfolio manager with HSBC Global Asset Management, says. “In some of the more recent LBOs, the leverage was too high.”Bonds issued by the purveyor of posh offerings from Prada, Lanvin and Valentino have tumbled more than 10 per cent since the month began, last trading at 91.5 cents on the dollar.Executives keen to wean consumers off steep discounts have found the prospect daunting. Men’s Wearhouse, the suit seller that bought rival Jos A Bank last year for $1.8bn, fell into the same trap that befell JC Penney years earlier.The company has started to reduce the promotional blitz that drove men across the US to Jos A Bank stores: buy one, get three free. The unit’s same-store sales slid 14.6 per cent in the third quarter and are expected to decline as much as 25 per cent in the fiscal fourth as the number of customers to its stores dwindles.Bonds issued by the group have declined 25 per cent from a high in July, trading at 81 cents on the dollar, while its shares have plummeted more than 50 per cent.Debt investors are also growing concerned about other clothing chains as the prospect of a US rate rise looms. Yields on bonds issued by US retailers have climbed from 3 to 3.4 per cent since the beginning of the year.Analysts at Wells Fargo say that stores have been “less promotional” at the start of November than in past years as they attempt to break consumers out of their habit of waiting for a sale. But that may prove short lived as “elevated” inventory levels weigh on the sector, the bank adds.“We no longer have confidence,” is the view from analysts at Jefferies.

Its shares dropped 5.7 per cent to $28.50, leaving the stock down 32 per cent this year.Analysts at Mizuho did not try to sugarcoat their assessment of the fallout for Gap, which under Mr Larsson’s leadership has proved a bright spot in what remains a testing backdrop for US retailers.The exit of the executive was “a bad omen for Old Navy’s performance going forward (especially facing tougher compares)”, he said. “This is also, in our view, a major loss of brain trust for the company with both Gap and Banana Republic struggling to refine design and supply chain processes to regain footing in the softlines space.”Analysts at the Japanese bank cut their rating on Gap to underperform and lowered the price target to $26.Shares of the retailers swung in sharply different directions in what proved a strong finish to a testing quarter for US stock markets.The S&P 500 closed up 1.9 per cent at 1,920.03, but it is down 7 per cent for the quarter in its worst three-month showing since 2011. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, home to just 30 US companies, was 1.5 per cent firmer at 16,284.70 as the quarter drew to a close, but it has weakened 7.6 per cent during the quarter, marked by anxieties over a global slowdown.The Nasdaq Composite, the benchmark index for the world’s largest technology companies, closed up 2.3 per cent at 4,620.17, bringing its quarterly losses to 7.4 per cent.However, it was a technology company that was one of the biggest risers on Wednesday.Shares of Western Digital, a computer hard disk manufacturer, jumped 15.4 per cent to $79.44 after Unisplendour, a Chinese information technology company, took a stake in the company. The $3.8bn investment by Unisplendour, a subsidiary of state-backed Tsinghua Unigroup, is the latest in a string of deals by the acquisitive Chinese company.Steve Milligan, the chief executive of Western Digital, said the investment will “help facilitate our growth as we look to capitalise on the many opportunities and changes within the global storage industry”.Activist investing has been a key trend in US equity markets this year, and the final day of the quarter saw another company targeted.Shares in Advance Auto Parts surged 11.1 per cent to $189.53 after Starboard Value, an activist firm that has previously pushed Yahoo to make changes, disclosed a 3.7 per cent stake. The investment firm, which is led by Jeff Smith, urged Advance Auto to return more cash to shareholders and eye acquisitions as a means to fuel growth.richard.blackden@ft.comTwitter: @richardblackden
66;GPS;Gap Inc;2015-09-04T17:15:01Z;Caterpillar reverses on commodity worries;US stocks slide after jobs report leaves room for Fed to raise rates;Caterpillar shares slid on Friday after analysts at Baird grew gloomier on the company’s outlook as commodities remain under pressure amid China-driven volatility.They downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “outperform” and lowered their price target to $77 from $89.The bank took a more optimistic view on the stock earlier this year on “signs of stabilisation in key commodity categories” but argued on Thursday that their bull thesis was losing ground amid increasing turmoil in China.Those concerns “resulted in another leg down for commodities as questions surrounding demand added to excess supply concerns,” said Mircea Dobre, an analyst at Baird.A deterioration in mining, continued pressure on oil and gas prices and softening demand for construction equipment have made it challenging for bookings to rebound in the near term, according to Mr Dobre.Caterpillar derived 95 per cent of its 2014 revenue from sales of machinery and power systems.Mr Dobre pointed to recent comments from mining equipment maker Joy Global, saying the company confirmed further deterioration in the commodity space.On Thursday, Joy Global lowered its full-year outlook citing the rout in global commodities and slowing global growth.“Against this backdrop, upside from the resources business appears increasingly unlikely, while peer original equipment manufacturer commentary and results are suggesting that fundamentals can actually get worse rather than better in the near term (a combination of volume declines and price compression),” Mr Dobre said.Shares of Caterpillar, which have declined 20 per cent so far this year, fell nearly 2 per cent to $73.10.Gap shares declined 1.8 per cent to $32.41, after the retailer said same-store sales, a key industry metric, declined 2 per cent in August. This was worse than expectations for a 0.4 per cent drop.A breakdown of the retailer’s divisions showed that comparable sales were worse than expected at the Banana Republic and Gap brands, declining 11 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. Analysts had forecast a fall of 2.2 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively.Old Navy, however, topped forecasts with same-store sales rising 6 per cent last month.Shares of Vince Holdings, an upscale New York-based retailer with an urban aesthetic, fell 44 per cent to $5.22 after the company cut its full-year forecast.Vince now expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of 31 to 37 cents a share, below its previous outlook for 85 to 90 cents a share.For the year, the company projects sales in the range of $285m to $295m, lower than its previous guidance in the range of $340m to $350m. This missed expectations for $342.4m.The news came alongside a second-quarter loss of 14 cents a share, while sales fell 10 per cent to $80m, worse than analysts’ forecasts.Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported a profit of 14 cents a share, also shy of analysts’ estimates.BP shares fell more than 5 per cent to $30.70 in New York after analysts at Bank of America downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “neutral”.US stocks slid after the August jobs report left room for the Federal Reserve to raise rates this year.The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,921.22 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 16,102.38.

AP first reported the net closings.McDonald’s is grappling with changing consumer tastes in its domestic market, where smaller rivals perceived to be more healthy — such as Chipotle and Shake Shack — are growing. It has reported many declining monthly sales in the US for more than a year.But overextension as consumers’ palates change is not the problem of McDonald’s alone in the US, but an issue forcing some of the biggest brands in the US to rethink their place in corporate America.Many consumers have become more prudent with their disposable income as wages have stagnated since the financial crisis.Millennials, a prized demographic group in which US consumer companies and retailers are rushing to grasp market share, are displaying changing tastes not only by choosing healthier foods but also by opting for craft beer and new fashion retailers.Those that have been slow to meet the stylistic needs and shopping habits of twenty-somethings are also being forced to close stores. Gap announced this week it would shut 175 speciality stores in North America over the next few years, including 140 this fiscal year.Art Peck, Gap’s CEO, is aiming to increase productivity and improve consumers’ experience as its more conservative, or preppy, clothing appears to be missing the mark among millennials. J Crew is similarly trying to change after reporting a widening of its net loss in the first quarter.Steve Easterbrook, the new McDonald’s chief executive, has pledged to make the chain a “more modern, progressive burger company”, hoping to replicate globally the success he had in the UK and other European markets.Many analysts were underwhelmed by a plan he unveiled earlier this year, though McDonald’s shares have edged higher since the start of the year.Mr Easterbrook has been pulling in new executives to help implement the overhaul of its operations and image. Last week the group named Robert Gibbs, US President Barack Obama’s former press secretary, as its global communications officer.
68;GPS;Gap Inc;2015-06-17T10:23:12Z;Gap: not so fast;Strong peripheral brands can only do so much;"Maybe Glenn Murphy saw what was coming. Last October, Gap’s chief executive retired unexpectedly. The clothes retailer had ended a long period of stagnation under his leadership, and its shares doubled between late 2011 and mid-2013. News of his departure sent them down by a tenth. Through the end of 2014, they made up the loss, but this year the shares have fallen again, put under pressure by problems at the Gap’s eponymous brand.On Monday the company said it would close 175 US Gap stores in the next few years, bringing the total down to 500. Like-for-like sales at the chain have been falling fast. New boss Arthur Peck points to poor fashion choices in its womenswear lines.But there is a broader trend at play: Americans have developed a taste for inexpensive clothing. “Fast fashion” brands such as H&M, Uniqlo and Zara get their latest styles to stores within weeks and they are cheaper than the mid-tier offering in Gap brand shops. Gap’s own low-price unit, Old Navy, has grown sales from $6bn to nearly $7bn in the past three years, and turnover has surpassed Gap-branded stores.Little earnings per share growth is expected in 2015; a share buyback has not offset the effect of a strong US dollar and the US port strike on net income. Besides the strength of Old Navy, however, Gap can point to Athleta, a popular athletic wear chain that competes with Lululemon in a growing area. And while Gap is closing physical stores, it believes online sales (15 per cent of its total) can make up the difference.While Gap tries to sort out the issues at the flagship chain, Old Navy and Athleta can pick up the slack. That’s a benefit of diversification that other flailing retailers (J Crew and Abercrombie & Fitch, for example) may not enjoy. Old Navy and growth units such as Athleta serve as a cushion that keeps the stock from falling too sharply. But a large underperforming brand puts a lid on a share price, too.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

By close, Humana had taken the top spot with a 3.38 per cent fall.Shares of United Rentals, which have declined almost 16 per cent in the past year, fell more than 3 per cent to $87.93 in morning trading. The stock recovered to close at $88.79.The Stamford, Connecticut company is expected to experience lower levels of activity in the future, but projects under construction will continue in the near term, said Sameer Rathod, an analyst at Macquarie.United Rentals lowered its 2015 rental rate to 3 per cent, from its previous outlook for a 3.5 per cent year-on-year increase in April and maintained its utilisation rate, a measure of the time that equipment is rented, at 69 per cent.Mr Rathod said several engineering and construction companies have noted delays in projects in response to the decline in oil prices, which could hurt demand as projects wrap up and no new work begins. In turn he expects the company will have to cut its rental rate and utilisation guidance in the second or third quarter.Gap shares advanced 1.44 per cent to $38.75 after the retailer announced late on Monday that it would close about 175 of its namesake stores in North America over the next few years as it seeks to boost profitability at its Gap brand.About 140 of the closures are expected this fiscal year and will not affect Gap Outlet and Gap Factory stores. Gap also plans to shut some of its European stores.The San Francisco company said it would also cut staff by 250 at its headquarters, primarily in North America.Gap said it expected to save $25m a year starting in 2016 from the restructuring, although the store closures are projected to cut $300m from sales. It reaffirmed its full-year outlook for earnings to range between $2.75 and $2.80 a share.Under Armour shares advanced nearly 2 per cent to $82.78, after the retailer said it would create a new class of stock in an attempt to maintain the influence of Kevin Plank, its founder and chief executive.Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals jumped 50.3 per cent to $19.94 after the US Food and Drug Administration allowed the company to shift the goalposts in a trial to test its Rhopressa eyedrop.The stock was also buoyed after analysts at Needham upgraded it to “buy” from “hold” with a $27 price target.US stocks edged higher as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day monetary policy setting meeting on Tuesday.By close of trading on Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.57 per cent to 2,096.37, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 17,903.98.

70;GPS;Gap Inc;2015-05-12T21:59:26Z;Gap shares slip as same-store sales miss forecasts;Broad market under pressure from bond volatility;Shares of Gap declined after the retailer said same-store sales slid at two of its largest divisions in April and missed Wall Street forecasts.The San Francisco-based group, which also owns the Old Navy and Banana Republic brands, reported a decline of 15 per cent for same-store sales from a year earlier at its eponymous brand, in contrast to expectations for a 10.5 per cent fall.Comparable sales at Old Navy slipped 6 per cent, while sales at Banana Republic slid 15 per cent. Analysts had forecast declines of 5.6 and 6.2 per cent respectively.Overall same-store sales, a key industry metric, fell 12 per cent in April. The results underlined the challenge facing newly installed chief executive Art Peck.While Gap’s Old Navy division has fared relatively well recently, a dispute at West Coast ports this year left the retailer without key merchandise ahead of Easter — a busy shopping season in the US.“We are concerned that Gap will get worse before it gets better, with material impact on the assortment not expected until next spring,” said Janice Ong, an analyst at UBS.Gap added that it expected to report fiscal first-quarter earnings between 55 and 56 cents a share.Gap shares, which have declined 6 per cent in the past year, fell 3.79 per cent to $38.36.Shares in Juno Therapeutics ended down 0.26 per cent to $45.46, after the biopharmaceutical company said it would burn through between $125m and $150m this year and that it had nearly $450m in cash at the end of the first quarter.Juno, which aims to fight cancer by extracting a patient’s blood and re-engineering its T-cells to fight tumours, went public late last year.Adjusting for one-time items, including certain research and development expenses, the company reported a loss of 30 cents a share, which was narrower than forecasts for a loss of 42 cents a share.Juno has yet to generate sales, and highlighted that in its prospectus ahead of its initial public offering late last year, but analysts say revenues could reach $335m by 2019.Shares of Ocean Rig UDW, an international contractor of offshore drilling services, rose 13.10 per cent to $7.61, after the company reported first-quarter results that beat expectations. Ocean Rig reported profits of $41.1m or 31 cents a share, ahead of estimates for 6 cents a share. Sales rose 11 per cent to $402.1m, exceeding expectations.Shares of Rackspace Hosting fell 13.50 per cent to $45.96, after the web hosting group forecast second-quarter sales that missed estimates. The San Antonio, Texas-based company said sales would rise between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent from the first three months of the year, shy of consensus forecasts for a 4.3 per cent gain. The company’s first-quarter results were in line with expectations.American Apparel said it would raise as much as $10m in a share sale, as its first-quarter losses widened, sending shares of the retailer 4.88 per cent lower to $0.56.US stocks declined for a second straight day as volatile government debt markets in Europe and the US rattled investor sentiment.The S&P 500 declined 0.29 per cent to 2,099.12, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.2 per cent to 18,068.23, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.35 per cent to 4,976.19.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
71;GPS;Gap Inc;2015-04-10T16:46:30Z;Gap shares fall on sales disappointment;Netflix boosted by broker upgrade as S&P 500 edges higher;Gap was among the worst performing stocks on the US benchmark after the retailer behind brands including Old Navy and Banana Republic reported a larger than expected decline in same-store sales at its eponymous brand.The retailer reported a 7 per cent decline in global same-store sales in March, a key industry metric that compares sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, at its namesake brand. This was worse than Wall Street’s forecasts for a 3.5 per cent fall.Sales at Banana Republic fell 3 per cent, worse than expectations for a 0.4 per cent gain.The declines were offset by a 14 per cent gain in comparable sales at Old Navy that eclipsed analysts’ estimates. This helped overall Gap sales rise 2 per cent, ahead of expectations for a 0.5 per cent gain.While overall comparable sales beat forecasts, they disappointed investors as they were not “positive enough” despite the earlier timing of the Easter holiday shopping period.“With the reversal of the Easter shift likely to weigh on April and fundamentals at the Gap brand remaining challenged, we remain fairly cautious on this stock,” Ike Boruchow, an analyst at Sterne Agee, said.The company installed insider Art Peck at the helm earlier this year in an effort to revive sales.Gap shares, which have climbed 5 per cent in the past year, declined nearly 4 per cent to $41.14.Netflix shares climbed after the online streaming service behind shows like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Daredevil and House of Cards, was upgraded by analysts at Citi.Analysts raised their rating of the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and increased their price target from $409 to $525, saying the recent decline in share price was probably “due to competition concerns that we don’t share, provides an opportunity for long-term bulls” and that international markets offer a significant opportunity.Mr May is bullish that the company can grow its paying streaming subscribers from 57m in two or three countries now, to 130m by 2020 from more than a dozen countries.“The content line-up is improved in 2015 and recently released content is getting good reviews, both of which bode well for subscriber growth,” Mark May, an analyst at Citi said.Shares in Netflix climbed 3.4 per cent to $454.57.General Electric shares climbed 11 per cent to $28.51 after the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company unveiled plans to sell the majority of GE Capital, its finance business, over the next two years and to focus on its manufacturing business.GE announced the sale of nearly all of its GE Capital property assets to funds managed by Blackstone and to Wells Fargo, for about $26.5bn. The company also said it expects 90 per cent of its earnings to be generated by its industrial business in 2018, up from 58 per cent last year.Industrials were the best performing sector on the benchmark index driven by the rally in shares of General Electric.The S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 2,102.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 18,057.65.

72;GPS;Gap Inc;2015-03-18T16:11:38Z;US ports: Gridlock on the waterfront;Unless terminals modernise, American importers and exporters face higher costs than their rivals;The MSC Renée, whose sheer black sides loom over the wharf at Pier 400, the US’s biggest container terminal, is an emblem of modernity and efficiency. At 366m long, the ship is enormous, capable of carrying 13,000 containers full of goods between Asia and the US west coast. But the superior economics of the MSC Renée’s immense size and hyper fuel-efficient engines have ebbed away since it hit the port in Los Angeles.In theory, the light blue cranes at Pier 400 should be able to whisk the containers from the vessel and reload it within four days. Instead, it will linger for a week because Pier 400 cannot provide enough dockworkers — the result of an antiquated system for assigning workers to the port’s terminals. The return trip, carrying American exports to China, will be delayed.The MSC Renée and Pier 400 are suffering from a slowdown at ports in California, Oregon and Washington that has clogged some of the country’s most vital trade arteries since October. The congestion disrupted production at US car factories, led to shortages of French fries at Japanese McDonald’s franchises and prompted a profit warning from Gap. The port congestion cut US gross domestic product by $40bn in December alone, analysts at Deutsche Bank estimate.The dispute over a new labour contract was settled last month, but the problem of congestion and inefficiency at the west coast ports remains. After years of failing to invest in the latest, most sophisticated equipment, they are falling far behind ports in other regions — Asia in particular. Ships are growing ever larger to handle more goods, but US ports struggle to accommodate them. And infrastructure around the ports — rail lines and roads — is under strain.Failure to come to grips with these problems could have profound consequences. Unless the ports’ record improves, US importers and exporters face higher costs than their international competitors for moving goods. They also risk the repetition of events of recent months, when perishable goods have rotted while waiting for export and imports have arrived too late for retailers. Above all, they face the prolonged uncertainty of knowing that even a minor disruption might break the ports’ fragile link in their supply chains.During the recent slowdowns, shipping lines began to use alternative routes, with goods from Asia travelling to the US east coast by way of the Panama and Suez canals or through Canadian ports. But the long line of anchored ships waiting in San Pedro Bay to dock at Los Angeles and Long Beach — which handle 40 per cent of US container traffic — serves as a reminder of how many shipping lines still depend on the most direct trans-Pacific route.“We’re getting worse, slower and more expensive,” says Dan Smith, of Tioga Group, a transportation consultancy. “The volume and complexity here in southern California have made the problems most obvious here.”The question — for the US and world economies as well as those directly involved in shipping — is whether frustration over the latest crisis will translate into significant reform, bringing west coast ports’ productivity closer to that of the world’s best facilities.Mario Cordero, head of the Federal Maritime Commission, which oversees the US’s seaborne trade, called for the maritime industry to start taking shippers’ complaints about US ports’ high costs and poor reliability more seriously. “It’s time to move towards substantive solutions,” Mr Cordero says.Carrying more containersThe MSC Renée’s presence illustrates the challenges. The popularity of alternative routes from Asia to the US means that container traffic at the San Pedro ports rose only a relatively modest 15.6 per cent between 2004 and 2014. But the cargo increasingly travels in vessels like MSC Renée that can carry about 50 per cent more containers than the biggest ships just five years ago.For the terminals, this trend has created new challenges. Some days they are underworked, but on others their capacity is strained by the task of finding space for 10,000 just-unloaded containers. Such spikes in traffic are rendering obsolete an old industry saying that operators should not build terminals for peak traffic — or “build the church for Easter Sunday”.“Now we’re getting two Easter Sundays a week at some terminals,” Mr Smith says.Shipping lines have rushed to form alliances — similar to those struck between airlines — to scrape together enough cargo to fill the bigger vessels. The MSC Renée is carrying cargo both for its owner — Mediterranean Shipping Company, operator of the world’s second-biggest container ship fleet — and Maersk Line, operator of the biggest. The two co-operate in the 2M vessel-sharing alliance. Pier 400 is operated by another arm of the AP Møller-Maersk Group that owns Maersk Line.One industry executive says few anticipated how disruptive these alliances would be for the ports. “I don’t think anybody realised when these new alliances came in [that they] would blow up the harbour when you start bringing multiple lines into your terminal,” he says. “Your terminal becomes less efficient.”Productivity problemJon Slangerup, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach, the public sector body that owns the port land, says the slowdown by the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union — which cut the number of crane operators it sent to terminals by two-thirds from late October — hit the terminals just as the end of the pre-Christmas season might have eased congestion.The union says the problems stemmed from the existing congestion, which it blames on employers’ under-investment. It cut crane operator numbers, it says, because amid the severe congestion only the most experienced staff could work safely. Productivity in many ports fell by 40 per cent. It has slowly returned to normal since a tentative contract deal was agreed on February 20.“Just as you would normally be digging out from the mess . . . labour then decided to be the big contributing factor [to congestion],” Mr Slangerup says.To avoid future crises, all the many parties involved in each shipment — including shipping lines, terminal operators, truckers, railroads and the shippers that own the cargo — need to co-operate better, most participants agree. Mr Slangerup says the present arrangement is “highly fragmented”.“All of them have information content and hardly any of it is shared,” he says.Another, less welcome, development could ease the west coast ports’ congestion problem: losing market share. The operators of the Panama Canal had expected to add at least five extra weekly container ship services for the US east coast once its expansion is completed next year, on top of the 10 Asia-US ships that use the canal each week. But it might add a further two new weekly services as shipping lines try to get away from the west coast, says Jorge Quijano, administrator of the Panama Canal.“We will be ready to do what we can to attract whatever amount of cargo is there,” he says.Additional capacityThe key to the southern California ports’ future may lie in the scene unfolding five miles from Pier 400, in a part of Long Beach known as Middle Harbor, where gantry cranes that will stack and sort containers are being tested in preparation for the opening of the new Long Beach Container Terminal, scheduled for this summer.According to Mr Slangerup, whose organisation is investing $1.3bn in the project, the facility will open up significant new capacity. Because it will be almost entirely automated, it will require 40 to 45 per cent fewer workers per container moved than existing facilities.It should also help Long Beach improve its productivity, which is good by US standards but poor by comparison with the world’s best. In 2013, Long Beach terminals moved an average of 88 containers on and off ships every hour, according to research by the JOC Group. The figure — the best in the US — is well behind the 130 moves per hour of Tianjin, in northern China.“It creates a perfect opportunity for the Port of Long Beach to have both the latest and the greatest demonstration of container handling,” Mr Slangerup says.Despite the labour shortages, Pier 400 is already the most efficient terminal on the US west coast, averaging 96 moves per hour in the JOC study. However, Mr Trombley already seems to be looking ahead to a time when the bulk of loading and unloading ships at the port will be done by machines.“We’ll continue to push as much technology through this facility as we can, to the point where the next step is something bigger and better, which is automation,” Mr Trombley says.For the moment, no new operator is working toward full automation, apparently out of fear of provoking the union. While the ILWU formally agreed to greater automation in 2008, there was conflict last year over the introduction of automation at Los Angeles’s TraPac Terminal, owned by Japan’s Mitsui OSK. It was resolved only with an agreement to keep more workers employed than had been planned. Without sharp reductions in worker numbers, the significant investments required for such projects — Hong Kong’s OOCL is investing $600m in the new Long Beach Container Terminal — make little sense.Yet the view from Angels Gate Park, overlooking San Pedro Bay, illustrates why automation and other efficiency measures are becoming urgent. Stretched towards the horizon are nearly 30 container ships, the sun catching on their splashes of white paint, each carrying thousands of containers and tens of millions of dollars of goods.Mr Slangerup insists that investments such as Middle Harbor and in new rail terminals should prevent similar scenes in future. The ILWU has been co-operating with the projects, Mr Slangerup insists. “I think they do understand the incentives,” he adds.Others, privately, would like a confrontation with the ILWU and regret that February’s settlement was reached without one. This reflects the uneasy sense that the industry’s inefficiency makes it vulnerable to disruption.Tim Simpson, US communications director for Maersk Line, says the industry should recognise it is ripe for challenges from innovative competitors. “The challenge is going to be for the parties in the industry to start taking a hard look at changing . . . the antiquated way we run our businesses,” he says.***Size matters: Bigger vessels hold key to American efficiency driveThe largest container ships in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are some of the biggest ever built. But these vessels, capable of carrying 13,000 or more 20-foot equivalent units of containers, are still not as big as the ships some shipping lines would like to see docking at the ports.On routes between Asia and European ports — where there are fewer concerns about terminals’ efficiency — the biggest ship currently operating, the MSC Oscar (pictured), measures 395m (1,297ft) long by 59m (194ft). The vessel, operated by Mediterranean Shipping Company, can carry 19,224 TEUs of containers. One TEU equates to the smallest size of standard container in current use.The size of the vessels illustrates how far the industry in recent years has pushed some fundamental truths about shipping economics. As long as the ship is reasonably full, the costs per container of operating a single large vessel are far lower than those for operating two smaller ships of the same total capacity.Yet, as recently as 2004 the Port of Long Beach was trumpeting how it was receiving an 8,500-TEU vessel, then the world’s biggest. It was only in 1988 that APL took the step of deploying a 4,600 TEU container ship that was the first to be too large to transit the Panama Canal. The first container ship — the IdealX, which sailed from Newark to Houston in 1956 — carried just 58 35ft-long containers, equivalent to about 100 TEUs.The speeding up of ship-to-shore cranes and advances in information technology have been critical in the rapid growth of container ships. But it remains unclear how big they will grow before shipping lines decide that the constraints of their size outweigh the benefits of their efficiency. The newest terminal at Long Beach’s Middle Harbor has been built to handle 22,000 TEU vessels.Steven Trombley, managing director of Long Beach’s Pier 400, the US’s biggest container terminal, says his terminal is constantly “pushing the envelope” to improve efficiency.“We want to continue to bring big boats in here. But, if the cargo doesn’t move, we’re in big trouble,” he says.

Once a staple of American culture in the 1980s and 1990s, retail foot traffic during the November-December holiday season halved from nearly 35bn in 2010 to 17.6bn in 2013, according to ShopperTrak.But look behind the headline numbers, and it becomes clear that not all malls are equal. Since 2007, the asset value of luxury, or so-called “A+” malls like the Westchester, has nearly doubled. The values of lower-tier “C” and “D” malls were slightly negative, according to Green Street Advisors, a real estate consultancy.This divergence explains US mall ownerSimon Property’s hostile $22.4bn bid for Macerich, a smaller rival, last week.Although it is just a quarter of Simon’s size in both enterprise value and rental income, Macerich has restructured itself around luxury malls by selling off underperforming property — and booking more than $1bn in pre-tax profit last year in the process.Macerich said it made 85 per cent of its 2014 operating income from what it calls “super zip codes” — where the median household income hovers around $120,000 and more than two-thirds of adults have a university degree. This is up from 66 per cent three years earlier.When we do well, we do really wellSimon’s bid is a “battle to own the best, most high-end malls in the country”, says David Auerbach, a Reit trader at Esposito Securities.Macerich, which did not respond to requests for comment, has said it would review what it described as an “unsolicited, conditional” proposal from Simon, which is at a 30 per cent premium to Macerich’s undisturbed share price.The imperative of owning luxury properties is apparent at the Galleria, a “C” ranked mall less than a kilometre from the Westchester.The dimly lit, gritty complex, anchored by Sears and Old Navy, stands in stark contrast to the carpeted, shiny corridors of its posh rival.A square foot of retail space at the Galleria generates just $310 a year, compared with $1,085 at the Westchester Mall. Employees at American Eagle, Old Navy and Aéropostale say the mall is less busy than a year ago and shoppers seem to spend less money.15%Number of US malls expected to fail or be converted to non-retail in the next decadeAcross the US, “C” and “D” malls make up about a third of the some 1,100 malls by number, but only 5 per cent by value. In the next decade, some 15 per cent of US malls will fail or be converted to non-retail property, according to Green Street Advisors, most of which would be lower-tier malls.Much of this divergence is due to rising US income inequality, which has “affected everything in malls”, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, an investment bank.Luxury and lower-tier malls are hurt by online shopping in different ways.“Luxury malls are golden, but the question is, where does the middle class shop? Cheaper alternatives, Walmart, TJMaxx and online deals, they’re off the mall,” he says.The Westchester, for example, is home to jewellery and accessories stores such as Tiffany, Louis Vuitton and Dooney & Bourke. People buying an expensive watch, for example, are more likely to want to visit the store and see the product, says Simeon Siegel, research director at Nomura.For the teen clothing brands at the Galleria such as Aéropostale and Old Navy, by contrast, there is much less reason not to shop online.Wealthy Americans are also simply spending more as the economy recovers. Same-store sales at luxury brands — including Michael Kors — have grown by double digits in the past few years.Abercrombie & Fitch’s US same-store sales fell 10 per cent for the November through January period, while Aéropostale’s dropped 9 per cent. Same-store sales at traditional “mall stores” such as Express and Ann Taylor have declined for three consecutive quarters.For stores like Michael Kors, strong demand from the wealthy will probably shield it from the threat of ecommerce and drop in overall traffic, say analysts.“I don’t know why it is [that fewer people are visiting the mall],” Kevin says. “But don’t get me wrong — when we do well, we do really well.”

The forecast included a 13 cent hit related to the delayed merchandise that is sitting at West Coast ports, as well as a 16 cent negative effect from the dollar’s strength.Without the two, Gap’s guidance would straddle the $3.07 per share forecast analysts on Wall Street had expected.There has been gridlock at the nation’s ports since last November, as members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union failed to reach an agreement with employers. A tentative five-year deal struck last weekend must still win a vote from members of the union and port owners, represented by the Pacific Maritime Association.The outlook accompanied Gap’s fourth-quarter earnings results, which eclipsed projections. Profits in the three months to the end of January climbed 4 per cent to $319m, or 75 cents a share. Sales, which had already been announced, rose 3 per cent in the period to $4.7bn.Art Peck, the recently installed chief executive, said: “Looking ahead at 2015, we will continue executing our global growth strategy, bringing new digital capabilities to life and making the shifts necessary to consistently deliver the brand-right, emotional product that our customers expect from all of our brands.”The company’s shares climbed 3 per cent in after-hours trading.
75;GPS;Gap Inc;2014-11-21T17:40:35Z;Gap sags under weight of falling sales;Hertz higher after appointing new chief;Declining third-quarter same store sales, disappointing guidance and a management shake-up all combined to weigh on shares of Gap, making it one of the worst performers on the US benchmark on Friday.Gap, whose portfolio includes Old Navy, Banana Republic and its eponymous brand, reported a 2 per cent decline in same store sales, in line with expectations. Same store sales in its Old Navy line unexpectedly beat forecasts, rising 1 per cent, but slipped 5 per cent in Gap.The retailer reported net income of $351m or 80 cents a share in the three months through November 1, topping expectations for 78 cents a share. Sales of $3.97bn were in line with expectations.The retailer also lowered its full-year earnings forecast to $2.73-$2.78 a share, below its previous forecast for $2.95-$3.00 a share. Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.91 a share.“While Gap has managed the business well through a very choppy retail environment, it seems they are running out of expense opportunities at the same time that Gap Brand does not appear to be poised for a turnround,” Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said.Alongside Thursday’s results, Arthur Peck, who is set to take over from chief executive Glenn Murphy in February, announced new global brand presidents at Gap and Banana Republic.Shares in Gap slipped 4 per cent to $38.46, pushing the year-to-date decline to nearly 2 per cent.The announcement of a new chief executive pushed Hertz shares up 4 per cent to $38.46. Late Thursday, the US car rental company said John Tague, a former executive with United Airlines, would be its next chief executive.Hertz had previously reached an agreement with activist investor Carl Icahn to put three directors of his choosing on its board. Two directors picked by Mr Icahn were part of the board’s search committee that oversaw the process.Hertz has said it will have to restate its 2012 and 2013 financial results after it found accounting errors in June.Sotheby's gained 7 per cent to $41.93, after the auction house announced that its chief executive Bill Ruprecht would step down.Activist investor Dan Loeb had previously launched a campaign against Mr Ruprecht’s management style and called for his resignation. Mr Ruprecht will continue to be at the helm of the company until the right candidate has been found.GameStop was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P 500, after the company reported third-quarter earnings and sales that fell short of Wall Street expectations. The retailer reported a 2.3 per cent decline in same store sales, below expectations for a 4.7 per cent gain.The company also issued fourth quarter and full-year earnings per share guidance that fell short of estimates. GameStop shares tumbled 13 per cent to $37.86.Global stocks were buoyed after the People’s Bank of China loosened policy, saying it would cut one-year benchmark lending rates by 40 basis points to 5.6 per cent and lower one-year benchmark deposit rates by 25 basis points to 2.75 per cent.The S&P 500 gained 0.5 per cent to 2,063.50, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,810.06.

Both had denied the charges.Prosecutors told the trial that as each deal between JJB and Mr Ball and Mr Barrington’s companies took place, a “tranche of money” went to Mr Ronnie which he failed to disclose to the board.Mr Ronnie owed around £11m to Kaupthing after he purchased a 30 per cent stake in JJB funded by the bank.However, he produced loan documents to Kaupthing signed by himself and David Ball purporting to show he was in receipt of a loan from Mr Ball’s Fashion and Sport company which were “faked” and a “fiction”, the trial heard.Mr Ball and Mr Barrington were instrumental in trying to delete emails as the SFO began its investigation into the sportswear deals, the trial heard.Their attempts were foiled by a computer engineer whom they asked to wipe their emails. He considered their request “odd”, kept a copy and later gave it to the SFO.Ball was cleared of two counts of furnishing false information but the jury were unable to reach a verdict on a further false information allegation against him.The trio will be sentenced on December 12 by Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith.

Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.29 a share on sales of $17.1bn.PepsiCo lifted its full-year earnings growth forecast to 9 per cent from a previous projection of 8 per cent.“While there has been some underlying expectation for, perhaps, somewhat bigger news with these results, we believe that the top- and bottom-line beat along with a full year EPS guidance raise should be enough to allow the stock to continue to grind higher,” Michael Branca, an analyst at Barclays, said.Shares of Destination Maternity slipped 5 per cent to $14.64 after the maker of maternity clothes issued a profit warning.The company said it now expects full-year earnings between 81 and 86 cents a share, as much as 33 per cent below earlier guidance.Shares of Apple advanced 0.2 per cent to $101.02 after analysts at Oppenheimer raised their rating on the stock to “outperform” from “market perform” with a price target of $115.Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn called on Apple to boost its share buyback programme in a letter to chief executive Tim Cook.Apple responded curtly that they “always appreciate hearing from our shareholders”.Shares of United Continental climbed 3 per cent to $45.04 after the company said third-quarter passenger revenue climbed between 3.5 and 4 per cent from a year earlier.Analysts at Deutsche Bank increased their third-quarter and full-year earnings expectations for United following the results.The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,928.21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2 per cent to 16,659.25 and the Nasdaq Composite eased 2 per cent to 4,378.34.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

The group’s digital leader Art Peck, who joined Gap in 2005, will assume his role on February 1 2015, and will join the company’s board.Mr Peck’s current title as growth, innovation and digital president has given him responsibility for omni-channel and e-commerce operations as well as fledgling brands such as Athleta and Intermix. Under Mr Peck, online sales across all of Gap’s brands rose 21.5 per cent last year to $2.26bn.He previously led Gap’s North American division and spent 20 years at Boston Consulting Group, where he focused on technology, consumer products and retail.The announcement came as the group reported September sales of $1.48bn, up just 1 per cent from the same five weeks of 2013. Mr Murphy said the month had “proved more challenging than expected”, adding that the group would “work aggressively to make sure our entire portfolio of brands delivers to its potential.”In its most recent quarter, namesake label The Gap posted negative same-store sales of 5 per cent, the group’s Banana Republic brand same-store sales were flat, while Old Navy’s comparable sales were up 4 per cent.Gap – best known for its casual denim and khaki pants – has been expanding into emerging markets to offset falling sales at home in the face of fierce competition from cheaper, fast fashion rivals such as Uniqlo and Zara. In August it announced plans to open 40 stores in India, following recent rollouts in Brazil, Hungary, Paraguay and Costa Rica.On Wednesday Mr Murphy was praised for expanding the group’s presence into 50 countries and for targeted acquisitions of smaller-scale brands that showed good growth potential. During his tenure, Gap said, the company delivered a total shareholder return of more than 160 per cent.“He’s created the path forward for the smooth and seamless transition our shareholders and employees deserve,” said Bob Fisher, whose parents founded the company 35 years ago. “Art Peck is an inspiring leader who thinks big, brings out the best in people, and understands how retail is changing today,” he added.Mr Fisher will assumed the position of non-executive chairman on Mr Murphy’s retirement.Mr Murphy told investors and media on a conference call he would work with the company on an “orderly leadership transition”. He added that he had no plans beyond January, but had felt he could not make the long-term commitment to Gap that was needed for its next stage of growth.

He invested part of the three payments in a Florida property, the jury heard.Mr Ronnie also faces two counts of transferring criminal property and two counts of furnishing false information in relation to “faked” loan documents to Icelandic bank Kaupthing.He is standing trial alongside David Ball and David Barrington, who worked for sportswear suppliers Performance Brands, as well as Fashion and Sport Ltd, which dealt with JJB as it purchased the Travel Fox brands and Old Navy clothing stock.Mr Ronnie allegedly received two payments of $380,000 and $250,000 from Fashion and Sport, and his company Seacroft received £650,000 from Performance Brands, the court heard.Mr Ball and Mr Barrington deny two counts of perverting the course of justice. Mr Ball also denies three counts of furnishing false information.Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the jury that it was the SFO’s case “that payments . . . [which] went over to Mr Ronnie were connected to transactions going on between JJB Sports and companies related to the other two defendants at the time”.Ms Moore said of Mr Ronnie: “The allegation is during this period of his tenure he or his company Seacroft Management received three payments totalling just over £1m.”She alleged that “as each transaction” between JJB and Mr Ball and Mr Barrington’s companies took place so did “a tranche of money to Mr Ronnie” which he “should have disclosed to his board and he failed to do so”.In the case of two money transfers originating from Mr Ronnie’s company Seacroft, Ms Moore told the jury it was a matter for them to decide. “Is it criminal money or is it perfectly all right,” she told them.Mr Ronnie, who owed about £11m to Kaupthing as he had bought a 30 per stake in JJB funded by the Icelandic bank, had to produce updated statements of his assets and liabilities for the bank so they could see how much he was worth, Ms Moore told the court.However, loan documents produced by Mr Ronnie to Kaupthing and signed by himself and Mr Ball purporting to show he was in receipt of a loan from Mr Ball’s Fashion and Sport company were “ a fiction” and “faked”, Ms Moore alleged.Ms Moore also told the court that when the Serious Fraud Office began to look into the Travel Fox and JJB deals, Mr Ball and Mr Barrington “withheld or got rid of” material related to that time, including emails.However, the men “failed because of one computer engineer”, she told the court.The IT engineer brought in to “wipe their emails” considered their request “odd” and while he wiped the emails, he “kept a copy and gave it to the Serious Fraud Office”, Ms Moore told the court.The jury trial, which is set to last eight weeks, continues.

Several economists argued the data would moderate any hawkish shift at the US central bank.Since January, the S&P 500 utilities index has lagged behind only the healthcare sector, rising 14 per cent.The payroll figures moderately lowered expectations that the US central bank would increase rates by March next year, as eurodollar futures for the date rose.“While the data is a significant disappointment, most participants will want to place the numbers in the context of a string of strong numbers,” Alan Ruskin, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said. “Nonetheless, this is the kind of data that staves off risks of a more hawkish Fed at the September Federal Open Market Committee.”Barclays strategists note the utility sector is the most negatively correlated sector to higher interest rates. Investors tend to use utilities as a proxy for the bond market as most companies in the sector have stable dividend yields, Barclays says.NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $30.99, Xcel Energy rose 2 per cent to $32.41, PG&E advanced 2 per cent to $47.90 and American Electric Power increased 1 per cent to $53.68. In afternoon trading, the 30 utility stocks on the S&P 500 were all higher.Strategists with RBC Capital Markets added the strong August rebound, which sent stocks to record heights, was showing evidence of a peak. The benchmark S&P 500, for instance, has struggled for direction over the past four days and has ended lower on most.“Rapid sector rotation is likely to remain the dominant technical theme within the equity market, consistent with the pattern of the last few years,” RBC’s Robert Sluymer said.Michael Kors shares were under pressure after it said Sportswear Holdings would sell its remaining stake in the company.Sportswear was the largest shareholder with a 52 per cent stake when Michael Kors first went public.Michael Kors shares fell 4 per cent to $76.67, although analysts with Wells Fargo said the sale could benefit the company if it chose to purchase its Chinese licensing rights, which are jointly held by Sportwear, Michael Kors himself and chief executive John Idol.“There are fewer conflicts of interest, and it seems less likely the price paid will be biased [to be too high],” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Gap followed Michael Kors lower, declining 5 per cent to $44.29, after the retailer said same-store sales at its Old Navy, Banana Republic and namesake chain missed Wall Street forecasts in August.Overall, same-store sales fell 2 per cent, compared with expectations for a 1.7 per cent gain. The company blamed its Gap brand for the weak results, where comparable sales fell 6 per cent – more than offsetting an improvement at Old Navy.Analysts with FBR Capital Markets warned increased clearance items could weigh on margins, despite new autumn apparel arriving in stores this September.Rival mall-based retailers also declined on Friday. Urban Outfitters fell 2 per cent to $39.27, American Eagle slipped 2 per cent to $14.16 and Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1 per cent to $40.70.US discount retailer Family Dollar slid after it said it had rejected a sweetened $9.1bn bid from rival Dollar General, citing competition concerns.Shares in Family Dollar fell 1 per cent to $79.01, Dollar General declined 3 per cent to $62.67 and Dollar Tree rose less than 1 per cent to $55.26.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 17,088.09.

At least four analysts raised their target price after the company reported better than expected sales and profits on Thursday.Net income for the three months ended August 2 rose 12 per cent to $239m, while sales increased 7 per cent to $2.7bn. Comparable store sales, the industry’s key metric, rose 2 per cent.The California retailer has benefited from the consumer trend for bargain hunting. Operating margin for the quarter increased 14 per cent, driven by higher merchandise gross margins and tighter cost controls.The company, valued at $15.6bn, forecast annual earnings per share between $4.18 and $4.26, up from $3.88 the year prior.Strong earnings also lifted a number of other retailers, despite a slightly weak performance on the S&P 500. By close, the S&P retail index had gained 0.7 per cent, compared to the S&P 500’s loss of 0.2 per cent.Shares in Foot Locker reached an all-time intraday high of $55, after the New York-based footwear company beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings.Foot Locker reported profits of $92m, a 39 per cent jump from results a year ago, due to healthy sales of basketball and running shoes. Foot Locker’s second quarter sales grew 13 per cent to $1.64bn, compared to analyst forecasts of $1.57bn.Investors have remained steadily bullish on Foot Locker, pushing the company’s share price up about 30 per cent since the start of the year and closer to 60 per cent in the past 12 months.Gap topped earnings expectations, sending the company’s stock 5 per cent higher, as the fashion chain also announced an expansion into India to capitalise on stronger demand from emerging markets for Western-style clothing.Gap is trying to fill the hole of slowing sales in North America by pushing into Asia; the company said in April it expected sales in China to triple in the next three years.Gap raised its full-year profit forecast to $2.95-$3.00 per share, from $2.90-$2.95 per share. The retailer also reported profits of $332m, or 75 cents per share, compared to analyst forecasts for 69 cents per share.But not all retailers managed a positive week. Aéropostale fell 10 per cent to $3.52 on Friday. The company reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Thursday and same-store sales fell 13 per cent. On Tuesday, the company’s shares rose 20 per cent after it reappointed its former chief executive Julian Geiger to lead the company.Ann Taylor also disappointed investors by cutting its sales outlook, pushing its stock down 3 per cent to $37.52.The clothing company continued to suffer from weak sales as consumers cut back on spending, although it did meet Wall Street expectations for profits.Several energy stocks were down as oil prices dropped slightly primarily due to increased supplies and easing geopolitical tensions.Transocean fell 2 per cent to $37.97, Cabot fell 1.5 per cent to $33.00 and Hess dropped 1 per cent to $98.81. Nabor Industries fell 2 per cent to $25.29 and Diamond Offshore dropped 2 per cent to $43.21.Shares in US electricity provider Dynegy, however, rose 9 per cent to $32.32 on news of a $6.25bn deal for a series of power plants from Duke Energy and a set of assets from Energy Capital.The company, which emerged from bankruptcy less than two years ago, forecast purchases would “significantly improve” its financial outlook by tripling its 2015 adjusted ebitda. Shares in Duke Energy were little changed at $72.87.Overall US equities were mixed following a speech on the US economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,988.41, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average loss 0.2 per cent at 17,001.22. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 4,538.55."
82;GPS;Gap Inc;2014-08-21T20:04:00Z;Gap to open 40 stores in India;;Gap is moving in to India’s fast growing market for Western-style apparel with plans to open 40 stores from 2015 – in the latest example of its aggressive expansion into emerging markets.The San Francisco-based fashion chain said it had entered into an agreement with a franchise partner, Arvind Lifestyle Brand Limited, to roll out the stores next spring, starting in India’s two largest cities: Mumbai and New Delhi.Gap’s comparable sales in the latest quarter released on Thursday were flat, weighed down by a 5 per cent slide in sales to $1.47bn for the Gap Global clothing brand. In the US, Gap Global net sales fell 5 per cent to $850m, compared to $894m in the same three month period to August 3 a year earlier.Gap – best known for its casual denim and khaki pants – has been expanding into emerging markets to offset falling sales at home, in the face of fierce competition from cheaper, fast fashion rivals such as Uniqlo and Zara.Last year, it opened its first stores in Brazil, as well as in Hungary, Paraguay, Peru and Costa Rica. In July, the US group also unveiled plans to enter Austria and Slovenia – giving it a presence in 44 markets.“For us, India is the last major market without an international shopping experience and an important next step in our global expansion strategy,” said Stefan Laban, senior vice-president of Gap International. “We’ve been looking to expand there for a number of years but only now do we really feel that the timing is right.”Although India remains a bastion of traditional forms of dress – including saris and salwar kameez – many affluent young Indians are adopting Western-style clothing as part of their regular wardrobe. Mr Laban also noted that Indian consumers’ awareness of Gap had been boosted by endorsements from Bollywood stars and a boom in affluent Indian tourists travelling abroad.“We believe the Gap aesthetic has the potential to really resonate with shoppers, especially the half of India’s population that is under 25,” he said.Arvind Mills is one of Asia’s largest denim producers, and a long-time Gap supplier. It also operates more than 1,000 retail outlets in India for leading American fashion brands including Nautica and Tommy Hilfiger.But while India is one of Gap’s top ten supplier countries, Mr Laban said that much of the apparel available in its Indian stores will be imported, despite high tariffs.Other western retailers to have launched in India– including the UK’s Marks and Spencer – struggled until they stocked primarily with Indian-made products to bring down prices. Nevertheless, Mr Laban expressed confidence that the Gap collections had potential for long-term growth.“We are aware of the higher duty taxes of course, but have spent a considerable amount of time working with our partners to benchmark the pricing of product both against local and international competitors,” he said. “Gap can and will be a contender in the field.”Mr Laban added that new higher-quality mall developments would provide a further boost.Zara owner Inditex, which entered the Indian market several years ago in a venture with the retail arm of the influential Tata group, is already expanding after finding favour with some consumers.Gap’s initial focus will be India’s biggest cities, though over time the company will look at smaller second and third tier cities where consumers have shown strong appetite for Western brands.“Clearly, our broader expansion will be regulated by the success of our first stores in Mumbai and Delhi, where the launch of the brand matters most and where we can be at our most visible,” Mr Laban said. “Equally, we also need to be flexible and secure good property as and when it becomes available, as competition among foreign players is becoming ever more fierce.Online shopping is also growing rapidly in India, but Gap said it has “no concrete plans” to make its apparel available over the internet.“It’s taken us several years to get to grips with India’s bricks and mortar lay of the land and how we want to be positioned within it,” Mr Laban said. “When we enter a market, you only get one shot to establish a brand and we want to make sure we get it right. That offline mentality also applies to online frontiers, and in particular e-commerce.”
83;GPS;Gap Inc;2014-07-11T21:35:04Z;US mortgage insurers fall on FHFA plans;Move to help protect taxpayers from some mortgage default losses;Mortgage insurers fell sharply on Friday after the Federal Housing Finance Agency proposed new rules to tighten standards on companies insuring loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The proposal from the housing regulator would require the companies to have a “sufficient level of liquid assets from which to pay claims” on failed mortgages in adverse market conditions.The move by the FHFA, which runs both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac through conservatorship, would help protect taxpayers from some losses on mortgage defaults. Private insurers would have two years to comply with the regulations if implemented.The proposal would require insurers to increase capital tied to a borrower’s policy to cover potential future losses, as the borrower misses payments, Barclays analyst Mark DeVries said. He added it would create “what would seem to be overly burdensome capital requirements”.Genworth Financial said it would need as much as $550m to meet the new requirements while executives with Radian Group expected to have a shortfall of some $850m. Milwaukee-based MGIC Investment did not say if, or how much, capital it would need to comply with the proposal.Mr DeVries said he expected MGIC to have a capital shortfall of $1.8bn, forcing the company to raise between $200m and $300m.Goldman Sachs analysts cautioned the FHFA could ultimately adjust the proposal after receiving comments, particularly as Radian and MGIC warn it could increase borrowing costs for home buyers.“There is a reasonable likelihood that the final capital rules are eased as they appear inconsistent with the FHFA’s goal of improving access to mortgage credit,” analyst Eric Beardsley said.Shares of Genworth Financial declined 2.58 per cent to close at $16.62, Radian Group fell 5.36 per cent to $13.77 and MGIC Investment was down 9.52 per cent to $8.36.Gap shares dipped 0.78 per cent to $40.65 after the San Francisco-based retailer reported a 2 per cent decline in same-store sales from a year earlier.The retailer, which also owns the Old Navy and Banana Republic brands, said its chains that cater to middle-income and affluent shoppers found the going toughest during the month.Same store sales at the Gap and Banana Republic fell 7 per cent from a year earlier. Analysts expected Gap sales to decline marginally, while Banana Republic was forecast to deliver a 2 per cent gain.Old Navy, which accounted for more than a third of sales last year, fared better. Same-store sales jumped 7 per cent, above forecasts.Mall-based rival Guess declined 1.59 per cent to $27.19, American Eagle slid 1.47 per cent to $10.75 and Urban Outfitters fell 0.68 per cent to $33.55.Reynolds American and Lorillard, two of America’s largest tobacco companies, confirmed on Friday a Financial Times report that they were in talks to combine.Reynolds said it was in talks about acquiring its rival in a deal which, if it happened, would create a combined company with a market value of $56bn.British American Tobacco, the UK company that has a 42 per cent stake in Reynolds, is involved in the discussions and would seek to maintain the size of its stake in Reynolds by subscribing for new shares, Reynolds said.Shares of Lorillard advanced 4.63 per cent to $66.01, among the top performing stocks on the S&P 500 on Friday, while Reynolds fell 0.82 per cent to $61.75.Wells Fargo shares retreated 0.62 per cent to $51.49 despite better than expected second-quarter sales and in line profits.The company said profits reached $5.7bn, or $1.01 a share, while revenues slipped 1 per cent to $21.1bn. Wells has battled against a slowing American mortgage market as loftier mortgage rates and higher prices squeeze consumers’ demand for home loans.US equities were slightly up by the close, ahead of a busy week of economic and corporate events, including earnings figures from much of the banking sector as well as tech giants Google, Yahoo and IBM.The S&P 500 nudged up 0.15 per cent to 1,967.51 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.17 per cent to 16,943.81.

84;GPS;Gap Inc;2014-05-23T22:11:44Z;GameStop jumps on higher profits and console sales;;GameStop, the US video game retailer, was among the market leaders on a slow trading day ahead of the holiday weekend after reporting first-quarter profits ahead of expectations as sales of gaming consoles launched last year continued at a brisk pace.The company said overall market sales of the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One in the US were twice as high as those of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 after their first six months on the market.Net sales rose 7 per cent from a year earlier to $2bn, in line with Wall Street expectations. Profits jumped by more than a fifth to $68m, or 59 cents a share, in the three months to May 3.“The next-gen console business is meeting our targets, our digital properties continue to grow and our new tech brands segment is positively contributing to our profitability,” chief executive Paul Raines said.BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Williams said the company still faced “several significant challenges on the horizon” but was performing well.“GameStop continues to execute well in the current environment, and in the short term, we expect GameStop to benefit from new hardware and software sales with next-gen consoles,” he said.Shares jumped 4.20 per cent to close at $38.43.Hewlett-Packard shares surged 6.10 per cent to $33.72 on Friday, reversing declines on Thursday when the PC maker inadvertently released a portion of its quarterly results.Chief executive Meg Whitman, who apologised for the early release, said the company would lay off as many as 16,000 more employees, taking cuts announced under previous plans to as many as 50,000.Net revenues fell 1 per cent to $27.3bn in the quarter. However, profits climbed 18 per cent from a year earlier to $1.27bn, or 66 cents a share.On a call with analysts, Ms Whitman said the lay-offs would “be across almost all the business units and across all geographies”.Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said: “The second quarter wasn’t the inflection point some investors hoped for but in-line results, better free cash flows, improved gross margin, and additional restructuring keep the turnround story moving forward.”Reynolds American shares faltered after Standard & Poor’s placed it and fellow tobacco company Lorillard on credit watch negative, a sign it could downgrade or affirm each rating in the coming months as talks of a potential takeover of Lorillard continue. Both companies hold triple B minus ratings with S&P, its lowest investment grade.S&P analysts said a takeover by Reynolds could more than double the company’s leverage ratio. Shares in Reynolds fell 0.14 per cent to $58.45 while Lorillard was 1.16 per cent higher at $60.20.Clothing retailers remained in the spotlight for a fourth day, as results from Gap and Aéropostale were digested.Shares in Aéropostale slid 24.56 per cent to $3.41 after the teen retailer forecast a wider loss than analysts anticipated. The company, which is in the process of closing 125 stores, said it expected to report a loss of $49m to $54m in its second quarter.Gap was more fortunate. The San Francisco-based retailer noted same-store sales improved across its three core chains in April, compared to a 6 per cent decline in March. Shares were up 0.69 per cent at $41.14.TiVo shares rose 2.18 per cent to $12.19 after the company said total subscriptions had reached 4.5m and investors grew increasingly confident that new deals with cable subscribers could lift TiVo’s reach further.Sales rose 30 per cent from a year earlier to $107.1m, while the company swung to a profit of $8.1m, or 7 cents per share.Volumes in the US were thinner than usual on Friday, with shares traded in S&P 500-listed companies nearly a third lower than the 30-day trailing average, according to Bloomberg data.However, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,900.53, surpassing the record close set on May 13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.38 per cent to 16,606.27.

85;GPS;Gap Inc;2014-04-11T22:04:38Z;US retailers fall after Gap reports sales slide;Financial sector also weakens in wake of JPMorgan results;Shares in US retailers were under pressure on Friday after one of the country’s largest apparel chains reported difficult March trade, upending a rising view that consumers were once again opening their wallets after months of severe weather.The Gap, owner of its namesake brand as well as Old Navy and Banana Republic, said same-store sales in March fell 6 per cent from a year earlier, far below Wall Street estimates.“We entered the first quarter with inventory levels that were above our current sales and traffic trends, and then February conditions made matters worse,” said Katrina O’Connell, vice-president of investor relations. “Unfortunately, traffic in March was well below our expectations and remained negative.”Comparable sales at Old Navy and Banana Republic also declined in the month and the company warned margins would continue to decline in the quarter as it remains promotional. Executives nonetheless affirmed full-year earnings guidance of $2.90 to $2.95 per share.“While we expect improvements in April from better weather, Easter and pent-up demand, we believe that the Gap will have to continue to be promotional in order to bring inventories in line with sales, particularly at the Gap segment,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Susan Anderson said.Gap shares fell as much as 6 per cent to $37.00 before paring losses, closing at $38.40, down 2.3 per cent.Express shares dipped 3.3 per cent to $15.06 while shares in Urban Outfitters fell 2.99 per cent to $36.01.The financial sector also weakened on Friday after JPMorgan reported its worst start to the year in fixed income trading since the depths of the financial crisis, sending ripples across the industry.Profits at the bank fell 19 per cent from a year earlier to $5.3bn, or $1.28 cents a share, below analyst forecasts. Overall, revenues slid 8 per cent to $23.9bn.The bank blamed a slowdown in mortgage refinancing and lower client activity in fixed income markets for weaker-than-anticipated results.JPMorgan’s shares fell 3.6 per cent to $55.30. Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.09 per cent to $152.72, Morgan Stanley weakened 2.67 per cent to $28.47 and Citigroup fell 1.19 per cent to $45.68.Zynga advanced after analysts at Morgan Stanley lifted their view on the company, a day after shares tumbled 7 per cent following the latest management shake-up.The investment bank upgraded it to equal-weight from underweight as expectations rise for Zynga’s newest game, FarmVille 2: Country Escape.“Zynga management appears to be reinvigorating innovation in the company, which could help it return to positive bookings growth [and] double-digit ebitda margins by the third quarter,” analyst John Egbert said. “The new FarmVille mobile title exhibits signs of reaching $100m plus in annual bookings after it launches broadly in the second quarter.”Zynga shares were flat at $4.07.Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company under intense pressure from policy makers and insurers over its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company revealed new data on the drug.At a presentation at the European Association for the Study of the Liver Conference in London, Gilead said a two-drug treatment of its Sovaldi and ledipasvir drugs showed a cure rate of 94 per cent.Shares in the company advanced 0.84 per cent to $66.03.Zoe’s Kitchen, the US restaurant chain, jumped in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, rising 64.8 per cent to $24.72 on strong investor demand.The company, which has 110 restaurants across the US, sold shares on Thursday evening at $15 apiece.Overall, markets slid for a second day as investors continued to rotate out of momentum stocks and into safer investments – including US Treasuries.The S&P 500 fell 0.95 per cent to 1,815.69 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average weakened 0.89 per cent to 16,026.75. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.34 per cent to 3,999.73.
86;GPS;Gap Inc;2014-02-20T01:47:52Z;Gap raises minimum wage for US workers;;Gap has broken ranks with other retailers and sided with President Barack Obama by deciding to increase its minimum wage as the White House turns up the pressure on employers to lift salaries.The fashion retailer said on Wednesday that it would boost its minimum hourly rate for store employees to $9 this year and $10 in 2015, a move that will mean 65,000 people get a raise.In a statement Mr Obama, who has put tackling inequality at the centre of his agenda, said: “I applaud Gap”.Wages for Gap employees currently go as low as the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour – often for part-time and seasonal workers – but the company could not say how many people are paid that rate.The White House has raised the pressure on retailers, restaurants and other employers of low-wage workers since Mr Obama told companies in his State of the Union address: “Do what you can to raise your employees’ wages.”He has also asked Congress to pass a bill to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10, although there is little chance of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives supporting it.The National Retail Federation, a lobby group that counts Gap among its members, has vehemently opposed an increase in the minimum wage, arguing that the higher costs would mean fewer jobs in the sector or higher prices for consumera.Art Peck, president of growth, innovation and digital at Gap, told the Financial Times that the retailer was not afraid to break from the pack.“Being different is not a bad thing. We believe it’s a good thing and it will show up again in front of our … shareholders, our customers, our sales associates and the communities we do business in,” he said.At the same time Walmart was forced to clarify that it remained “neutral” in the minimum wage debate, after Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that it was “looking at” supporting a rise in the federal minimum wage.“We believe it’s a good thing and it will show up again in front of our … shareholders, our customers, our sales associates and the communities we do business in”A Walmart spokeswoman said the retailer was examining what impact a rise in the minimum wage would have on its business, but stressed: “We’re remaining neutral. Our position hasn’t changed.”Mr Peck said Gap had been considering the move for a while but that it had not been influenced by messages coming from the White House. “We’re not part of the political debate right now. This is really a business decision.”Many Gap jobs merited higher wages, he said, because the blurring of boundaries between in-store and online shopping meant the work was changing as store staff, for example, had to do tasks such as packing and sending out online orders.“As the digital and the physical world come together we’re really asking our sales associates in our stores … not just to do everything they’ve always done but to actually do a lot more and it felt like this was the right time to acknowledge that,” he said.Gap’s decision came the day after the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said lifting the federal minimum wage could lead to the loss of 500,000 jobs in the US by the second half of 2016.That prompted the White House to challenge its conclusions, saying the budget office’s estimates did not reflect the overall consensus view of economists that a minimum wage rise “has little or no negative effect on employment”.Mr Obama has already used his executive powers to lift the federal minimum wage for workers employed under new federal government contracts.At Gap, Mr Peck said: “I honestly don’t see this cascading down into fewer people making more money.”
87;GPS;Gap Inc;2014-02-07T22:04:03Z;Gap jumps on higher earnings hopes;US retailer records stronger than expected sales in January;Gap shares rose at their fastest pace in three months on Friday as the US retailer lifted its earnings expectations and recorded stronger than expected sales in January.The owner of Banana Republic and Old Navy said it now forecast quarterly earnings between 65 cents and 66 cents per share, ahead of guidance set last year. Gap benefited from a 1 per cent advance in same-store sales in the first month of the year, compared to Wall Street forecasts for a 1.1 per cent decline.Sales at Gap and Old Navy, the company’s two largest brands, were both up on the same month last year, while Banana Republic logged a 10 per cent drop.Glenn Murphy, the chief executive of Gap, said January’s gains left the company’s quarterly same-store sales up for the eighth consecutive quarter.“Management originally expected it to be difficult to lever expenses given the loss of the 53rd week, but was able to do so from disciplined expense control,” UBS analyst Roxanne Meyer said, referring to the change in Gap’s fiscal calendar.Gap rose 5.8 per cent to $42 at the close of New York trading.Expedia shares climbed 14.3 per cent to $74.45 to lead the benchmark S&P 500 as profits jumped 14-fold to $94.7m, or 70 cents per diluted share, in the three months to December.The company said its acquisition of Trivago, the German travel search engine, last year was paying dividends, with sales in the division rising 85 per cent from a year earlier.Net sales at Expedia, which also operates the Hotwire and Hotels.com websites, rose 18 per cent from a year earlier to $1.2bn, as hotel bookings grew 25 per cent.Analysts at more than a dozen investment banks lifted their price targets on the company, with Evercore analyst Ken Sena noting the company saw improvements across geographies.“Strong bookings performance driven by the lower-margin air business and traction within the Expedia Traveler Preference programme resulted in strong bookings trends,” Mr Sena said. “In addition, strength across brands and stability within Hotwire led to a seemingly brighter outlook on the business.”Travel booking site TripAdvisor jumped 9.5 per cent to $84.45 following Expedia’s results, while Priceline climbed 5 per cent to $1,195.Netflix shares touched an all-time high in afternoon trading as analysts at Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the company to “buy” from “hold”.Analyst Ben Mogil said Netflix would benefit in an increasingly bifurcated environment, particularly among a generation of consumers who are no longer subscribing to cable television.“In an environment where video subscribers are increasingly bipolar in their consumption patterns, Netflix remains a very attractive programming option suited towards both cord-cutters/nevers/shavers as well as heavy video users,” he said.Shares of Netflix rose 5.4 per cent to $429.98 while Mr Mogil set a $475 price target.Insurance provider Cigna weighed on equity markets, falling 9.25 per cent to $77.47 as profits slid 11 per cent from a year earlier. The company said net income totalled $361m in its fourth quarter, or $1.29 per share, compared to $406m a year ago.Cigna forecast sales would grow between 4 and 7 per cent this year, shy of Wall Street forecasts.Investors shrugged off a disappointing report from the labour department that showed the US economy added 113,000 jobs in January, below expectations for 180,000.Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey pointed to annual revisions by the agency, which showed the March 2013 employment level was 369,000 higher than earlier thought.“With the annual benchmark revision, there is more strength in the labour market than we thought,” Mr Rupkey said. “The American economy is a veritable jobs-creating machine: 2.1m in 2011, 2.2m in 2012 and 2.3m in 2013.”The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,797.02 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.06 per cent to 15,794.08. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite index advanced 1.7 per cent to 4,125.86.
88;GPS;Gap Inc;2013-10-11T23:34:34Z;Gap falls but US indices advance;;Shares in clothing retailer Gap fell in early trading on weak revenue numbers but US equity indices ticked up to extend Thursday’s rally as negotiations in Washington continued.The clothing retailer set a negative tone for companies dependent on consumer spending as its stores that have been open for at least one year logged a 3 per cent decline in revenue. Shares in Gap were off 6.7 per cent to $36.83.Nomura Securities said in an analyst note that the continued slowdown in consumer spending would hurt Gap.“As customers shrug off the need to buy yet another pair of blue denims, we expect to continue to see sluggish trends, absent a reason to buy,” Nomura said. “And although we believe [Gap’s] strategy of building a global omni-channel retailer sets it above the pack, we maintain our neutral rating in the face of challenging domestic compares ahead.”Gap shares remain up 18.6 per cent on the year as an unexpected rise in retail spending fuelled a spring and summer rally.The decline from Gap sent other retailers lower. Urban Outfitters fell 1.5 per cent to $35.90 and American Eagle Outfitters lost 2.1 per cent to $13.26.Despite the weakness from retailers, the consumer discretionary sector rose 0.8 per cent as growth-focused stocks led the market higher. Energy shares were the strongest area, up 1.3 per cent.The S&P 500 added 0.6 per cent to 1,703.20, extending Thursday’s rally that sent the index up by more than 2 per cent and closing above the 1,700 level for the first time since September. After a rocky start to the month, the S&P is now up 1.3 per cent in October.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 15,237.11, while the Nasdaq added 0.8 per cent to 3,791.87.Wells Fargo dropped in early trading but recovered later in the day to close flat at $41.43. The company reported earnings on Friday morning that highlighted a decline in mortgage revenue.JPMorgan shares were fractionally lower to $52.51 despite reporting the bank’s first loss under chief executive Jamie Dimon.Regional lender SunTrust Banks was off 0.5 per cent to $33.51 on news that it had agreed to a more than $1bn settlement with federal agencies over allegations of mishandling government-backed mortgages.A positive report on third-quarter air traffic boosted Spirit Airlines. The news garnered Citi to upgrade the company’s shares from “neutral” to “buy”. Spirit shares rose 14.8 per cent to $39.11.Johnson & Johnson added 1.9 per cent to $89.45 to lead the Dow. The consumer health group was upgraded to “neutral” from “sell” by analysts at Goldman Sachs on strength from the company’s pharmaceutical area.Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology dropped 8.6 per cent to $16.84 after the company reported earnings per share that missed expectations.However, Micron shares are still up 165.6 per cent on the year to date on demand from smartphone and tablet makers for the company’s memory chips.Grocery retailer Safeway was boosted by a strong earnings report, sending its shares up 6.9 per cent to $33.75.The company also said that it plans to leave the Chicago market, a cost-savings move that follows on the sale of its Canadian business earlier this year.Thursday’s gains helped to put the S&P 500 in positive territory in a week that highlighted investor concern about the political impasse in Washington.The CBOE Volatility Index lived up to its name as Wall Street’s fear gauge, as it rose above 21 on Wednesday, then fell sharply on Thursday and Friday to below 16. It sat at 15.76, off 4.3 per cent after Friday’s close.Between the international stand-off over Syria and the approaching US debt ceiling, investors have had to endure a healthy amount of bad news that has clouded markets, said Marino Marin, managing director for investment bank MLV & Co.“It’s very difficult to decipher considering what’s happening in Washington,” he said. “The market really cannot be read the way it should because of these external events.”
89;GPS;Gap Inc;2013-05-01T09:40:38Z;Global retailers pledge help for Bangladesh factory victims;;Western retailers have begun pledging compensation for Bangladeshi garment workers killed or injured in last week’s building collapse as rescuers abandoned hope of finding any more survivors.The official death toll from the collapse of the Rana Plaza, which housed five garment factories producing for many major Western retail brands, passed 400 on Wednesday according to police, with hundreds more suffering from severe injuries.Officers said 399 bodies had been pulled from the debris and three of the injured had died in hospital. Authorities expect to find many more dead bodies – possibly hundreds – as they dig through to the bottom of the mountain of concrete and iron.With an intense global spotlight now on their business ties in Bangladesh, Western retailers that used suppliers housed in the doomed building have begun offering ill-defined compensation to the victims.But aid groups have been unimpressed by some of the vague promises such as UK discount retailer Matalan’s pledge to “provide financial and other support”. The offer to those affected fell short of meeting victims’ rights, said War on Want.“Matalan’s words of sympathy will be cold comfort to those affected without action that would ensure such a disaster never happens again,” said Ruth Tanner, campaigns and policy director at the anti-poverty charity.Ethical Trade Initiative, an alliance of companies, trade unions and voluntary organisations, said it would be a “travesty” if brands did not seize the opportunity to work to effect changes in working practices with the government, which had been shaken into action by the disaster.“Now there is an opportunity for the international partners, brands and retailers and labour organisations to say, let’s work with you, government, and hold you accountable for putting in appropriate changes to the industry,” said Peter McAllister, director at ETI. “If we don’t take that opportunity, there will be new disasters and that will be an indictment on everyone involved.”Matalan said it was not using any suppliers based in the building but a spokeswoman said a previous supplier was based there in February. Primark, British discount retailer, which early on acknowledged its use of suppliers at a factory in the Rana Plaza, was the first Western brand to pledge compensation to the dead and injured employees of its supplier.In a statement this week, Primark, owned by UK-listed Associated British Foods, promised “long-term aid for children who have lost parents, financial aid for those injured and payments to the families of the deceased”.Primark noted that many other major Western brands were purchasing stock from factories located in the building. “We are fully aware of our responsibility,” it said.Subsequently, Canada’s Loblaw, which had a supplier of products for its Joe Fresh clothing brand at a factory in the building, said it too was going to provide compensation for the families of victims employed by its supplier.In a statement, Loblaw said that it was still working on the specific details of how to deliver this support in the “best and most meaningful way possible”, but that the company’s goal was to ensure that “victims and their families receive benefits now and in the future”.But even as some retailers are offering aid, other brands have sought to distance themselves from the tragedy. Mango, for example, whose orders for children’s leggings were found in the wreckage of the building by the Financial Times, said it had only placed a “trial order” with one of the factories there. One surviving manager of that factory though said that workers had been trying hard to complete the order, which had prompted them to go back despite the discovery of the crack.Mr McAllister said: “Frankly it’s a travesty that some of the other brands have not been as proactive as Primark.”Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s $19bn export-oriented garment industry, which has seen its business badly hit by disruptive political turmoil in the past few months, is struggling to reassure Western retailers and their buyers that it remains a reliable credible supplier.On Monday, representatives of 35 major Western brands and buyers met the leaders of the Bangladeshi Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the industry body, and they agreed to form a panel to lay down a plan to address safety issues.In the meantime, the BGMEA this week instructed all its members to have their factory buildings examined by structural engineers and submit proof of these inspections by the end of this month.Additional reporting by Joseph Allchin in Dhaka, Barney Jopson in New York and Louise Lucas in London
90;GPS;Gap Inc;2013-03-07T19:21:46Z;Gap shares halted after early data release;;Trading in Gap shares was halted briefly on Thursday after the retailer’s latest sales data were accidentally released several hours early, the latest case of an unplanned data leak roiling companies and markets.The halt in share trading, which came after a sudden 4 per cent rally, was requested by Gap and immediately sparked speculation that a deal announcement was pending.But the retailer said the decision was made because a data vendor had released some of its February sales information earlier than planned. It did not name the vendor.The incident put a spotlight on monthly retail sales figures just as Target and Macy’s joined other big retailers that have stopped reporting them, complaining that they foster short-termism and misunderstandings about their businesses.The Gap error followed confusion last month over the planned merger of Office Depot and OfficeMax after it was inadvertently announced early by a division of Thomson Reuters that manages investor relations websites.Last October a sell-off of Google shares was sparked when its printers accidentally “pressed send on the release” hours earlier than planned.As Gap’s shares stayed halted for almost 30 minutes, the company rushed out a full version of a press release confirming the key number in the leak: its like-for-like sales rose 3 per cent in February from a year ago.When trading restarted Gap shares remained up 3.4 per cent on the day at $35.63.Retail shares have traditionally been more volatile than other sectors partly because traders feed on monthly sales figures – published on the first Thursday of each month – as a form of market-moving information not available elsewhere.But in recent years the number of companies that publish them has dwindled. Sixteen companies are now tracked by Retail Metrics, a research group, and their sales rose 1.9 per cent in February, lower than forecasts of a 2.5 per cent increase.Gap had been due to publish its numbers after the market close at 4pm, a change from its previous policy of publishing before the market opens.Macy’s, which decided to stop publishing monthly figures after the end of its financial year in January, said: “Reporting monthly does encourage a short-term orientation and could often lead to misinterpretations of the business.”Macy’s noted that shifts in the calendar made it even harder to establish clear year-on-year comparisons.Walmart, the US’s biggest retailer by sales, stopped publishing monthly figures in 2009 and JC Penney, the department store, stopped when its wrenching transformation plan began last year.Kroger, a supermarket group, on Thursday reported strong quarterly sales and profits that surpassed expectations and lifted its shares 3.6 per cent to $30.42, but it does not publish monthly figures.Mike Schlotman, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times: “The problem with that is that things can be so variable that people try to read into a monthly report things that they shouldn’t relative to the strength of your business.”

With the same money I spent now I bought more things. This year I don’t feel the savings.”While stores tried to outdo each other with advertisements, Michael Appel of AlixPartners, a consultancy, said discounts could be smaller than in 2011 as cautious retailers were keeping lean inventories for the entire holiday season.“They don’t have a lot of extra stock to sell, so, on the top items, they don’t want to give them away because they may run out of stock,” he said.Black Friday comes towards the end of a strong year for retail stocks with the S&P retail index rallying 28 per cent so far – more than double the 12 per cent rise in the broader market – but intense competition threatens to erode profits.Walmart, Toys R Us and Sears opened at 8pm on Thanksgiving night in an effort to grab market share during the traditional start of Christmas shopping.Walmart said it saw larger crowds than at its midnight opening last year, but it also faced protests at some stores from labour activists, who criticised it for low pay and ruining employees’ Thanksgivings.Order Barney Jopson’s startling account of the hidden influence and boundless ambition of Amazon, overlord of a mini-economy that goes well beyond online shoppersAt Target’s store in Brooklyn, which opened at 9pm on Thursday, Gina Flower said she wanted a coffee maker and would then head next door to Best Buy, which opened at midnight, for a Toshiba television priced at $179.She had concluded that equally good deals were available online, but had brought her two teenage daughters for the spectacle. “People want the thrill of coming to see things. But you’re better off letting your fingers do the walking on the internet.”For the first time Target and Best Buy have promised to match the lowest prices of some products on Amazon and other ecommerce sites.While no single product dominated the day, shoppers at Target rushed to grab 50-inch Westinghouse flatscreen TVs – going for $350 – which they dragged across the floor, lugged on shoulders or pushed precariously in trolleys.Outside with his wife and two televisions, two air mattresses and some crockery, Raul Gutierrez said he was glad to have been able to finish his shopping early. “Now we have the day free tomorrow …You pick your poison,” he said.At Toys R Us in Times Square on Thursday night, Yamid Cala, a Colombian tourist, walked away with a PlayStation 3 and other gadgets he had targeted before he left home in Bogotá.“It’s crazy. They’re really nuts. The queues,” he said of his first Black Friday. “But it’s a great experience.”
92;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-10-15T13:44:17Z;H&M branches out with Monki strategy;;The Monki store on Hamngatan in Stockholm stands opposite a large H&M outlet. But there is little to suggest the two are related.Clothes in Monki are hung on strings connected as if in a carousel, and tinsel hangs from the silver-plated ceiling, highlighting its pitch for a slightly older and more upmarket customer than typically shops at H&M. Asked while buying a SKr500 ($75) jumper if a shopper knew that Monki was a brand belonging to H&M, she replies: “I had no idea. That’s quite interesting.”H&M is in a hurry to add new brands. Five years ago, the Swedish clothing retailer only had its core H&M brand. But then it founded the more upmarket Cos, made a small acquisition that added Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday, and will launch another new brand next year called & Other Stories.The Stockholm-based company, still controlled by its founding family, says it is aiming to target new customers away from its core young, price-conscious shopper. But in some ways it is only catching up with its rivals, particularly Spain’s Inditex with its nine brands, and Gap of the US with five brands including Banana Republic and Old Navy.The comparison is most unflattering with Inditex, which started adding brands alongside its main Zara stores 20 years ago and now uses lines such as Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear to fuel the explosive growth that saw the Spanish group overtake H&M last year as the world’s biggest fashion retailer.But Pernilla Wohlfahrt, H&M’s head of new business, says that while the Swedish group looks at what competitors are doing it makes its own decisions on which fashion segments to enter.“It is one way for H&M to grow. We can still grow in existing stores, existing markets and new markets with the H&M brand but we can also add new product groups such as Home or target new customers looking for another quality and price segment as we did with Cos,” she adds.One example is the launch next year in about 10 European cities of & Other Stories, a brand focused on accessories as well as clothes. She adds that all the brands share the same desire to offer value for money but keep their own identities with separate head offices and designers.Analysts say that one of H&M’s reasons to start multiple brands is that the financial crisis and its aftermath have not been kind to the Swedish group’s young customers.Isabel Cavill, an analyst at Planet Retail, says slightly older shoppers such as the over-25s and the over-35s have carried on shopping much more and that H&M needed to do something to appeal to them. “They felt the need to diversify so that they could attract a new demographic of shopper. In this day and age it is quite risky to rely on one brand,” she adds.Investors are, however, still a little wary of H&M, particularly when compared with the nimble Inditex and its ability to get clothes in two weeks from the design board to the shops. H&M’s shares are up 9 per cent in the past year, while shares in Inditex are up 47 per cent over the same period.Adam Cochrane, analyst at UBS, says: “Unfortunately H&M is being compared to a company that is right on the ball . . . due to a mixture of its product, culture and flexibility of its business model.”Despite the sudden growth in the number of brands, H&M is expanding cautiously. It has about 150 non-H&M brand stores around the world with Cos its big success, opening about 20 this year alone. Inditex is on the verge of having its sixth brand reach the 500-store milestone. Yet Ms Wohlfahrt insists H&M will not be rushed: “We just started and we want to do this slowly and with quality.”The recent comparison leaves H&M looking second-best in other areas. The Spanish group posted forecast-beating second-quarter results while H&M’s disappointed somewhat, although on Monday it reported better than expected sales for September. H&M also postponed the launch of its US website for a second time while Inditex enjoys rising online sales there.Karl-Johan Persson, H&M’s chief executive, insists the Swedish group is happy doing its own thing: “I know there is a lot of comparison. Honestly, it is not frustrating. We look at our development compared with last year and we are up 11 per cent [in sales in the first nine months] in a tough market. We are doing that at a time when we are investing a lot in long-term initiatives such as new brands.” 
93;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-10-04T17:57:56Z;US retail sales growth slows;;US retail sales growth slowed in September but was in line with expectations against the backdrop of uncertainty over the economic recovery and the presidential election, writes Barney Jopson in New York.Like-for-like sales rose 3.6 per cent from a year ago in September at 17 retailers that report monthly figures, according to Thomson Reuters, after a 6.1 per cent rise in sales during back to school shopping in August.“It’s not hot, it’s not not, it’s just ‘meh’,” said Barbara Kahn, marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, as economic data continues to send mixed signals to consumers. Gap, Costco and the TJX Companies narrowly beat expectations with gains in like-for-like sales of 6 per cent each. Department stores had a relatively weak month as Nordstrom and Macy’s posted smaller gains that fell slightly short of expectations. At Kohl’s, another department store, sales fell 2.7 per cent.The figures indicated the sector was on course for a “decent” but not spectacular end-of-year shopping season, Ms Kahn said, but she added that the impact of the November 6 presidential election was a wild card.“From a consumer point of view you may have very strong expectations and if your candidate wins maybe you’ll be jubilant and it’ll be reflected in higher shopping,” she said. “If your candidate loses maybe you’ll think the country will go into a tailspin and you’ll be pessimistic.”Joel Bines, a consultant at AlixPartners, said retailers were likely to start their end of year marketing blitz later than normal because of the election and the associated heavy spending on political advertising. “With media prices being what they are and the general distraction of the nation, retailers are being prudent about their marketing dollars. They’re saying ‘Let’s just wait till November 7’,” he said.Discounts and promotions are expected to be abundant this year as retailers battle for market share, promising a concentrated blizzard of activity. Mr Bines said consumers had held back in September after a splurge of back-to-school spending.Target, a mass market discounter, posted a 2.1 per cent gain in sales. Rises in house prices and the stock market are lifting consumer sentiment, as is the Federal Reserve’s attempt to stimulate the economy by loosening monetary policy.On the negative side are higher gas prices and worries about the jobs market, the US budget deficit and eurozone crisis.
94;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-08-30T18:04:18Z;US retailers beat sales forecasts;Gap, Victoria’s Secret and Costco enjoy August burst;Gap and the owners of Victoria’s Secret and TJ Maxx reported sharp sales growth in August as US retailers reported another strong month in spite of economic uncertainty.Sales rose by 5.4 per cent among the 20 or so retailers that report monthly figures, beating expectations for the second consecutive month, according to Retail Metrics.August is the crux of the back-to-school shopping season, the second-most important part of the year for many clothing retailers after the end-of-year holidays.“The US consumer continues to surprise everyone with their ability to dig deep,” said Chris Donnelly, head of the retail practice at Accenture.“There’s no fundamental reason why spending should be so high,” he said, alluding to stubbornly high US unemployment and meagre economic growth. “It has to be psychological.”Roughly 90 per cent of retailers reported sales that beat market forecasts. Clothes sales at both department stores and speciality chains were especially strong.Like-for-like sales at Gap climbed 9 per cent from the same month last year following a 10 per cent rise in July, as its newest clothes click with consumers after a long period of criticism for uninspiring fashions.Sales at Limited Brands, which owns the lingerie store Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, were up 8 per cent.While Victoria’s Secret does not see the same back-to-school peak as other retailers, its Pink brand for college students – which includes backpacks as well as underwear – does get a new-term kick.The TJX Companies, which include the discount clothes and homeware chain TJ Maxx, posted an 8 per cent rise in sales. Costco, the supermarket warehouse club, reported a 6 per cent rise in August sales.Retailers continued to rely on coupons and discounts to woo shoppers as many consumers justify spending only when they see a bargain, said retail analysts, a trend that is cutting into profitability.Nancy Liu, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, said: “Back-to-school is a time when people need to go back and spend. But we’re still a little bit touch and go with the economy.”Sales had been flat in June but rose 4.3 per cent in July.
95;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-08-19T16:40:11Z;US retail – Gap closes;Former fashion mainstay seems to have rediscovered its mojo;Who were the coolest dudes at the mall this summer? Surprisingly, one of them was Gap, a company that was hugely popular in the 1990s but lost its lustre in the new millennium. Its saving grace was that even if Gap’s fashion sense was off, its management never lost its skill in controlling costs. Retailers must ultimately make stuff people want to buy, however, and it looks as though Gap may have started to get its fashion mojo back.The company beat expectations for net income and sales in the second quarter. And its same-store sales rose 4 per cent in the period. That follows a similar increase the previous quarter, the first quarterly increases since 2010.Gap shares appear to be regaining popularity with investors too. Since the start of August, the stock has risen more than 20 per cent, hitting a ratio of about 17 times earnings estimates for this fiscal year. That is in line with the multiple at Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and has delivered quarterly same-store sales growth of between 7 and 9 per cent during the past year.The question for shareholders is whether Gap’s stores will stay in style this autumn. And whether Gap may finally be getting its fashion right just in time for a renewed slowdown in the US economy. A look at 10 retailers that reported earnings in the past few weeks shows that quarterly same-store sales remain generally positive. The discounters TJX Companies and Ross Stores were particularly strong with quarterly increases of 7 per cent. Most companies, including Gap, have raised earnings guidance for the year.But at eight of the chains same-store sales growth slowed from the first to the second quarter. That raises the idea that an economic slowdown in the US may already be leading to tighter purse strings among consumers. Now that would be a drag throughout the mall.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
96;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-08-16T22:30:45Z;New styles help Gap beat estimates;;Gap reported growth in net income and sales that narrowly beat market expectations as its newest clothes clicked with consumers following a long period of criticism for uninspiring fashions.The San Francisco-based retailer reported sales up 6 per cent to $3.6bn in the three months to the end of July.Net income rose 29 per cent to $243m, or 49 cents per share. The company also raised its full-year profit forecast.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, said customers liked Gap’s latest choice of styles, colours and fits and that its decision to focus on becoming “dominant” in areas including baby clothes and denim was yielding results.But he was not ready to say Gap’s long-awaited turnround was complete after a string of sales declines caused by missteps in fashion and marketing.“Sustained performance is what matters and everybody here is working hard every single day to make sure we maintain the momentum in the back half we enjoyed in the first half of 2012,” he told analysts.The sharp growth in profit also confirmed Gap’s ability to keep a tight lid on costs and its own inventory, which mitigated the need to resort to profit-sapping markdowns, analysts said.In North America, sales rose at stores open at least a year under all three of its brands: Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy.However, in its international business – where it continues to open new stores – like-for-like sales fell 5 per cent from a year ago.Gap shares rose 1.9 per cent to $34.99 in after-hours trading.
97;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-08-02T19:12:59Z;US retailers’ sales beat expectations;;Clothing retailer Gap’s sales rose by an unexpectedly strong 10 per cent in July as big discounts helped attract more buyers than forecast to US shops despite continued economic uncertainty.Like-for-like sales among 20 retailers rose 4.3 per cent in July from a year ago, surpassing expectations of a 1.5 per cent rise and much improved from a flat June, according to Thomson Reuters.Gap’s monthly figures compared with a forecast of 3.8 per cent growth and added to evidence that the clothes retailer is ending a prolonged period of falling sales caused by missteps in fashion and marketing.While the sector figures gave retailers some hope that consumers were spending more freely, analysts said that many people were still willing to buy only when they saw big discounts.Consumers’ sensitivity to price appeared to be rising back to the levels of the most recent recession, said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, a research group. “[The July figures] are not a reflection that consumers are feeling much better about their economic situation.”“In June retailers were still trying to sell summer merchandise at full price and hoping not to discount,” he added. “By the time July came round they were switching to early fall mode and ready to discount.”Another strong performer in July was Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, whose sales were up 12 per cent versus forecasts of a 6 per cent rise.Target and Macy’s also surpassed forecasts with like-for-like sales growth of 3.1 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively.Discounting is likely to eat into many retailers’ profit margins, but Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said that aggressive promotions at Gap seemed to have persuaded consumers they were getting bigger bargains than they were.Noting that Gap’s gross profit margin was rising, he said: “At the end of the day it cost them less to appear to promote more.” The company’s figures also include its Banana Republic and Old Navy brands.Mr Jaffe said the Gap had also been fortunate that the weather in large parts of the US was hot in July, vindicating its decision to stay focused on “wear now” summer styles and colours rather than bring in clothes for later months.Underlining consumers’ appetite for bargains, Coach, the handbag brand, this week blamed its decision to stop offering discount coupons at some stores for meagre sales growth in North America in the quarter to the start of July.JC Penney’s decision to scrap discounting has sent its sales plummeting. Next week it will report the second set of quarterly results since it made the decision. Walter Loeb, a veteran retail consultant, is predicting that its sales dropped 25 per cent.Across the sector, Mr Jaffe said that he was optimistic about sales trends for the months to come and noted that a fall in the cotton price was helping to boost the profitability of clothes retailers. “My one concern is that retailers who’ve had inconsistent sales become more promotional early in the [next] season and it makes it difficult for everyone,” he said.
98;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-05-23T16:47:12Z;Inconvenient truths about bargain clothing;Elizabeth L. Cline’s ‘Overdressed’ calls for a return to ethical fashion;"Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion
By Elizabeth L Cline
Portfolio/Penguin, $25.95/£18.99Elizabeth L Cline goes for the jugular straight away in this exploration of the consumer love affair with cheap clothing. “Fashion,” she writes, “largely deserves its bad reputation. It’s now a powerful, trillion-dollar global industry that has too much influence over our pocketbooks, self-image and storage spaces. It behaves with embarrassingly little regard for the environment or human rights.”Overdressed begins with a mea culpa, as Cline, a New York-based journalist, reveals that she too was once one of those naughty consumers who snapped up multiple pairs of badly made, $7 shoes because they were cheap.She then admits that she used to be intoxicated by the rock-bottom prices of brands such as H&M and Old Navy. “For a decade I only bought cheap fashion,” she writes.This confessional, personal tone runs through the book and whether it will grate or ingratiate probably depends on how much the reader already knows about the topic.The process by which cheap clothes lost their stigma and were embraced by magazines such as Vogue began in the 1990s, Cline explains. She compares the thoughtlessly acquisitive way some people shop now to the more considered regional department-store experience of the 20th century.More interesting is Cline’s chapter on how the US lost most of its clothes manufacturing industry. Big brands, driven by the pursuit of cheaper labour, sent the production of their clothing overseas, in a process that she points out was accelerated in the mid-1990s by trade liberalisation and the removal of quotas.Cline links the relationship between high and low fashion and the polarisation between the two to the widening gap between rich and poor, suggesting that it is symbolic of a broader social issue.There is a sense that this opinion might be rooted in the fact that Cline is intimidated by high fashion – she describes a visit to the Fendi store that ends with her thinking: “I wasn’t supposed to be here. There was nothing I could afford.”Cline’s target is, therefore, broader than her book’s title implies. She is almost as sceptical about designer fashion as she is about affordable fashion – criticising the whole industry for its over-accelerated trends and lack of individuality.The most urgent, engaging chapters are about the factories in which cheap clothes are made in places such as Bangladesh, China and, yes, Los Angeles.Cline also visits the exemplary Alta Gracia factory in the Dominican Republic – where workers are unionised and paid a living wage – which is operated by South Carolina-based Knights Apparel, the leading producer of college-logo clothing sold at US universities. She talks to Gemma Castro, one of the factory’s production managers, and finds that “in her experience, big clothing brands are very strict about following health and safety codes and the local labour and wage laws in the countries where they source their goods. But when it comes to wages, the legal minimum is as far as they take their responsibility.”Cline cites several sources that claim companies could raise wages with little or no resultant rise in prices for the consumer.This certainly isn’t the first book about the consequences of cheap fashion – British journalist Lucy Siegle published To Die For: Is Fashion Wearing Out The World? in 2011 – but Overdressed focuses less on the environment and more on a holistic overview of the fashion industry. It suggests overshopping is as bad for our souls as it is for the planet. Served up as evidence are the young female shopping addicts who prove the power of cheap clothes and the psychological sway of consumer desire. “My friends say I have enough clothing to open a store,” says Lee Councell, a 23-year-old shopaholic who owns 16 or 17 blazers but is still on the lookout for more.By the end, Cline’s manifesto for change involves customising and mending your clothes and a call for a return to quality, mid-priced, ethical and sustainable slow fashion. For some readers it will feel like preaching to the converted. For others, it will open the door to a whole new wardrobe.Carola Long is the FT’s deputy fashion editor"
99;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-05-17T22:33:12Z;Gap sales boost turnround strategy;;Gap produced further evidence that a turnround at the US retailer was under way as it reported a quarterly sales increase and raised its profit forecast for the year.For the three months to April 28, Gap reported net sales of $3.5bn, a 6 per cent rise compared with the same quarter a year ago. Comparable sales saw a 4 per cent increase.The San Francisco-based company forecast that net income for this year would stand at between $1.78 and $1.83 a share, above initial projections of $1.75 to $1.80. Analysts, however, had estimated full-year earnings of $1.98 a share.Gap has spent several years struggling to reverse declining sales in the US having lost its verve in fashion and marketing, according to analysts.Shares in the retailer have rallied more than 40 per cent since the start of the year – the fourth-best performing stock on the S&P 500. Gap shares rose as much as 8 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday after closing down 2.9 per cent at $26.31.Net income for the first-quarter stood at $233m, or 47 cents a share, compared with $233m, or 40 cents, a year earlier.Gap spent more on short-term investments including marketing and operating costs in the first quarter as the company tried to reclaim its standing as a fashion leader. Operating expenses for the first quarter were $980m, up from $918m from the same period last year.Analysts had deemed the company’s popular spring collection as the start of Gap’s turnround strategy in the US where the company has lost sales in recent years to competitors such as Hennes & Mauritz.“During the quarter, we improved sales, grew earnings per share, and continued investing in the business to drive performance,” said Glenn Murphy, Gap’s chairman and chief executive. While Mr Murphy said he was pleased with the company’s progress, he acknowledged the company had “lots of work to do”.Gap said last year it would close 21 per cent of its Gap-branded US stores in the next two years and triple its outlets in China by the end of 2012.Comparable sales rose 5 per cent at the group’s Gap and Banana Republic brands in North America and 4 per cent at Old Navy. Total overseas revenues rose 13 per cent to $511m but sales fell 4 per cent at international stores.Online revenue rose 18 per cent to $410m, the company said.
100;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-05-03T15:33:22Z;US retail spending slows in April;;US shoppers cooled their spending in April as they faced a softer economy and seasonal challenges, according to monthly sales figures from some of the country’s largest retail chains.Total sales at stores open for at least a year rose just 0.8 per cent last month, according to Retail Metrics, a research group. That was below the expected 1.5 per cent forecast increase and compared with an 8.7 per cent surge in April last year.Last month retailers faced headwinds, including an earlier Easter and unseasonably warm weather in February and March, which brought sales forward, as well as a weaker economic environment, highlighted by a rise in unemployment insurance claims and slow private sector job growth.“All of this was just too much to overcome for retailers as softness was evenly distributed across the retail landscape,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.Some analysts had hoped the momentum from March’s 3.9 per cent sales rise would carry over into April.“April put March into perspective,” said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the Pennsylvania university’s Wharton School. “People bought their spring clothes, but they bought them in March instead of in April. It was just regular, slow, solid progression.”Same-store sales at the discounter Target rose 1.1 per cent, less than half the 2.9 per cent expected. Costco, the membership warehouse club, reported a 4 per cent gain compared with an estimated 5.4 per cent rise.Target “received an early season boost from the combination of warm weather and an earlier Easter”, said Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of the chain.Sales were weaker than forecast at middle-market chains, including Macy’s, the department store, where sales rose 1.2 per cent, below the 1.9 per cent forecast. The company said it had expected April’s figures to fall from March – when they rose 7.3 per cent – because of the combination of an early Easter and late Mothering Sunday.At Saks, the high-end department store, sales were up just 2 per cent compared with estimates of 5.6 per cent. Among the few department stores to report a gain was Nordstrom, where sales rose 7.1 per cent, above forecasts.The apparel retailer Gap reported a steeper than forecast 2 per cent drop as lower sales at its Old Navy stores offset increases at Gap and Banana Republic.But other clothing chains reported strong gains. American Eagle Outfitters, the teen-focused retailer, on Wednesday raised its first-quarter earnings outlook after comparable sales in the first three months of the year jumped 17 per cent.“We experienced broad-based strength in our spring merchandise selling, which enabled us to pull back on full-scale promotional plans,” said Robert Hanson, chief executive.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Henri Bendel, also boosted its profit guidance after it reported April sales climbed 6 per cent compared with an expected 3.9 per cent.TJX, the brand-name discounter, said its sales rose 7 per cent, twice the forecast gain.

The label’s founder Tamara Mellon also quit last November, after fifteen years at the brand.Earlier this month, Ms Mellon delivered a stinging attack in the Financial Times on the way in which private equity groups conduct themselves in their acquisitions of luxury fashion brands. In the decade up its sale by TowerBrook Capital to the Labelux Group for £500m last May, Jimmy Choo had been owned by three separate private equity groups as part of its gradual consolidation into a leading luxury lifestyle brand.Mr Schulman will take up his new position on May 7 and will report directly to Jim Gold, president of speciality retail at the Neiman Marcus Group, which operates Bergdorf’s.Karen Katz, president and chief executive officer of The Neiman Marcus Group, said: “Joshua’s unique experience blends keen business acumen with creativity and vision. He appreciates the legacy of Bergdorf Goodman but understands brands have to be continually defined and redefined.”She added: “From merchandising to marketing to sales and service, he is exceptional in his ability to bring an idea and an ideal to life.

103;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-04-05T13:40:15Z;Upbeat consumers boost US retailers;;An improving jobs market and unusually warm weather helped to lift US retail sales in March by nearly 4 per cent, beating Wall Street expectations and continuing a run of positive months.Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.9 per cent at the 20 or so at the retailers that report monthly figures, according to Retail Metrics, revealing little evidence of higher petrol prices crimping spending.“In general, there was real strength across the retail sector, across all parts of the value chain from luxury down to deep discounters,” said Joel Bines, a retail analyst at AlixPartners.Warm weather encouraged people to continue early spring clothes shopping, a trend that began in February.“Those [retailers] who missed [expectations] missed because of product and price, not because the consumer was not out shopping,” said Mr Bines.Gap, the clothes retailer, reported a second consecutive month of rising sales: at Gap-branded stores in North America they were up 9 per cent following a 1 per cent gain in February, when it started selling clothes from a new creative team.At TJX and Ross Stores, two leading discounters of clothes and household wares, sales rose 10 per cent from a year ago.At Target, the mass-market discounter, sales rose 7.3 per cent and Macy’s, a department store, also reported a 7.3 per cent increase.Mr Bines said clothes retailers could also claim credit for rolling out an attractive set of spring fashions.“Walking into the typical mall is like walking into a tulip garden. There is so much colour and freshness that it is really remarkable. It’s really resonating with the consumer,” he said.
104;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-03-29T17:07:11Z;H&M to launch new line of stores;;Hennes & Mauritz said it was going to launch a new line of stores next year as the Swedish fashion retailer reported a substantially worse than expected rise in profits for the first quarter.The Stockholm-based company, which vies with the world’s biggest fashion retailers such as Inditex of Spain and Gap of the US, refused to give any details of the new line but analysts speculated it could cater to the older market.H&M’s COS, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday stores are all primarily focused on a younger demographic.“Our best guess is that the new format will be aimed at an older customer base, as they have a limited offering currently and it should allow for deeper penetration of existing as well as new markets,” said Adam Cochrane, analyst at UBS.The fashion retailer reported that higher commodity prices and a greater number of markdown sales had weighed on operating margins, which fell 1.2 percentage points to 12.7 per cent.Pre-tax profits rose 4.5 per cent to SKr3.7bn ($554m) in the three months to the end of February, which was short of the SKr4.2bn expected by analysts. Analysts had also expected margins to be broadly flat.Shares were down 4.9 per cent to SKr238.The company was once again forced to defend its strategy of protecting consumers from commodity prices rises and the impact of rising labour costs in Asia when competitors have passed these costs on.Karl-Johan Persson, chief executive, said: “H&M has a long-term perspective, we are investing for the future and we always have the customers in focus. Despite increased purchasing costs, we have continued to strengthen our customer offering – for example, by not raising our prices to customers.”The group reported a 3 per cent rise in same-store sales over the period, but much of this was due to a larger number of discount items being sold, which reduced gross margins by 0.9 per cent. More discount stock was available for the sales after a historically warm autumn suppressed demand for winter clothes last year.Revenue was up 13 per cent to SKr32bn over the period as the company saw better sales in its big markets such as the US, UK, Germany and France. This was balanced by weaker sales in Switzerland, Japan and Greece.Earnings per share rose 4.4 per cent to SKr1.65. The group opened 29 stores and closed 10 during the three-month period and it now has 2,400 stores worldwide. It confirmed its target to increase the number of stores by 10 to 15 per cent a year.
105;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-03-22T16:42:47Z;Li & Fung bullish on pace of US recovery;;Li & Fung, a bellwether of global consumer sentiment, said new orders showed US consumer demand was a lot stronger than economic indicators would suggest and the recovery of its biggest market was happening faster than expected.William Fung, executive deputy chairman of the world’s largest supplier to consumer brands, said demand from US clients such as Walmart and Gap was stronger than anticipated in January and February as consumers began to feel more secure about employment. The US market accounted for 60 per cent of Li & Fung’s $20bn revenue last year.However, chances of a speedy European recovery were much lower by comparison, he said. Asia was another bright spot for the Hong Kong-based company, with demand for its goods tripling in 2011 to about half of its European sales. Bruce Rockowitz, chief executive officer, predicted that by 2013, Asian sales would likely catch up with Europe, traditionally the group’s second-largest market.Li & Fung’s net profit increased 24 per cent to $681m on a 26 per cent rise in sales, in line with expectations. Analysts commended its cost controls, especially in the second half of the year. Core operating profit at its sourcing business, which accounted for 80 per cent of revenue, rose from 3.1 per cent of sales to 3.6 per cent despite sharp increases in Chinese wages and raw material costs.Contrary to the common belief that contract manufacturing in China was “dead”, Mr Rockowitz said sourcing from the country rose 24 per cent by volume last year as Chinese factories were still the top choice for making higher-end products.Outside of China, Bangladesh overtook Vietnam as its second-biggest production base because its factories had rapidly advanced their expertise in apparel, while Vietnam’s rising costs had made it less competitive against China, he said.The company has been on the acquisition trail in order to diversity into distribution and logistics and its purchases over the past year generated $2bn in annualised turnover, it said. By comparison, analysts said growth may be slowing at its existing business, a concern given its cash pile has more than halved since 2010, which could slow future M&A activity.“Cost control was a bright spot, but I am concerned about the balance sheet flexibility to make future acquisitions and drive revenue growth,” said Gary Pinge, regional head of consumer and gaming at Macquarie Research.“The 2011 top-line performance seems to be mainly driven by acquisitions. With $5bn in acquired revenues over 2010 and 2011, I think underlying organic growth rate may be quite low. Unless the company can deleverage, it may need to slow down on acquisitions, which could expose the low organic growth rate.”
106;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-03-20T00:32:46Z;Amazon acquires robotic delivery group;;Amazon is to improve its warehouse systems by spending $775m to buy Kiva Systems, a group whose technology replaces traditional shelf picking with mobile robots that deliver packages into the hands of stationary workers.The cash deal underlines Amazon’s determination to improve the speed and reliability of its systems to get packages to consumers, which retail analysts say are already better than many of its US rivals even though they are relatively labour-intensive.Dave Clark, vice-president for global customer fulfilment at Amazon, said: “Amazon has long used automation in its fulfilment centres, and Kiva’s technology is another way to improve productivity by bringing the products directly to employees to pick, pack and stow.”Faye Landes, managing director of Consumer Edge Research, said: “Amazon is very anxious to deliver as efficiently as possible and in a perfect world, that would mean getting same-day delivery.”“It’s extremely important because it obviates the need to ever go to a store. Most shopping needs are not truly acute, so if we can order in the morning and know it’s there when we get home in the evening, that’s enough.”The Seattle-based retailer generates a small but growing proportion of its revenue from offering its distribution services to other merchants via a business called Fulfillment by Amazon.Kiva’s systems remove the need for workers to trek the corridors of vast warehouses by instead using orange robots that propel mobile shelves to staff work stations, where workers pick off packages and put them into the relevant order basket.The acquisition, which has been approved by Kiva’s shareholders, is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.Kiva, which will retain its headquarters in Massachusetts after the deal, says its technology is already used by Staples, Gap, Walgreens and Crate & Barrel.Amazon said Kiva’s existing customers “will continue to receive service and support after the transaction”.Kiva systems are already in use at Quidsi, an online soap and nappy retailer that Amazon acquired in 2010.In order to improve its delivery speeds, Amazon invested heavily last year in building 17 distribution centres, bringing its total in the US and overseas to 69.The distribution centres have complicated its US tax position, because while Amazon has benefited from not having to collect sales tax from customers in most US states, it is required to do so in states where it has a physical presence.While Amazon says it supports a federal solution to help all states collect tax from online retailers, it is pursuing a deal in New Jersey that would give it a sales tax holiday in return for a $130m investment in distribution facilities that would create 1,500 jobs.Last month, it announced plans to open a second distribution centre in Delaware, which does not have a sales tax.
107;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-03-01T17:27:10Z;Gap and Target post strong February sales;;US retailers recorded better than expected sales in February as positive economic news and warm weather prompted an early start to spring shopping.New fashion items at Gap helped generate its first sales growth in seven months as overall retail sales grew 6.5 per cent from a year ago among the 20 or so companies that report monthly figures.The gain was the biggest since June 2011, according to Retail Metrics. Sales at Target, the mass-market discounter, rose 7 per cent and Macy’s, the department store, posted a 4.6 per cent increase.Barbara Kahn, marketing professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, said the strong sales figures reflected higher consumer confidence and lower unemployment and indicated that growing concern over rising gas prices was not yet inhibiting spending.But she added that Gap’s fortunes were a reminder that: “Consumers have to want to shop, but there has to be something in the stores they want to buy too.”At stores open at least a year, sales of the Gap brand in North America rose 1 per cent in February, as it started selling clothes from a new creative team that is aiming to reverse Gap’s long decline into dowdiness.“Customers responded well to our spring product,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive. Last week Gap had reported a bleak Christmas.Keith Jelinek of AlixPartners, a consultancy, said warm temperatures had encouraged shoppers to start buying spring clothes and outdoor furniture: “Retailers always want to blame the weather, but the weather definitely helped because this time last year we had very serious storms that pushed people inside.”Another month of strong growth at stores that specialise in cut-price goods, with 9 per cent increases at both TJX and Ross Stores, suggested consumers remain cost-conscious.“They’re being very precise in what they want to buy. They’re not updating their whole wardrobe. They’re being wise with their spend,” Mr Jelinek said.Last week, Walmart, which does not report monthly sales, said US unemployment had not yet fallen to a level where financial pressure on its core low-income customers had visibly eased. On Thursday the retailer, the world’s biggest by sales, said it would raise its annual dividend 9 per cent to $1.59 per share.At Limited Brands, which owns the store chains Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Henri Bendel, sales rose 8 per cent in February.
108;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-03-01T15:28:03Z;Improving jobs outlook lifts Wall Street;;US stocks survived a mid-afternoon oil price surge to finish the session at a post-financial crisis high as Wall Street’s best start to a year in two decades continued to gather strength.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,374.09, rebounding strongly after a first fall in five days on Wednesday.The benchmark index had opened higher as initial jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March 2008. Stocks barely paused for breath when consumer spending data showed a fall in real disposable income in January, leading Goldman Sachs to lower its first-quarter growth forecast.A surge in the price of crude oil triggered a pullback in mid-afternoon trade but the S&P 500 rebounded to finish near a day high.Despite the US market’s apparent resilience to bad news in 2012, Sam Stovall at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ became the third equity analyst in a week to urge clients to retreat from equities.“We view current price levels . . . as very good areas in which to lighten equity exposure. We think the next pullback could be particularly sharp,” Mr Stovall said in a note.Bank stocks led the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 climbing 1.6 per cent. Bank of America was up 1.9 per cent to $8.12 and JPMorgan rose 2.9 per cent to $40.37, its highest close since August.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.2 per cent higher at 12,980.3 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to 2,988.97.Among investment banks, Goldman Sachs surged 5 per cent to $121.13, a six-month high, and Morgan Stanley added 3.5 per cent to $19.19.Nomura analysts forecast that the sluggish start to the year in US M&A and equity trading activity would pick up as a result of the buoyant markets.“Investor risk appetite has increased and asset levels are higher,” Glen Schorr told Nomura clients. “If asset prices can hold relatively steady, we think activity in these businesses will likely see some improvement.”February same-store sales exceeded analysts’ expectations for many retailers.Shares in Gap climbed 7.2 per cent to $25.05 as sales rose 4 per cent, beating the average analyst estimate for a decline of 1.4 per cent.The clothing store chain endured a torrid 2011 but shares are now within reach of 10-year highs, having gained by a third this year.Mid-market department store chain Kohl’s was one of the few companies to disappoint with its same-store sales figure. It slipped 1.6 per cent to $48.87.Advanced Micro Devices climbed 2.2 per cent to $7.51 after the semiconductor manufacturer’s move to buy computer server manufacturer, SeaMicro.The purchase appears designed to staunch AMD’s loss of market share to Intel in sales of personal computer chips. Shares in Intel lost 0.1 per cent to $26.86.It was the second sign of consolidation in the semiconductor space this week after Japanese computer memory chipmaker Elpida filed for bankruptcy. But analysts said the two cases were different.“The computer memory space is ripe for consolidation because the industry has high fixed costs and products are easily substitutable,” said Srini Pajjuri at Crédit Agricole Securities.“AMD’s acquisition, on the other hand, is more strategic. It’s partly vertically integrating to improve its offering to computer manufacturers.”First Solar fell 5.8 per cent to $30.42 as investors continued to sell the stock after the solar panel manufacturer declared an unexpectedly large quarterly loss this week.At one point in February, shares in First Solar were up almost 50 per cent for the year, following the trend for last year’s S&P 500 laggards to outperform in 2012.But the poor earnings report and a planned reduction in German subsidies for solar panels have seen its shares fall $20 in two weeks and the stock is down 10 per cent for the year.Finisar ended a volatile day up 4.6 per cent to $21.23. The stock had fallen as much as 10 per cent in pre-market trading after the telecoms equipment provider saw earnings fall 50 per cent compared with the same period last year.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 2.6 per cent to $8.59, giving back part of a strong gain on Wednesday, which analysts had put down to unrealistic expectations of an imminent housing recovery.
109;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-02-24T17:38:07Z;Retailers seek fresh strategies to survive;;Few US retailers had a great holiday season and results for the Christmas quarter reported this week underlined how many of them still need to reform to survive in an overcrowded market.Already in the midst of an overhaul is JC Penney, the department store chain now led by the former head of Apple’s retail business. JC Penney reported a net loss of $87m on Friday due to the costs of shaking up its management and laying the foundations to reform its pricing.Its new era of low prices and no unpredictable discounts began on February 1 – and JC Penney said sales so far were below last year. But a 1.8 per cent fall in like-for-like sales in the three months to January 28 was a reminder that something had to change.Walmart, the mass market discounter, has been cutting prices to win back customers it lost during the recession. It patted itself on the back for a second consecutive rise in US like-for-like sales, even though it did not show the momentum investors wanted.Gap, which has spent years trying unsuccessfully to restore its fashion touch, reported sales down 3 per cent at Gap-branded North America stores.Sears Holdings, another turnround story that has so far failed to materialise, signalled a radical change of course by spinning off part of its business and selling 11 stores to raise up to $770m as it reported a net loss of $2.4bn.Perhaps the best performance of the week came from Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, where improved customer service, a reformed supply chain and cost-cutting helped it to 6.1 per cent US sales growth and a 32 per cent rise in net income.
110;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-02-24T00:05:35Z;Bleak Christmas for Gap as earnings drop 40%;;Gap’s efforts to revive its fortunes suffered another setback in the crucial Christmas quarter when the clothes retailer’s sales fell both in the US and overseas and net earnings dropped 40 per cent.The San Francisco-based company said on Thursday that like-for-like sales at Gap-branded stores in North America fell 3 per cent from a year ago while international sales were down 8 per cent in the three months to January 28. Analysts said the company continued to suffer from its uninspiring range of clothes.Gap has spent several years struggling to reverse slumping sales in the US. The company lost its verve in fashion and branding, faces rising sourcing costs, and has become a symbol of a perceived surplus of stores in a fragile US economy where ecommerce is growing.In the fourth quarter, its net earnings tumbled 40 per cent to $218m on sales that fell $100m to $4.3bn, but profits were slightly better than Wall Street had expected. Gap shares declined 1.2 per cent to $23.25 in after-hours trading after it released its results.The company also announced a new $1bn share buy-back plan having repurchased $2.1bn of its own shares last year.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, said: “We all agreed 2011 was not our best foot forward at Gap.” For the 12 months, like-for-like sales were down 4 per cent while net income fell 17 per cent to $833m.But Mr Murphy said the company had made progress by closing 65 US stores and opening new outlets overseas to rebalance Gap’s geographical exposure. The Gap group had 2,650 stores in North America at the end of the quarter out of its global total of 3,263.Mr Murphy said a new creative centre, established last year in New York to bring together design, production and marketing operations, was beginning to make a difference, with its first clothes going on sale in stores in the past two weeks.The new products have got more favourable reviews than Gap is used to, given a common criticism that it has struggled to get beyond khakis and button-down shirts, but analysts say it may not have enough attractive styles to excel in a hyper-competitive retail market.In the latest in a series of management changes earlier this week, Gap appointed Liz Meltzer, a former Uniqlo executive, to oversee international merchandising, and Jill Stanton, a former Nike executive, as creative adviser for Old Navy.Gap said sales at its Old Navy business in North America fell 6 per cent. The best performance came at Banana Republic in North America, where sales were flat.In its international business, Mr Murphy said he was optimistic about China, where the group has 14 stores and plans to have 45 by the end of 2012.In Europe, he said the company had been hurt by austerity measures in its biggest markets – the UK and France – and by its failure to offer women’s clothes that appealed to customers.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and chief investor. The process is set to begin in April with the $270m sale of 11 stores.The shares climbed 18.7 per cent to $61.80, $15 above their price before December’s announcement.That helped the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 to a healthy gain, although it remained in negative territory for the week, and was not helped by a 5.9 per cent fall for Kohl’s, the mid-market department store, which reported a decline in profits of nearly 8 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, high costs ate into margins for several companies.Shares in Safeway fell 7.6 per cent to $20.95, as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins. Analysts had forecast worse figures and the shares climbed 2.9 per cent to $54.50.Procter & Gamble investors responded positively as the company bowed to analyst pressure to streamline its business, by announcing it would cut 5,700 jobs and $10bn in costs over the next four years. Shares in the consumer goods maker climbed 3.1 per cent to $66.42.Elsewhere, stocks closed within 0.2 points of a post-financial crisis high, as the S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,363.46 points.Wall Street had opened lower but was given a shot in the arm by better than expected data from the Kansas Fed manufacturing index, a closely watched indicator of economic activity in the mid-western states of the US.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,984.69 points, its highest close since May 2008.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,956.98 points, as Apple shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $516.39, after the company bowed to pressure to give investors greater influence over the election of directors.Shares in Vivus gained 77.5 per cent to $18.73 after the drugmaker received backing from a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel for a new weight loss pill.Hewlett-Packard shares fell 6.5 per cent to $27.05 after the computer maker reported a 7 per cent fall in sales after the bell on Wednesday. Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, promised a multi-year turnround of HP’s large businesses, but analysts stressed the challenges.“[The turnround] will require significant investment in streamlining operations, regaining product leadership and positioning the company to benefit from key industry trends,” said Richard Gardner, technology analyst at Citi. “The company will have to make these investments while navigating a number of extremely competitive, mature end markets – not a journey for the faint of heart.”Shares in First Solar fell 8 per cent to $37.20, as investors reacted to the German government’s plans to cut subsidies for solar power generation. Analysts were expecting the solar panel manufacturer to report a fall in profits of more than 10 per cent when it released fourth-quarter results after the close of trading on Thursday.MetroPCS climbed 13.8 per cent to $11.70 as the company reported a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged large mobile networks by offering customers attractive rates. But the company showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs. The cost of acquiring new customers fell, while most analysts had expected it to rise.Oil and gas exploration and production companies continued to report fourth-quarter results and 2012 budgets, with two winners evident on Thursday.QEP Resources climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.03 and Denbury Resources was up 5.5 per cent to $20.71 as the companies responded to decade-low natural gas prices in different ways.Denbury saw fourth-quarter profits easily beat analyst expectations, thanks to strong oil output from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.QEP resources reported a fourth-quarter loss, but saw earnings from its field services operation, which is less closely tied to gas prices, almost double compared with the same period in 2010.Shares in Salesforce.com gained as much as 10 per cent to $144.33 in after hours trading, after the business accounting software provider reported revenue that exceeded analyst expectations.

Shares climbed 1.4 per cent to $509.46 yesterday as investors brushed off attempts by a Taiwanese company to prevent the export of iPads from China as a trademark tussle rumbled on.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was hit hard as investors absorbed banks’ submissions on the proposed Volcker rule on proprietary trading.Bank of America fell 3.3 per cent to $7.98 after Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that “earnings headwinds” would check a rally, which has seen BofA shares climb more than 40 per cent this year.Morgan Stanley fell 2.5 per cent to $19.05 and Citigroup was off 2.4 per cent to $32.08.However, not all analysts expect Volcker concerns to weigh on bank stocks.Insurer Fidelity National bucked the trend of falling financials, climbing 7 per cent to $31.04, for the best performance in the S&P 500.The company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings but also raised its quarterly dividend by 17 per cent to $0.14 per share.First Solar fell 6 per cent to $39.21 on reports that solar panel installations in Germany, a big global market, will be far lower than previously expected in the first four months of the year.Goodyear Tire fell 5.2 per cent to $13.25 after fourth-quarter revenues missed analyst expectations.Shares in Hospira climbed 6.1 per cent to $36.30 with investors apparently relieved that fourth-quarter profit only fell 15 per cent year-on-year.Shares in Gap rose 2.9 per cent to $22.34 as Citigroup analysts recommended clients buy the stock, pointing out the company had substantial cash on hand for stock buy-backs if it wanted to support its share price.Netflix shares climbed 4 per cent to $123.07 as filings showed that Jana Partners, a hedge fund, took a $45m stake in the video streaming and DVD delivery company in the final quarter of 2011.Shares in Zynga, the developer of online games such as FarmVille, climbed 7 per cent to $14.35, a new high, ahead of its first quarterly earnings report, which came after the close of trading.The company reported more than $300m in fourth-quarter revenue, a jump of almost 60 per cent from the previous year, although stock distributions to employee meant the company was lossmaking.Shares retreated by a few cents after hours, but are still up around 50 per cent so far this year.Shares in Michael Kors jumped 27.5 per cent to $42.85 after the luxury-goods maker reported same store sales in North American and European stores climbed by more than a third in its fiscal third quarter. Shares have now more than doubled in price since an initial public offering just two months ago.
114;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-02-02T21:06:21Z;New tech stocks surge on Facebook’s IPO fizz;;Facebook’s $5bn IPO filing was a fillip for recently debuted internet businesses.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,859.68, handily outperforming other big US indices as stocks from Chinese social network Renren to offers website Groupon surged.Zynga benefited the most. Shares in the social-game developer climbed as much as 20 per cent to hit an all-time high of $12.91 before closing at $12.39, a gain of 16.8 per cent.That came after Facebook’s filing revealed Zynga accounted for 12 per cent of Facebook’s 2011 revenue, up from 10 per cent in the prior two years. Zynga shares ended the day comfortably above their $10 IPO price, for the first time since the company’s own stock market debut in December.But other moves appeared to have little to do with any Facebook-specific information.Professional networking website LinkedIn climbed 8.2 per cent to $76.87, Groupon climbed 7.4 per cent to $23.08 and Renren was up 8.2 per cent to $5.42. SINA, a Chinese social-media company, which owns a Twitter-like service, climbed as much as 5 per cent before closing up 1.9 per cent to $75.30.“This rally is really all about sentiment,” said Herman Leung, a tech analyst at Susquehanna. “We’re seeing big share price moves for anything with a whiff of social about it on no real news, while old school internet companies underperform.”Yahoo slipped 0.1 per cent to $15.72 and Google climbed 0.7 per cent to $585.11.Elsewhere, US stocks were generally flat with the S&P 500 inching up 0.1 per cent to 1,325.54.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,705.41, as Pfizer fell 0.9 per cent to $21.11 after the drug maker recalled 1m packets of birth control pills amid fears that faulty packaging could potentially lead to unwanted pregnancies.Merck shares also fell 0.5 per cent to $38.44 although Pfizer’s rival swung to a fourth-quarter profit, beating analyst expectations. The second-largest US drug maker by revenues predicted a relatively flat 2012, with profits expected to be hit by cheaper generic forms of its biggest product, asthma drug Singulair.Retail stocks were volatile as clothing stores updated investors on fourth-quarter expectations.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 13.7 per cent to a 52-week low of $40.40, as the clothing store warned fourth-quarter profit will come in well below expectations.The company said sales growth of 16 per cent in the quarter ended January 28 was driven almost exclusively by new store openings, as same-store sales came in flat.Rival clothing company Gap jumped 10.6 per cent to $21.52, despite forecasting a fall in same-store sales across its brands of 4 per cent and a 2 per cent fall in overall sales. Analysts had been braced for much worse, but sales at Banana Republic stores surprised on the upside.However, Robert Drbul at Barclays Capital noted that apparel, footwear and textiles stores underperformed the S&P 500 in January, while, “exposure to Europe remains a concern given the soft macroeconomic environment”.Earnings were responsible for other big movers, with JDS Uniphase falling 7.2 per cent to $12.19 even though quarterly earnings came in better than expected as the fibre optics manufacturer recovered strongly from supply-chain disruption in Thailand.Nikos Theodosopoulos at UBS downgraded JDS to “neutral” from a “buy” recommendation, telling clients that, “while orders looked good we struggle to place a higher than 15 [times earnings] multiple on JDSU’s cyclical business.”Qualcomm shares climbed 2 per cent to $60.73 as strong sales of smartphones drove demand for its wireless networking products, helping deliver better than expected fiscal first-quarter results and strong guidance for 2012.“A healthy market, ongoing share gains and conservative guidance should yield further upside in the shares,” said Jeff Kvaal at Barclays Capital.CME Group rose 8.4 per cent to $257.13. The largest US exchange group by market capitalisation said fourth-quarter profit rose, with a tailwind from an Illinois tax benefit. Meanwhile NYSE Euronext rallied 1.9 per cent to $26.94 after retreating on Wednesday, as the European Commission blocked its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.Electronic Arts gained 6.1 per cent to $19.57 after the second-largest US video-game publisher reported a 70 per cent increase in third-quarter profit.MasterCard shares, which climbed 66 per cent in 2011, were on the move again, gaining 6.7 per cent to $381.57. The credit-card company delivered strong earnings, once a $495m after-tax charge against litigation was stripped out of fourth-quarter numbers.
115;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-02-02T19:28:58Z;US retail sales mixed in January;;US retailers reported mixed sales figures for January with half beating market expectations and half falling short as overall sales rose 4.4 per cent from a year ago.January is traditionally a quiet month that accounts for a small proportion of full-year sales, as consumers count the cost of their Christmas spending and retailers seek to clear out the remainder of their inventory.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which compiles the monthly figures, said January had yielded “all kinds of mixed messages” about the resilience of consumers and their shopping preferences.The figures signalled a slight acceleration from sales growth in the holiday shopping months of November and December, when sales rose 4.1 per cent from the previous year, according to National Retail Federation.Macy’s, the department store, reported a 2.4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales at stores open at least a year, which fell short of market expectations.In contrast, Costco, a warehouse club that performed consistently well in 2011, said its like-for-like sales in the US, excluding gas, rose by 8 per cent in January. Target also beat expectations with a 4 per cent gain in sales.However, Gap, the clothing retailer, reported another weak month, with like-for-like sales in January – including online sales – down 4 per cent from a year ago.Unusually warm weather across much of the US meant that sales of winter clothes did not match those of an icy cold January in 2011.John Long, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consulting firm, said the growing importance of online sales at some bricks-and-mortar retailers was reducing the significance of the monthly store sales figures.“We’ve seen some companies today that are not hitting sales expectation but revising their earnings forecasts up,” he said. “What that suggests is that the same-store sales picture is becoming a smaller and smaller indicator of a retailer’s overall health because it’s only reporting one channel.”Retailers are not expected to step up marketing, promotions and price discounts until March, said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, in a report this week.
116;GPS;Gap Inc;2012-01-25T15:00:59Z;Anywhere, anytime: the future of employment is flexible;Traditional office culture is being replaced by more pliable arrangements – and delivering business benefits;The transformation of the working environment is apparent to new Unilever employees from the moment they arrive at the consumer goods company’s 21st-century offices in locations such as New Jersey and Singapore. Instead of being shown to a department or desk, they can choose where and when to work, as long as this suits the demands of the role and the working style of their team.This is their first taste of “agile working” at Unilever, which aims to make 30 per cent of roles location-free by 2015. The strategy is designed to cut office space and business travel, increase productivity, and encourage a management approach that judges performance on results rather than hours worked.Fiona Laird, senior vice-president of human resources and one of the leaders of the initiative, says it is the biggest change in working culture in her 20 years with the company. It requires a holistic approach from senior management, covering people, place and infrastructure. “It’s absolutely critical to have the marriage of HR, real estate and technology,” she says. “You can’t do one without the others.”The principles of the strategy, launched in 2009, specify that all employees may work at any time and anywhere as long as business needs are met, that travel should be avoided wherever possible, and that managers are assessed annually on how well they support agile workers.Unilever is one of a growing number of companies that are pioneering new approaches to work in the digital age and recognising the vital role culture plays in making a successful transition. While researching our book, Future Work, I and Peter Thomson, a former director of the Future Work Forum at Henley Business School, found organisations that encourage innovative working practices are most likely to have a culture of trust and empowerment. These companies also assume employees are self-motivated, value their creativity, and expect them to “do the right thing”.Redesigning space and putting in technology may be important, but moving the furniture is not enough without a shift in management attitudes. “The worst examples of so-called flexible workspaces have junior employees crammed together in poorly run hot-desking areas while senior managers maintain separate fiefdoms, luxuriating in their thick-carpeted personal offices,” says my co-author. “The best examples have the chief executive and directors sitting in open-plan areas, symbolising the abolition of traditional hierarchies.”It can take time to effect a change, especially if there is resistance from management. Leadership commitment and a strong business case are both critical to creating an open and flexible working culture, notes BDO USA, the accounting firm, which has won awards for its practices.“The first and most important step is leadership support and accountability,” says Marcee Harris Schwartz, director of the company’s flex strategy. “A key differentiator for us is that our chief executive, Jack Weisbaum, feels ownership of the strategy and speaks eloquently about the benefits. He speaks about how he will try and wrap up part of the day, go for a swim, have dinner with his wife, then log back on in the evening to interact with our west coast leaders.”The firm also set out to monitor and measure the business benefits – ranging from property savings to faster access to new markets and higher productivity. The initiative goes much further than conventional flexible working arrangements, Ms Harris Schwartz points out. “It wasn’t an HR programme or benefit. It really was a business strategy. It wasn’t just something mothers or working women used, but something everyone uses every day.”Gap, the clothing retailer, found that traditional flexible work options failed to address its business challenge – in this case an unacceptably high rate of staff turnover in one of its departments in California. It was only when it adopted a “results-only work environment”, in which employees could come and go as they liked provided they met their objectives, that staff attrition dropped rapidly, it says.Companies making the transition to the new world of work say it is essential to address managers’ fears. Many initially believe employees will shirk their duties if they are not present in the office during fixed working hours. Making expectations clear to staff at the outset is important, as is regular and open communication between managers and team members. Trust is at the heart of the relationship, requiring adaptability and accountability on both sides. “If you really trust people and really rely on them, they are more reliable and trustworthy,” says Syd Nadim, chief executive of Clock, a UK digital marketing agency that gives employees a lot of latitude. “Let go and watch how well other people can deliver and perform.”Businesses with experience of managing teams across locations and time zones find that, with mobile technology, the bigger danger is that employees will not switch off. “‘Anytime, anywhere’ must not become ‘always on’”, says Unilever’s Ms Laird. Leaders should not expect this of their teams, and individuals must be supported to say “no” if they find they are being overstretched.Companies also need to take national cultures into account when rolling out global innovation policies. A survey by Thomson Reuters, the information group, found that practices such as working from home could be a challenge in parts of Asia, where internet connections are unreliable and many employees live with their extended families.However, new working styles are emerging in rising economies as well as developed ones. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and a strong culture of “face time” in the office. The country has embarked on a national policy to encourage more people to work from home or from specially equipped “smart work” centres – hubs closer to residential areas that workers can use without a long commute to the office. “Using time and space more flexibly, I can now give more attention to my kid’s education and emotional development,” says one engineer with Samsung Electronics who uses a smart work hub. “I can also respond to urgent situations much more rapidly. Hopefully, my wife can finish her PhD while I work here.”Alison Maitland is the co-author of ‘Future Work: How Businesses Can Adapt and Thrive in the New World of Work’ (Palgrave Macmillan)
117;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Icann to expand domain despite web of protest;;The non-profit organisation that oversees internet domain names has said it will go ahead with plans to create several hundred new suffixes to rival .com and .net from January 12, despite intense pressure from big companies and US lawmakers to delay or limit the programme.“Many of the recent concerns expressed about the new top-level domain program are more about ‘perceived’ problems than actual deficiencies,” says Steve Crocker, chairman of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann).Big companies such as Procter & Gamble, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, Kellogg and Kraft oppose the plans, which they estimate would cost each company an extra $2m on average in having to protect trademarks across hundreds of new internet domains. They are also concerned about increased customer confusion and online fraud.The Association of National Advertisers, a US trade body whose members include Coca-Cola, Gap and the Ford Motor, has mounted an extensive lobbying effort in Washington against the internet domain programme, involving more than 160 companies and trade associations. This has resulted in two Senate hearings and a series of letters from congressmen, the Federal Trade Commission and international organisations, all calling for delay.“You are going to place a tax on the internet ecosystem costing billions of dollars, but we haven’t seen any cost-benefit analysis. We don’t believe there is a need for this programme,” says Bob Liodice, chief executive of the ANA, who has not ruled out a legal challenge to the plan.A number of new internet names are likely to prove popular and could become subject to bidding wars to decide who will gain control of them.Names such as .nyc, .bayern, .africa, .sco, .eco, .gay and .ngo all have gained interest from more than one organisation.One of the most famous battles has been over .eco, where a group backed by Al Gore, the environmental campaigner and former US vice-president, is pitched against Big Room, a Canadian company, for ownership of the name. Both would like to use it as the internet domain for the green movement, and both sides have been lining up support from leading environmental organisations such as the Sierra Club and the WWF.Similarly, two gay organisations, the Dot-Gay Alliance and DotGay LLC, are both vying for control of the .gay domain.Under Icann rules, where there is more than one application, the domain name will go to the organisation willing to pay the most for rights.Top Level Domain Holdings, an Aim-listed company that plans to apply for several of the new domain extensions, says in many cases deals will be struck between bidders.However, if an auction breaks out, the costs of a domain name could run to several million dollars, further adding to the revenues Icann takes in from the name expansion.The full list of name applications will be published at the end of April.However, Mr Crocker points out that Icann has debated the internet names plans over six years and run pilot programmes related to the expansion.The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the US Commerce Department unit that oversees Icann’s contract to administer internet names, has also asked the organisation to address concerns, but it stopped short of asking for a postponement and robustly defended the Icann programme during Senate hearings in Washington last month.The NTIA is keen not to undermine Icann for fear that it could lead to internet governance moving away from the California-based organisation to a a body like the United Nations. In that case countries such as China and Iran, which favour restrictions on internet use, could have more influence over online policies.Consultancies that help companies manage their internet names are expecting up to 1,500 organisations to apply for new suffixes such as .deloitte or .sport. Many community groups have already been open about plans to apply for names such as .london, .nyc and .scot, as well as .eco for green industries. The Public Interest Registry, which currently runs the .org domain is planning to bid for .ngo, which it would make into an internet hub for non-profit organisations.Companies have been more reluctant to publicise their plans for fear of giving away their branding strategies. Canon, Hitachi and Deloitte are among the very few that have openly stated plans to apply for a name. Around 80 per cent of the 350 companies that have expressed interest are from outside the US, though American companies are beginning to consider applications, says Stuart Durham, sales director at Melbourne IT, the domain name consultancy.“We’ve seen more US companies come off the fence recently,” he says. “Many were expecting the lobbying by the ANA to slow the process down but now that does not seem to be happening. We have got some fairly significant interest.”Companies will pay $185,000 to apply for a new top-level domain, and the list of applicants will be published by the end of April. The first of the new domains could be operational in 2013.The high application fees are raising a secondary concern over Icann’s ability to manage a vastly increased budget. The expected 1,000 or more applications would at least triple Icann’s current revenues to around $200m a year and the final number could be far higher. If more than one party is interested in a particular name, the winner could be decided through an expensive bidding war.Around $60,000 from each application will be set aside to fight any lawsuits arising from the domain name process. Icann is already facing a legal challenge over its decision to allow the controversial .xxx domain to be created for internet sites containing adult material. The remainder will go towards paying the lawyers and consultants at companies like Ernst & Young and KPMG, for processing the applications.Although the application fee was calculated to be revenue neutral, some members of the internet community are concerned that it will create a sizeable profit for the NGO.Kurt Pritz, senior vice-president of stakeholder relations at Icann, says any surplus money would be earmarked for either lowering application fees in the next round of domain name applications, or used to fund public service internet projects.“We have talked a lot about creating the foundation but it is hard to establish without knowledge of how large the available funds would be,” he said.

Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.

Bank of America climbed 8.6 per cent to $6.31, topping $6 for the first time since November, on its best one day gain since October.Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed their profit estimates for BofA citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits.Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December, without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 7.7 per cent to $7.04.That may also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform. SunTrust was up 5.4 per cent to $19.66, and Regions Financial climbed 4.2 per cent to $4.52, while some investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, sat out the rally. Goldman Sachs slipped 0.2 per cent to $94.58.The S&P 500 remained above its 200-day moving average for a third day, a sign of bullish sentiment, while Goldman Sachs reported that one-month realised correlation between the S&P 500 and its sectors, excluding financials, has fallen to its lowest level since August.

121;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-12-29T17:54:14Z;US retailers gifted Christmas boost;Consumers flock to stores for deals;A last-minute surge in revenue as consumers rushed to finish their Christmas shopping provided a boost to US retailers, but deep discounts will probably squeeze profit margins at many companies.Figures from several industry groups showed sales rose sharply in the week up to Christmas and the day after the holiday. The fact that Christmas fell on a weekend also helped retailers, with many staying open late on Christmas Eve when they promoted sales to draw in budget-minded consumers.Sales at chain stores rose 4.5 per cent in the week to December 24 from a year ago and were up nearly 1 per cent from the previous week, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs.“Consumers have become procrastinators and have bought closer to need,” said Michael Niemira, ICSC chief economist. “Those last few weeks were catch-up.”Figures from ShopperTrak, a shopper counting company, showed sales of apparel, furniture, sporting goods, books and general merchandise jumped 37.8 per cent to $44bn in the week before Christmas from the prior week, and were 14.8 per cent higher than a year ago.Sales the day after Christmas were also robust, ShopperTrak said, surging 25.5 per cent from last year to $7.1bn.“It really shows that consumers are willing to wait it out, wait for the discounts, and once they’re in the store, they’re willing to participate” said Bill Martin, ShopperTrak founder.The data supports forecasts of a firm finish to the year. The National Retail Federation recently increased its holiday forecast, saying it expects seasonal sales to rise 3.8 per cent this year to a record $469bn – but moderating from 2010’s 5.2 per cent increase.Underlining the growing importance of ecommerce, online sales have been growing at roughly three times the pace of overall sales.Mr Martin emphasised that “a dollar spent is a dollar spent, whether they’re spending it in a brick-and-mortar [store] or online. It’s all part of the consumers’ willingness to spend money that hopefully they have”.Mr Niemira said this year’s strong close was likely to spill over into January as shoppers redeem gift cards, which do not show up in retail sales figures until they are spent.Consumers reported that gift cards accounted for nearly 18 per cent of their spending this holiday season, he said, the highest level since 2006 and confirming surveys that indicated gift cards were the top choice of present this year.“This week and the first half of January tend to see a lot of gift card redemption, so you don’t want to close off the holiday season too soon,” he said. “We may see some unexpected strength in January sales to drive the first quarter.”But the welcome rise in sales may not translate into strong profits for many retailers, which lured budget-conscious shoppers with heavy advertising, big discounts and free shipping for online purchases.“We are very concerned for overall retail margins. It’s clear that the bulk of selling was driven by very deep discounts,” said Joel Bines, a retail analyst at AlixPartners. “In the holiday season, you can’t afford to have people stay away, and the only way was to offer discounts …Consumers are much better armed to ensure that they’re paying the sharpest prices possible.”Many apparel retailers have reported aenemic revenues in recent months in part due to unusually warm weather that led some shoppers to hold off winter clothing purchases, despite heavy marketing of sales and promotions.Sears Holdings, owner of the Sears and Kmart chains, announced this week it would close as many as 120 stores due to weak sales of electronics and clothing and higher expenses. In October, Gap said it would close 20 per cent of its namesake stores in the US over the next two years.Mr Bines said he expected more retailers to make similar moves, particularly in those segments where business is migrating online faster, such as electronics, books, games and DVDs. “There’s just too much brick-and-mortar store capacity out there for the amount of base business,” he said.Retailers have also been pinched by higher commodity prices this year that raised the costs of clothing, transportation and food, trimming margins even further at a time when companies have been hesitant to raise prices.“Outside of the luxury sector, retailers were simply unable to pass their costs along to their customers,” Mr Bines said.Consumer confidence has improved in recent months but is still at recessionary levels, underlining the uncertainty many Americans feel in an economy still dragged by high unemployment and declining home values.“We had always expected a tough profit season,” Mr Niemira said. “All of that was the backdrop that made it more difficult for retailers on the profit margin side. We expect that when the dust settles it’ll be viewed as a pretty good but not great season.”
122;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-12-27T18:46:47Z;Amazon leads holiday online retailers poll;Netflix losing appeal after tough year;Amazon has extended its lead in customer satisfaction rankings over Netflix and other US ecommerce groups, as winners and losers begin to emerge from a generally strong holiday season for online retailers.A poll of 8,500 consumers for Foresee, a customer satisfaction consultancy, found that Amazon scored 88 out of 100 on its index, a two-point advance to the highest score of any retailer in the seven years since the survey began.Netflix, by contrast, dropped seven points to 79 after a bruising year in which a 60 per cent price rise and an abortive attempt to split its DVD rental business from its online streaming service lost it more than 1m subscribers and left its shares down more than 60 per cent from the end of 2010.“Netflix totally misread its customer base and is paying the price, damaging its brand among both consumers and investors,” said Larry Freed, ForeSee’s chief executive. “Customer satisfaction is predictive, which means that Netflix’s financial woes may be just beginning,” he added: “If satisfaction drops significantly, a revenue drop is likely to follow.”Shares in Netflix were down $2.27 or 3.1 per cent at $70.35 in lunchtime trading on Tuesday, while Amazon shares slipped 60 cents or 0.3 per cent to $176.68.The two companies, which for several years enjoyed similarly high customer service scores, are coming into more direct competition as Amazon builds up digital media streaming services to supply content to its Kindle devices and to compensate for declining sales of the physical books, CDs and DVDs on which Jeff Bezos first began to build the business.ForeSee’s study found that Gap’s clothing site and Overstock.com, which sells discounted merchandise, suffered declines of six points and five points respectively in the customer satisfaction rankings. JC Penney, under the new leadership of former Apple executive Ron Johnson, recorded one of the biggest gains, up six points to 83.The survey found that US online shoppers are less price sensitive than in past years, with consumers citing price as their top priority for just one of the top 40 sites it measured. Instead, the range and quality of merchandise was cited as the priority by shoppers at 25 sites.Analysts expect another year of strong growth for e-commerce sites. The National Retail Federation reported that US consumers intended to spend about 36 per cent of their holiday budgets online, up from 32.7 per cent a year ago.IBM has predicted 9.5-10 per cent growth in December online sales, and said Christmas Day sales rose 16.5 per cent year on year, while early estimates from ComScore pointed to a 15 per cent advance over 2010 and a Shop.org survey found that 68 per cent of retailers expected at least 15 per cent growth in holiday season online sales year-on-year.
123;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-12-27T18:31:12Z;Sears Holdings to close up to 120 stores;;Shares in Sears Holdings tumbled on Tuesday after the owner of the Sears and Kmart US retail chains warned that weak sales of expensive electronic items and clothing would force it to close 100-120 stores.Comparable store sales for the eight weeks to December 25 were down 5.2 per cent across the group, with a 4.4 per cent fall at Kmart and a 6 per cent drop at domestic Sears stores. For the year to date, the group’s comparable store sales are down 2.6 per cent.Sears said partly as a result of the weak sales, it would have to take non-cash charges in the fourth quarter of $1.6bn to $2.4bn.The news follows Gap’s announcement in October that it will close one-fifth of its Gap-branded US stores in the next two years, and reflects a growing recognition that a weak economy and the rise of ecommerce has left the US with too many stores.Sears shares were down $12.47, or 27.2 per cent, in late morning trading at $33.38. The group, which saw its shares rise above $190 in 2007, has been struggling for some years to reposition itself, and has announced 950 job cuts in the past seven months.The fall in the shares takes them to levels last seen in 2004, when Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund manager behind ESL Investments who chairs and controls Sears, created the merged group having acquired much of Kmart’s debt while it was going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.Other retail stocks were little changed, but analysts are watching closely for signs of weak consumer spending in retailers’ busiest season. The National Retail Federation recently revised its holiday forecast upwards, predicting that seasonal sales would rise 3.8 per cent this year to a record $469bn, but this is below last year’s 5.2 per cent increase.Sears said Kmart’s sales decline was due to a decrease of demand for electronics and apparel and lower sales in its Layaway programme, which lets cash-strapped shoppers pay in instalments. At the Sears US chain, most of the decline came from electronics, but it also saw weakness in appliances, where it leads the market but has admitted “missteps” in introducing new Kenmore-branded items.The lower sales and an unspecified rise in expenses would leave adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the fourth quarter at less than half the $933m it reported a year ago, the group said. That will trigger a non-cash charge of $1.6bn-$1.8bn related to deferred tax assets, and an impairment charge against goodwill of up to $600m, it added.“Given our performance and the difficult economic environment, especially for big-ticket items, we intend to implement a series of actions to reduce ongoing expenses, adjust our asset base and accelerate the transformation of our business model,” said Lou D’Ambrosio, chief executive since February.He did not disclose the locations of the 100-120 stores to be closed, but said the closures would generate $140m-$170m in cash from inventory sales and further proceeds from the sale or sublease of the properties affected.In its remaining US stores, it will reduce inventories by $300m from the $10.2bn third-quarter level. It also announced plans to cut fixed costs by $100m to $200m, without giving details.“While our past practice has been to keep marginally performing stores open while we worked to improve their performance, we no longer believe that to be the appropriate action in this environment,” the company said, announcing a strategy of focusing resources on the best-performing stores “with the goal of converting their customer experience into a world-class integrated retail experience”.
124;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-12-07T23:47:18Z;A mangled guide to surviving digital Darwinism;;"The End of Business as Usual: Rewire the Way You Work to Succeed in the Consumer Revolution
By Brian Solis, Wiley, $24.95/£16.99The founder of Facebook, who has himself been the target of legal action, has lent his name to a law. Mark Zuckerberg’s Law of Social Sharing refers to his claim that the quantity of information shared online will double every year.The implications for business of this idea are the subject of technology writer Brian Solis’s new book, The End of Business as Usual.Solis is an internet zealot. “I live in social media,” he proclaims. When he gives presentations, he limits each slide to 140 characters so the audience can tweet it. He says that this sharing of information can be good news for business.He cites several examples to back up his argument. Each time a Facebook user chooses to “like” a company, they bring it to the attention of an average of more than 100 friends. PC maker Dell has claimed that average daily mentions of the company on Twitter exceed the combined circulation of the top 12 US newspapers. Businesses are so integral to social media that when Google’s rival to Facebook initially refused companies, users were outraged, proclaiming Google+ irrelevant. Google quickly rectified the situation.The internet means that consumers are able to voice their opinions swiftly and easily. Last year, for example, clothing group Gap was forced to drop plans to change its logo following an outpouring of online criticism.Solis recognises that there is not just one type of “connected consumer” – different audiences want different corporate approaches that are accessible on different devices. Users increasingly want more than just interaction and influence. In return for following companies online, they are demanding discounts on products; it is not enough, Solis says, to have a snazzy website and hope that customers will come to you.He approvingly cites companies that reward consumers for promoting them via social media. Palms Casino and Resort in Las Vegas offers 10 redeemable points for every tweet mentioning its name. In another promotion, Gap gave a 25 per cent discount to people who “checked in” to one of its stores using the smartphone location app Foursquare.Such discounting has implications on the high street. Retailers, says Solis, must match competitors’ prices, because phone-wielding consumers can seek out the cheapest option when queueing to purchase goods.He warns that without systems to analyse how online technology is changing consumer behaviour, companies face extinction through “digital Darwinism”.So who has got it right? When it comes to picking winners, Solis – of course – chooses Apple.The problem is that Apple contradicts many of his proclamations. It doesn’t have a Facebook page (though its App Store does), and if it did, it wouldn’t offer discounts. Instead, it has a great website – something that Solis says earlier in the book does not matter. If the future lies in social media, Apple appears the exception, not the rule.Readers of The End of Business as Usual will also find themselves challenged by some of the writing.To take just one sentence, which mangles Confucius with Google Translate: “The language [companies use] is the pavement that lays the foundation for the last mile of engagement.”Worse still are the buzz­words – “weblebrity”, which describes those with a big online following, is probably the most painful, but “egosystem”, “niche­works” and “nextworks” are also cringe-inducing.Another flaw is that Solis spends much of the time generalising from his own experiences.If tweeters are half as impatient as Solis suggests, they won’t get past page one. But if they can persevere past the buzzwords and the mangled sentences, corporate strategists might glean some practical insights."
125;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-12-01T18:44:48Z;Winners and losers in Black Friday sales;;Strong shopping traffic over the Black Friday holiday weekend failed to provide a boost to all retailers, with November sales figures revealing a clear separation of winners and losers.Like-for-like sales across the sector increased by 3.2 per cent in November from a year ago, but some retailers reported declines, according to Retail Metrics, a research group. Bargain-hunting shoppers in the days after Thanksgiving account for between 20 and 30 per cent of most retailers’ November revenue.In spite of a strong Black Friday, shares in Barnes & Noble, the book retailer, plunged by 16 per cent on Thursday after its latest quarterly results revealed slowing revenue growth and a bigger-than-expected loss as it invests in its digital business to take on Amazon and Apple.Among department stores, Macy’s reported a 4.8 per cent rise in sales in November thanks partly to the buzz generated by its decision to open at midnight on the cusp of Black Friday. But sales at JC Penney, which stuck to a 4am opening, fell 2 per cent.No clear recipe for success emerged. Kohl’s, which also opened at midnight, reported a 6.2 per cent fall in sales, while sales at Nordstrom, which kept to normal openings hours and did not offer big discounts, grew by 5.6 per cent.“You still have the consumer dichotomy,” said Joel Bines of consultancy Alix Partners, referring to shoppers who split their spending between high-end luxuries and cut-price basics. “And within each retail segment you are seeing a separation of the winners and the losers.”Barnes & Noble said its sales grew by 11 per cent over the Black Friday weekend, compared with retail-wide growth estimates that ranged from 9 to 16 per cent.But investors were unnerved by a sharp slowdown in sales growth for its Nook e-reader business in the three months to October 29 – which preceded the November launch of its own tablet computer – as total sales slipped 0.6 per cent to $1.89bn.Barnes & Noble shares were down 16 per cent at $14.62 at midday in New York after Standard & Poors lowered its rating on the company to sell and other analysts said they were reviewing their sales and profit estimates.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said that the November sales figures for the sector suggested “a good, but not great, start to the holiday shopping season”.Gap, the clothing retailer, reported another weak performance in November as it struggles to revive its business, with like-for-like sales at Gap-branded stores in North America falling 2 per cent and the group’s international sales down 9 per cent.Megan Donadio, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consultancy, said: “The companies that have had negative [sales] have lost touch with their target consumer. They’re clearly not able to give consumers what they want.”
126;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-11-30T14:57:56Z;Foreign retailers defy Hong Kong rent surge;;"Mongolian yurts standing on a ferry pier may be a strange sight for Hong Kong commuters on their journey to work but they are a telling symbol of the city’s shifting retail landscape.The yurts are the temporary home of Shanghai Tang, the luxury brand and Richemont subsidiary, which has just lost its 13-year-old flagship store in a downtown colonial building to Abercrombie & Fitch.“We are in between stores. We have become the nomads of Central district,” says Raphael le Masne de Chermont, executive chairman of Shanghai Tang.The Hong Kong retailer lost out because Abercrombie & Fitch offered the landlord around US$1m in rent per month, three times more than what Shanghai Tang was paying, real estate agents say. The US retailer is part of an influx of foreign mid-range retailers defying an average 25 per cent increase in retail rent this year to set up shop in the city in an effort to snare the big-spending mainland shopper.According to CBRE, the real estate agency, retailers in Hong Kong are this year paying on average about US$1,700 per square foot per year in prime locations, just behind prime areas in Manhattan, the world’s most expensive shopping district, where landlords charge US$1,900 per square foot. Sydney is in third place at US$1,224 per square foot.Gap, the US clothing retailer, opened its first Hong Kong store last Friday, while fellow US retailers American Eagle Outfitters has already opened and Forever 21 is putting the finishing touches to its first store. Zara and H&M, meanwhile, opened in Hong Kong in 2004 and 2007 respectively.Hong Kong’s retail market is tiny compared with the estimated US$2,200bn in China’s total retail spending last year but there are a number of reasons why it is proving a huge draw for retailers.There are many businesses in the city that specialise in bringing new brands to the mainland. By having a shop in Hong Kong first, and doing well there, brands can attract leading distributors to work with them in China, according to Jason Ding, a Beijing-based partner at consultancy Roland Berger.Also, as China’s most international city, brands that do well in Hong Kong also have a certain cachet and appeal to mainland consumers more than brands that only do well in, say, Shanghai or Beijing, retail analysts say.However, it is the sheer number of shoppers coming from north of the border that represent Hong Kong’s main appeal. In 2010, 23m visitors came to Hong Kong from mainland China, a 25 per cent increase on the previous year, and they spent about US$13bn in the city, according to the local tourism board. That is 17 times more than the amount Chinese tourists spent in France in the same period.“I find that prices here are around 20 per cent less than back home in Shanghai, because there is no tax. I am also buying cosmetics and handbags in Hong Kong because the quality is better – you know you are not picking up fakes here!” says Ms Wang, who is on her first trip to the city with her sister.Such mainland shoppers are playing a large part in the surge in retail sales in the city. Hong Kong recorded US$42bn in retail sales last year, up from US$39.9bn in 2009; and they have grown 17-28 per cent over the previous six quarters alone, year-on-year, according to government statistics.Competition is so intense that retailers are struggling to find the right kind of shop space. Many of the best spots already taken up by luxury brands. Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, Armani, and other high-price brands were the first western retailers to set up flagship stores in Hong Kong in the early 2000s with a firm eye on mainland Chinese demand. The absence of a luxury goods tax in the city made the shops an instant hit and there are entire streets, such as Canton Road in Kowloon, which are overwhelmingly dominated by luxury brands.Success in the city has prompted some retailers to tap the demand in the capital markets. Prada, which has eight stores in Hong Kong, raised US$2.2bn in a Hong Kong listing this summer, while L’Occitane, which has 20 stores, raised about US$700m last year. While the two stocks are trading 6 and 8 per cent below their IPO prices respectively, investor confidence in the Greater China retail market – mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan – has helped them beat the Hang Seng index, which is down 22 per cent this year.“Hong Kong is the most capitalist place in the world, and it’s all about survival. Retailers new to the market will soon find out that if they don’t do well, they will end up working for their landlords,” says Mr le Masne de Chermont."
127;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-11-18T19:24:41Z;Bears dominate Wall Street despite positive data;Major indices finish week down sharply;US markets spent the week threatening to break free from their eurozone shackles, only to be thwarted as the threat of contagion reared its head again.Bullish investors pointed to a flurry of positive US economic data – new unemployment claims fell to their lowest since April, while retail sales accelerated in October – but bears remained transfixed by sovereign bond yields in Europe, which spiked during the week.A warning from Fitch Ratings an hour before markets closed on Wednesday on US banks’ exposures to eurozone sovereign debt settled the tussle decisively in favour of the bears. The S&P 500 tumbled 2 per cent in an hour, turning a modest gain into a heavy loss.”Europe has been driving the market for a long time, and it will be driving the market for a long time to come,” said Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.The financial sector of the S&P 500 ended the week off 5.6 per cent, yet again falling more than any other sector.The investment bank Jefferies plumbed new year lows of $9.50 on Thursday, as yields on its benchmark 2018 bond soared above ten per cent, amid fears of interbank lending strain. The bank has been trying to reassure investors that its eurozone exposures are manageable. Shares recovered somewhat but were still ended the week down 9.6 per cent to $10.16.Other investment banks, which investors target when the eurozone is in the news, also fell. Morgan Stanley was down 13.1 per cent to $14.21 and Goldman Sachs was off 9.6 per cent to $91.91.The bankruptcy of MF Global continued to cast a shadow over the CME Group, the futures exchange, partially responsible for regulating the broker.The CME fell another 5.6 per cent this week to $248.89, as regulators publicly floated responses to the MF Global collapse.“We still think CME’s futures business remains strong,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS. “But investors have no way of knowing what the regulatory fallout from the MF Global bankruptcy will be, so it’s no surprise the shares are soft.”The S&P 500 was closed the week down 3.8 per cent, trading at 1,215.66, its worst week since an awful September.The Dow Jones was off 2.9 per cent to 11,796.23, given ballast by Boeing, which ended the week up 0.8 per cent to 67.46, after securing its largest ever civilian aircraft deal from Emirates.The Nasdaq Composite index was down 4 per cent to 2,572.5.Despite the positive October sales data, several high profile retailers sold off after posting disappointing quarterly results.Abercrombie & Fitch fell 16.7 per cent to $47.30, as a high profile bet on European growth failed to pay off. Quarterly earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than expected, as sales at flagship European stores disappointed.Walmart, whose exposure to value seekers normally helps it outperform in a falling market, fell 3.3 per cent to $57.23. The discount retailer reported sales growth at its US operation for the first time in two years, but analysts were alarmed by the large spending on discounts and special offers required to drive those sales.Sears slumped 13.5 per cent to $64.27, as its quarterly losses widened by almost 50 per cent compared to the same period in 2010. The loss of $2.57 a share followed a poor performance at the department store chain’s Canadian subsidiary.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit on news that the flow in a key oil pipeline will be reversed, alleviating the glut of West Texas Intermediate crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma.Refiners with access to the WTI crude have benefited from cheap oil, but the discount of WTI compared to Brent crude narrowed sharply on the news.HollyFrontier, which is almost completely dependent on WTI crude, fell 14.4 per cent to $24.38. Other refiners were affected. Shares in Tesoro fell 16 per cent to $23.69.

128;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-11-17T22:10:30Z;Gap unable to reverse slumping sales;;Gap, the US clothes retailer, failed to deliver signs that a long-awaited turnround is under way as it reported a sharp fall in profits and lower sales that its chief executive called “unacceptable”.The group’s net income tumbled 36 per cent from $303m to $193m in the three months to October 29, reflecting the cost of investments in reviving the business, while sales slipped 2 per cent to $3.6bn.Gap has spent several years struggling to reverse slumping sales after it opened too many stores in the US and lost its verve in fashion and branding while having to grapple with rising sourcing costs.Sales at stores open at least a year – a key measure of retail performance – were down 5 per cent from a year ago, a figure that included declines in all four divisions: its international business as well as Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy in North America.“That is unacceptable,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive since 2007, who added: “The company has not executed this year in the way it should and the way I expected.”Shares in Gap closed down 1.2 per cent at $19.25, having declined steadily during the day ahead of its results, which were released 25 minutes before the market close.Gap’s earnings per share of 38 cents, versus 48 cents last year, were 2 cents ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company did not alter its full-year earnings guidance.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, a research group, noted that earnings per share had been boosted by the effect of share buy-backs, on which the company spent $645m in the quarter. On Thursday Gap announced a new $500m repurchase programme.Noting that the value of inventory per store was up 6 per cent from a year ago, and forecast to be up “mid-to-high single digits” in the fourth quarter, Mr Perkins said: “They’re probably a little slow on the [product] sell through, so there is a good chance of additional mark downs that could cut into margins.”As it seeks to rebalance its business, Gap said last month that it would close 21 per cent of its Gap-branded US stores in the next two years and triple its outlets in China by the end of 2012.So far this year, the company said its capital expenditure had been $416m, which was focused on downsizing Old Navy stores and expanding its international and online businesses. Online sales provided a rare bright spot in its results, rising 21 per cent.
129;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US retail sales fall short of expectations;;US retail sales rose in October but growth decelerated and fell below market expectations as retailers head into a holiday shopping season of fragile sentiment and fierce competition.In spite of a weak economy, sales increased 3.8 per cent from a year ago to rack up a 26th successive monthly rise, according to Retail Metrics. But they fell below analyst forecasts of 4.4 per cent growth and below the 5 per cent-plus increases of the previous three months.Although spending has not collapsed, the US is entering the biggest shopping period of the year with consumer confidence plumbing depths last visited in the 2008-09 recession.Fifty four per cent of the retailers that report monthly sales fell short of expectations, among them both those that reported overall increases and declines.At Gap, the struggling fashion retailer, sales at North American stores open at least a year fell 6 per cent from a year ago while its group-wide sales were $1.14bn.JC Penney, the mid-market department store, also missed expectations with like-for-like sales that dropped 2.6 per cent.High-end department stores failed to live up to market hopes as well, as Saks reported a 1.8 per cent increase in sales and Nordstrom a 5.4 per cent gain.Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in Accenture’s retail practice, said: “When you consider all the other things battering consumers … the fact [they] are still spending at a healthy clip is encouraging.”He added: “Is it possible we’ll look back at October and say we saw a bit of pull back? Absolutely. But it’s also possible we’re seeing some variability in a month that is not typically the strongest.”Competition between retailers in the run-up to Christmas is likely to be especially tough as cash-strapped consumers confront high unemployment and a weak housing market.Macy’s, Target and Kohl’s this week said that for the first time they would open at midnight on the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, when retailers traditionally kick off the holiday shopping season with big discounts.Holiday shoppers plan to spend less on gifts and seasonal merchandise this year than last: $704.18 versus $718.98, according to a National Retail Federation survey.But analysts say consumers typically spend more than they intended and the NRF is forecasting that retail sales in November and December will grow 2.8 per cent to $456bn.Steve Riordan, global managing partner of advisory services at PRGX Global, said: “There won’t be a holiday bump unless [consumers are] digging into savings or running up the credit card.”He added that consumer sentiment had become as volatile as financial markets: “We’re super excited one day and ready to jump off the cliff the next … It’s hard to make a decision as a consumer.”
130;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-10-24T10:06:35Z;China: making Gap sexier;;"Maybe the Chinese can do for Gap what generations of American shoppers have failed to do: make its clothes sexier. The US retailer only opened its first store in China last November but Redmond Yeung, president of Gap Greater China, says mainland consumers are already having an impact on its famously preppy clothing.“A lot of good ideas are coming out of this market,” he told journalists at a briefing on Monday at 800 Show, the Shanghai government-backed design space where Gap has its China headquarters. Name one? Gap’s US women’s wear line for summer 2012 will be “more sexy in the cut” due to the influence of China, he said.Gap has opened eight stores on the mainland in under a year and expects to open two new stores a month over the next year and a half in China and Hong Kong, he said. The company’s Chinese stores have only about 30 to 40 per cent product overlap with US stores, he says. “There are a lot more high fashion products here than in the US because young people here spend 30 to 40 per cent of their income on apparel” compared to 8 per cent in the US, Yeung said. “Here you go out more often, you don’t entertain at home, so you need more clothes.”The local Gap design team helps the company localise the 60 to 70 per cent of its products in China which are not the same as its overseas offering. But their influence does not stop there. The Shanghai team feeds ideas to the global design team – and sometimes they end up in the clothing the rest of the world wears, he says. At the moment, less than 1 per cent of Gap’s business comes from China but Yeung predicts China will be Gap’s second largest market in a few years’ time – by which time the retailer plans to bring its other brands like Old Navy and Banana Republic to China, too.Old Navy, Gap’s bargain-basement cousin, could prove a harder sell in China, where US retailers have found it hard to capture market share with low prices. But Leung is not worried: “An Old Navy customer can also be a Louis Vuitton customer”, he says. And there are certainly no shortage of those in China.Related reading:

131;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-10-16T17:02:47Z;Gap: closing the growth divide;At some point it is impossible to increase profitability without sales support;"US clothes retailer Gap is aptly named. There has been a wide chasm between the company’s sales growth (terrible) and the rest of its financial performance (impressive).Top-line growth was negative every year between 2005 and 2009; 2010 managed only modest growth despite following a recession year. Same-store sales growth at all the company’s four segments – higher-end Banana Republic, the eponymous mid-priced brand, low-end Old Navy, and the international division – have been almost continuously negative since 2005, edging into positive territory in 2010.But the company has controlled costs and margins have expanded steadily. Net income grew at an annual average of 12 per cent, and earnings per share (driven by buy-backs) at nearly 20 per cent, between 2006 and 2010. Return on assets has moved steadily north. Cash flows have been prodigious.At some point it becomes impossible to keep increasing profitability without support from sales. Alas, that moment seems to have arrived. In the first half of 2011, under pressure from increased cotton prices and a return to negative sales trends, margins have dropped sharply. The company is responding to this with plans to shut 140 underperforming North American Gap stores (20 per cent of the total, excluding outlet stores) and invest in online operations and high-growth international markets, particularly China. This should boost growth, which is after all what retail investors want: for all its efficiency and profitability, Gap’s share price is about a 10th lower than it was five years ago, mirroring the performance of the wider market. Yet in retail it is only partly about where the stores are and how many there are. They must sell things consumers want, too. Gap’s sluggish sales reflect shortcomings on this front as well. The company has proved it can handle finance. Fashion is trickier.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
132;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-10-13T23:09:04Z;Gap to close 21% of its US stores;The company eyes China expansion;Gap, the US clothing retailer, has said it will close 21 per cent of its US stores in the next two years and triple its outlets in China by the end of next year, as it looks to expand its international business to offset weakness at home.Gap signalled in 2008 that it would begin to scale back its speciality namesake stores amid slumping sales. The company operates 889 such stores in the US and will cut that total to 700 by 2013.“I’ll be the first to say that our stores have not been executing with the consistency that they need to execute at in order to deliver the kind of brand experience that we are committed to delivering,” Arthur Peck, president of Gap’s North America business, said at the company’s investor conference on Thursday.Last August, Glenn Murphy, Gap’s chief executive, said that the group had lost touch with the “evolution of the women’s aesthetic” and had become too modern for its customers.Gap has overhauled its design team, shortened its “product pipelines” to become more nimble and is focusing more on outlet stores in the US. It plans to open 50 outlet stores, which sell clothing at discount prices, within the next two years.Mr Peck said that some of the company’s stores have become “tired and worn out” and that the closings are part of a “natural pruning” process. He said that by closing speciality stores and opening more outlets, it will be able to ensure that it has the right stores in the right markets.In spite of such efforts, analysts have suggested that Gap’s US sales slump is unlikely to abate until next year, when the company is expected to unveil updated clothing designs.“We believe Gap stores lack fashion direction,” said Jennifer Davis, retail analyst at Lazard Capital Markets. “With no meaningful change in product until spring, we expect sales to remain weak throughout the second half of the year.”Gap’s US challenges come as it faces greater competition from companies such as Uniqlo, which is drawing attention for its “cheap chic” apparel. Unlike Gap, the Japanese retailer is investing heavily in a US expansion plan, which was punctuated by this week’s opening of its new flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue.Meanwhile, Gap is looking for growth overseas and said it planned to increase its number of stores in China from 15 to 45 in the next year.“China remains a really significant opportunity,” said Stephen Sunnuck, president of Gap’s international division. “It is the second largest apparel market in the world.”By deepening its presence in Asia, Gap is also stepping up competition with rival Uniqlo. Within the next 18 months Gap will unveil the first Old Navy store, its own “value brand”, in Japan.
133;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-10-12T16:41:20Z;Fast Retailing sets sights on US expansion;;Fast Retailing is poised to expand aggressively in the US, where it is opening its largest Uniqlo store on Friday, as part of its plan to globalise operations rapidly and reduce dependence on its home market.“We are planning to open a huge number of stores in the US,” said Tadashi Yanai, Fast Retailing’s chief executive, ahead of the opening of the Fifth Avenue flagship, which will be the largest single retailer on New York’s famous shopping street.Uniqlo stores are being planned for New York suburbs as well as other big cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.“We feel that we will do well there,” Mr Yanai said at a press conference, held in the glitzy Shangri-La Hotel Ballroom in Tokyo.Fast Retailing, which made its name selling high quality, affordable, casual clothes, is accelerating its overseas build-up, with plans to open 200 to 300 stores globally each year for the next several years.Mr Yanai forecast that in four years, by fiscal 2015, which ends in August 2015, Fast Retailing will have more stores overseas than in Japan.When Fast Retailing opens its Uniqlo store on Fifth Avenue on Friday, the occasion will be a chance to reassess Manhattan’s central stretch of shopping real estate and one of Japan’s largest retailers, writes Alan Rappeport in New York.In a building that once housed a Brooks Brothers, often perceived as embodying a classic American style, Uniqlo is opening an 89,000 square foot store offering modern, affordable clothing. The building, for which the company is investing $300m for a 15-year lease, is simply designed but punctuated with energetic touches such as a neon-lit staircase, rainbows of cashmere sweaters and a bridge connecting different clothing departments.“It’s a statement of our ambition in the US and around the world,” said Yasunobu Kyogoku, chief operating officer of Uniqlo USA. “It is a statement of our intention to revolutionise the way people think about basic casual wear.”Although the company is paying a lot for such prime real estate, much of the merchandise is deeply discounted. Uniqlo offers jeans for under $10 a pair, undercutting even the Walmart discount chain’s lowest prices. Its cashmere sweaters cost less than $50.In spite of this, Mr Kyogoku said the store and the clothing were intended to be refined and, as he put it, “Zen-like”. The marketing aim is to offer customers the wardrobe staples they used to seek out at American chains such as Gap. The company looks to source its materials directly from manufacturers but, while most of the clothing is made in China, Mr Kyogoku said the company also used Japanese innovations.Uniqlo is also putting some emphasis on training, to try to translate Japanese traditions of customer service and efficiency to the US. Mr Kyogoku said that most of the staff had undergone training in Japan, where they were taught to pay attention to details such as giving customers receipts with two hands, in a traditional Japanese sign of respect.At present it has 843 stores in Japan and 181 overseas.The group is believed to be paying one of the highest rents on Fifth Avenue, which is its second store in New York after the SoHo store it opened in 2006.Amid considerable uncertainty facing the outlook for the US economy, the group next week opens its second-largest store, on New York’s 34th Street.Fast Retailing forecasts a surge in sales as a result of the two store openings in New York and expects to be able to generate profits from its US operations this year, despite the opening costs.The group’s bullish outlook for its overseas operations comes as Fast Retailing forecast a nearly 18 per cent rise in sales to Y965bn and a 31 per cent increase in net profits to Y71bn in the year to August 2012.Much of the boost this year is expected to come from a 90 per cent rise in overseas operating profits to Y17bn, with overseas sales growing 71 per cent to Y160bn.However, in the year just ended, Fast Retailing suffered from a downturn in the domestic market, resulting in the first sales and profits decline in its domestic business in eight years.Group sales were flat at Y820bn and net profits slumped 12 per cent to 54.3bn, reflecting weakness in Japan.By contrast, it enjoyed double digit sales growth in markets including China, Hong Kong, Korea, France and the US, last year.However, operations in Russia and the UK, where competition was fierce, were lossmaking.In a bid to update its image and boost domestic sales, Fast Retailing is revamping its store policy and opening large flagship stores in key Tokyo shopping districts, such as Ginza and Shinjuku.But Mr Yanai said: “The focus of Uniqlo’s growth will be overseas. There are many [risks] but our business is more highly appreciated overseas than in Japan, so I feel that the chances are greater than the risks.”“Asia is really important. We have to do it now or else others will take over these markets,” said Nobuo Domae, Fast Retailing executive vice-president.
134;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-10-06T15:37:33Z;Back-to-school shopping lifts US retailers;;Back-to-school shopping and heavy discounting fuelled sales at US retailers in September, beating Wall Street’s expectations as consumers searched for deals in a turbulent economic environment.Sales rose 5.8 per cent at stores open at least a year, ahead of an estimated 4.9 per cent gain, according to Retail Metrics, the research firm.“The general disconnect between US retailers…and broader weakness in the global economy continued in September,” said Ken Perkins, Retail Metrics president. He noted that the labour market “continues to struggle to gain job-building momentum”, citing Thursday’s report that weekly jobless claims rose back above 400,000. The government is due to report on September job creation and unemployment on Friday.As the stock market has taken a wild ride, driven by concerns over the eurozone debt crisis and fears that US growth may remain in low gear, consumers have been more pessimistic about economic conditions.Despite those worries, shoppers flocked to discounters like Target and Costco, and department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s to stock up for the new school year.Target sales rose 5.3 per cent from a year ago, the company’s biggest single monthly increase outside of the Easter holiday since before the recession, Mr Perkins noted. That beat an expected 3.9 per cent rise. Costco, the membership-based discounter, posted a 12 per cent gain compared with a forecast 9.9 per cent rise.Kohl’s recorded a 4.1 per cent gain, compared with a forecast of 2 per cent, helped by aggressive promotions. Sales at Macy’s were up 4.9 per cent, compared with an expected 4.4 per cent, a performance that chief executive Terry Lundgren said “underscores that our business remains on track, despite the persistently negative macroeconomic news”.With Americans watching their wallets more closely, retailers “who have figured out how to do business with the consumer in these economic times” are succeeding, said Mike Brown, a vice-president at AT Kearney, the consultancy. “We are looking at strong performance from retailers who are offering the consumer great value.”He pointed to luxury retailer Saks, which posted a 9.3 per cent sales rise compared with an expected 6.2 per cent gain, saying that stores which sell high-end products that people feel they “have to have” continue to do well despite the rocky economy.Other department stores were not so successful, however. Bon Ton Stores sales fell 3.6 per cent while JC Penney was down 0.6 per cent, both missing expectations. Following the disappointing sales data, JC Penney cut its forecast for third-quarter earnings to 10 to 15 cents a share from about 25 cents a share, and said it expected sales growth in the July to September quarter to be flat.Clothing retailers reported mixed results. Sales at Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath and Body Works, jumped 11 per cent compared with an expected 3.9 per cent rise. But Gap sales dropped a greater-than-expected 4 per cent.“While there were some bright spots across our brands and business units, we’re clear and focused on the steps necessary to improve our business performance going forward,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive of Limited Brands.Hurricane Irene, which brought record flooding and damage to the east coast at the end of August, was likely to have affected shopping patterns last month, said Michael McNamara, head of MasterCard Advisors Spending Pulse, which tracks US retail sales. He said store closings over the final weekend of August pushed some back-to-school shopping into September and also boosted sales at hardware suppliers as homeowners repaired damaged houses.
135;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-09-16T15:15:19Z;Esprit shares dive after analysts’ downgrade;;Shares in Esprit plunged on Friday after analysts downgraded its stock following a 98 per cent drop in full-year net profit, the biggest ever two-day drop for the Hong Kong-listed retailer.The group on Thursday said it would dispose of its North American operations and close 80 unprofitable stores globally, including its retail businesses in Denmark, Sweden and Spain.Esprit said it would not pay a final dividend after it wrote off the cost of this restructuring in its full-year results, which included a drop in net profit from HK$4.23bn a year earlier to HK$79m ($10.1m) in the year to June.Esprit’s results triggered a 17.8 per cent slide in its share price on Thursday and on Friday those shares lost a further 19 per cent to close at HK$12.22 as investors absorbed the level of the restructuring costs. The shares have lost 67.4 per cent this year.Analysts were surprised by the cost of the disposals and by its announcement that it would invest HK$18bn in the next four years to overhaul the flagging brand.Standing before a backdrop featuring super model Gisele Bündchen, the face of Esprit’s new collection, Ronald Van der Vis, chief executive, on Thursday said Esprit needed to improve designs and cut prices to lift sales.“The brand has gradually lost its soul over the past few years,” the company said.Esprit is planning to overhaul its stores, change its merchandise and expand its footprint – particularly in China. Between now and 2015, it plans to invest HK$18bn and nearly double the number of places shoppers can buy Esprit merchandise on the Chinese mainland to 1,900. It also plans to set up a design hub to better tailor its clothing to the market.However, Uniqlo, Gap, Zara and H&M have been offering more fashionable and cheaper products and have been expanding in mainland China, identified by Mr Van der Vis as Esprit’s new growth engine.The company said its operating profit margins next year would be only 1 to 2 per cent.“The scale of investment that the company feels it needs to turn around the brand does surprise me,” said Anne Critchlow, an analyst at Société Générale. Even as sales have missed expectations and demand in European markets has fallen, its sales showed some resilience, she added.Overall sales in China, Esprit’s second-largest market, grew 4.4 per cent during the year. Sales in Germany, its biggest market, fell 1.1 per cent.“This is not a totally broken brand. There is a loyal customer there, and that is something to build on,” said Ms Critchlow. Turning around a mass market brand as big as Esprit was a risk. “There are sales to be gained but there are also sales to be lost.”
136;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-09-14T15:54:36Z;Esprit looks to China to lift its spirits;;Esprit, the Hong Kong-listed fashion brand that has suffered a distinct absence of joie de vivre in recent years, is turning its focus to China as its traditional markets in western Europe run out of steam.“China is our new growth engine,” Ronald Van der Vis, chief executive, tells investors repeatedly. The Dutchman, who joined the Hong Kong-listed casual wear group in 2009, has overseen Esprit’s purchase of its partner’s stake in their Chinese joint venture, a move which gives the company full control in the market.He is launching an ambitious expansion programme to address Esprit’s absence in China’s fast-growing, smaller cities, and he has raised the possibility of a cheaper, second line designed for China.The group’s long-suffering investors will hope this is going to reverse Esprit’s fortunes. The 43-year-old company has become highly dependent on Europe after it consolidated disparate regional operations and set up its global headquarters in Germany in 2003.Over 80 per cent of its annual revenue comes from the continent. But since the global financial crisis, demand in Europe has dropped by 13 per cent and the continent’s economic outlook remains extremely uncertain. This has dragged down total revenue by 9 per cent since 2008 to HK$33.7bn ($4.31bn) last year, while the group’s net profit had fallen by 34.4 per cent to HK$4.2bn. It is the worst-performing stock in the Hang Seng composite index this year after losing about half its value.The company has not hit bottom yet. Esprit is today (Thursday) expected to announce a sharp fall in profits and flat sales for the year to June 2011, according to a warning issued this month.China’s retail market is still growing at a rate of about 17 per cent this year despite Beijing’s tightening measures, and Esprit thinks that it can double its sales in the country from last year’s HK$793m (2.4 per cent of global revenue) by 2015.It is no stranger to the market. It opened its first store in mainland China 19 years ago and has about 1,000 retail and wholesale outlets in the country. The fact that China still makes up such a small portion of its sales shows how tough a market it can be for mid-range clothing brands, especially now that competition is fiercer than when Esprit first landed in Shanghai in 1992.Japanese brand Uniqlo opened its first Chinese store in 2002 and now has over 50 branches. H&M and Zara – the two European fashion companies – arrived about four years ago and have about 120 stores between them. Gap, the US chain, launched last year with a high-profile campaign shot by Annie Leibovitz.Analysts say that Esprit’s uninspiring performance in mainland China – where same-store sales fell in 2010 and saw a meagre 0.5 per cent growth in the first half of this year – highlight the nature of the Chinese market.In a country where the per capita disposable income in urban areas was under US$3,000 last year, a brand needs to send out a clear message to customers, saying why it deserves to be paid a premium. Esprit has failed to gain traction because it charges relatively high prices for its products – prices that are considered expensive even in affluent Asian markets – even though it is considered distinctly unfashionable, says Gabriel Chan, retail analyst at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.“In a high-inflation environment, regular shoppers are going to increasingly look for value. This will be a problem for Esprit, as well as other mid-range clothing brands trying to sell their products in China,” he says.Chinese consumers are also highly attuned to global trends and companies such as H&M and Zara have won out not just because they are cheaper, but also because they offer more fashionable products.Esprit and other mid-range casual clothing labels – such as Gap and American Eagle Outfitters – face more intense competition from “fast fashion” in China than in the west because the Swedish [H&M] and Spanish [Zara] giants are not considered low-end there.They appeal to the middle-class, aspirational shoppers in China, says Torsten Stocker, partner of management consultancy Monitor Group. This means they attract a wider range of shoppers in China than in more mature markets.There are calls for Esprit to make itself more affordable in China. “It needs to launch a low-cost, second line for China. Gap is selling its products at prices cheaper than Esprit and it appears to be doing quite well,” says Mr Chan.But Esprit’s management needs to keep an eye on its operating profit margin, which narrowed from 20.7 per cent in 2008 to 11.2 per cent last year, as retailers worldwide suffer higher raw material and labour costs. An expensive global rebranding campaign – featuring Giselle, the world’s most expensive supermodel – and a continuing programme to shut down underperforming stores will put additional pressure on its bottom line.

138;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-08-19T19:11:52Z;Quarterlies tell a tale of two consumers;;A raft of quarterly results from US retailers continued to tell a tale of companies whose fortunes are tied to two types of consumers.Stores that cater to higher-end consumers, with money to spare, are holding their own, while those focused on low-income shoppers must work even harder to attract them. Analysts say that shoppers with moderate incomes, although faced with elevated petrol prices and a volatile stock market, can still afford the occasional splurge.This was evidenced by robust results from Limited Brands, operator of the Victoria’s Secret and Bath and Body Works chains, which reported a 29 per cent year-on-year increase in its second-quarter net income and raised its profit outlook.Saks, the luxury department store chain, showed a marked improvement during the quarter. The company took a big step in its turnround by narrowing its loss to $8.37m from $32.2m in the second quarter of last year.In spite of signs of consumer health, Walmart, Sears Holdings and Gap, reported sluggish sales in the US. All three have been forced to retool in the aftermath of the recession but the process of revamping their stores, merchandise and websites has not yet translated into an acceleration of sales.Meanwhile, the economic uncertainty appears to be worsening. Stephen Sandove, chief executive of Saks, warned this week that the rest of the year could be increasingly challenging.“With the recent increased volatility and downturn in the financial markets and the overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, we’re approaching the fall season a bit more cautiously,” Mr Sandove said.
139;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-08-18T22:16:48Z;Gap and Sears struggle to revive images;;Weak quarterly results from Gap and Sears Holdings underlined the challenges facing US retailers that have been struggling to revive their images at a time when consumers are already being cautious.Gap, the largest US apparel company by revenues, said on Thursday that its second-quarter net income fell 19 per cent to $189m, or 35 cents a share. The company has been unable to pass along commodity cost increases to its customers and efforts to update its merchandise have so far failed to increase sales.US same-store sales at Gap’s namesake outlets were down 3 per cent year on year, while sales at its Banana Republic stores slipped 2 per cent and sales at Old Navy were flat. Glenn Murphy, chief executive, acknowledged that the quarter was “difficult” and expressed frustration that his stores have not been drawing enough traffic.Earlier this year, Gap replaced the head of the North America Gap brand and appointed a new creative director, in hopes of finding fashion trends with better appeal to young people and women. Mr Murphy said he still hoped to see noticeable improvement in the results by the holiday shopping season.Meanwhile, Sears Holdings reported a wider quarterly loss on Thursday, as customers flocked to its rivals in search of bigger bargains and better service.The company, which runs Sears and Kmart stores, also announced another round of jobs cuts. It said it would sack 250 workers, two months after it cut 700 jobs.Sears has been hit hard by the weak US economy and analysts have criticised its strategy of shutting stores and discounting heavily. They say the company, which sells everything from clothing to electrical appliances, has struggled to compete with rivals offering lower prices and better service.In the second quarter, the company reported a loss of $146m, or $1.37 a share. That followed a loss of $39m, or 35 cents, in the same period a year ago and sent Sears’ share price down 8.2 per cent to $555.23 on Thursday.“We are not satisfied with our results and are taking actions to turn round our performance in a challenging economic environment,” Lou D’Ambrosio, chief executive of Sears Holdings, said in a statement.Weakness at Sears Holdings has persisted since 2005, when billionaire Edward Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in a $11.9bn deal.The company’s sales have fallen each year since as competitors such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot have invested in their stores and grabbed market share. Sales slid again in the second quarter, declining by 1.2 per cent to $10.3bn.“They have underinvested in stores, they have cut service levels and consumers are saying that the asking price for their products is not worth it for the level of service they get,” said Gary Balter, retail analyst at Credit Suisse.Sears Holdings took a $48m charge from the closing of 29 stores this year. Mr D’Ambrosio said that shrinking profit margins were due to markdowns and promotions that were needed to clear inventory.Rather than invest in its stores, Sears Holdings has been focused on improving its online presence and creating brands, such as the Kardashian Kollection.Mr Balter said sales driven through clearances were “not the solution to Sears problems”, and that its poor customer service was depleting the value of its strong brands, such as Kenmore and Craftsman.In a letter to investors in February, Mr Lampert argued that upgrading stores was just one part of becoming a “go-to” retailer, and that “emerging” areas such as online and rewards programmes were more important.“Our decisions to allocate capital in these areas are based on the expected future performance of the investments without worrying about the quarter-to-quarter reporting consequences,” he said.
140;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-08-04T20:58:57Z;Wall Street tumbles on economic concerns;;US stocks tumbled to their worst one-day losses for more than two years with industrial and energy stocks leading the declines as a surge in the dollar raised fears that exporters would be hit by higher costs.All three major US indices entered correction territory, meaning they were more than 10 per cent lower that their 2011 highs. The benchmark S&P 500 retreated 4.7 per cent on Thursday to 1,200.24 at the closing bell. It was the worst session since February 2009.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in more than two years, falling more than 500 points or 4.3 per cent to 11,383.83, while the Nasdaq Composite was off 5.1 per cent to 2,556.39, its worst session since January 2009.The CBOE Volatility index or Vix, popularly known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge“, jumped to its highest level since March, up 29.64 per cent on the session to more than 30.The S&P energy sector fell 6.8 per cent, materials lost 6.7 per cent and industrials were down 5.4 per cent, all hit by the rising dollar and weakening market sentiment.Alcoa was the Dow’s biggest faller at the close, retreating 9.2 per cent to $12.94, while Caterpillar was 7 per cent lower at $89.55.In the energy sector, which reached its lowest level since March, the US oil majors were hit hard.ExxonMobil fell 5 per cent to $73.84, ConocoPhillips was down 5.2 per cent to $66.92 and Chevron lost 5.8 per cent to $96.84.Alpha Natural Resources reported a $56.4m second-quarter loss, much of which was due to takeover-related costs after acquiring Massey Energy for $7.1bn in June. Its shares dropped 17 per cent to $33.24.In addition to concerns about global economic growth and currency stability, weekly US initial jobless claims weighed on sentiment, with the 400,000 figure less than the 405,000 that was forecast.Wall Street was also anticipating Friday’s nonfarm payroll report for July, one of the most important economic indicators, which has disappointed in the last two months“Having been burned badly the last two months, it appears that this time a lot of traders have been exiting positions and going to the sidelines ahead of the US non-farm payrolls report,” analysts at CMC Markets said. “This suggests that unlike the last two months where pre-announcement euphoria ended up being crushed, the resignation and despondency seen today could set the table for a positive surprise.”Kraft was one of the few bright spots, leading the Dow after news that the US food company would split into two divisions.As well as reporting forecast-beating results, the maker of macaroni and cheese, Oreos and Kool Aid said it would spin-off its grocery business from the faster-growing snack business. Its shares were 1.5 per cent lower at $33.78.Among retailers, individual July same-store sales figures were mixed but sent the S&P retail sector 4.9 per cent lower.As a whole, the Retail Metrics July same-store sales index rose 5 per cent, with 58 per cent of retailers beating forecasts. “Retailers catering to higher-end consumers outperformed once again in July,” the report said.But mid-level department store group Kohl’s, which was expected to miss sales expectations, fell 7.9 per cent to $47.67.Shares in Gap, the clothing store, fell 11.6 per cent to $16.98, one of the worst-hit retailers of the session. Shares in the troubled retailer have fallen nearly 30 per cent from its 2011 high.Costco, the discount retailer, reported a 15 per cent bump in sales against a similar period last year, registering net sales of $6.4bn. Gasoline inflation and foreign exchange rates both worked in the chain’s favour, Citigroup analysts noted. Its shares were off just 0.7 per cent to $76.51.Limited Brands also reported strong sales and boosted its outlook for the second quarter, which left its stock 1.27 per cent lower at $35.84. The company, whose brands include Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said same-store sales rose 6 per cent over 2010, beating analysts’ expectations.Elsewhere among the earnings reports, General Motors said its quarterly profit nearly doubled to $2.5bn on strong North American and Asian sales. Earnings per share in the carmaker were $1.54, beating analysts’ expectations.“We believe this quarter should begin to revive momentum around the GM story,” Citigroup analysts said. “Recent market share gains, resilient pricing and now a high-quality quarter are all occurring ahead of GM’s major North America product cycle.”But the strong earnings did little to boost GM shares, which fell 4.3 per cent to $25.99. Its domestic competitor, Ford, was down 6.8 per cent to $10.86.DirecTV, the US satellite broadcaster, reported that net income rose to $701m, or 91 cents a share, but its market share shrunk, adding just 26,000 US subscribers. Its shares dropped 5.7 per cent to $46.63.A key concern is that DirecTV’s model is “structurally flawed vs the cable operators”, analysts at Collins Stewart noted. They were optimistic about the outlook because “DirecTV has been able to withstand the crippling US recession and housing crises because of its premium brand and superior service.”
141;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-08-04T14:47:53Z;Heatwave boosts July US retail sales;;US retail sales rose 5 per cent in July from a year ago thanks to deep discounting and hot weather, but growth decelerated from the previous month against the backdrop of a weak economy.Sales at stores open at least a year rose ahead of expectations for the seventh consecutive month, according to Retail Metrics, which tracks 25 retailers that are estimated to account for between 20 and 30 per cent of total retail spending.The year-on-year growth was down from 7.2 per cent in June. July is typically a transitional month in which retailers offer big discounts to clear out summer merchandise and make room for back-to-school and autumn goods.“Heatwaves and high temperatures drove many shoppers to air-conditioned malls, which gave a nice boost,” said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics.Some analysts cautioned that the sales jump gave a misleadingly positive impression because it was explained partly by higher ticket prices linked to commodity inflation and did not necessarily signal consumers were buying more units than last year.Underlining the strength of the wealthiest Americans, the best performing retailer was Saks, the high-end department store, which reported a 15.6 per cent rise in sales.Gap, the mid-market retailer struggling with its fashion and branding, posted a 5 per cent fall in sales following a gain of 1 per cent in June.The biggest negative surprise came from Kohl’s, a mid-price department store, where sales dropped 4.6 per cent.
142;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Gap hopes freezer tip will crystallise sales;;Gap is publicising an employee’s tip to clean jeans by putting them in the freezer as part of an effort to revitalise its struggling sales through videos targeting smartphone-carrying shoppers.The retailer has struggled with branding, fashion and sourcing in recent years, and a new team of creative executives hired earlier this year wants to connect Gap’s clothes to its heritage and Los Angeles design studio, where the freezing tip emerged.The tip, from a veteran denim washer called Rob Crews, appears in one of several videos that Gap will promote through web links in its stores to try to engage with shoppers who are increasingly using smartphones while they shop in malls to compare products and prices.Smartphones’ challenge to retailers is as big as the emergence of e-commerce in the 1990s because they make it easier for consumers to use bricks-and-mortar stores as showrooms, then buy their products from online retailers instead.Seth Farbman, Gap’s chief marketing officer, said: “I think a lot of other retailers are trying to hold on to technology and control it,” citing the example of marketing videos played on large in-store screens as an outdated approach.“You have to recognise that consumers have tremendous control over information and your brand. You can recognise that your customer has choices and appreciate that.”Putting jeans in a freezer overnight should kill any germs they carry, although the freezing cannot eliminate stains, according to Mr Crews, who says it is less likely to damage jeans than regular washing and tumble drying.The jeans should be kept inside an airtight bag so they do not come into contact with water and become iced.Referring to the cost and water requirements of traditional laundry, Mr Farbman joked: “It’s good for the environment, good for your wallet. Not so good for your ice-cream.”Industry consultants say there is a divergence between retailers that are peeved or paralysed by smartphone shoppers and those looking for ways to respond, including by developing brands and store experiences that distinguish them more clearly from rivals.Gap’s sales have fallen every year since 2005, although its profits have been improving. Previous unsuccessful turnround plans included the unveiling of a new logo last October. The move sparked a hail of public criticism and the logo was abandoned a week later.In addition to a perception that its fashion is unexciting, Gap has also had supply chain problems. It dismayed investors in June by disclosing a surge in sourcing costs that exceeded those of other retailers grappling with high commodity prices.The new videos form part of an autumn marketing campaign centred on Gap’s 1969 denim brand and its Los Angeles studio.Mr Farbman said the message is: “We’re not a sterile corporation. There are interesting, inventive people in downtown LA who freeze their jeans.”
143;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-29T19:33:09Z;GPG sales put Coats in an enviable position;Incentive package for thread supplier’s executives;Senior executives at Coats, the world’s leading supplier of threads to the clothing trade, stand to make up to $100m under an incentive scheme when the company re-emerges on the London Stock Exchange after its 2003 delisting.Owner Guinness Peat Group, the corporate raider that took Coats private nearly a decade ago, has agreed to a stepped incentive package which offers its subsidiary’s chief executive Paul Forman and other senior employees up to 15 per cent of any increase in the company’s value above $1.35bn over the next three years.Coats, an original FTSE 30 constituent, was acquired by GPG for £414m ($683m) in 2003 but was only valued internally at about £320m at the end of December 2010. Mr Forman, formerly chief executive of Low & Bonar, the FTSE Small Cap industrial materials maker, took over as Coats chief executive at the end of 2009.Blake Nixon, director of Coats who expects to move from an executive to a non-executive director’s role at GPG in July, said the total amount available would be capped at 9.9 per cent of GPG’s own capitalisation at the time of the scheme’s close on 31 March 2014.This would create a maximum pay-out of about $100m for top executives should Coats perform successfully as the sole operational interest of GPG following its controversial decision to sell off its remaining assets in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.Mr Nixon defended the generous terms of the incentive scheme, describing it as typical of those enjoyed at many private equity firms or at the riskier end of publicly listed companies. He added that if top managers hit the top limit it would represent a “win-win situation” for shareholders.He said the early completion of asset sales by GPG could see the name of the remaining listed entity being changed to that of the rump Coats business.The sell-off strategy was agreed after a number of boardroom splits over the past two years and a shareholder revolt in the wake of a fall in the valuation of its business in 2008 and 2009.GPG continues to trade at a discount of about a third to its own valuation of £993m for its investments, which apart from Coats spans interests in financial services, food processing, building services and food distribution. More than half the portfolio by value is held in companies based in Australia or New Zealand.GPG is committed to returning £75m from asset sales to shareholders this year. Among UK investments being prepared for sale by GPG are stakes in Newbury Racecourse, brewers Young’s and Co, Daniel Thwaites and Shepherd Neame, car delivery company Autologic and Nationwide Accident Repair Services.Under its current owners, Coats – an early investor in China, Vietnam and other Asia-Pacific centres of textile and clothes making – has reduced its exposure to the US and Europe.GPG argues that Coats, which supplies threads to 22 per cent of the global apparel market, can continue to improve sales and profits.Last year turnover rose from $1.41bn to $1.58bn with pre-tax profits jumping from $36m to $107m,Gap, Levi Strauss jeans, Adidas, Marks and Spencer, Nike and Abercrombie & Fitch are among those brands using Coats threads and yarns, which are used in the manufacturing of clothing, sports shoes, furniture and bedding as well as airbags and safety belts in cars, and parachutes used by Nasa space vehicles.
144;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-25T20:52:38Z;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Polo Ralph Lauren led consumer discretionary stocks lower after the retailer reported a sharp drop in quarterly earnings but US indices enjoyed modest gains as firmer commodity prices bolstered the energy and materials sectors.The high-end fashion retailer reported a 36 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit amid higher costs and lower sales in Japan, sending the stock down 11.4 per cent to $114.70.Ralph Lauren is one in a long line of retailers that have been under pressure in recent months thanks to higher commodity costs squeezing margins and elevated gasoline prices discouraging consumers from splashing out.The S&P retail sector is down 2.6 per cent this month after a number of weak earnings reports from companies such as Gap and Aéropostale.The disappointing news from Ralph Lauren weighed on related stocks, with VF Corp, one of the world’s largest clothing companies, falling 2.1 per cent to $95.54 and JC Penney down 0.7 per cent to $35.86.The S&P consumer goods sector lost 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.The main S&P 500 index closed up 0.3 per cent to 1,319.89, led higher by energy and materials stocks as commodity prices rose.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climbed 1 per cent to $84.10 while Halliburton advanced 5 per cent to $49.87.The S&P energy index was up 1.4 per cent, the best performing sector on Wall Street.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 2.4 per cent to $49.98 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 2.8 per cent to $49.52. The S&P materials index gained 1.4 per cent.This helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.3 per cent to 12,394.66 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,761.38.Technical factors also helped the wider markets to post gains, after the previous session saw the S&P 500 hit a one-month low and come near a resistance level of 1,315.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “The S&P 500 continues to trend toward a potential test of the 1,295-1,300 zone with resistance emerging in the 1,315-1,320 area.”Gains on the indices were limited by downbeat economic data, however, with news that US demand for durable goods had sunk more than expected in April.The number of new orders for durable goods fell 3.6 per cent last month, led by a sharp drop in car and aircraft orders.Car orders dropped 4.5 per cent, the sharpest fall since August, as parts shortages following the Japanese earthquake slowed production at US factories.Ford shares fell 0.6 per cent to $14.58 in the session, leading the S&P auto index down 0.5 per cent.Shares in AIG were down 4 per cent to $28.28 after 300m shares in the bailed-out insurer began trading after a secondary offering.The US Treasury sold 200m shares worth $5.8bn while AIG itself sold 100m shares worth $2.9bn.Applied Materials reported forecast-beating second-quarter earnings but rose only 1.1 per cent to $13.86 as the manufacturer of chipmaking equipment forecast an unexpected drop in current-quarter revenue.Applied Materials has fallen 11.7 per cent this month, one of the many technology stocks that have been on a downward trend recently as investors have moved away from riskier assets into more defensive sectors.The S&P technology index has fallen 4.3 per cent this month while Apple has lost 3.8 per cent to $336.78.Citigroup analysts said that, after the recent losses, it was hard to see a lot of downside on Applied Materials shares, although they argued that now was still not quite the right time to buy.Away from the technology sector, shares in Toll Brothers rose 1.8 per cent to $20.63 after the luxury homebuilder reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss as sales and margins improved.Hormel Foods, which makes Spam and MegaMex Foods products, fell 4.8 per cent to $28.59 after the company forecast a fall in margins because of rising input prices.Express dropped 12 per cent to $20.12 after the apparel retailer said that its second-quarter earnings would not exceed 15 cents a share, which was below the 16 cents a share that analysts had been expecting.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, fell 5.4 per cent to 16.86 in the session.
145;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-22T20:50:58Z;Inditex breaks new ground for seasons in the south;;Inditex, owner of the Zara fashion chain, has become the first global retailer to sell fashion lines designed especially for the seasons of the southern hemisphere as it continues its expansion into markets in Latin America, Australia and Africa.This year the group surpassed the 5,000-store mark, after opening 30 Zara stores in Brazil, and launching its first store in Australia in April. It plans to open in South Africa this year.The company, based in Galicia in northern Spain, overtook rivals Gap and Hennes & Mauritz to become the biggest clothes retailer by sales in 2008, and is opening stores at a rate of 10 per week, or about 500 per year.But for clothes retailers based in the northern hemisphere, the seasons of the south have traditionally presented a barrier to full globalisation because of the complexity of producing specially-tailored winter lines at the same time as summer wear.“We need a specific collection [in the southern hemisphere] because of the seasons,” Pablo Isla, Inditex chairman, told the Financial Times.“That is why we need a different collection in order to deal properly with these markets. They don’t want last year’s stock because they follow fashion trends as much as everyone else. If you try to sell them things from the previous season, that never works.”H&M and Gap, Inditex’s principal rivals, do not have fully integrated operations across the southern hemisphere. Gap has two franchise stores in Australia.Inditex is rare among international retailers in that it produces the bulk of its clothes in its home market, having eschewed the cheaper labour of Asian factories favoured by rivals.In the year to January 2011, net profits increased by 32 per cent to €1.7bn ($2.4bn) in a period in which clothes retailers have been hit by rising raw material and labour costs and dwindling consumer spending in western Europe.Société Générale forecasts a 1 percentage point decline in Inditex’s gross margin in the year to January 2012. That compares with a 3.5 percentage point decline at H&M and a 2.3 percentage point decline at Primark, the UK-based discount fashion retailer.Inditex manufactures 49 per cent of its products in Spain, Portugal and Morocco, and 35 per cent in Asia. In comparison, H&M sources and produces 75 per cent of it products from Asia.The Spanish group is expected to open a further 120 stores in China this year, taking in Zara and its other brands, which include Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.Last month Inditex purchased a store on New York’s Fifth Avenue for $324m, in the most expensive US property deal by square foot on record.
146;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-20T21:53:59Z;Euro plunge, dollar surge smacks risk appetite;US retailers pull S&P 500 lower on margin fears;Friday 21.30 GMT. An initially mildly positive start to the global session has been smacked down by a surge in the dollar and worries about US retailers after Wall Street trading kicked in.The FTSE All-World equity index is down 0.6 per cent, industrial commodities have lost some early gains and yields on US Treasuries are softer. The S&P 500 in New York is down 0.8 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 is off 0.2 per cent as cyclicals falter.Asian shares had closed mixed and Europe was higher before worries about eurozone growth and sovereign debt clobbered the euro.The single currency is down 1.1 per cent to $1.4158 after the Bundesbank said in its monthly bulletin that the German economy would lose momentum in coming months and as peripheral spreads widened.Greek government 10-year bond yields have spiked 55 basis points to 16.55 per cent as investors position for the expected restructuring, and after Fitch downgraded Athens’ debt.Perhaps of more concern to the market is a deterioration in Spanish sovereign bonds, where the yield on 10-year paper is up 8 basis points to 5.48 per cent, closing in on the euro-era high of 5.55 per cent hit in AprilEuropean currency havens are fairly rare. Even so, Adrian Schmidt at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets believes there is a trade to be made differentiating two of them: the Swedish krona and the Swiss franc.“The SKr has traded very closely with yield spreads against the euro in recent months,” Mr Schmidt says. “This contrasts with the SFr, which has ignored widening yield spreads with the eurozone and has traded much more in line with the widening dispersion between EU periphery yields and Bund yields. Clearly, this indicates that the SFr is seen as more of a haven than the SKr.”That makes some sense. Growth in Sweden was hit badly in 2008-09 as the global economy faltered, while Switzerland outperformed. If conditions in the eurozone periphery worsen, the Swiss franc will be supported.But “there is effectively no premium applied to the SKr by virtue of its superior fundamentals relative to the eurozone”, Mr Schmidt says. “The fact that SFr/SKr is at the highs of the last year in spite of exceptional Swedish growth performance . . . suggests these are good levels to buy SKr and sell SFr.”Protests in Spain ahead of regional and municipal polls appear to be worrying investors that Madrid’s austerity drive may be compromised, potentially worsening its fiscal position. The extra premium traders demand over German Bunds has risen to a four-month high of 241 basis points.The fall in the single currency is helping push the dollar index up by 0.3 per cent to 75.47 – a trend that remains no friend to risk assets.Commodities had been seeing decent gains for much of the session as traders were adopting a timidly bullish tack, hopeful that such products will be supported by continuing largesse from many of the developed world’s central banks should recent evidence of weakening growth persist.WTI crude is up 1.1 per cent at $99.49 – having earlier been down 1 per cent, in an example of the range-bound trading seen lately – and copper has halved its early advance to trade up 1.3 per cent at $4.12 a pound.Gold is managing to hold on to a pop of 1.2 per cent, the first time it has crossed $1,510 since early last week, as haven flows counteract the buck’s rise. Another popular refuge, Treasuries, are also benefiting from the Friday fear. US 10-year yields are down 3 basis point to 3.14 per cent.The mood in equities has been further soured by a sharp stumble in US retailing stocks after Gap and Aeropostale delivered downbeat forecasts.This has dropped the S&P 500 down to 1,334, meaning it is due to record the third week in a row of declines as investors again fail to push it through fresh cyclical highs above 1,360.Indeed, the S&P has now been stuck within a roughly 30-point closing range for 21 sessions as the softer economic data has been joined by a somewhat wet end to an otherwise decent first-quarter earnings season.Still, bulls will point to the continuing rumblings of M&A and Thursday’s incredible IPO of LinkedIn as evidence that animal spirits roam the markets. Cynics are already arguing that such an IPO pop is a sure sign there is more money than sense swirling around.The social networking group is up another 8 per cent mid-morning in New York.Earlier, in Asia, shares fluctuated as resources stocks fell on lower commodity prices overnight, leaving the FTSE Asia Pacific index flat on the day.The region’s benchmark was held back by a 0.1 per cent dip for Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average as investors fretted about prospects for the country’s power sector in the light of troubles for Tepco, which runs the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.5 per cent, as miners inherited Thursday’s global slide in raw material prices. South Korea’s Kospi Composite was up 0.8 per cent despite foreigners selling for the seventh straight session.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index inched up 0.2 per cent, led by financial shares, but the gain was capped by weakness in resources stocks.On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite index was down fractionally, but Chinese shares fluctuated with rare earth material shares gaining ground after Beijing said it would expand export quotas for the sector.Reporting by Jamie Chisholm in London and Telis Demos in New York
147;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-20T21:19:45Z;A font of wisdom on economies of scale;In spite of its ubiquity, spare Swiss typeface Helvetica is vulnerable to competition;"A confession: I have become something of a fontophile over the past couple of months. And I don’t think it’s just me. This year’s April Fool’s Day witnessed some splendid typographical jokes. Typing “Helvetica” into Google provoked an alarming change: every letter in the search was suddenly transformed, not into the spare and elegant Swiss typeface, but into Comic Sans. (Comic Sans is a determinedly informal font loathed by almost everyone with a knowledge of typography, and unwittingly adopted by most of the rest of the human race.)Helvetica itself was the subject of an eponymous and entertaining documentary in 2007. The message of Helvetica echoes contemporary concerns about globalisation. A single typeface, designed in 1957 in Münchenstein near Basel in Switzerland, graces the American Airlines logo, Coca-Cola adverts, the New York subway, labels in American Apparel stores, Crate and Barrel, Kawasaki, Gap, Panasonic, BMW, Jeep and even Oral B. One designer, infuriated by its ubiquity, declares in the documentary that Helvetica is the font of the Vietnam war. She’s only half joking.Modern life tends towards standardisation. The likes of McDonald’s and Starbucks try to replicate the consumer experience, the branding, the size of the drinks cups. In such cases, economists often look for signs of “economies of scale”, a term used to describe a business operation whose average costs decline as the size of the business expands. Annoyingly, economies of scale are analytically inconvenient – if you want to build a textbook model of an industry with scale economies, the mathematics are messy – and yet Adam Smith’s famous example of the pin factory simply illustrated how fundamental economies of scale are to economic progress.Fonts and typefaces enjoy economies of scale: once designed, they can be used again and again at low cost. Indeed this is more true than in the days when a font was hundreds of pounds of carefully sculpted metal. (Simon Garfield’s likeable book, Just My Type, includes the tale of Doves, the font that drowned. Thomas Cobden-Sanderson, the designer of Doves, did not wish his glorious font to be used by a rival after his death. Over the course of three years the septuagenarian Cobden-Sanderson destroyed the casts for the type, and then every metal letter, by consigning parcels of them into the Thames. Helvetica is immune from this fate. So, alas, is Comic Sans.)Economies of scale underpin real-world monopolies. Could Helvetica achieve this status? Hardly. Just like most dominant companies, Helvetica is vulnerable to competition. Arial, an upstart font with the same proportions as Helvetica, was packaged with Microsoft Windows from 1992 and guaranteed instant prominence. The world’s most popular font these days is probably Calibri; it was pushed centre stage by Microsoft as recently as 2007, the year Helvetica was produced.Contrary to popular belief, Helvetica never even wiped its rivals off the face of the New York subway. An obsessive coffee-table book by Paul Shaw documents that the Helvetica-style font that defined subway signage is in fact Standard Medium. Helvetica didn’t become the official typeface on subway signs until 1989. Standard Medium persists in corners of the subway and most people don’t notice the difference.Economies of scale in fonts, as often in the corporate world, do not seem to stand in the way of diversity for long. There have never been so many alternatives to Helvetica, and new fonts are created at an unprecedented rate. There is always demand for the next forward-looking font. Barack Obama used a 21st century font, Gotham, for his 2008 election campaign. Evidently some people think it helped his fortunes: Gotham has now been adopted by Sarah Palin."

It made a spectacular first day of trading on Thursday, jumping 109.4 per cent from its initial public offering price.The stock largely maintained those gains on Friday, falling only 1.2 per cent to $93.09, still over double the $45 IPO price and nearly triple its valuation at the beginning of the week when bankers set a price tag of $32-$35.In the energy sector, Cheniere Energy soared 32 per cent to $10.14 after announcing it had received approval from the Department of Energy to export US natural gas to more countries overseas.However the past five days on Wall Street have been generally downbeat, with sentiment weighed on by disappointing economic data.Traders were unnerved by worrying reports on the US housing markets as well as data showing a sharp drop in manufacturing activity this month.The influential Philadelphia Fed index of mid-Atlantic manufacturing showed a reading of 3.9, a sharp decrease from the 18.5 reading in April and lower than the 20 points that economists had been expecting.“Some people are arguing that we are seeing the start of a protracted slowdown in global growth as rate hikes in the emerging markets begin to bite, but I think this weakness will only last a few months,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at ING Investment Management.The negative sentiment over the week was limited as weekly employment data came in stronger than expected, but overall the mood was downbeat and investors continued to move their money from the cyclical to defensive stocks.Since the start of the second quarter, defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples and utilities are up 6-9 per cent while energy, financials and materials are all down 3-6 per cent.The worst performing stocks of the week were in the consumer discretionary and the technology sectors.The technology sector was helped lower by Hewlett-Packard, which disappointed investors by lowering its full-year earnings forecasts.The stock was down 11 per cent to $35.98 over the week. The S&P technology index was 1.5 per cent lower.
149;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-20T19:33:47Z;Gap’s cost concerns lead retailers lower;;Shares of US clothes retailers plunged on Friday after Gap and Aéropostale warned that rising prices for cotton and other commodities would eat into their profits this year.Gap’s share price was down 17 per cent in Friday afternoon trading after the apparel retailer said late on Thursday that its product costs would be 20 per cent higher in the second half of the year than in the same period of 2010.With consumer demand remaining tepid, the company said it would be unable to completely compensate for its higher costs by raising prices. It lowered its full-year earnings outlook by 22 per cent to $1.50 a share. Gap’s first-quarter profits were down 23 per cent year-on-year.Glenn Murphy, Gap’s chief executive, called the predicament a “short-term macro challenge” and acknowledged that cost pressures were hurting the business. In a call with analysts, he said that in March, “we were just more dormant than we should have been”.Retailers have been hit hard by rising cotton prices and have announced their intention to raise prices this year. Sales have also been damped by cautious consumers who are feeling pinched by increased costs of petrol and food.Brian Sozzi, retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies, said Gap’s struggles reflect factors that go beyond macroeconomic headwinds.“The product is not resonating,” Mr Sozzi said. “Because the product is not right, you’re going to have to compete on price, and given where the price of cotton has been, that is tough.”Analysts at Nomura noted that the brands at Gap’s namesake stores are struggling to regain relevance, leading to poor top line performance.“It has few levers to pull to offset product cost increases and its brands have little pricing power,” the analysts said.Gap showed its awareness of the lack of lustre surrounding its product line earlier this month when it dismissed Patrick Robinson, the design director for its namesake brand.Meanwhile, Aéropostale, a speciality retailer that targets teenagers, pulled its full-year earnings guidance as its net income fell 64 per cent during the first three months of the year.Thomas Johnson, the company’s chief executive, said he was “disappointed” with Aéropostale’s current performance. Its stock price was down by nearly 15 per cent in Friday afternoon trading.Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, downgraded his rating on Aéropostale stock to hold in response to its results.“It is facing challenges from higher price competitors discounting aggressively and from the fact product cost is going up,” Mr Jaffe said.“As a low-cost producer the pressure is felt more profoundly.”Gap and Aéropostale weighed on the sector, with shares of Wet Seal down nearly 10 per cent and American Eagle Outfitters off by nearly 7 per cent.
150;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-10T19:31:23Z;Weak dollar boosts New York tourism;;Foreign tourists are flocking to New York to take advantage of the weak dollar, helping to revive the city’s economy as Wall Street struggles to rebound from the financial crisis.The result is an uncoupling of the economy from the fortunes of Wall Street. In contrast with previous recoveries, tourism and retail rather than finance are leading the rebound, according to figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.“The city is now very attractive from a tourist’s perspective,” said William Dudley, New York Fed president, at a briefing on the region last week. “The economy is more diversified and less dependent on the financial sector.”A record 48.7m tourists visited New York last year as the city bounced back from a decline in 2009, the first drop in tourism since 2001, according to the city’s tourism organisation. Almost 10m of those visitors came from other countries. Traditionally, the city benefits from European travellers, led by more than 1m from the UK in 2009, the last year for which detailed figures were available.Spending by out-of-towners reached $31bn last year, up nearly 10 per cent from 2009, with international tourists contributing about half the total, according to the city. That has helped lift retailers such as Macy’s and Tiffany, whose flagship Manhattan stores are tourist meccas. At Tiffany, purchases by foreigners rose to 17 per cent of national sales in the first quarter.Tourists snapped up a broad range of items, said Faith Consolo, chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman’s retail leasing division. “They might buy a diamond watch at Cartier but then they’ll buy a T-shirt at Gap and then they’ll buy Guess jeans,” she said.German tourist Stefanie Leimpek, waiting in line outside the Abercrombie & Fitch store on Fifth Avenue with her husband, said: “We need a third suitcase.”The couple said they vacationed in Spain last year but were drawn to New York to shop for clothes and the Masters of the Universe figurines her husband, Manuel, collects.Foreigners also swarmed to the Apple store on Fifth Avenue, which is the company’s top store with nearly $600m in sales every year, Ms Consolo said, and to other stores offering electronics not available outside the US. “Gadgets are very much in vogue.”The New York Fed data showed the city’s tourism-driven sectors fared better than the national average in the years of the recession as well as the recovery.Retailers cut 7.7 per cent of their workforce across the US from December 2007 to February 2010, but shed just 0.1 per cent in New York. The city’s leisure and hospitality sector grew 3.5 per cent during the downturn, compared with a 4.5 per cent national fall. Since then, the two sectors have added almost 20,000 jobs, compared with 10,300 new jobs in finance.Hotels across the city reported strong demand for rooms and a recovery in prices since early last year, although most said room rates were still below the peak levels of 2007. This resilience has supported a pick-up in hiring at many companies.The Crosby Street Hotel, a boutique in Soho, has seen a “surge of business from other parts of the world where the economy is strong and the currency is strong”, said Craig Markham, marketing director of owner Firmdale Hotels.Mr Dudley said overall, the New York recession was “less severe” than the national downturn. When job losses bottomed out nationally in February last year, seven months after the end of the recession, the city had shed 3.8 per cent of its jobs – nearly half the 6.5 per cent cuts seen nationally, and a lower rate than the city’s losses in the previous two downturns. As in the rest of the US, manufacturing and construction lost the highest percentage of jobs in the city.In a reversal of the trend of the last three recessions since the 1970s, job losses on Wall Street bottomed out in January 2010, four months after the labour market turned the corner in other sectors.
151;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-05T22:12:23Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;US equities continued to retreat from the multiyear highs reached last week, led lower by energy and material stocks as risk appetite was sapped by disappointing economic data and a mixed set of earnings reports.The big corporate news of the session was from General Motors, the largest of the Detroit carmakers, which reported a tripling in first-quarter earnings to $3.2bn.But this hefty growth in profits failed to impress investors as much of the improvement was due to one-time gains from the sale of stakes in former affiliates. The stock was down 3.1 per cent to $32.02 and the larger S&P auto index fell 0.4 per cent.In the wider markets, sentiment was weaker after weekly employment data showed that the number of jobless claims had unexpectedly surged to the highest level in eight months, raising concerns about the strength of the US labour market.This disappointing data followed weaker-than-expected ADP jobs data on Wednesday and bodes badly for the all-important official non-farm payroll data set to be released on Friday.These concerns left the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,335.03, the fourth consecutive losing session on the index.The losses over the past week have been led by energy and material stocks as commodity prices have softened. This theme continued on Thursday as commodity prices plummeted.In the energy sector, Murphy Oil was down 6.4 per cent to $68.57 while ExxonMobil lost 2.6 per cent to $82.62. The S&P energy index fell 2.3 per cent, adding to the 5.1 per cent drop already this week.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, lost 2.5 per cent to $49.85 while Peabody Energy was down 3.6 per cent to $61.27. The S&P materials index was 1.3 per cent lower.Transport stocks were given a boost by the tumbling oil price, however, and the Dow transport index was up 1.1 per cent.But the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent to 12,583.11 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,814.72.The recent downturn follows a raft of technical highs achieved by large benchmark indices last week. In the final few days of April, the S&P rose to a 35-month high, the Nasdaq reached a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.“It is not clear yet if this is just a traditional correction following some technical highs, or it is the beginning of something more significant,” said Jonathan Lewis, chairman of the investment committee at Samson Capital Advisors.“Some unsettling questions have been raised of late by weak data on housing, manufacturing and gross domestic product growth,” he added.Late last month, government figures showed that US GDP growth slowed to 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 as rising oil prices weighed on consumer demand and government spending fell.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in JDS Uniphase bounced 6.9 per cent higher to $21.38 after the maker of optical communications reported a swing into a third-quarter profit, beating expectations with both its earnings and revenues.This helped the wider technology sector record some of the smallest losses on Wall Street. Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone maker, was up 3.8 per cent to $24.98 while Juniper Networks added 0.7 per cent to $37.54. The S&P technology index was down only 0.5 per cent.In other positive news, Whole Foods Market, the natural and organic grocer, reported a 33 per cent rise in second-quarter profit and lifted its full-year earnings forecast. Shares in the company were up 0.4 per cent to $59.95.Since the earnings season began, however, the number of companies that have beaten expectations with their results has been in decline.Two weeks after the start of the season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent with slightly more than 100 companies left to report.Elsewhere, Kindle International soared 57.7 per cent to $14.98 after privately held INC Research agreed to buy the clinical research company late on Wednesday for $232m.Shares in CVS Caremark added 1.9 per cent to $36.79 after the drugstore and pharmacy company reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, although profits were down and margins were slimmer.
152;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-05-05T18:57:29Z;Easter spending boosts US retail sales;;"US retail sales grew strongly in April as discount promotions and the Easter holiday persuaded consumers to spend more than expected, in spite of rising inflation and a weak labour market.Sales were up 8.7 per cent from a year ago at stores open at least 12 months, equalling the largest monthly gain in the past 11 years, according to Retail Metrics.But against a backdrop of continued economic uncertainty, analysts warned that life for shoppers and retailers would get tougher as the year went on and the pain of adjusting to inflation grew.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said that after June “all bets are off”.Gap, the clothing retailer, said its April sales were 8 per cent higher than a year ago, bouncing back from a 10 per cent decline last month.The best performer was Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, whose sales grew 20 per cent.But department stores other than Macy’s failed to meet expectations.David Bassuk, head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consultancy, said many of the better performing retailers had offered aggressive low-price promotions, but at
the cost of narrower profit margins.“We continue to see consumers responding to value and promotions. They want the deal,” he said.“Consumers are not showing any signs of being willing to accept price increases.”Gap, which has offered particularly big discounts, was forced to lower its earnings forecast for the first quarter. It also said its design chief, Patrick Robinson, was leaving the company, as it struggles to revitalise its product range.Among permanent discount retailers, sales at Target stores rose 13 per cent while Costco said its comparable store sales – excluding petrol – rose 6 per cent.Some retailers were boosted by the late timing of Easter, because the traditional pre-holiday shopping surge that took place last year in late March instead came in April this year.Both retailers and consumer goods companies are facing a difficult combination of rising input inflation and consumers who they know may stop buying if prices increase.Sara Lee, the US food company, said on Thursday that its price increases – including a 6 per cent rise in its retail division from a year ago – would hit sales volumes this year. It lowered its earnings outlook.Estée Lauder, the upmarket beauty brand, said that rising fuel prices were not yet affecting its high-end consumers, but acknowledged that more dramatic rises in petrol prices would damp consumer sentiment and eventually be a drag on business.Mr Bassuk said: “Unemployment is rising; consumer confidence is at low levels; gas prices have hit $5 [a gallon] in some cities; food prices are up. Summer is going to be very difficult for retailers focused on the discretionary spend.”"

He will join a growing band of fashion retailers using the internet to lead expansion outside their home markets.“We just have huge demand overseas,” Mr Drexler told Bloomberg TV. “We’re walking, we’re studying right now. But we launch in the UK …in August or September. That’s kind of our official online international.”J Crew agreed to be acquired by TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in a $3bn deal last November.The group will enter an increasingly competitive market for high-end online fashion in the UK, where Ralph Lauren and Boden are among the retailers that already have a presence selling their own label clothes.Some J Crew clothes are available in the UK via the national site of Net-a-Porter, which sells a variety of women’s brands.Mr Drexler said the group’s online business in the US was its most profitable and added that once the group had expanded it into the UK, “then we’ll figure out where we put stores”. The group is already planning to open an outlet in Canada in August.Stressing that J Crew was not losing interest in the US, he said: “It’s not because America’s over-stored for us. We still think we have [a] good opportunity here. But …we’ve got to make sure you’re on the game, and continuing to move forward or else someone’s going to take your business.”Mr Drexler led Gap’s rise to dominate the retail landscape in the 1990s. After leaving Gap suddenly in 2002, he was recruited to lead a restructuring at J Crew, which began as a catalogue business in the 1970s.The deal to take J Crew private returned it to the control of TPG, which controlled the retailer as a private company between 1997 and its initial public offering in 2006.Mr Drexler said he had no regrets about accepting the buyout offer.“I would do it the same way …I sleep well at night,” he said. “It is what it is. I can’t blame anyone. If you look at most buyouts etc, things happen. But I’m very comfortable with it.”He was talking in an interview on Bloomberg TV’s “In Business with Margaret Brennan”.

The S&P industrial index fell 0.5 per cent, led by General Electric, which was down 1 per cent to $20.35, and 3M, which fell 0.7 per cent to $93.19.General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, lost 6.9 per cent in the days following last month’s Japanese earthquake.“This is another setback for the markets, raising the level on the global uncertainty thermometer just another touch,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Technology stocks, which saw sharp losses after the previous earthquake due to supply worries, were hit by the news.JDS Uniphase lost 3 per cent to $18.99, while Cisco Systems fell 0.9 per cent to $17.91. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.5 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,333.51, recovering from the much sharper losses earlier in the session after a tsunami warning was lifted in Japan and officials at the nuclear agency there said no further troubles had been reported following the earthquake.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,409.49 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,796.14.Before the earthquake, the markets had been hovering in neutral territory as traders reacted warily to the decision by the European Central Bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent, a move that suggested the era of ultra-loose monetary policy was coming to an end.Helping to limit the losses of the session was strong US economic data. Figures from the labour department showed that new applications for unemployment benefits had dropped by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week, in a further sign that the US labour market was continuing to improve.“The downward trend continues, as the pace of lay-offs by small businesses slows further,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Elsewhere on Wall Street, retail stocks were in focus after a number of same-store sales figures from key industry leaders. Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, reported that same-store sales were up 13 per cent in March, beating analysts’ expectations and sending the shares up 3.8 per cent to $77.82.Elsewhere, Limited Brands rose 1.6 per cent to $35.80 after the clothing retailer, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, reported same-store sales had climbed 1.4 per cent in March, beating the 1.1 per cent rise that was expected by analysts.Bed Bath & Beyond saw some of the strongest gains in the session, rising 10.5 per cent to $54.55 after the home furnishings retailer forecast annual earnings of $3.38 to $3.53 a share, more than the $3.33 expected by analysts.“The company delivered a high quality beat with better than anticipated sales,” said analysts at Citigroup.But the results from the retail sector were not all positive. Gap, the clothing retailer, reported same-store sales down 10 per cent, while Target reported sales down 5.5 per cent. Shares in Gap lost 1.5 per cent to $22.72 while Target was down 2.6 per cent to $49.62.Overall though, the results were better than expected and so the retail sector was up 0.4 per cent.In corporate news, Newmont Mining, the largest gold miner in the US by market capitalisation, was up 3.3 per cent to $58.29 after announcing plans to increase its annual gold production to approximately 7m ounces by 2017, a 35 per cent increase from current levels.The company also announced a new dividend policy that will link its quarterly dividend payment to its average realised price of gold sales. The price of gold has gone up 65 per cent in the past two years and is now trading around record highs near $1,450 a troy ounce.Among other companies in focus, Rite Aid put on 1.9 per cent to $1.08, reporting that its fiscal fourth quarter loss had narrowed slightly. Pier 1 Imports added 10.5 per cent to $11.65 after the home furnishings retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 48 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate.
156;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-04-07T19:08:44Z;Luxury US brands enjoy sales boost;;"Luxury and specialist brands such as Victoria’s Secret enjoyed an uptick in US retail spending in March, while middle-market retailers led by Gap suffered as consumers grew in confidence but shopped selectively.Retail sales grew by about 2 per cent year on year as the impact of high fuel prices and worries over crises in the Arab world and Japan were offset by an improving US labour market.But while Victoria’s Secret, a lingerie chain owned by Limited Brands, reported sales up 19 per cent at stores open a year or more, sales for Gap in North America fell by 9 per cent.“It is not a rising tide that lifts all ships,” said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “The consumer is discerning. The more premium products and brands seem to be faring better; the less-prestigious brands and the lower-priced products are not faring so well.”Gap’s woes were exacerbated by an effort to revamp its product line-up and marketing, which the company acknowledged have been problematic. It shook up its management in February, including the appointment of a new creative director.Luxury department stores also reported strong figures, with sales up 11.1 per cent at Saks and 8.8 per cent higher at Neiman Marcus. Sales at Nordstrom, an upmarket fashion store, rose 5.1 per cent.“The retailers have to be happy with how things shaped up this month. The consumers have been resilient,” said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics. “What was underestimated was the improving jobs picture over the past several months, which is giving consumers more confidence to spend.”In March, the US economy generated a stronger-than-expected 216,000 jobs, the second consecutive month of growth.But on the divergence in retailers’ fortunes, Mr Perkins said: “Strong performers are gaining strength and the weaker ones not.”Among mid-market and low-end department stores, sales were down 1 per cent at Dillards and 6.5 per cent at Kohl’s. Target, a discount retailer, reported a 5.5 per cent fall.Headline figures from Retail Metrics showed retail sales up 2.2 per cent in March while the International Council of Shopping Centers reported a 2 per cent gain.The growth was down from an expansion of 4 per cent in February, but would have been higher had it not been for distortions stemming from the late timing of Easter this year.Many Americans buy clothes in a new season splurge in the weeks leading up to the Easter break. With Easter Sunday falling on April 4 last year, March caught a large chunk of that shopping. But with the holiday this year on April 24, it had no impact last month.Sherif Mityas, a partner in the retail practice at AT Kearney, a management consultancy, said: “People need to be encouraged but still cautious, because there are a lot of pressures.“Unemployment is better, but there are still a lot of people out of work. Inflationary pressures are rising and at some point those costs are going to need to be passed on.”"
157;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-04-06T20:01:26Z;Retailers face up to challenge of rising costs;;Marks and Spencer chief executive Marc Bolland was in combative mood on Wednesday, insisting the UK retailer would hold the line on margins despite higher commodity costs and fragile consumer sentiment.Increased cotton prices were having less of an impact on M&S than on the cheaper clothing retailers, he maintained. “We are trying to mitigate [the cost increases] by managing the supply base and getting efficiencies,” he said.But his words highlight the dilemmas facing the global clothing industry as rising input costs – including record cotton prices– test the efficiency of supply chains across the retail sector.Companies are agonising over how much – if any – of the increased cost they can pass on to their hard-pressed customers who have grown used to low-priced garments. They are also looking at a variety of strategies for squeezing more value out of their suppliers.Many retailers are already placing orders earlier with suppliers to secure lower prices.Gap, the biggest US fashion retailer, says it is making more long-term orders at a fixed price to even out costs. It has directed more orders to countries where it can benefit from free trade agreements to lower its cost of doing business.Gap has also been experimenting with different fabric mixes at its Old Navy stores, where it is using more rayon and modal (a form of cellulose fibre) in some of its cotton knits. The company is offering more linen in some of its dresses.Other retailers are also experimenting with lower-cost materials, including man-made fibres such as viscose, as a substitute for cotton. However, moves towards using more man-made fibres have already raised the price of synthetics.UK discount fashion chain Primark has been absorbing the rising cost of cotton, which is eating into margins. Primark says it is determined to retain price leadership in its market, although people familiar with its business say they cannot rule out price increases.Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, the UK fashion retailer, says prices in its shops have risen by about 8 per cent this season, yet says it would have been 18 per cent but for measures such as earlier ordering. “We have to be a little bit braver,” he says.It is not just the rising cotton price that is testing retailers’ business models. Higher labour costs in China have ushered in “a new era in sourcing with higher prices”, Li & Fung, the Hong Kong-based consumer goods sourcing company, warned last month.“Rising cotton prices are a more temporary phenomenon because suppliers can always plant more cotton, whereas rising labour costs in Asia are more structural,” saysCaroline Gulliver, analyst at Execution Noble.Some retailers are moving from coastal and southern regions of China in search of cheaper labour to the west and north, although some analysts believe this differential is already being whittled away. Others are leaving China altogether in favour of Bangladesh and southern India.Inditex and Hennes & Mauritz both helped pioneer the “fast fashion” era in which the latest catwalk designs are quickly mass-produced for the high street.The strain of rising input costs have brought their contrasting business models into sharp focus.Spain’s Inditex stands out from most rivals by sourcing about half its clothes production close to home in Spain, Portugal and north Africa and keeping all its warehouses in Iberia. This differs from H&M, which produces 75 per cent of its products in Asia.Until recently, Inditex appeared to be taking a gamble by foregoing the benefits of cheap Asian labour, but analysts say its strategy is paying off as the company, best known for its Zara chain, appears to be coping with rising costs better than others.Last week, H&M announced a 30 per cent drop in first-quarter net profits, compared with a year ago, as margins declined.That contrasted with a 14 per cent increase in net profits reported by Inditex just days earlier.In part, the difference reflects H&M’s refusal, like Primark, to pass on higher input costs to customers in a bid to defend its “cheap chic” image.Karl-Johan Persson, H&M chief executive, says the company is “looking for improvements all the time” in its supply chain but insists Asia remains the most competitive place to produce clothes.He argues that, while other retailers have raised prices or cut quality, H&M would be rewarded in the long run for not doing either.Ms Gulliver says there is so far little evidence to support Mr Persson’s theory, noting that Inditex’s like-for-like sales have been growing faster than H&M’s.“The risk is that consumers turn out to be not that price-sensitive and H&M ends up investing in lower prices without seeing a commensurate increase in volumes.”Reporting by Andrew Ward in Stockholm, Miles Johnson in Madrid, Andrea Felsted in London and Barney Jopson in New York
158;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-03-24T19:18:07Z;Li & Fung warns of end of cheap China goods;;Li & Fung, a Hong Kong-based consumer goods sourcing and logistics company, warned that “a new era in sourcing with higher prices” has begun, as manufacturers pass on the rising costs of both raw materials and Chinese labour to customers.The supply chain company, which sources products for companies including Walmart and Gap of the US, and Debenhams of the UK, on Thursday reported a 27 per cent rise in profits to HK$4.28bn ($550m) for 2010.Bruce Rockowitz, president of Li & Fung Trading, said: “The biggest topic on the minds of everyone in this business is that higher prices are really here to stay. At this point, retailers are not sure what they can pass on to consumers and what they cannot.”William Fung, the company’s group managing director, said heightened competition for labour in China, which has resulted in wage increases of about 20 per cent this year, heralded the end of China-led deflation for the world economy.The company said higher prices had historically been good for its trading business. “For the last 20 years, because prices were going down we had to ship more pieces [to keep revenues growing],” said Mr Rockowitz. The company’s core operating margins rose from 3.82 per cent in 2009 to 4.56 per cent in 2010.The higher labour costs in China have prompted Li & Fung to move labour-intensive work on products such as garments to countries with lower wages, such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia.The company said that China was now responsible for only 25 per cent of Li & Fung’s clothing sourcing, and Mr Rockowitz said Bangladesh and Vietnam were rapidly gaining share of its clothing business.In spite of this shift, China’s share of the company’s total sourcing rose from 54 per cent in 2009 to 57 per cent in 2010 because of a series of acquisitions last year.At its results briefing, the company, which uses “stretch” targets in three-year plans, announced a plan under which it hoped to reach $1.5bn in core operating profit by 2013, 50 per cent higher than in the previous plan.In 2010, the company acquired Visage, a UK-based private-label supplier, Jimlar Corp, a US-based footwear maker, and its sister company Integrated Distribution Services, a logistics provider, which it said would be responsible for $2.8bn in annualised turnover.
159;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-03-03T19:02:53Z;US retailers report robust February sales;;US consumers returned to shopping malls in February, shrugging off harsh winter weather and demonstrating a renewed willingness to spend.Sales at large US retailers were stronger than analysts had expected, with luxury chains and department stores leading the way and robust demand at merchants such as Saks and Nordstrom.The 4.3 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales surpassed the 3.8 per cent advance that was projected and was stronger than last year’s increase, according to data from Retail Metrics.“February 2011 will go down as a month where improved consumer sentiment, tax refunds in hand and stimulus in pay cheques created a spark in the minds of consumers to buy discretionary goods and not be so stringent on the type and amount of daily necessities bought,” said Brian Sozzi, a retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies.Same-store sales at Saks rose 15.3 per cent on the back of greater demand for women’s apparel, men’s apparel, shoes, handbags, fashion jewellery, cosmetics and fragrances.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie chain, benefited as purchases heated up around Valentine’s day and it reported a 12 per cent increase in comparable store sales.Meanwhile, Macy’s sales were up 5.8 per cent thanks in part to a surge in online shoppers.“Consumer reaction to new spring merchandise has been encouraging,” said Terry Lundgren, Macy’s chief executive.February tends to be a weaker month for retailers. However, last month was an exception for many after a stormy January held shoppers back.But in spite of rising sales, signs of inflation could create a spring lull, as consumers are forced to spend disposable income on more expensive food and fuel.“We’re starting to see inflation flow through at this point,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.“The question is how much will consumers be able to take in terms of price increases before they stop buying.”On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said that retailers in many parts of the US were implementing price increases or planning to do so in the next few months.Analysts argue that rising petrol prices have a two-month lag before they have a negative impact on retail sales, potentially posing a problem in May and June.So far, high-end and discount stores have fared the best, while mid-range retailers such as Gap, Kohl’s and Dillard’s have experienced slower sales.David Bassuk, head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consultancy, said that consumers at high-end chains have been helped by a wealth effect from elevated stock prices and discounters have benefited from the ability to offer aggressive promotion schemes.“We see it as the hour glass effect, where the ones at the top and bottom are finding their place, but those in the middle are squeezed,” Mr Bassuk said.

Agency: Crispin Porter + Bogusky
Territory: US
Verdict:Old Navy clothes are aimed at a slightly older, more cash-conscious shopper than its parent company Gap. So it is a sign of the growing popularity of smartphones that its latest ad campaign uses an app from Shazam, a music-recognition company, to unlock extra information and special offers.Reckoning that its customers, typically young mothers, love music as much as fashion, the retailer commissioned the record producers behind hits such as “Toxic” by Britney Spears to create a branded band of musicians.The Audio Threadz – a trio with striking similarities to bands like The Black Eyed Peas – sing about how they are “super c-u-t-e every single day” in a minute-long burst of forgettable pop.By creating its own music for the first time, Old Navy plays on the fact that its clothes are designed in-house, unlike some of its budget rivals.When users of Shazam hear the song on television, online or in stores, they can “tag” the song to instantly watch videos and find special deals from Old Navy on their smartphone.It is a far simpler way of closing the loop between TV and online than making people Google or remember a web address – and makes it even easier to buy on a whim."
161;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-02-25T00:18:57Z;Retailer results show US consumer caution;;Results from US retailers show that consumers remain cautious with their purchases amid a fragile economic recovery and growing signs of inflation.Target, the discount retailer, said on Thursday that its fourth-quarter profits grew on the strength of a successful holiday shopping season and its improving credit card business.Kathy Tesija, head of merchandising, told analysts Target shoppers remain cautious and focused on lower-end products and groceries.“Guests are telling us that they are still risk averse, they’re concerned about losing their jobs and focused on controlling household budgets, leading to increased coupon use and a focus on promotions,” she said.A surge in profits in its credit card business gave Target a boost, as customers took advantage of a new rewards programme. The unit reported $151m in income during the fourth quarter, up from $39m in the same period a year earlier, and Target’s bad debt expenses fell from $284m in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $83m in the latest quarter.Net income rose by 10.5 per cent to $1.035bn, or $1.45 a share, up from $936m, or $1.24, in the same period a year ago. Target’s revenues grew by 2.8 per cent to $20.3bn during the final three months of last year.Comparable store sales, which rose by 2.4 per cent, surpassed those of its larger rival Walmart, which earlier this week reported its seventh consecutive quarterly same-store sales decline. Signs of consumer caution were also evident in Sears’ earnings, as shoppers steered toward lower-end discount products.Profits at Sears fell by 13.4 per cent to $374m, or $3.43 per share, with comparable store sales at the US retailer falling by 1.2 per cent. But at Kmart, its discount branch, sales picked up by 2.5 per cent.At Kohl’s, the department store chain, shoppers over the age of 60 will soon be eligible to receive special discounts in an effort to offset rising clothing prices.“Apparel inflation is clearly real, but we believe we have had the time, the tools and the processes to work through it effectively and have a competitive advantage for both us and our consumer,” said Kevin Mansell, chief executive of Kohl’s, as the company reported a 14 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits.Meanwhile, comparable store sales at Gap, the clothing company, were flat during the final three months of last year. However, fourth-quarter profits rose by 4 per cent to $365m, or 60 cents a share and Gap announced an increase to its 2011 dividend.
162;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-02-18T01:46:47Z;Shazam hangs clothes on music service;;Shazam, the music recognition app with more than 100m users, hopes to demonstrate it can sell clothes as well as songs in a new use for its fingerprinting technology.An ad campaign just launched with the Old Navy clothing chain in the US urges viewers to Shazam the music they hear on TV spots. The app then takes them to a screen identifying the band and song and inviting them not only to watch a video and get the music for free, but also to shop for the clothes they see in the ad.In case you’re not familiar with Shazam, the UK-based company has catalogued more than 10m songs and can identify any of them from just a few seconds of music recorded on users’ mobile devices and relayed to their servers.So if you hear an unfamiliar song on the radio, a movie soundtrack or in a bar, opening the Shazam app and holding your phone up to the music soon brings up a display showing the title and band, options to buy the full song, stream it from a range of services, watch the music video, get the lyrics and even buy concert tickets if the band is touring.SoundHound and MusicID with Lyrics are similar services, but Shazam leads with the 100m user mark passed in December, 1m users being added a week, 3m songs a day being identified and 300,000 songs a day being sold through Shazam.The Old Navy campaign will be tailored to have different bands and promotions as it runs its course. Slightly altered versions of the songs will be played in stores to allow Shazam to identify them but offer different in-store promotions.This is part of Shazam being used as a marketing tool in a wider context than its familiar app, David Jones, head of marketing, told me.In the UK, TV ads for artists such as Faithless urge fans to “Shazam Now” to be taken to a screen where they can buy the music.Shazam has also fingerprinted entire episodes of  Being Human on NBC Universal’s SyFy channel, enabling Shazamming of both voice and music to trigger promotions on users’ phones and increase their engagement with the series.Mr Jones says advertisers and networks like the accuracy and data provided by these “confirmed check-ins”.“We know you are watching the show at whatever point, even if you have delayed it on a DVR, because we have your audio fingerprint of it,” he says.“We think we have a large enough number of users in the United States to get major networks and advertisers excited about Shazamming more than just music.”
163;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-02-16T23:28:46Z;Strikers slow Egypt’s return to normality;;"After closing his factories for a week during the height of the Egyptian uprising, Magdi Tolba was hoping business would return to normal. Hosni Mubarak bowed to demands to step down and all but a few diehard protesters had packed up their tents and left Cairo’s Tahrir Square.During the 18-day revolution Egypt’s economy was virtually paralysed, but Mr Tolba, a garment producer, was in constant contact with clients in the US and Europe, including Gap, Macy’s and Calvin Klein, and all had been “understanding and supportive”.Indeed, many businessmen believe a transition to democracy will be positive for the investment climate. But now companies are facing new challenges as the revolutionary zeal fuels a wave of strikes, with workers raising their voices like never before to demand better pay and conditions.The protests have forced banks to close this week, while the stock market has been shut since January 27. An exchange official said on Wednesday that trading would not resume on Sunday as planned, since the bourse could only reopen once the banking sector was functioning properly.“Everything was about to go back to normal, but our problem nowadays is workers and employees – everybody has started to ask for his personal benefits and this is really starting to scare us,” Mr Tolba said. “We are in the export industry, we have commitments.”His factories, which should be producing 50,000 pieces daily, are operating at 70 per cent, because some of the near 4,000-strong workforce have not returned to work. He has not faced strikes, but others have. Then there is the banking problem.“We have shipments of raw materials at the port and we can’t clear them, we have to wait until the banks are open next week,” Mr Tolba said. “If we have to buy local raw material we have to wait, there’s no liquidity.”Banks are due to reopen on Sunday, when the central bank will meet staff representatives from state and private banks affected by strikes in a bid to end the protests. Bank workers have been demanding higher salaries and management changes.“We have made it clear we will discuss the employees’ benefits, but definitely they cannot choose which management they want, this is not open for discussion,” Hisham Ramez, deputy central bank governor, told the Financial Times. “We are confident we can sort this out very soon.”Hisham Fahmy, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, said most businesses were back to 70-80 per cent capacity, but the next two weeks could be crucial. The mood at a meeting of the chamber’s members on Wednesday was “very apprehensive”.“The question everybody is worried about now is not the political side, but the security side – the striking workers, the lack of police presence and the army being overstretched,” Mr Fahmy said. “It’s not personal security; it’s getting people back to work.”Raouf Ghabbour, chief executive of Ghabbour Auto, which assembles Hyundai cars and is involved in $70m joint venture with Marcopolo, a Brazil-based bus manufacturer, is among those who believe the changes in Egypt will benefit business.But the short term concerns him. “The problem is defining what is short term. Is it six months, is it a year, is it three years?” he said.The bank closures were also hurting his businesses – customers could not get financing for new vehicles. “Closing the banks is killing us,” he said. “My feeling is the business is coming back, but the strikes …could lead to a collapse.”"

John Wren, chief executive, said a 12.7 per cent improvement in organic revenues in the US was ahead of expectations.Full-year revenues increased by 6.4 per cent to $12.5bn, with net income up 4.4 per cent to $827.7m.“Over the course of 2010, we have seen a steady increase in the number of clients around the world who are again investing at their own growth,” Mr Wren said. “At this point we expect growth in 2011 to return to normal levels.”The growth forecast would be the equivalent of outpacing global gross domestic product growth by 100 to 200 basis points, he added.“2010 was a great year,” Mr Wren said. “We don’t have a full analysis yet as to the strength in the fourth quarter – as to whether some of it was due to comps [comparators], some of it due to clients with budgets wanting to spend the money to increase their market share or increase performance.“At this point, until we see evidence to the contrary, we really fully expect to go back to what we can expect normally from a historic point of view.”Underlining that confidence, Omnicom’s board has approved a 25 per cent increase in dividend pay-out.Client wins in the fourth quarter included GSK, J&J baby products, the Gap and BMW. Technology and financial services companies were among its biggest -pending clients.Last week, Publicis, which owns Saatchi & Saatchi and ZenithOptimedia, reported organic revenue growth of 12.5 per cent in the fourth quarter.Omnicom has made several acquisitions in recent months, including Clemenger, an Australian agency, and Communispace, an online market researcher. But Mr Wren insisted: “We are not on a spree by any standards.”The group has been less acquisitive than rivals such as WPP and Publicis in recent years. After announcing a partnership in online media trading with Google last year, further partnerships with Microsoft and Yahoo will be announced soon, Mr Wren said.Omnicom has pledged to return its margins to 2007 levels by 2012.
165;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-02-15T21:56:59Z;Amazon’s Europe push targets Spain;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, is laying the groundwork for a new e-commerce site serving customers in Spain, as it continues to expand its business in western Europe.The retailer has begun recruiting Spanish-speaking managers to handle the look and content of home pages and site merchandising initiatives, as well as vendor and in-stock managers.It is also looking for a marketing manager to develop its customer base in Spain with efforts including e-mail campaigns, search engine optimisation, and a local associates programme to encourage individuals to link their websits and blogs to Amazon’s site.Amazon’s job advertisements indicate that the planned business will follow the lines of the company’s Italian site, which launched in November last year, and which is run by a management team split between Paris and the retailer’s European headquarters in Luxembourg.Amazon initially moved into Europe with separate businesses, launching first in the UK and Germany in 1998, but it is increasingly moving towards a more unified European business.The Italian site was the first new country business Amazon has launched since expanding into China in 2004 with its acquisition of Joyo.com.Of the 13 new distribution centres the retailer added in 2010 to its previous global network of about 40 sites, three were in Europe, including a second location in Montelimar in southern France.In January, Amazon took full control of Lovefilm, the UK-based DVD rental service that has customers across western Europe, in a £200m ($317m) deal. In October last year, it paid almost $100m to acquire BuyVIP, a fashion sales site based in Spain with a presence in seven EU countries.The international expansion of e-commerce has gathered pace over the past year, with Amazon’s rival Walmart expanding its business online in Mexico, China, Chile and Argentina, and US brands ranging from Gap to Polo Ralph Lauren opening international e-commerce sites. In the UK, both Tesco and Marks & Spencer are planning to expand their e-commerce presence.
166;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-02-04T05:01:29Z;US retailers beat bad weather;;US shoppers continued to step up their spending during January, shrugging off extreme winter weather, higher fuel prices and continuing high unemployment levels.Monthly sales data from leading US retailers released on Thursday showed stronger-than-expected gains, with the Retail Metrics’ index of comparable sales growth up 4.4 per cent against the same quarter a year earlier.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said that “with signs the economy may be turning a corner here, retailers carried some of holiday 2010’s sales’ momentum into the new year”. But he warned that “retailers and consumers are still facing some headwinds from a languishing housing market, as well as 9.4 per cent unemployment”.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the sales gain was “encouraging …and suggests relatively healthy underlying consumer demand”.The increasingly buoyant consumer mood was also reflected by SpendingPulse, the monthly survey from MasterCard Advisors, which estimated that clothing sales rose 6.2 per cent during January against a year ago.SpendingPulse, which bases its estimates on MasterCard card spending and estimates of other forms of payment, said luxury spending rose 6.1 per cent, and online sales rose 12 per cent.Store chains reporting better-than-expected numbers included Limited Brands, owner of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain, which saw sales at stores open at least a year increase by 24 per cent.Same-store sales at Victoria’s Secret rose 35 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, also reported a better-than-expected 1 per cent increase in comparable sales against the same period a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, reported a 2.3 per cent increase in comparable sales, although Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said sales have been “restrained by the series of snowstorms that caused widespread store closures along the east coast and in the south-east”.Its online sales were up 27 per cent.JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-price department stores, reported sales below Wall Street’s expectations, with JC Penney down 1.2 per cent and Kohl’s up 1.4 per cent.Target, the mass discounter, said its comparable sales increase of 1.7 per cent was below its expectations, citing weakness in the north-east and south, regions affected by the bad weather.Costco, the warehouse club, said its same-store sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, rose 4 per cent.Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report monthly sales data.
167;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-02-03T21:46:16Z;Wall St rises amid mixed results;;"Stocks made modest gains after promising economic data and strong January sales figures from retailers, but mixed earnings reports and worries about Egypt and other countries limited gains.Merck lost 2.7 per cent to $32.90 after the drug group posted a fourth-quarter loss and forecast that full-year earnings would come in below expectations.Much of the loss was because of a writedown after it had to stop trials in an experimental heart drug due to safety concerns.For the fourth quarter, Merck lost $531m, or 17 cents a share, after the $1.7bn writedown, falling back from a $6.5bn profit, or $2.35 a share, a year earlier.Dow Chemical reported that fourth-quarter earnings had nearly trebled. The largest US chemical company reported profits of $511m, or 37 cents a share, up from $172m, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. The results were only slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts and so the shares were up 0.3 per cent to $36.74.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,307.11 after strong economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent to 12,062.26, its fourth consecutive session of gains, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 2,753.88.Figures from the Labor Department showed that the number of j obless claims had fallen by 42,000 to 415,000 in the last week of January, surpassing the 31,000 drop forecast by economists.“Initial claims are trending down as the labour market recovers,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. “We would expect the downtrend in claims to continue.”Data also showed that the productivity of US workers had unexpectedly risen in the fourth quarter. Separately, figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US service sector had seen strong growth in January, with the index moving 2.3 points higher to 59.4. A reading above 50 signals expansion.But market reaction to the statistics was muted as traders looked nervously at the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East after Yemen became the latest country to face anti-government protests.“The focus …seems to have turned towards Egypt because this higher ISM number is really strong (approaching a booming pace) but the market is simply not trading on it,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. The retail sector was one of the leaders of the session after groups reported better than expected January sales.Limited Brands, parent of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, reported a 24 per cent increase in January same-store sales and revised up its fourth-quarter earnings guidance, sending the shares 7.4 per cent higher to $31.29. Zumiez, a speciality sports retailer, said January same-store sales had risen 15 per cent, sending the shares up 3.2 per cent to $24.39.Costco Wholesale, a warehouse retailer, rose 4.5 per cent to $74.03 after its same-store sales rose 9 per cent.Sally Beauty Holdings saw same-store sales up
6.8 per cent, but reported first-quarter earnings up 57 per cent, outstripping analysts’ estimates and sending the shares 13.8 per cent higher to $14.37.News that BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, was considering selling itself sent its shares up 12.2 per cent to $48.25.After the closing bell on Wednesday, News Corp, owner of Fox Broadcasting and Twentieth Century Fox, reported a doubling of second-quarter net income. Its shares gained 6 per cent at $16.96. The company reported second-quarter profit of $642m, or 24 cents per share, from $254m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, driven by higher TV subscriber fees and advertising sales.That came in spite of deep cuts at MySpace, which triggered a $275m charge to News Corp’s quarterly earnings. The group disclosed that rivals and financial groups from the US and elsewhere had shown interest in the site.Verizon Communications, the telecommunications provider, advanced 0.6 per cent to $36.38 after announcing it would buy back 100m of its shares.Kellogg, the maker of breakfast cereals, reported a 7.4 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, sending its shares up 4.3 per cent to $52.52. Gap rose 4.2 per cent to $19.83 after it forecast that its end of year profits would come in ahead of previous estimates.CVS Caremark, the second-largest US pharmacy chain, dropped 5 per cent to $32.92 after reporting weak fourth-quarter earnings."
168;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-02-02T05:31:21Z;Gap to revamp core-brand management;;Gap, the US clothing company, will on Wednesday announce a management shake-up of its core Gap brand, seeking to strengthen support for further global expansion and improving its still uncertain US performance.Art Peck, previously head of the company’s outlet and international franchise business, is to take over as president of the North America Gap brand from Marka Hansen, whose departure after four years in the job was announced on Tuesday.Gap is also establishing a new “global creative centre” in New York, which will combine overseeing the existing design offices already based in the city with production and marketing functions.Pam Wallack, who will head the New York creative operation, said the move would improve Gap’s ability to deliver “one global design vision” across its business North America, Asia and Europe.“In many cases we have been challenged by being a San Francisco-based company that has retail stores around the world …We think [New York] is a cosmopolitan city, and we think we can serve the globe very well from there.”Gap is also dropping Laird + Partners, the creative agency that oversaw a botched attempt to revamp its logo last year, in favour of Ogilvy & Mather, ending a nine-year relationship.Seth Farbman, formerly director of Ogilvy’s worldwide business, is to become the Gap brand’s first global chief marketing officer, reporting to Ms Wallack.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, said the New York creative team would support the company’s renewed focus on international growth, which saw new stores opening last year in China and Italy, and an expansion of its global e-commerce business.Over the past four years Mr Murphy has presided over a turnround effort at the Gap brand, aimed initially at improving the sales productivity of its stores and then at restoring North American sales growth by regaining its leadership position in casual fashion, such as the launch of the 1969 denim sub-brand.In March last year, Mr Murphy said the company was again focused on growth, and that “the word ‘turnround’ can just go and find another brand now”.Gap brand monthly same-store sales in North America subsequently fell in seven of the next nine months against the year before, including an 8 per cent drop in December.Gap’s shares rose more than 1 per cent in New York to close at $19. 52.
169;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Brutal battle looms over tax loopholes;;"Barack Obama’s call for Congress to cut the corporate tax rate and close special “loopholes” for individual industries has set the stage for a long and brutal lobbying fight on Capitol Hill.It could also lead to a realignment of the biggest “winners” and “losers” of the US tax code.The US president was short on details in his State of the Union address about the kinds of tax breaks he would like to see abolished to pay for the first overall reduction in the corporate tax rate in 25 years, a move that he said would enhance competitiveness.The US rate stands at 35 per cent, the second highest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Anne Mathias, tax analyst at WRG, said companies already domiciled in US tax havens, as well as pharmaceutical groups such as Pfizer and technology groups such as Hewlett- Packard, which have been able to sustain effective tax rates in the low 20s by taking advantage of special tax provisions, might have the most to lose.Companies that could see benefits in a tax revamp were those focused on US sources of revenue that did not rely heavily on foreign subsidiaries, including large US retailers such as Best Buy and Gap Inc, and food and healthcare companies.“This is an insanely complex system, and the only way to lower the corporate rate without increasing the deficit is to eliminate enough loopholes so that companies with very low effective tax rates have to pay more,” she said. “Any legislative effort is going
to have to be a balancing act.”Gene Sperling, Mr Obama’s chief economic adviser, acknowledged on Tuesday that reaching an agreement in Congress and – to some extent – within the corporate community, would be a Herculean task politically.“Everyone wants to cut someone else’s tax loophole,” he said.The US Congress is not only divided on the tax issue along partisan lines, but also by the regions, industries and large corporations that members represent.Lawmakers representing corn-growing states from both sides of the aisle would be hard pressed to agree to a cut in ethanol-related subsidies, while those representing Silicon Valley would probably try to protect provisions that allow tech companies to skew high taxation on intellectual property to low-tax countries.An administration official on Wednesday said the president would continue “outreach” to stakeholders over the coming months.“Revenue-neutral, rate-lowering corporate tax reform that removes special tax incentives for certain activities and investment will improve the allocation of capital in the economy, which should improve growth,” the official said.The White House has not been shy about its intention to target $4bn in tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, which Mr Obama said ought to be diverted
to pay for investments in “clean energy technology”.But the administration is not likely to call for the reduction of billions of dollars in tax credits and deductions for research, because that is an area Mr Obama has said ought to be expanded.Many Republicans want the US to return to a territorial – rather than worldwide – system of taxation that would end taxes of profits generated by companies abroad when they are brought back into the US.Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House ways and means committee, the chief tax writing body, said he was disappointed that Mr Obama did not address the needs for tax reform for small business.He did not comment on the president’s call for an end to special interest tax cuts.Clint Stretch, managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte Tax LLP, said the gulf between the administration’s vision of tax reform, and that of the resurgent Republicans in the House of Representatives, might be too wide to achieve real reform.As with most policy issues in Washington, the momentum for change might ultimately come down to whether enough influential businesses believe an overall cut in corporate tax would be worth the price of abandoning the tax benefits they already enjoy, and whether they can convince lawmakers to agree."
170;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-01-14T22:03:15Z;Tweaks to a logo? A bit of a no-go;Rebranding does often seem to be used as an alternative to fresh thinking;"Like you, I know I’ll always remember where I was the first time I heard about the new Starbucks logo.I remember it like it was last week. I was on a train; no hang on a minute – maybe I was driving. Yes that’s it, I was driving and I heard the news on the radio and was so stunned I had to pull over, where I got talking to another man who was just as shocked. Anyway, we stood there reminiscing about great cups of coffee we’d had and how we’d miss the great logo, even though we’d never really noticed it before. “It’s like a piece of my heritage has been erased,” he said. “I loved that blue square.”No, that can’t be right. Oh wait, wait; that was where I was when I heard about the new Gap logo. I was definitely on a train when I read about Starbucks – or maybe a bus. Ok, I admit it, my world was left pretty much intact by the news that Starbucks’ name and the outer circle of the design were being removed from what I hadn’t previously recognised as the “mermaid” logo.Some people, however, took it less well. These are the thousands of angry people who left furious messages on the Starbucks blog or the company’s Facebook page. (It’s tempting to digress into wondering what sort of person ordinarily reads Starbucks blogs or joins the Facebook fan page, but I’m staying on mission).But these people were very upset: Amanda Austin said the new logo “makes me throw up”. On the blog, LRboyd was “so fired up” he opened an account just to leave an angry comment. Mimi Katz wanted the name of the “bonehead” who came up with the idea. But some were, just as bafflingly, terribly excited. Shelleyjo99 thought it was “bold, brave and beautiful”.Now, I’m not one of those people who thinks all logos and branding are nonsense. It is just something of a struggle to get worked up about it. Rebranding can be valuable to signify a new direction, although it does often seem to be used as an alternative to fresh thinking and can even denote an attempt to retain the status quo by changing the presentation. Nestlé may keep bleating on about how it is now a “health and wellness company” but to most people it is still primarily Kit-Kat, coffee and Smarties.Few can deny the value of a strong logo – the Lloyds black horse; the RBS begging bowl or the Golden Arterial Stents of McDonald’s. But still, this fuss seems overstated. Starbucks’ logo tweak is not exactly Disney dumping Mickey Mouse.But then in a world where people pay to wear other companies’ logos, carry their bags and drink from their branded coffee cups, it is easy to understand why they feel invested in the aesthetic. Perhaps this is why the latest logo-rage (should that be logorhythmia?) seems to go further. It is not just about people’s desire for anchors in a constantly shifting world; it speaks to our every day consumption being an increasing part of our identity. We really are becoming what we drink, eat, wear and watch. I’m a Mac; not a PC. I’m Gap not Brooks Bros; I’m Starbucks not Nescafé.Now, there’s always been a touch of this. People have long defined themselves by the car they drive or the paper they read. But a logo is less tangible. Driving a Ferrari makes you a Ferrari driver; wearing Ferrari aftershave does not. Once upon a time we knew this; we knew that smoking a Marlboro did not make you a cowboy. Wearing Fred Perry certainly did not make me a tennis player. But now it seems too many people have bought in. We are sold on the idea that being a Starbucks guy makes us more like one of the cast of Friends and less like another bloke in an office. It builds out our image.Of course, we aren’t fooling anyone. After all, I may have a MacBook but deep down I know that I’m probably still a PC really. But if you don’t want to know this, the logos are your permission to be the person you’d rather be. And all of a sudden the company goes and changes them and they look naff to you. The illusion is destroyed. And you remember that the coffee was never actually that good in the first place.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
171;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-01-06T22:01:09Z;Retail sales report weighs on US stocks;;Gap, Target and Macy’s were among the retail stocks that fell after weak festive holiday trading but positive news from the jobs market helped US stocks pare losses.The final verdict on retailers’ holiday shopping season was disappointing as many large chains missed their estimates.Retail Metrics said its index of same-store sales had risen 3.2 per cent against analysts’ forecasts for a 3.5 per cent gain.The S&P 500 retail index fell 1.6 per cent while the wider consumer discretionary sector sank 0.7 per cent. The consumer discretionary index was the biggest riser in 2010 and its retail component surged towards the end of the year in anticipation of a bumper shopping season.“Retail sales were kind of a dampener,” said Randall Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Services. “But the market is not too worried about it, probably because the Christmas season was quite good. It was just the snow in the north-east at the end of December that kept the shoppers away.”Target, the discount retailer, tumbled 6.8 per cent to $54.93 after its sales only edged up 0.9 per cent compared with the average analyst estimate of a 3.9 per cent gain.But TJ Maxx, which offers discount designer clothes, added 5.9 per cent to $45.52 after it unexpectedly reported a rise in same-store sales.Department store Macy’s dropped 4 per cent to $23.97 after it said sales rose 3.9 per cent in December, less than the 4.5 per cent predicted.Rival Saks added 4.6 per cent to $11.50 after it reported a rise of 11.8 per cent, which was better than analysts’ forecasts.Clothing retailer Gap dropped by 6.9 per cent to $20.70.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,273.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.2 per cent lower at 11,697.31.But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.3 per cent to close at 2,709.89. as a decision by Microsoft to use a different processor in the next version of its Windows operating system buoyed some technology stocks.Microsoft climbed 2.9 per cent to $28.82, while the makers of ARM processors also gained. Nvidia soared 13.8 per cent to $19.33, while Qualcomm added 1.2 per cent to $52.67 and Texas Instruments gained 1.4 per cent to $33.25.Intel, which used to dominate the processor market, fell 0.8 per cent to $20.77.Initial jobless claims edged up by 18,000 to a total of 409,000 last week, but the number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits fell. The report was slightly better than average forecasts.“The average level of initial claims in December was the lowest monthly average since July 2008 and this, combined with other labour market readings for the month, leaves us comfortable with our forecast for a 175,000 increase in private payrolls in December,” said John Ryding of RDQ Economics.Telecoms stocks led the fallers, down 2.8 per cent, after Metro PCS announced its fourth-quarter subscriber results, which missed expectations, sending its shares tumbling 6.7 per cent to $13.30.Metro’s rivals also fell, with AT&T down 1.4 per cent to $29.15 and Verizon losing 2.6 per cent to $36.23.US-listed shares in BPdipped 0.6 per cent to $46.23 after rising in the session. The official US inquiry into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill concluded that systemic failures by the management of BP and other companies led to the Macondo well blow-out.Transocean and Halliburton, contractors on the project, were also criticised by the report. Transocean edged down 0.3 per cent to $73.04 but Halliburton lost 3 per cent to $38.22.The S&P 500 energy index, which has suffered this week as the oil price fell, dropped 0.7 per cent.Coal producer Massey Energy sunk 3.1 per cent to $54.65 even though it said fourth-quarter coal shipments were lower than it had previously projected.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, jumped 8.6 per cent to $29.67 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 to at least $2.08 per share from a previous maximum of $1.96. It said strong bond market issuances had boosted profit as the agency rates the bonds.
172;GPS;Gap Inc;2011-01-06T20:59:24Z;US retail at strongest since 2006;;Sales at leading US retailers failed to meet Wall Street’s heightened expectations in December, but the sector still delivered its strongest performance since 2006 over the two months of the holiday shopping season.The International Council of Shopping Centers, which tracks monthly sales data of 32 retailers, said its index of December same-store sales, delivered on Thursday, rose 3.1 per cent against a year ago, but short of the 3.5 per cent rise expected by analysts.However, its index for November and December together was up 4 per cent against last year, the most robust growth in the holiday shopping season in four years.Mike Niemira, chief economist at ICSC, said that while the results missed the “hype”, December’s performance “was good, but uneven” with some retailers indicating that bad winter weather had cut into sales.“The big themes were recovery in the economy, and in the retail industry, and ultimately in consumer spending,” he said.Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Macy’s, the country’s largest traditional department store chain, said sales at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale's outlets during November and December rose 4.6 per cent, with December sales “consistent with our high expectations”. This was despite the snow that hit the east coast after Christmas.JC Penney, its lower-cost rival, said it had a “successful” holiday season, with comparable store sales up 5.7 per cent against the previous year.But Gap, the largest speciality retailer, reported a 3 per cent drop in comparable store sales growth during December against last year.Sabrina Simmons, chief financial officer, said that “after a strong start to the holiday season in November, sales and traffic trends for our brands were less consistent in December”.American Eagle and Aero­postale, the youth fashion retailers, reported comparable sales declines of 11 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in December.Target, the discount chain, saw comparable sales rise just 0.9 per cent against last December. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the month’s sales “were below expectations, as strength in grocery and apparel was offset by softness in electronics, toys and some home categories”.However, there was evidence that more prosperous Americans are spending again on discretionary purchases, and so more upmarket retailers continued to outperform the rest of the sector in December.
173;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-12-30T22:21:47Z;US stocks fall despite positive jobless data;;US energy shares saw a slight lift after BHP Billiton was said to be considering a $90-a-share bid for Anadarko Petroleum, the US-based oil-and-gas explorer.Anadarko shares closed 6.9 per cent higher at $75.59, their highest level since June 2008.Anadarko recently announced the opening of its Ghanaian “Jubilee”field, the first major international expansion for the group, which has substantial assets in US shale.Gas trapped in shale rock in the US has been a sought-after asset this year. As a sector, oil and gas saw the most $1bn or larger deals in 2010, with 65 deals for $220bn globally, according to Dealogic.The market is expected to continue to expand, with some $90bn of oil and gas assets said to be for sale in 2011. Reliance Industries, the Indian energy conglomerate, said it is still seeking expansion in the US.Other independent US shale exploration groups were mixed. Cabot Oil & Gas was up 0.9 per cent, to $37.69, but Denbury Resources was down 1.4 per cent to $19.Energy shares overall were up fractionally at the end of the session, as US indices slipped back from their highest levels since September 2008 in extremely light end-of-year trading volumes.The S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,257.88. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.1 to 11,569.71, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.2 per cent to 2,662.98.Sentiment was softer in spite of a sharp decrease in weekly US jobless claims. Claims fell by 8 per cent, with 388,000 unemployment insurance claims filed for the week ending December 25. The figures were adjusted for the typical jump in holiday hiring.“We would advise taking the result reported today with a very large grain of salt. The holiday season normally creates volatility in these figures that doesn’t shake out until late January,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, saw shares rise 2.1 per cent to $24.12, at one point seeing their highest since June 2008.The Chicago region purchasing managers’ index also improved, rising from 62.5 in November to 68.6 for this month. A reading over 60 indicates expansion.Materials groups, closely tied to economic growth, were down only slightly. Alcoa led the Dow, rising 0.5 per cent to $15.21, though AK Steel fell 1 per cent to $16.11. CF Industries, which produces fertiliser, was up 1.4 per cent to $136.67.The financial sector lagged, falling 0.3 per cent. Asset managers were lower on weaker fund sales. Janus Capital Group was down 1.2 per cent to $12.91, and Legg Mason fell 1.7 per cent to $36.17.US investors pulled almost $8bn from municipal bond funds in November, the Investment Company Institute said on Thursday.Consumer credit groups were lower after US mortgage foreclosures were revealed to have risen sharply in the third quarter, up 31 per cent, according to US regulators. That hurts consumers’ willingness to take on debt. American Express was down 0.8 per cent to $42.51, and Discover Financial fell 2.2 per cent to $18.17.Expedia, the travel website, dropped 1.2 per cent to $25.28. The group has been locked in a dispute with American Airlines over whether the carrier will continue to advertise its flights on the site.Sears Holdings was down 0.5 per cent to $74.15 a day, Its shares rose more than 6 per cent on Wednesday after it said it would launch an online film service. Shares in Netflix, the market leader, were down 0.3 per cent to $179.80.Cephalon, the drugmaker, continued to fall after news that it would not seek approval for its jet lag remedy. Its shares fell 0.8 per cent to $62.16.Retailers were mixed as traders judged the post-Christmas holiday season.Gap, the clothing retailer, rose 2.4 per cent to $22.46. Apparel group Limited Brands also added 1.6 per cent, to $31.19.Tiffany & Co, the jeweller, dropped 1.4 per cent to $63.11. GameStop, the video game retailer, and RadioShack both added 2 per cent to $22.95 and $18.82, respectively.
174;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-12-17T17:33:47Z;Barnstormer;;Social entrepreneur Tamsin Smith creates sustainable business opportunities for entrepreneurs in Africa and Central America, a career she has built from her work at Gap and experience as a panel member at the Harvard Business School and the International Aids conference. When she’s not travelling to promote her various causes, Smith spends most of her time in San Francisco, where she lives with her two children, Scully, aged nine, and Tabitha, six, in one of the city’s most unusual properties: a 19th-century barn house.In 2006, Smith was appointed president of (RED), an initiative co-founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver, that engages the private sector to raise money for women and children with Aids. Smith collaborated with a number of global brands to create one-off products, from iPods to Converse shoes made from African mud cloth, all of them coloured red. For every (RED) product bought, the Global Fund receives part of the profit to invest in Aids programmes in Swaziland, Ghana, Lesotho and Rwanda. So far, (RED) has generated over $150m.In 2008, Smith left (RED) to spend more time with her children. She now heads the consulting company, SlipStream Strategy, from her office at home.Her projects include Girl Up, a United Nations Foundation campaign that encourages US girls to raise money for school supplies, clean water and health services for underprivileged adolescent girls around the world. “I work on the communications surrounding a project, whether it comes from a non-profit, the private sector or a community organisation,” says Smith. “I help implement creative strategies to increase visibility and awareness on the part of the general public.”Smith lives in Noe Valley, a residential neighbourhood in central San Francisco surrounded by flower markets and restaurants, including her family’s favourite, Haystack Pizza. The house, whose pink and blue barn door makes for an unusual facade, is a rarity among rows of Victorian and Edwardian houses, for which San Francisco is famous. Built in 1887, it is one of the few buildings to have survived the 1906 earthquake and fire. “From the moment I walked in, I was drawn to my house in much the same way as I was drawn to this city,” says Smith. “It had so much character and history and yet it was modern and light like a new-old soul, which is a little how I feel sometimes.” From her beach-blond hair to her passion for surfing in the Pacific Ocean, Smith is quintessentially Californian although she was born in England to a half-Chinese, half-English mother, a prominent cell biologist, and an English father who was a lepidopterist and Hope Professor of Zoology at Oxford. Smith moved to Florida as a child after her parents took teaching positions at the University of Miami. From an early age, she discovered that her proclivities were not for science but stories and poetry.“When I graduated with a literature degree from Kenyon College in Ohio, I knew only that I wanted, at some point in my life, to live in northern California,” says Smith. “The stories and music from Big Sur [a region in central California] and San Francisco always had a special lure for me.” After completing an MA in international law and diplomacy at Tufts University and working as an assistant on Capitol Hill to members of the US House of Representatives, Smith moved to San Francisco shortly after her 30th birthday to lead the government affairs department of Gap.She fell for the barn house largely for its storied history. She bought the property in 2007 after growing weary of carting children up to a home on Potrero Hill. The barn house, originally built as a carriage house for the larger Victorian home next door, has housed a variety of tenants from ironworkers to animals to neon sign manufacturers. The first proprietors, the Axford brothers, came from Scotland to make cannon shot for the Union during the American civil war. Later, the Strahls family arrived. They worked in the meat business and filled the barn with livestock. The original pulley, once used to haul up hay, still hangs outside Smith’s bedroom window, although it now serves as a hook for Scully and Tabitha’s ghost forms on Halloween.“I remember worrying about the fact that the house had virtually no closets, a serious problem given my love of apparel, or storage space to speak of,” says Smith, who made an offer for the house several hours after viewing it and two days before embarking on a surfing trip to Costa Rica.Smith transformed the two-storey barn into a family home. In the downstairs kitchen, she replaced closed white cabinets with open shelves of solid maple so she could peer into the open-plan living and dining rooms. Upstairs, she punched into walls to create more cabinet space and added a window in her bedroom. She converted an attic into a “pirate/princess” nook with sky-blue walls that her children access via a ship’s ladder. Up there, they have a telescope for studying the stars.Smith painted the walls creamy yellow, perhaps inspired by the yellow buds that drop from an old pepper tree and blanket the front porch. She incorporated splashes of pink, blue and green throughout the house, including her living room’s orange sofa and jars of sea glass, to reflect the tones of the small garden.Paintings and sculptures by local artists hang beside her children’s Snoopy drawings, a swelling collection of surfboards stands next to a dining table she purchased in one of her favourite shops on Valencia Street in the nearby Mission District. Books, from the poetry of Yeats to her father’s book on butterflies of the West Indies and South Florida, line the shelves and rise in stacks from her office floor.“I think this house feels like an outward expression of what I find most attractive in other people,” says Smith. “It’s exposed but intimate, quirky but solid, simple yet full of character. I’m drawn to its openness, the way you can see right into its heart from a big wide window, but I also love its secret nooks and unexpected details. It’s a free spirit with gravitas, if that makes any sense at all.”
175;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-12-14T05:22:58Z;JCPenney links with Facebook on webstore;;JCPenney, the mid-priced US department store, has become the first leading US retailer to launch online shopping fully integrated with Facebook, the social networking site, in a move that reflects the intense interest among retailers in Facebook’s potential to deliver sales.A new JCPenney webstore allows Facebook users to browse selected inventory and categories and make purchases without leaving the site, while also posting comments and recommendations to other friends on the Facebook network.The retailer has 1.3m registered Facebook “fans”. Tom Nealon, who heads JCPenney’s digital initiatives, said the new application would “encourage social integration and user contribution as our customers shop”.JCPenney is using a platform developed by Usablenet, whose other web products are used by about 180 online and bricks and mortar merchants, with about a quarter of them to use its platform to open similar Facebook stores by the first quarter of next year.Jason Taylor, head of global product strategy for Usablenet, said that Asos, the UK online fashion retailer, also hoped to open its own Facebook site by the end of the year.Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods company, launched a similar Facebook e-commerce store in October, using a platform run by Amazon’s web services business. 1-800-Flowers, the online florist, began allowing Facebook users to complete transactions last year, and, in August, Delta Air Lines began offering ticket sales via the Facebook site.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, has made online inventory available on Facebook for comments and search, but directs users to its own site for transactions.Most retailers have so far largely focused on using Facebook as a tool for cultivating loyal customers, through special coupons, online sweepstakes and other offers.Stores have also created links to Facebook from their e-commerce sites that allow customers to share images or comments with their friends, in the hope that this will lead to future sales.Mr Taylor argues that the emergence of e-commerce business within Facebook will provide retail marketing executives with firmer data on which to determine future marketing spending.“One of the things that JCPenney recognises is that they are doing lots of things, but without the key numbers on revenues that are coming through Facebook, it is hard to move the investments forward,” he says.Earlier this year, Facebook also launched a new Facebook Deals service with several retailers, including Macy’s and Gap, aimed at attracting customers to stores by offering discounts to users who register their presence in a physical store.In a separate commerce initiative, Facebook also offers users and small businesses a marketplace feature for buying and selling products, that functions as an online classified service backed by users’ Facebook profiles.
176;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-12-13T18:42:02Z;Walmart to close Moscow office;;Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales and profits, is closing an office in Moscow that it opened last year to pursue acquisitions in Russia.The move, announced on Monday, comes a week after X5, Russia’s biggest food retailer by sales, said it had struck a $1.65bn deal to acquire Kopeika, a rival that operates about 700 discount stores and was a potential partner for the US retailer.Walmart said it had been looking to expand in Russia through an acquisition rather than by starting its own retail chain. It said it was closing its representative office in Moscow because it had no potential partners in view in the near term.Doug McMillon, head of Walmart’s international business, said he believed that the Russian market remained “a compelling retail opportunity” and that Walmart would continue “to pursue market entry opportunities”.Some international retailers who have sought to enter the Russian market on their own have faced challenges. Carrefour, Walmart’s French rival, withdrew from Russia last year after opening just two of its large-format hypermarkets.Sweden’s Ikea, with 12 shopping centres in Russia, has complained of pervasive corruption and dismissed two senior managers this year for allowing a supplier to pay bribes to secure power for a shopping centre in St Petersburg. Germany’s Metro and France’s Auchan, both early entrants to the Russian market at the start of the decade, have about 45 stores each.Walmart continues to pursue an aggressive programme of overseas expansion, both through store openings in the 14 countries in which it already has a presence and in new markets. In November it announced a $2.3bn bid for Massmart, a South African retailer, following a $1.13bn deal in May to buy 193 small supermarkets in the UK from Denmark’s Netto.Its growth in existing markets has been focused this year on Brazil, China and Mexico, while it is also expanding a small chain of cash-and-carry warehouses in India.Mr McMillon said the retailer remained “excited about our international business, including markets where we already operate such as Brazil, China and India, where we have tremendous growth opportunity”. Russia’s developing consumer market has continued to attract attention from US retailers and consumer companies, with PepsiCo, the soft drink and snack company, announcing a $3.8bn deal last week for Wimm-Bill-Dann, the largest Russian dairy company.Russia has also attracted speciality fashion retailers, with Gap and Sweden’s H&M opening stores over the past two years. Their rival Zara, which opened its first Russian shop in 2003, now has more than 135 stores in the country.

Fashion house Armani opened an e-commerce site in China two weeks ago, while Gap, the clothing retailer, launched its online store there last month.Dangdang, China’s leading online bookseller, raised $272m, almost a quarter more than originally planned, in its New York Stock Exchange IPO on Tuesday.After following in Amazon’s footsteps in diversifying from books into general online retailing, the company’s revenues jumped 56 per cent in the first nine months. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is planning a Chinese e-commerce site for its Sam’s Club stores next year.Uniqlo, the Japanese clothing retailer, set up an online store in China last year, while Adidas, the sportswear company, opened an online shopfront this summer on Taobao, China’s largest consumer e-commerce platform.“Just nine months ago, many foreign companies felt that building a web presence in China was too difficult, given all the trouble Google had in China,” says Jeff Kim, vice-president of CDNetworks, a company that hosts e-commerce websites.But now, “people feel this market is just too huge to ignore,” he says. Since October, 30 per cent of CDNetworks’ new customers are companies entering China.A similar rush is under way domestically. Geely, the Chinese automaker, launched its first online store on Taobao this week, where buyers will pay a deposit and then visit a showroom to confirm their purchase.New e-commerce websites are mushrooming. “We see new specialised sites in our sector pop up at a very fast speed,” says CC Zhuang, president of Qunar, one of China’s oldest and largest online travel agents.Taobao Mall, the company’s business-to-consumer arm, expects its transaction volumes to quadruple this year from 2009. But the rapid growth is also bringing challenges. So far, China’s online retail market has been dominated by consumer-to-consumer transactions – a field where Taobao reigns supreme.“Business-to-consumer transactions accounted for only 8.5 per cent of total online retail sales last year,” says Su Huiyan, an analyst at iResearch in Beijing.“But that proportion will greatly increase over the coming five years.”That could spell trouble for Taobao. Although it is also the leader in the business-to-consumer market, its share, at 33 per cent, is only half its overall e-commerce market share.Fang Yingzhi, an analyst at China e-Business Research Center, says an online mall started earlier this year by Japanese online retailer Rakuten and China’s leading online search engine Baidu could become a serious challenger for Taobao Mall.Consumers are also becoming more demanding – a trend that has already prompted changes at Taobao. The company has moved its mall site to a separate domain to create a higher-end environment, and its parent is investing massively in a logistics network to get rid of bottlenecks in delivery.“We started with consumer-to-consumer, and people were attracted by the low price, the many choices and the convenience,” says Daniel Zhang, Taobao’s chief financial officer. “Now product and service quality have become more important.”
178;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-12-02T21:32:50Z;US bond yield rise points to improved outlook;;The yield on 10-year US Treasury notes rose above 3 per cent for the first time since July after better economic news prompted a dramatic reassessment of the economic prospects for the US.US asset prices and bond yields rallied on Thursday despite the fears about eurozone sovereign debt that have prompted safe haven buying of US Treasuries in the recent past.The moves suggested that investors had fresh confidence in the US recovery and believed that it can successfully decouple from problems in Europe or any slowdown in China.Higher 10-year yields suggest investors think the Federal Reserve will raise rates or halt its current $600bn programme of asset purchases earlier than they previously thought.“As long as the economic dots connect higher, I reckon that a sub-3 per cent 10-year note will be difficult to sustain,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at RBS Securities.In the latest sign of an improving outlook pending home sales, which reflect transactions signed but not yet closed, surged by 10.4 per cent from September to October. That surpassed the expectations of Wall Street economists, who had predicted a decline, suggesting some stabilisation in the housing market.The steady recovery of confidence among middle-income US consumers was also underlined by monthly sales data from a range of mainstream retailers – including JC Penney, Macy’s, Gap and Target – which delivered stronger than expected sales gains against last year.Weekly jobs data released on Thursday pushed the 10-year yield to a high of 3.03 per cent, before it eased to 2.96 per cent at midday in New York.Bond traders zeroed in on the fact that the four-week moving average of US weekly jobless claims dropped to 431,000 this week, its lowest level since August 2008.Bond traders now await the release of the US employment report for November on Friday. That could spark a further rally if it tops the forecast gain of 145,000 new jobs.“Until we see a meaningful upward surprise in the payroll numbers, the market is still going to treat the durability of the upturn with caution,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.While the Federal Reserve will be encouraged by the better economic data, it will also note that much of the fall in bond yields and the dollar since August, when its new round of asset purchases first became widely anticipated, has now been reversed. That has tightened financial conditions and offset some of the stimulating effect of its asset purchase policy.Reporting by Robin Harding in Washington and Michael MacKenzie, Alan Rappeport and Jonathan Birchall in New York
179;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-12-02T14:14:59Z;Return to spending boosts sales at US shops;;Leading US chain retailers recorded a strong start to the holiday shopping season in November, as early promotions and solid sales on the post-Thanksgiving weekend boosted revenues.Monthly sales data from retailers released on Thursday suggested they had benefited from an improvement in discretionary spending. As a result sales rose at department stores and top brands.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of comparable sales growth rose by 5.3 per cent against the same month last year, beating the 3.5 per cent forecast based on Wall Street analysts’ predictions. The increase compared to the 0.7 per cent gain in November 2009.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said he expected a “robust” December, supported by “stock market gains, improving macro data leading to better consumer confidence numbers, and aggressive promotions”.Department stores delivered some of the strongest sales growth, as they benefited from shoppers’ increasing readiness to spend on items such as costume jewellery.JC Penney, the mid-price department store, said comparable sales increased by 9.2 per cent, while its rival Kohl’s reported a 6.1 per cent increase.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, saw its comparable sales rise by 6.1 per cent.Target, the mass discounter, said November sales rose 5.5 per cent on a comparable store basis against last year.Comparable sales at Limited Brands’ Victoria’s Secret stores rose 13 per cent against last year, continuing a run of double digit monthly gains since the summer.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said its same-store sales rose by 4 per cent compared to last year.Same-store sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer, surged 22 per cent. But same-store sales at its lower cost rival American Eagle were flat.The strong sales at individual stores came amid broad year-on-year increases in consumer spending in leading categories, according to estimates from MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse. SpendingPulse, which uses data from card spending and projections for other payments, said clothing spending had increased by 9.6 per cent against a year ago.The survey estimated that e-commerce sales rose by 12 per cent in November against last year. ComScore, the online research firm, reported this week that US online sales on the Monday following Thanksgiving rose 16 per cent, giving the US e-commerce sector its first day of sales surpassing $1bn.

Some investors are locking in profits given the performance of the markets.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,180.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to close at 11,006.10 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.1 per cent lower at 2,498.23.The indices finished November almost flat, with the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent over the month, after a sharp rally in September and October.Energy and consumer discretionary stocks led the risers over the month while the utilities and healthcare sectors suffered the most.On Tuesday, stocks pared their losses after positive data on the US economy.“Today’s catalyst for now is the Chicago PMI and the better-than-expected consumer confidence figures,” said Nino Jimenez, senior vice president at Brinson Patrick. “They point to the more largely followed ISM manufacturing index due out tomorrow as well as Friday’s employment numbers.”The Chicago Purchasing Manager’s Index showed business activity in the region climbed faster than expected in November, partly on the back of stronger employment.Improving confidence in the labour market helped US consumer confidence rise to its highest level in five months.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index pared its losses after the report and was down just 0.3 per cent. Supervalu, the grocery store operator, added 2.7 per cent to $9.04, department store owner Macy’s gained 1 per cent to $25.68 and clothing retailer Gap advanced 3.1 per cent to $21.36.But the housing market remained grim. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of house prices in 20 cities showed US house prices fell for the third month running in September.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said 19 of the 20 cities showed a decline in prices for the month and he expected further declines before the end of the year.However the S&P 500 homebuilders index was up 1.2 per cent with Lennar gaining 1.3 per cent to $15.19 and DR Horton jumping 1.7 per cent to $10.04.In financials, Bank of America fell 3.2 per cent to $10.95 just before the close as investors speculated the bank could be at the centre of a future Wikileaks document release.Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, said in an interview with Forbes that his group plans to release tens of thousands of documents from a major US bank but would not identify the bank. In an interview last year with Computerworld, Mr Assange said he had obtained data from Bank of America.Bank of America said it is aware of WikiLeak’s claims but has not been contacted by the group or seen proof that it possesses any of the bank’s information.Shares in Goldman Sachswere down 1.8 per cent to $156.14 and Morgan Stanleylost 1.9 per cent to $24.46.The technology sector fell the most in the wider indices, down 1.4 per cent.Google dropped 4.5 per cent to $555.71 as the European Union said it had opened a full investigation after allegations from smaller online search providers that the US company had abused its dominant market position. There was also continued speculation that Google would bid for the Groupon discount website and it was reported that a possible offer could be between $5bn and $6bn.Comcast lost 0.9 per cent to $20.04 after it found itself at the centre of a dispute about how it handles video traffic on the internet as US regulators work to prepare “net neutrality” rules.The cable company was accused late on Monday of asking for fees for the first time in return for carrying internet movies and other traffic for Level 3, which provides streaming services. Level 3 edged up 0.5 per cent to $1.01.Ebay fell 3.6 per cent to $29.14 after it was downgraded by analysts at Piper Jaffray who said the auction site will lose market share in the next two years.Research in Motion jumped 4.8 per cent to $61.83 after analysts at Jeffries Group upgraded the BlackBerry maker, citing the company’s new QNX operating system.In deal news, shares in Baldor Electric Company put on 40.4 per cent to $63.31 after the maker of industrial motors agreed to be bought by Swiss-Swedish group ABB. The bid, worth $4.2bn including debt, will pay investors $63.50 a share, a 41 per cent premium to Monday’s closing price.
181;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-11-28T23:01:02Z;Amazon seeks to expand globally;;Amazon says it plans to revamp its international e-commerce platform to make it easier for the company to reach customers in new markets.The online retailer, the world’s largest by number of visitors, operates online businesses in six countries outside the US. It says it has set up a new team that will create “the architectural underpinnings to greatly simplify country expansions”, by translating content into different languages and adjusting taxes, prices and delivery options to better suit customers’ locations.The move underlines the increasing globalisation of online retailing, as companies such as Gap, the US clothing retailer, and Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, seek to use e-commerce sites and cross-border shipping to reach a wider audience.Walmart, one of Amazon’s main online rivals in the US, has invested heavily in a global e-commerce platform over the past two years, which it says it plans to use to reach customers both in existing markets and in countries where it has no physical stores.Japan’s largest online retailer, Rakuten, has also recently acquired or launched sites in the US, Europe and China forits Ebay-style online marketplaces.Amazon operates websites in Canada, China, Japan, the UK, Germany and France, and offers customers ordering from other countries the ability to pay for purchases in their own currencies. But it has not entered a new country since 2004, when it acquired Joyo.com, its Chinese site. Instead, it has focused on steadily expanding the new product categories on its range of global sites.The retailer is now seeking to recruit senior software engineers for what it says is “a new team . . . that is gearing up to make a substantial impact on how Amazon does business around the world”.A job posting says the team is “tackling interesting problems like rendering content in multiple languages and calculating tax, price and shipping variations on the fly based on the customer’s preferred shipping destination”.Gap has recently launched a UK-based e-commerce site aimed both at the UK and other western European countries, although customers can only pay in sterling, not euros.Gap has recently launched its first e-commerce sites in Canada and China, while Walmart has said it will shortly open an e-commerce site for its Sam’s Club discount warehouse stores in China.Marks and Spencer, the UK general retailer, has said it hopes to use e-commerce to expand its international sales, once its current agreement to rely on a site run by Amazon expires in 2013.Tesco, the UK supermarket group, also said this month that it planned to open e-commerce sites in China, Poland and the Czech Republic.
182;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-11-26T20:22:58Z;Man in the News: Millard Drexler;Failure at Gap seems only to have fired up the J.Crew supremo, writes Jonathan Birchall;"Michelle Obama, first lady of the US, has been good to Millard “Mickey” Drexler, chief executive of J. Crew, the retailer of “preppy” clothing style for affluent Americans. From an early television appearance in October 2008 to the presidential inauguration and a visit to Downing Street last year, Mrs Obama’s taste for J. Crew’s casual outfits stimulated a surge in sales at the company’s 230 US stores. “It was actually an act of God,” Mr Drexler said, after being blessed by the most stylish first lady since Jacqueline Kennedy. “She loved the clothes, I guess.”This week good fortune smiled again, as J. Crew agreed a $3bn private equity buy-out that should leave Mr Drexler about $150m richer. But for the 66-year-old chief executive the deal also continues a more personal turnround, one that has made him a hero to the mass fashion industry as a retail leader who has shown that hunches, not data, can still determine what flies out the door and what doesn’t.“He’s a true merchant prince,” says Gilbert Harrison, chief executive of Financo, a retail-focused investment bank in New York. But in an industry where business success depends increasingly on demand-forecasting software and algorithms to determine when and by how much to cut the price of a slow-moving item, Mr Drexler talks instead about his own “internal mechanism, a switch that goes on when the goods look good”. It is, he has said, an intuition shaped by both his successes and failures in the fickle world of fashion.When he first brought his hunches to J. Crew seven years ago, his career had just suffered a particularly momentous failure. In 2002 Mr Drexler had been fired as chief executive of Gap, the world’s largest speciality clothing retailer. He had worked there for 18 years, hugely expanding sales, creating Gap Kids and launching the lower cost Old Navy chain. By 2002, however, Gap had opened too many stores, and sales were slumping. Mr Drexler’s instinct was to introduce more trendy fashions (including an orange coloured puffer jacket), but the move only further antagonised loyal customers.For all his tag as a “merchant prince” he ultimately proved unable to steer the empire he had helped create, leading to an acrimonious split with Gap’s founder, Don Fisher, who died last year. Mr Drexler has said he still gets angry when he walks past a Gap store, even after the subsequent satisfaction of seeing J. Crew – once a nondescript, struggling catalogue-based outfit – consistently outperform its rival.His Gap departure made Mr Drexler a wealthy man, as he cashed in his stake for about $350m. He now owns an array of luxury properties including Eothen, an estate on Long Island created by Andy Warhol, which he bought for $27m. This seems to fulfil what he has long said was an early ambition to escape from the rough neighbourhood in which he grew up. He was raised in a grim apartment building in New York’s Bronx, by a father who bought buttons for the garment trade and earlier by a mother who died when he was a teenager.His breakthrough came when he won a place at the respected Bronx Science High School. He went from there via city and state colleges to an MBA programme at Boston University. There then followed 12 years as a buyer with various department stores, where he first claims to have discovered the power of his inner “switch”.At J. Crew and Gap, and before that as head of Ann Taylor, the women’s fashion brand, Drexler earned a reputation for being obsessed with the detail of clothing design, while also taking an unusually hands-on approach to management. He uses his cell phone to connect to the public address system at J. Crew’s New York headquarters, updating his staff on travel plans and creative thoughts, and even on occasion issuing reminders to turn the lights off when they went home.Mr Drexler dresses in what he calls his uniform – an open- necked shirt, sometimes worn over a T-shirt, a jacket and jeans. “He dresses like his customers, he acts like his customers,” says Mr Harrison. “I don’t think he’s worn a suit and tie, even to a funeral.” He regularly replies directly to customer’s e-mails and phone calls, to stay in touch with his shoppers. His only reported leisure activity is walking the dog.“He shares a lot in common with the start-up leaders of successful Silicon Valley companies,” says an executive who worked closely with him at Gap, noting in particular his passionate attitude to work. Mr Drexler, who is married and has a teenage daughter and adult son, compares his approach to Steve Jobs, the detail-obsessed chief executive of Apple. Indeed, the two have a history: Mr Jobs served on Gap’s board, and broke the news of his firing in 2002; Mr Drexler is now chairman of Apple’s board.This passion comes with an evident ego. As one retail industry observer notes of his public utterances: “He likes to talk a lot about everything Mickey Drexler has done.” His strong opinions have also seen him row publicly with rivals. As the industry slumped in late 2008, he sparred with Burt Tansky, the much-respected head of luxury department store Neiman Marcus, telling him that the days of customers paying $800 for a pair of shoes were over. At Gap he had a reputation for impatience too, often losing his temper – something he now says he controls better.Mr Drexler says he wants those who work for him to be equally forthright. When he interviews job candidates, he says he looks not at academic credentials but for “hungry high-energy people”. Candidates who have worked as waiters do well, he says, because they understand customer service. He identifies “with the kid who has grown up in environments like I’ve grown up in”.Now the $3bn proposed buy-out offer for J. Crew puts him in a place most other retail executives would envy: he has financial backers who believe in his vision, a “significant” personal stake in the company, and room for growth at his own pace both in the US and internationally. Eight years after he failed at Gap, the question is whether his distinctive skills can work as his company grows to meet his ambitions. This as much as anything will determine whether the merchant prince can further expand his kingdom."
183;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-11-23T20:07:43Z;Low-cost stores expand as bigger shops falter;;TJ Maxx has opened its third store in Manhattan on 57th Street – with the “off-price” retailer moving into space previously occupied by a branch of Gap, the leading US speciality clothing retailer.Marshalls, another off-price retailer owned by TJ Maxx’s parent company, TJX, is opening an outlet in the city’s Chelsea district, selling a similar selection of end-of-range mid-price and aspirational branded merchandise.Nearby on Union Square stands the recently opened Nordstrom Rack store, operated by the upmarket Nordstrom department store to dispose of out-of-season or excess clothing stock.For once, Manhattan’s retail changes are accurately reflecting changes in the country as a whole – with TJX and its rivals continuing to open stores at pre-recession rates, as mainstream rivals pause or slow expansion.Over the past two years, the largest off-price retailers – TJX and Ross Stores – have regularly reported sales growth outperforming conventional department stores, with comparable sales gains running in the mid-single digits. Their stores, known for their overflowing racks and discounts of up to 60 per cent, were prime beneficiaries of shoppers abandoning traditional department stores to “trade down” by searching for brand-name bargains.But both claim they can continue to expand even as the economy improves, benefiting from changed shopping habits among customers across all income levels.Michael O’Sullivan, Ross’s chief operating officer, has told investors that from experience of past downturns, “when we pick up new customers …we tend to hold on to [them] even when the economy picks up”.The two groups also argue that their established position in the stock liquidation business – which accounts for about 7 per cent of US clothing sales – will help them stave off competition from online competitors such as Ebay and Overstock.com.Laura Champine, retail analyst at Cowan & Co, says the scale of purchases by the largest off-price retailers – who buy with short lead times of four to six weeks – gives them the market power that should guarantee them adequate supplies of excess branded merchandise even in a recovering economy.“A vendor who does not sell to them runs the risk of not being able to move excess inventory,” she says.TJX, which also operates the TK Maxx stores in Europe, has 2,799 stores, and had sales of more than $20bn last year. Ross Stores, with more than 1,030 stores in the US and sales of $7.2bn, has hopes of eventually doubling the number of its US locations.
184;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-11-15T19:06:32Z;JC Penney to launch stores for ‘big men’;;JC Penney, the US mid-price department store retailer, is to launch a chain of up to 300 speciality stores aimed at “big and tall” male customers, as it pursues sales growth in an increasingly saturated retail market.The retailer, which operates 1,100 large, mid-price department stores, said the new chain of smaller stores would be called The Foundry Big and Tall Supply Company, aimed at men who struggle to find suitable clothes in mainstream stores.It plans to open its first 10 stores next May, together with an e-commerce site.The stores, of about 6,000 sq ft, will sell both national brands and private label merchandise. The retailer said the stores would have an “urban, industrial design, in a hip, yet unpretentious environment that invites men to shop, relax and enjoy themselves”.The move targets a market that is expanding due to rising obesity rates across the US. It is already served by speciality retailers including Casual Male, which has 500 stores and sales last year of just under $400m.JC Penney said in September it wanted to add an additional $1bn of sales over the next five years. It had sales of $17.6bn in 2009.Mike Ullman, chief executive, noted in a statement that “oversize” customers made up more than half the male population, and spent nearly $6bn annually on clothing, shoes and accessories.But beyond the specific market, the move also marks an evolution of the traditional department store business, as stores such as JC Penney turn to separate, more focused speciality businesses in the search for growth, rather than continuing to open more of their existing format.The retailer is following a practice which has previously been limited to speciality fashion stores, such as Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth retailer, which launched its Hollister stores in 2000 to target younger customers, or Gap, which branched out into Old Navy and Banana Republic stores in the 1980s and 1990s.JC Penney, which traces its roots back to 1902, said last week that it would also launch two e-commerce-only retail businesses next April, through a newly established new growth brands division, in an unprecedented move by a leading US chain retailer.The new sites, Clad.com and Gifting Grace.com, will be supported by a marketing and merchandising partnership with Hearst Magazines, publisher of Cosmopolitan and Esquire, and will sell respectively men’s clothing, and gifts aimed at a female audience.Michael Dart, a senior retail consultant at Kurt Salmon Associates, said he believed the creation of the separate store chain by the retailer “is the start of a trend that will only accelerate”, as department stores try to make their strongest brands and offerings “more accessible to their core customers”.
185;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-11-08T03:28:31Z;Maybe Gap’s new logo ‘mistakes’ were intended all along;;From Mr Phil Dean.Sir, In Rhymer Rigby’s piece around the Gap logo fiasco (“ Treating the shock of the new name”, Business Life, October 28), he failed to pose what seems to me the obvious question – did they do this whole thing on purpose?Gap is a huge, multinational company with a vast customer base. While it is important to demonstrate a willingness to listen to your customers, typical “big brand behaviour” involves a certain confidence and strength of image. Not making a complete U-turn in a matter of days over something as crucial as a brand logo, just because of some negative comments online.Gap’s new logo looked uninspired and thrown together. Subsequently opening the floor to disapproving customers and using crowd sourcing to design a new logo seems an odd decision, and one that has met with some adversity in the design community. I find it hard to believe that Gap could make all these fundamental mistakes without good reason, and the word-of-mouth and international press exposure the brand has enjoyed since would suggest that this was Gap’s plan all along. If so it has played it brilliantly.Phil Dean,Managing Director of Creative Services,Communisis,Leeds, West Yorks, UK
186;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4.7 per cent to $70.00 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold surged 7 per cent to $103.89.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investment, said stocks could rally into the end of the year as diminished uncertainty after quantitative easing, the midterms and stabilising jobs and housing data helped investor confidence.“Cyclicals like energy and materials are very good suspects for leading markets [where as] financials have a lot of question marks like Basel III and Dodd-Frank,” he said.He added that natural resources stocks were soaring partly due to quantitative easing but also because of expectations that China would end its tightening cycle in the first half of next year.The financials rallied later in the session, up 3.4 per cent, after it was reported that the Federal Reserve might allow banks with strong capital levels to increase dividends. The two biggest banks by assets led the risers. Bank of America jumped 5.2 per cent to $12.12 and JPMorgan Chase shot up 5.5 per cent to $39.80.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.7 per cent, lifting the wider consumer discretionary sector by 1.6 per cent as retailers reported their October same-store sales.Gap, Target and Macy’s all beat expectations. Gap jumped 6.1 per cent to $20.43, Target climbed 1.5 per cent to $54.76 and Macy’s gained 6.6 per cent to $25.56.Even shares in Kohl’s, where same-store sales fell and the retailer lowered its third-quarter outlook, rose 2.3 per cent to $51.92.Some retailers also reported their quarterly earnings. Limited Brands, which owns the Victoria’s Secret chain, advanced 5.3 per cent to $31.43 after it beat estimates. Shares in Limited Brands have risen 68.2 per cent this year.In food retail stores, Whole Foods rocketed 15.1 per cent to $47.27 after the upmarket grocer raised its 2011 profit forecast and beat expectations in its fourth quarter. Same-store sales rose 8.7 per cent as customers dipped into their pockets for more organic and gourmet foods.At the other end of the spectrum, Costco, the warehouse club operator, said its same-store sales rose 6 per cent in October. Its shares were higher by 3.7 per cent to $65.48.News Corp, the owner of Fox News and newspapers around the world, beat expectations as advertising recovered. Revenue grew 17 per cent at Fox News after it led the cable news ratings, helping to increase operating income at the division by 23 per cent. But its shares edged down 0.6 per cent to $14.75.Cable operators also beat expectations with their quarterly earnings as they added more internet and phone subscribers.Time Warner Cable said it added more internet customers even though the number of basic video subscribers fell. Revenue and profit rose and the company said it would launch a $4bn share buy-back programme. Its shares advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.33.Cablevision Systems also reported better-than-expected results. Its shares jumped 2.6 per cent to $28.36.US-listed shares in PotashCorp dropped 2.4 per cent to $141.97 after the Canadian government rejected BHP Billiton’s $39bn bid. Potash shares have risen 29.2 per cent this year as the Australian miner has pursued the company. BHP Billiton, which added 6 per cent to $91.20, has 30 days to appeal.
188;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-27T20:53:54Z;Treating the shock of the new name;;"As the recent Gap logo fiasco shows, rebrandings can go horribly wrong. Earlier this month, the US clothing retailer announced that a new logo design was to replace its well-known 20-year-old version. Customer reaction to the three black letters and a small blue square was swift and overwhelmingly negative, sweeping rapidly across the internet.A Facebook page, “I think the new GAP Logo Sucks”, appeared, as did a spoof Twitter account featuring the new logo tweeting about how ugly it felt. Another site offered people the opportunity to make their own logo; one of the most popular variants used a word that rhymed with Gap.Feeling the pressure, Gap made a U-turn. Marka Hansen, head of the Gap brand in North America, said: “We’ve been listening to and watching all of the comments …We heard them say over and over again they are passionate about our blue-box logo, and they want it back. So we’ve made the decision to do just that.” The company, she noted, “did not go about this the right way”.Rebrandings and renamings that repel the audience they are supposed to at­tract are a feature of business life; sometimes the company backtracks, while others tough it out.Pepsi stuck with the redesign of its roundel a couple of years ago, even though it was roundly deplored, while the SciFi channel decided to rise above the rash of syphilis jokes that greeted its decision to call itself SyFy in 2009. Less fortunate in outcome was the UK Post Office group’s decision at the start of the decade to move some of its operations under the label of Consignia, which attracted hoots of derision before it eventually and quietly renamed itself Royal Mail Holdings. Similarly, Tropicana, the fruit juice brand owned by PepsiCo, re­designed its logo in early 2009 only to revert quickly to the original after it was deluged with e-mails, phone calls and letters with such comments as: “The new cartons stink.”Other efforts attract less enmity but beg the question, why bother? Why, for instance, did AOL feel the need to insert a full stop into its new logo? Odder still was the US electronics retailer Radio Shack. Last year, it decided it wanted people to call it “The Shack”, but only as a kind of nickname, while it was still formally known as Radio Shack.Rebrandings are also often enormously expensive. Paul Veness, director of Endpoint, a brand implementation com­pany, says: “From our experience, the cost of [executing] a rebranding is 20 to 30 times the creative budget. It’s everything from signage to staff uniforms to the IT back end.”While he may be right that rebranding can be a good time to introduce best practice and achieve some streamlining, this is hardly the case if the company has to change it all back again.However, Wally Olins, chairman of Saffron Brand Consultants, says the widespread public outrage at the overhaul of the Gap logo does not mean rebranding is a bad idea, “I don’t think it goes wrong that often but, when it does go wrong, people notice it,” he says.When they like a new logo or name, he says, they usually say nothing rather than demanding that the company backtracks. Moreover, he adds, most brands “do need to change subtly and continuously if they are not to look anachronistic. If you look at BMW, the brand is continuously evolving.” Similarly, Nike, Apple and Shell all update their logos in a way that might be considered evolutionary.But there are times when revolution is called for. “There are often very compelling reasons to make a change,” says Rita Clifton, chairman of Interbrand. “It might be a regulatory change, part of the company might split off, it might be a merger such as Diageo [the result of combining GrandMet and Guinness] or it might be that you’re becoming more international.”Such was the case with Aviva, which until 2009 was known as Norwich Union, Commercial Union and Hibernian, as well as Aviva, in different markets, before becoming Aviva everywhere. In its home country, the UK, this meant dropping Norwich Union, a brand with more than 200 years of history, yet there was very little fuss. “Aviva rebranded in a very charming way,” says Ms Clifton.Amanda Mackenzie, Aviva’s group marketing director, says: “Before we did it, we really tried to understand what people wanted out of a financial services brand and to understand how important Britishness was to the brand. It was driven from the top but we talked to customers and staff throughout.”The company announced the change a year before it formally took place. It ran TV and poster campaigns featuring celebrities known for having changed their names, such as Bruce Willis, Elle Macpherson and Ringo Starr. It also listened to people, says Ms McKenzie. “We had an e-mail from the Bishop of Norwich’s office saying: ‘I do hope you’ll keep the cathedral in the logo.’ And we reassured him that yes, we would.” Ms Mackenzie even contacted some unhappy customers directly. “Someone wrote in and said: ‘Which balding, facetious, marketing twit did this?’ I phoned him and said: ‘Hi, it’s the balding and facetious marketing twit.’”When the company formally chang­ed its name in June last year, it also an­nounced it would sponsor Norwich City Football Club to reaffirm its local roots. There are no Facebook groups for people who hate the name Aviva.Ms Clifton points out that while new “invented” names – such as Diageo, Aviva, Altria or Accenture – are tempting targets, especially when they replace venerable brands, customers do get used to them. “It’s easy to mock but after a while it starts sounding normal.”It is worth remembering how, in 1958, Japanese consumers hated the idea of Tsushin Kogyo (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering) changing its name but the company explained it needed something foreigners could pronounce. It based its new name on the Latin word for sound, sonus, and became Sony.Not everything hangs on a name. Mr Olins points out that if the company is good enough, even brands that in theory should be dreadful can still work. He cites Volkswagen. “It’s a classic example of an appalling name. It’s unpronounceable and has horrible historical connotations [Hitler was one of its original supporters] but it’s a very successful brand.”His point is echoed by Ms Clifton. “The thing that really makes brands is the substance that lies beneath. If it’s not right, then a shiny new logo will just highlight this.”Even so, companies must manage the process carefully.Ms Clifton counsels against springing a new name on an unsuspecting public – Aviva gave people a lot of time to get used to the idea.It is worth remembering that customers can be very conservative. “People often hate anything new,” says Mr Olins. “Jaguar spent a lot of time listening to focus groups who told them they had a great brand, so it didn’t change. But then the same people went out and bought other brands that had changed.”The lesson may be that brands need to lead and not follow – and sometimes this can mean having the strength to weather initial criticism. The London 2012 Olympics logo was controversial at first but people now seem to have got used to it. Indeed, some observers have said Gap made two mistakes – the first was the new logo. But the second was to cave in to the online mob, which made it look weak and indecisive.Nevertheless, there are times when rebranders must throw in the towel. But even then, if handled well, disaster can be avoided.In 1998, Kellogg’s changed its UK breakfast cereal Coco Pops to Choco Krispies. It turned out that it had underestimated the UK public’s love of the name Coco Pops, including a catchy advertising jingle. But instead of quietly reintroducing Coco Pops, it managed to turn the outcry into a successful publicity campaign by setting up a phone vote line referendum for consumers. This at­tracted a great deal of media attention, culminating in the triumphant return of the original brand."
189;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-25T17:58:35Z;US retailers tackle unsold stock problem;;US retailers are stepping up investment in new technology that will allow them to connect shoppers with items lurking unsold on their shelves, as they battle to increase sales and earnings in a sluggish economy.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer by sales, has said it is working on a new “ship from store” system, that will make the hoodies, blouses and khaki trousers in its 1,040 US Gap stores available to online customers as well.Toby Lenk, head of Gap’s online business, told investors this month: “We can book an order online, and then send that order to the store for fulfilment. It’s going to allow us to stay in stock longer at the website …There’s great business potential from that.”As with most retailers, orders from Gap’s e-commerce operations are currently filled from warehouse distribution centres, with an inventory system that evolved separately from that used by their brick and mortar stores.Its planned embrace of “ship from store” technology follows other retailers, including Sports Authority, the sporting goods retailer, and Jones Apparel, the fashion retailer, who both launched similar systems this year. Toys R Us, the toy retailer, introduced a similar system for some of its stores this month.Nikki Baird, a consultant at Retail Systems Research, says that while some retailers recognised the need to bring store and online inventory together in the early years of the decade, they initially focused technology spending elsewhere.Unlike investments in new customer-facing technology, such as mobile phone marketing campaigns, the investment in backroom store systems offers a way of boosting sales and profits at a time when most retailers are no longer able to grow sales by opening new locations.Nordstrom, the fashion department store, linked inventory at its 115 stores to its e-commerce site in September last year, saying it led to it selling more stock at full price, and contributed to a “dramatic” improvement in inventory turns. Nordstrom’s inventory turns – the number of times it sells the total value of its stock – rose to 5.46 at the end of July, against 5.16 a year previously.Ms Baird says that for fashion retailers facing short seasonal windows, “there is a huge amount of value for the retailer to go to that effort to match that customer up with that item at another store”.Fiona Dias, head of strategy at GSI Commerce, the retail web-services company, says the systems address a long-standing retailing challenge. “Merchants in big retailers are just salivating. All of them have this problem of odds and sods littered all over their company …nobody in Bloomington, Indiana, wants it, but someone in Alaska does.”
190;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-20T17:45:44Z;Alibaba plans China delivery network;;Alibaba Group, China’s leading e-commerce company, is planning to build a massive logistics network across the country because it is dissatisfied with the quality of local delivery services and wants to stay ahead of rising competition in its fast-growing home market.The group is to set up distribution centres in 52 Chinese cities over the coming two years, Jack Ma, founder and chairman, told management in recent internal strategy meetings, according to sources at the company.The logistics service, details of which have not been revealed, is designed for users of Taobao, an unlisted group affiliate which has a stranglehold on China’s consumer e-commerce market.Its platform for trade between consumers and its retail platform where merchants sell to consumers have a combined market share of 83.8 per cent, according to Alan Hellawell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.Purchases on Taobao already make up more than 70 per cent of domestic couriers’ daily deliveries, and this has led to delays and patchy quality in distribution and delivery because the local logistics companies do not have the capacity to cope with the fast growth in e-commerce.This trend has led to United Parcel Service, the US package delivery company, moving ahead with plans to establish a domestic service in China.Alibaba, initially just a business-to-business platform, has left rivals, including Ebay, far behind in the consumer e-commerce sector since the launch of its Taobao site in 2003. Taobao has 230m registered consumer users, compared with 90m registered on Ebay.But it is facing new competition. Baidu, China’s leading search engine, launched an online mall website this week together with Rakuten, Japan’s largest online shopping mall operator.A growing number of foreign retailers are setting up their own online shopping sites in China. While Adidas opted for a shopfront on Taobao, Uniqlo, the Japanese clothing retailer, launched its own Chinese online store last year, and its rival Gap is set to follow next month. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is also preparing to launch its own e-commerce site in China.Tencent, China’s largest internet company by registered users, is also working to expand Paipai, its e-commerce arm.While e-commerce revenues in China are still small, they are expected to grow at 42 per cent a year to Rmb1,523bn ($229bn), or 7.2 per cent of total retail sales, by 2014, said Mr Hellawell in a research report.“E-commerce in China is still in a nascent stage, but if Taobao wants to retain the market position it has now, it must up its game,” said a company official who asked not to be named.
191;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-19T16:31:22Z;Fast Retailing sees quality as a good fit for Uniqlo;Failure would be a blow to the already battered image of Japan Inc, says Mure Dickie;As this column features Fast Retailing, Japan’s largest clothing retailer by sales, I should start by declaring an interest.Not a financial interest. I do not own a single Fast Retailing share nor do any business with the company. My interest is more personal: I find shopping for clothes in Fast Retailing’s Uniqlo stores less painful than anywhere else.So I am keen to see them prosper and open ever more shops – preferably anywhere I might end up living.Until recently, that seemed a safe bet. Supported by soaring sales, Uniqlo’s Japanese and international operations opened more than 80 new stores in the year to August. The brand already has a presence in New York, London and Paris, arrived in Taiwan this month and has targeted the opening of 1,000 shops in China by 2020.But Uniqlo has been faltering. Fast Retailing this month surprised investors by forecasting its first profit decline in four years. Fast Retailing shares fell 10 per cent on the news and are down nearly 40 per cent since the start of 2010.So is Fast Retailing on the fast track to be yet another Japanese corporate disappointment?The answer does not only matter to fashion-deaf shopaphobes such as myself who have come to rely on Uniqlo’s supply of good quality, standard clothes in a decent range of sizes at reasonable cost. Fast Retailing’s energy and international ambitions have made it something of a national champion. Failure would mark a heavy blow to the already battered image of Japan Inc.Tadashi Yanai, Fast Retailing’s president and chairman, has himself blamed Uniqlo’s troubles over the past half year on a range of failings, including poor product planning, supply chain management and marketing. Previous strong performance has made the company “careless”, he says.At the very least, the slowing growth makes clear Uniqlo is not the unstoppable juggernaut that its cheerful defiance of Japan’s anaemic growth and demographic decline had made it seem. Investors have now been reminded of past debacles such as a first push into the UK market in 2001 that crumbled just two years later with the closure of 18 out of 23 outlets.But Fast Retailing’s disappointing profit forecast should be seen in the context of its strong recent performance, not to mention healthy 8 per cent operating margins. Net sales were up 19 per cent year on year in the eight months to August at Y815bn ($9.9bn), while net profits rose 24 per cent to Y62bn.Mr Yanai’s forthright analysis of Uniqlo’s problems is one reason Fast Retailing remains a good bet. This company learns from setbacks. “They are always hitting walls, falling down and getting back up again …stronger,” says Masafumi Shoda, analyst at Nomura Securities. This year’s disappointments could even help Uniqlo’s long-term prospects by puncturing over-optimism. The plan to open Chinese stores at a rate of one every three days for a decade, for example, looks a bit ambitious. Mr Yanai has sometimes seemed in a rush to match bigger global clothes retailers such as Gap of the US or Spain’s Inditex.Mr Yanai should also think hard about Uniqlo’s insistence on a unified global marketing strategy, under which advertising and pricing is supposed to be the same everywhere from New York to Kuala Lumpur.Fast Retailing is unusually cosmopolitan for a Japanese company and Mr Yanai stresses the importance of local management for his global empire. Yet, Uniqlo insists it can come up with a centrally controlled approach that will appeal effectively to consumers of all ages in all markets.That sounds unlikely. For marketing, as much as for Uniqlo’s fine cotton slim fit shirts, one size can hardly fit all.Even more important will be balancing the need to please conservative and price-conscious customers such as myself, while staying fresh enough to attract more fashion-conscious consumers and thus avoid looking hopelessly dated or uncool.Uniqlo pulls this trick off well. The brand competes unabashedly on price. But a recent fashion spread in a UK newspaper showed a model in a £1,295 ($2,037) coat from Dunhill – and £30 Uniqlo jeans.Still, fashionistas are fickle and can leave the unwary retailer stuck with unwanted inventory, so chasing their favour too keenly is a risky business.Now Mr Yanai has decided Uniqlo needs to refocus more on quality and less on “superficial elements of fashion”. This suggests its stores will remain the kind of place where a retail surgical strike can quickly and cheaply yield a pair of nice new chinos and an Oxford shirt. I may be biased, but that sounds like a recipe for success to me.Mure Dickie is the FT’s Tokyo bureau chiefmure.dickie@ft.com
192;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-17T22:55:59Z;US retailers to ride wave of China web sales;;Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is about to launch a website for its Sam’s Club stores in China, in a sign of the growing interest of global retailers in online sales in the fast-growing market.Gap, the US clothing retailer, will open a Chinese online sales site next month, to complement the opening of its first stores in the country.Japan’s Uniqlo, a rival of Gap, launched an e-commerce business in China last year, while Adidas, the sportswear company, opened an online store in August on Taobao, China’s dominant internet marketplace. Coach, the US handbag retailer, intends to open an online store in China next year.The retailers’ push comes as growth in China’s e-commerce market is expected to take off. Online retail sales increased by 117 per cent last year to $39bn, according to iResearch, a Beijing-based company.“About two-thirds of Chinese have been online for three years or less, and half for less than two – and in the past it has taken about three years for an internet user to become an online shopper,” McKinsey, the consultant, revealed in a recent report on Chinese internet use habits. “Assuming that this conversion continues, tens of millions of new e-commerce consumers could be just around the corner.”This prospect is particularly alluring for companies as Chinese consumers appear to trust retailer and manufacturer websites and are likely to search for product information there. “That is a stark difference from the US, where consumers prefer to consult consumer and third-party reviews, such as Amazon,” the McKinsey survey said.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s global e-commerce business, told a meeting with investors last week that the retailer was “excited about the size of the opportunity” for online sales in China.Walmart expects China to overtake both Japan and the UK over the next five years to become the world’s second-largest e-commerce market behind the US, with projected online sales of $230bn, against a forecast $490bn in the US.One in four of China’s 400m internet users buy online, according to the state-run China Internet Network Information Centre.Walmart said it will use its own internet platform for the service, which would support the handful of Sam’s Club stores it currently has in China, rather than its more numerous Walmart and Trustmart locations. But it said the service would include both next-day delivery and information on product availability in store for Sam’s Club’s customers, who are primarily small businesses and local retailers.Gap is working with a local partner, Shanghai Yi Shang, which will handle distribution and fulfilment of orders. Gap is believed to be the first retailer to launch an e-commerce business in parallel with the opening of its first stores.Toby Lenk, head of Gap’s direct sales, said last week that online sales were viewed as “a really exciting opportunity long term”.Taobao, owned by Alibaba, provides internet “store fronts” for retailers and dominates online merchandise sales in China.However, Baidu, the search company, is preparing to launch a rival marketplace with Japan’s Rakuten.Wan Ling Martello, chief operating officer of Walmart’s global e-commerce business, said that both she and Mr Castro Wright had been “completely, absolutely blown away by how much Chinese customers have embraced e-commerce”.Dan Brutto, head of the international business of UPS, the parcel logistics company, said its decision to seek a domestic delivery license in China was driven in part by demand for business-to-consumer shipping.“A lot of customers are asking us, ‘Hey, can you help us in China? I have a plant in China that I now want to use to service the Chinese consumers.’ So we think there is demand,” Mr Brutto said.Additional reporting by ­Jeremy Lemer and Kathrin Hille
193;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-17T14:51:06Z;Listening to customers can be bad business;Gap’s climbdown on its new logo is feeble;"Last week, for the first time ever, the mob on Twitter and Facebook forced the management of a big company into defeat. This victory of democracy over autocracy was scored over something people feel strongly about: whether three letters belong inside or outside a box.For the past 20 years, the letters G-A-P have resided in a dark blue square, but two weeks ago the management of the clothing company announced that the letters had escaped and that a smaller blue square would henceforth sit above the P. All hell then broke loose. Thousands of people protested online and, a week later, Gap backed down. The big box was going to stay.The new Gap logo was not obviously an improvement on the old one. And the sight of management listening to customers and accepting humiliation in order to satisfy them seemed like a good thing.Yet what happened was not really good at all. It isn’t progress when a company panics and surrenders when faced by an armchair army of protesters. It is feeble.Compare Gap’s experience to that of PwC, which changed its logo two weeks earlier. The new PwC look is an even uglier version of the new Gap effort, with the letters in italicised lower case, and not one, but a whole jumble, of little boxes scattered over the C. This logo was launched old-style, with corporate fanfare and a statement of customary idiocy from senior management, followed by customary sniping from journalists and from a couple of tweeters (people don’t care as much about accountants as about jeans) and that was that.“We think our new brand expression visually distinguishes PwC in the same way that the quality and expertise of our people differentiates the experience of working with PwC,” said the firm’s chairman. Which is, of course, absolute, total tosh. Three little letters and some squares cannot say anything about quality or expertise at all.But then logos are a fluffy subject; I have never heard anyone say anything that wasn’t daft about the thinking behind any change. This is because there never is any thinking, save the idea that it’s time to do something different.PwC’s management evidently judged that time had come, and knows that any fuss will quickly die down. One day people may even become fond of the nasty new look – to the extent to which it is possible to be fond of the logo of an accountancy firm, that is.Now back to Gap.Once Marka Hansen, the company’s president for North America, got wind of the scale of the protest, she wrote a piece on The Huffington Post defending the “contemporary and current” new logo. Her post is a marvel for students of corporate language, with its “living and breathing”, its “alignings”, and its “journeys”. But mainly it is remarkable for its disingenuousness. Ms Hansen was surely feeling shock and awe at how badly her new logo had gone down, but claimed to be delighted that everyone felt so “passionate” about it.The chummy message that she simultaneously posted on the company’s Facebook page was even more frightening for its attempt to get down with the kidz and talk the right chirpy language through gritted teeth: “Thanks for everyone’s input on the new logo! We know this logo created a lot of buzz and we’re thrilled to see passionate debates unfolding! We love our version, but we’d like to see other ideas. Stay tuned for details in the next few days on this crowd sourcing project.”But even this didn’t work. The mob continued to show its passion by saying it hated the new design and, last Monday, she gave up.This time the tone was more like when Princess Diana had died. Ms Hansen spoke of the “outpouring of passion from customers” on the company’s old logo and solemnly announced that the letters would stay in the box after all.She should not have capitulated. By letting tweeters see the whites of her eyes, she has done other companies a disservice. Now that the mob has got its way on this, it is going to be harder for other companies to insist on their management’s right to manage.Listening to customers is one thing, when they are voting with their wallets. But company logos should not be designed democratically on Twitter. If managers allow themselves to be frightened of the tweeting mob, they will become emasculated, change will be even harder than it ever was, and the status quo will always prevail.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"
194;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-14T23:12:11Z;Gap eyes international market to lift sales;;Gap, the US clothing retailer, is looking to international markets and its online business for growth, as it faces sluggish consumer demand in a saturated home market.At an annual meeting on Thursday, the company said it aimed to double the percentage of sales from its international and online businesses, from 12 per cent of sales last year, to about 25 per cent by 2013.Gap reported annual sales of $14.2bn last year down from a peak of $16bn in 2005. It has seen a slight uptick in sales growth in the US this year under a turnround led by Glenn Murphy, chief executive.Mr Murphy told investors the retailer was “making the investments necessary to shift the balance of revenue over time to come increasingly from our online and international businesses”.The expansion would be driven in part by new e-commerce sites in China, Japan, Canada and western Europe, which it said should contribute to a doubling of online sales to about $2bn and operating income of $500m by 2015.Gap recently launched e-commerce businesses in Canada and the UK, which it is using as a base for Gap and Banana Republic brand sites to serve the rest of western Europe. It also added international shipping to about 80 countries to its main US site, which covers its five brands: Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime and Athleta.The retailer will shortly open its first four stores in China, and is launching an e-commerce business in the country with a local partner. It also said it plans to continue to expand its franchised stores, which it has used to establish a presence in emerging markets, including south-east Asia, eastern Europe and Russia, the Middle East and Latin America.Tom Wyatt, the head of Gap’s Old Navy stores, said the division was also considering launching outside the US. “We’re absolutely convinced that Old Navy as a value proposition makes sense worldwide,” he said.The drive to increase international sales comes a year after it was overtaken as the world’s largest speciality clothing retailer by Zara, the fast-fashion business owned by Spain’s Inditex. Gap executives see its e-commerce expertise as a competitive advantage against both Zara and Sweden’s H&M.Zara launched its first online business this year in western Europe.In contrast to its online and international plans, Gap said it expected to see “consistent modest growth” in its home market, where it has sought to target a new generation of “millennial” customers with relaunches of its core products and a less monolithic approach to design and marketing.It said it would not be running a Gap brand television campaign this Christmas, but would focus instead on mobile and online marketing.
195;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-12T19:32:22Z;Gap abandons logo overhaul;;Gap has reinstated its established blue and white square logo on its main US website, just seven days after unveiling a much-criticised redesign, in an unusually rapid corporate reaction to internet criticism.The proposed new logo – three black letters and a small blue square – provoked a storm of online abuse from both customers of the global clothing brand and graphic designers on blogs after it was unveiled on the site a week ago.Marka Hansen, head of the Gap brand in North America, said in a statement that Gap had now “made the decision not to use the new logo on its e-commerce website any further”, adding: “All roads were leading us back to the blue box.”A company note on Gap’s Facebook page said more directly: “OK. We’ve heard loud and clear that you don’t like the new logo.”The company initially responded to the row by saying it would seek alternative ideas from its fans and critics through a “crowd sourcing” project, an idea it has now also abandoned.The new logo was developed by Laird & Partners, a New York creative agency, as part of a broad overhaul of Gap’s logo. This began about two years ago under Ms Hansen, who reports to Glenn Murphy, Gap’s chief executive.In addition to the new logo, the effort has included changing the design and some graphical elements of the e-commerce site, an effort that would eventually have extended across all its stores and advertising.Adding to Gap’s public discomfort, the climbdown came ahead of Thursday’s meeting with Wall Street investors and analysts, where the company expects to discuss new sales growth initiatives, including efforts to extend its e-commerce business in western Europe and China, and opening its first Chinese stores.A Gap spokeswoman argued that the logo redesign sought to reflect recent changes at the brand that have included taking a less centralised approach to design and store design.Ms Hansen said of the reversal in direction that Gap had “learnt a lot in this process”, including the challenges of trying to “crowd source” ideas for the logo. Crowd sourcing involves requesting ideas from the online community.“We are clear that we did not go about this in the right way. We recognise that we missed the opportunity to engage with the online community. This wasn’t the right project at the right time for crowd sourcing.“There may be a time to evolve our logo, but if and when that time comes, we’ll handle it in a different way,” she said.Designers have compared the turnround with PepsiCo’s decision last year to abandon a redesign of its Tropicana fruit juice brand. Unlike Gap’s rapid response, PepsiCo’s reversal took four weeks and came after evidence that the new design had led to falls in supermarket sales of its juices.

Wu Yajun, 46, of Longfor Property, comes in second with $4.1bn and Chen Lihua, 69, of Fuhua International, a Hong Kong conglomerate, ranks third with $4bn.The richest non-Chinese is Spaniard Rosalia Mera of Zara, the fashion house, with $3.5bn, and two others who made their fortunes in fashion: Doris Fisher for Gap is eighth and Giuliana Benetton of Benetton is 11th.Oprah Winfrey, the US television show host, ranks ninth with $2.3bn.Nandani Lynton, of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, identified political and social factors for making a scrap paper lady from China richer than the doyennes of Zara, Gap, Benetton and Ebay.“Mao made an incredible difference when he said women hold up half the sky, since then it has been assumed that all women in China will work,” Ms Lynton said.Chinese women are also among the most ambitious on earth, according to a study from the Centre for Work-Life Policy in New York, which found 76 per cent of women in China aspired to top jobs, compared with 52 per cent in the US.Working mothers in China and other Bric countries “are able to aim high, in part because they have more shoulders to lean on than their American and European peers when it comes to childcare”, the centre noted. With an average work week of 71 hours for Chinese women, cheap childcare is essential, and in China is often provided by grandparents – four for every only child.Nandani Lynton noted that it was not just the availability of cheap or free childcare but also the absence of any stigma attached to using it that helped Chinese women dominate the global rich lists.Still, compared to Chinese men, women still lag behind. According to Hurun, only 11 per cent of the richest people in China are women and the average wealth of China’s top 50 richest women is only a third that of the top 50 richest men.

Unlike Gap’s rapid response, PepsiCo’s reversal took four weeks, and came after evidence that the new design had led to falls in supermarket sales of its juices.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, this year battled through a highly visible surge in internet comment from customers when it relaunched its Pampers nappies.Its executives argued that the volume of online criticism was consistent with reactions to previous evolutions in its products.Dorothy Wolden of Creative Intuition, an Arizona-based design company, said she initially “kept thinking it must be a joke”.“I guess we just don’t understand in the first place why they had to change what they already had,” she said.“The brand equity that they had with the old logo was just tremendous.”

Initial jobless claims last week fell 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 445,000, compared with predictions that they would edge up.The ADP employer services data showed a fall in employment in August, taking the wind out of the sails of the recent stock rally.But investors were focusing on the government-compiled employment monthly figure, the non-farm payrolls, due to be announced on Friday. “Everybody is waiting for the jobs report out tomorrow for a better read on the labour market and, secondly, we’re looking for greater clarity from the Fed as to its next steps,” said Paul Bellew, chief economist for Nationwide Insurance.He added that traders had been watching closely the movement of the dollar ever since the Fed had signalled the potential for further quantitative easing.Retailers reported that same-store sales in September rose 2.8 per cent, compared with an average estimate for a 2.1 per cent gain.The S&P 500 retailers index rose 0.4 per cent and the wider S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was up 0.3 per cent.September sales include the end of the key back-to-school season and many shops aimed at younger consumers beat expectations.Abercrombie & Fitch surged 8.9 per cent to $42.03 after reporting a 13 per cent rise in sales, shoe and accessory retailer Buckle jumped 10.7 per cent to $29.55 and sports clothing retailer Zumiez gained 8.2 per cent to $24.66. American Eagle Outfitters soared 8.1 per cent to $16.23 after it raised its third-quarter forecast for earnings from continuing operations to at least 27 cents per share, above the average estimate of 25 cents.Limited Brands advanced 3.8 per cent to $28.64 after same-store sales at its underwear retailer Victoria’s Secret rose 12 per cent, significantly more than the 4.1 per cent gain forecast.The chain also raised its outlook for October, saying same-store sales would rise in the mid-single digit percentages.JC Penney spent most of the day in negative territory in spite of beating expectations, but surged in the late afternoon up 9.1 per cent to $31.64.But some retail stocks suffered after reporting their September sales.Gap lost 3 per cent to $18.12, after sales were dragged down by poor performance at its Old Navy stores, and Bebe Stores dropped 7.9 per cent to $6.44 after same-store sales fell 4.7 per cent.Alcoa posted its quarterly results after the closing bell.Shares dipped 1.4 per cent to $12.20 during the session but after the miner beat expectations on both the top and bottom line, shares crept up 2.9 per cent in after-hours trading.Pepsi fell 3 per cent to $66.10 after it posted earnings in line with analysts’ expectations but reduced its earnings forecast for the full year from a rise of between 11 and 13 per cent, to a gain of between 11 and 12 per cent.Hotel chain Marriott International also issued a forecast below some analysts’ expectations. The hotelier said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of 33-36 cents per share, below the 37 cent average estimate, and its full-year profit projection also missed the consensus forecast.Marriott shares lost 5.8 per cent to $35.67.Elsewhere, Adobe surged 11.5 per cent to $28.69 after it was reported that the software maker’s chief executive had met with the chief executive of Microsoft, sparking speculation about a possible merger.The stock was temporarily halted by the circuit breakers introduced after May’s “flash crash”.Microsoft shares edged up 0.4 per cent to $24.53.
199;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-10-07T14:42:15Z;Late back-to-school buying lifts retail sales;;US chain retailers reported broadly better-than-expected store sales during September, supported by last minute back-to-school and college shopping that boosted teen and youth retailers in particular.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales rose 2.7 per cent in September. He cited strong back-to-school selling “coupled with attractive fall fashions, aggressive promotions and a near-record September stock market rise” as factors supporting the performance.Limited Brands, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works, reported a 12 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, with margins up “significantly” as the company avoided the price-cutting promotions seen last year.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, said same store sales rose 4.8 per cent. Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the back-to-school period was “one of our most successful in years”. He highlighted the performance of its Material Girl teen clothing collection, a joint venture with Madonna, and its American Rag clothing for teen boys.JC Penney said its sales rose 5.1 per cent, ahead of expectations. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales up 3 per cent. Kohl’s said on Wednesday that it would increase its temporary holiday staff hiring this year by 20 per cent, reflecting new store additions and increasing confidence in holiday demand.Luxury and high-end stores also performed well, with Neiman Marcus reporting same store sales up 4.7 per cent, Nordstrom up 7.5 per cent and Saks up 6.5 per cent.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the strong performance of higher-end spenders was “especially encouraging for the economy and the upcoming holiday-shopping season because the top 20 per cent of households by income account for nearly 40 per cent of total consumption”.Several teen and youth fashion retailers who have struggled over the past year with sluggish discretionary spending also fared better than expected. Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 13 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Zumiez, a teen retailer, said its same store sales rose 17 per cent, and raised its earnings guidance for the quarter. Buckle and Aeropostale both saw comparable sales up 3 per cent.But Target, the discount retailer, said its 1.3 per cent increase in comparable sales was lower than it had expected, despite being pleased with its back-to-school performance. Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, reported a 1 per cent drop in same store sales, saying that September had been more challenging that it had expected.Sales at its Gap stores in North America fell 1 per cent, despite efforts to draw sales with a large marketing focus on black denim pants that the company said would increase inventory levels. Gap’s lower-price Old Navy stores reported a 5 per cent drop.Costco, the warehouse club, said on Wednesday that its same store sales rose 5 per cent, also slightly above Wall Street’s expectations, although US store sales excluding fuel were slightly below forecasts, at 2 per cent.

JP Morgan Chase declined 1.4 per cent to $38.41 and Bank of America lost 1.2 per cent to $13.11.But AIG rose 0.4 per cent to $37.45 after the bailed-out insurer said its board would meet later in the day to discuss an exit plan for the US Treasury.Citigroup gained 1 per cent to $3.92 after the US Treasury said it plans to sell a portion of $2.2bn of its Citigroup debt securities.The S&P 500 technology index was lifted for much of the day by Hewlett-Packard raising its forecast for 2011 but it ended the day flat. Intel fell 1.4 per cent to $19.24 and Microsoft declined 0.7 per cent to $24.50.Hewlett-Packard predicting 12 to 14 per cent growth in earnings to between between $5.05 and $5.15 per share compared with the current consensus estimates of about $4.99 per share.The technology company said it was adding thousands to its salesforce and forecast a 5 per cent to 7 per cent rise in revenue.However, the company did not announce a new chief executive, which many analysts hoped it would. Its shares rose 2.2 per cent to $42.53.Standard Microsystems, which makes circuits and systems software for personal computers, consumer electronics and the industrial and car markets, reduced its forecast for the third quarter, saying that earnings will be no more than 43 cents per share. The average analyst estimate was 45 cents, but its shares rose 1.3 per cent to $22.78.The oil price rose after inventories fell last week and pushed up energy stocks by 0.7 per cent.Natural gas producer EQT Corp gained 4.6 per cent to $35.48 after it announced strong production figures from two wells in Pennsylvania. Cabot Oil and Gas added 5.1 per cent to $30.19.US-listed shares in BP rose 1.8 per cent to $40.00 after it said it had ousted Andy Inglis, the head of its exploration division, and announced plans to restructure its safety operations.The oil company’s new chief executive, Robert Dudley, is set to take over on Friday.In industrials, aircraft manufacturer Boeing rose 2.3 per cent to $65.97 after the Pentagon said the company had received a contract to build 124 Super Hornet and Growler fighter jets, valued at $5.3bn.Fedex, the delivery company often seen as a barometer for global trade, rose 2 per cent to $86.37. Fred Smith, chief executive, said he was “very bullish” on the outlook for next year, saying it was seeing a rebound in demand for express shipping and that it intends to raise ship-ping rates.In earnings news, Family Dollar Stores beat expectations as more shoppers turned to the discount chain for bargains.In its fourth quarter, earnings per share were 56 cents compared with forecasts of 51 cents.The retailer raised its expectations for its first quarter in 2011, with predicted earnings per share between 55 cents and 60 cents.Following retailers from Nordstrom to Gap, which have all recently announced share buy-backs, Family Dollar said it may repurchase up to $750m in shares.

201;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-09-13T21:19:26Z;India’s cotton industry pleads for export ban;Tight global supplies after losses in Pakistan;India’s textile industry has urged Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, to ban cotton exports until January, complaining that local mills face serious domestic scarcity and spiralling prices after excessive exports.India, the second-biggest cotton exporter after the US, first restricted exports in April. The plea from textile companies comes amid tight global supplies after losses in Pakistan and a week after New Delhi said it would permit the duty-free export of up to 5.5m bales, a relatively small volume, from October 1.Indian authorities are due to meet on Tuesday to reconsider the decision.The prospect of a further cutback in Indian supplies helped lift New York cotton futures to their highest level since 1995. ICE December cotton rose 2.1 per cent to 93.17 cents a pound.“It is significant,” said Ron Lawson of LOGIC Advisors, a commodities researcher. “It turns all the buying back to the US.”The rise in wholesale cotton prices has led textile companies in the US and Europe to warn about rising clothing prices next year.While forecasters expect a record Indian cotton harvest this year, the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, the trade body, warned that the crop might fall short of expectations due to heavy monsoon rains in growing regions. The industry body appealed to New Delhi for the imposition of a Rs10,000 ($216) tax on all cotton exports, whenever they begin.“We are facing a crisis of a large magnitude,” said Shishir Jaipuria, confederation chairman and managing director of Ginni Filaments, which produces garments for western brands such as Benetton.“If cotton is exported unabated, the industry will have to reduce capacity and there will be large unemployment. Only the cotton exportable surplus should leave,” he said.In regulating its export flow, New Delhi has tried to balance the interests of its textile industry – which employs an estimated 35m people – and its 5m cotton farmers.“There is hardly any cotton available in the market,” said S.P. Oswal, chairman of Vardhman Textiles, which makes clothes for retailers such as Gap, Esprit and H&M. “Mills will have to cut production. How does a cotton-surplus country create a disadvantage for its own employment?”Elsewhere in commodities markets on Monday, base metals rallied on the back of better-than-expected economic data in China, the world’s biggest importer of metals such as copper.Beijing said its industrial production accelerated in August to 13.9 per cent growth year on year, up from 13.4 per cent in July.On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months’ time rose to $7,630 a tonne, up 1.7 per cent, and analysts say copper prices could surpass a record high of nearly $9,000 a tonne, set in mid-2008, as soon as next year.Tin prices hit a fresh two-year high, trading at $22,300 a tonne for the first time since August 2008. The metal is only 13 per cent shy of its all-time high of $25,500 a tonne set in May 2008.Nickel, lead and zinc had posted gains of about 3 per cent.Additional reporting by Gregory Meyer in New York

The S&P 500 financials index rose 1.1 per cent and JPMorgan climbed 2.2 per cent to $39.12.Goldman Sachs shares jumped on reports that KKR, Perella Weinberg, and BlackRock were all in talks to hire Goldman’s US proprietary traders.But shares later gave up much of their gains after it was revealed that Goldman faces a large fine in the UK as part of an investigation into its Abacus investment and closed up 1.6 per cent at $147.54.Shares in KKR were flat at $10.25 and BlackRock was up 0.8 per cent to $151.94.In industrials, Boeing gained 1.7 per cent to $64.50, Caterpillar advanced 1.5 per cent to $70.74 and Textron added 2.4 per cent to $18.66.The energy sector was up 0.9 per cent. US-listed shares in BP rose 3.2 per cent to $38.37 after it released its internal investigation into the causes of the rig blast that led to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.The oil company blamed “a sequence of failures” for April’s disaster, including mistakes it said were made by Transocean, which leased the rig to BP, and Halliburton, which was responsible for cementing the well. US-listed shares in Transocean were higher by 1.3 per cent to $53.74 and Halliburton rose 1.2 per cent to $30.21.Shares in Anadarko Petroleum, which owns 25 per cent of the well, gained 4.2 per cent to $52.39.The retail sales index rose 3 per cent last week, showing sales at department and chain stores in the final leg of the back-to-school season had been higher than in the same period last year. The S&P 500 retailers index gained 0.8 per cent.But Talbots suffered after it became the latest company to beat expectations on earnings but fall short on revenue. The retailer fell 1.3 per cent to $10.97, after sinking as much as 8 per cent. Profit was boosted by tighter inventory management, but sales fell 1.3 per cent to $300.7m.The company’s forecast for its third-quarter profit was also lower than analysts had expected, at between 22 cents and 28 cents per share, compared with a consensus estimate of 30 cents.In contrast, Phillips-Van Heusen raised its full-year forecast from an upper level of $3.65 a share to as much as $3.80. It reported a net loss in the second quarter, but, excluding costs to acquire the Tommy Hilfiger brand, beat earnings expectations.

The financial sector led the month’s fallers, down 7.9 per cent in August, followed by industrials, which fell 7.3 per cent and information technology stocks, which declined 7.2 per cent. Telecoms and Utilities were the month’s only risers.Investors were disappointed on Tuesday after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Committee showed members would only consider large-scale asset purchases if the outlook for the economy weakened “appreciably”.Markets had been cheered on Friday when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke suggested a greater willingness to act.“It is clear that the focus of discussion at the FOMC is on what further measures may be implemented to support the economy, and that those arguing that a “do nothing” approach is the best strategy are increasingly in the minority,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. “Still, the minutes reveal enough difference of opinion to suggest that nothing substantial is in the cards anytime soon barring a complete economic collapse.”Before the minutes, US equities had flipped between positive and negative territory in response to mixed economic data.Both the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index and the S&P/Case Shiller home prices index were slightly better than expected but the Chicago purchasing manager’s index came in just under economists’ estimates.The consumer confidence figures dominated, cheering investors for much of the day, but the S&P 500 retailers closed flat with earlier risers Gapdown 0.1 per cent at $16.89 but JC Penney climbing 2.5 per cent to $19.98.The homebuilders also gave up earlier gains to end down 0.1 per cent.

204;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-08-29T20:19:43Z;Online retailing;Selling consumer information is far easier than using it;Selling involves a whole messy business of making, stocking and shipping products efficiently behind the scenes. But at the heart of retailing remains a simple task: show customers product at a price they will pay. The internet was supposed to make the task easier.It has sometimes worked brilliantly. The ability to target a “long tail” of niche interests has helped to keep Amazon growing at a rapid clip, although clever segmentation proved a disaster for the subprime lenders that were partly responsible for inspiring the idea of the long tail in the first place. And the ease of tracking and aggregating on the internet is still tantalising. The great excitement about Facebook comes from the potential access to personal information, even more than the enormous number of subscribers.Still, the most up-to-date methods are largely the extension of old tricks. UK-based retailer Tesco, for instance, began collecting information for what is now one of the largest databases of consumer behaviour in 1993.Indeed, many start-up darlings use tried-and-tested approaches to selling. Groupon, part owned by Facebook investor Digital Sky Technologies, simply sends its e-mail subscribers daily discounts for local businesses. The recent nationwide Groupon offer for Gap was just a coupon in electronic form. Woot.com, purchased by Amazon in June for a reported $110m, specialises in advertising one new deal every day. Customers of Gilt Groupe race to grab bargain-priced fashion on weekdays at noon.

205;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US stocks fall as recovery fears weigh;;US stocks fell today after fears about the pace of the US economic recovery continued to weigh on investor sentiment.By midday, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 per cent at 1,063.91, falling 1 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.2 per cent to 10,151.78, lower by 1.1 per cent on the week, and the Nasdaq was 0.9 per cent lower at 2,160.09, losing 0.2 per cent over the five days.Wall Street followed global equity markets, suffering from a flight from risk sparked by weak manufacturing data from the Philly Fed and worse-than-expected US initial jobless claims figures released on Thursday. All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 slid, with energy and industrials heading the falls.Over the week, the energy sector suffered the most, losing 2.9 per cent as it followed the oil price down. Financials and industrials stocks suffered because of concerns about the economy, and mergers and acquisitions news from Intel and McAfee to BHP Billiton and PotashCorp failed to cheer investors.As the earnings season draws to a close, computer makers Dell and Hewlett-Packard reported their results after the closing bell on Thursday.Dell’s earnings and revenue came in better than expected and the technology company reiterated its full-year guidance, saying it expected demand from corporate customers to remain steady in the coming months. Dell dropped 1.1 per cent to $11.91.Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest technology company by revenue, released pre-announced results and said its strategy remained intact following the departure of chief executive Mark Hurd. Its shares, which have dropped about 12 per cent since Mr Hurd left, fell 2.9 per cent to $39.57.Retailers continued to report mixed results and Gap and Ann Taylor announced share buy-backs.Gap reported earnings per share of 36 cents in the second quarter compared with average estimates of 35 cents. Its Banana Republic and Old Navy chains saw a rebound in sales, but same-store sales at its namesake shops continued to slide.Gap shares fell 3.7 per cent to $17.05 in spite of the board authorising a new $750m share buy-back.Also in clothing retail, net sales at Ann Taylor Stores missed the consensus forecast of $502.8m as its Loft-branded stores suffered the most. The shares fell 0.5 per cent to $15.39 after the retailer said it had increased a share buy-back plan to $400m.Hormel Foods, which makes Spam and MegaMex Foods products, was almost flat at $43.38 after it beat earnings and revenue expectations and the company raised its full-year forecast.Marvell Technology, which makes processors for BlackBerry phones, posted a second-quarter profit in line with analyst expectations. Its shares soared 9.1 per cent to $16.27.
206;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-08-18T19:38:18Z;Asian labour militancy on the rise;;Bangladeshi garment workers, who make clothes for western brands such as H&M, Gap and Marks & Spencer, greeted a recent 80 per cent pay rise by rampaging angrily through the capital Dhaka burning cars and looting shops.For the world’s lowest- paid garment workers, the increase in the minimum wage, effective from November, takes their pay from $23 to $43 (€33, £27.50) a month. It was their first pay rise for four years, a period of soaring food and fuel prices. However, the workers were enraged that Dhaka had not agreed to the $75 a month they had demanded.“This is not enough for the survival of workers and their families,” said Amirul Haque Amin, president of Bangladesh’s National Garment Workers’ Federation, which has about 23,000 members. “Living costs – including food, clothes, shelter and medical care – are going higher and higher.”Bangladeshi authorities have since arrested three prominent labour rights activists and charged them with inciting unrest, which they deny.But the anger among the country’s workers is a wake-up call for global retailers expecting to escape rising labour costs and strikes in China by shifting more production to other Asian manufacturing centres.While starting from a cheaper base than China, Asian industrial hubs such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia are also facing mounting labour unrest and intense upward pressure on wages as prices for food and other essentials rise.“I don’t see very many low-cost countries in the region where there is not pressure for higher wages,” says Ifty Islam, managing partner of Bangladesh-based Asian Tiger Capital Partners. “The ability of employers to pay very low wages is diminishing.”Demands for better pay across Asia reflect improving job opportunities in economies that are growing faster than their western markets.“A lot of growth and dynamism is happening in Asia and that is putting upward pressure on wages,” says Mr Islam.In Cambodia, Phnom Penh recently raised the minimum wage by 21 per cent– from $50 a month to $61. That was below what the more activist of Cambodia’s 273 unions demanded, although a three-day, industry-wide strike did not materialise.Vietnam recorded 200 strikes last year by workers hit by inflation of 9 per cent. In April, for example, nearly 10,000 workers walked out of a Taiwan-owned shoe factory, demanding better pay.In Indonesia – where powerful trade unions with millions of members play a crucial role in negotiating with employers – minimum wages, set by regional authorities, have been increasing.In 2008, Jakarta raised the local minimum wage by 10 per cent to nearly $100 a month, although wages in the country’s remoter regions are half that.Yet Indonesia has also recorded a spate of strikes at textile factories, including a one-day stoppage last month in Bandung, where 40,000 workers from various companies walked out in protest against rising electricity prices.“Prices are skyrocketing, and many of our members are breadwinners and have kids to be sent to school,” says Mochammad Papon, head of the union representing garment workers, mostly women, from 14 textile factories in West Java, which is planning to strike for higher wages next week.In India, too, Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone maker, Bosch, the German car parts manufacturer, South Korea’s Hyundai, Volvo and countless local companies have all faced rising industrial unrest.But nowhere is workers’ rage as palpable as in Bangladesh, where even Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the prime minister, called the current minimum wage “not only insufficient, but inhuman”.Local food prices have risen about 31 per cent since the last minimum wage increase in 2006 – before which workers went for 12 years without any adjustment at all. Nazma Akter, president of the Sommilito Garment Workers’ Association, says workers are “earning money to try to survive. But they hardly survive. Their daily needs . . . are very expensive.”Factory owners call the new minimum wage generous in the current global market, but Korshed Alam, a Dhaka-based labour rights activist, says workers’ purchasing power has eroded sharply since the 1990s. “Their anger is quite justified,” he says.However, Dhaka is sensitive to the interests of garment factory owners, of whom 29 sit in the 300-seat parliament, while many other lawmakers have stakes in garment factories. Critics say those interests leave Dhaka unwilling genuinely to engage with labour groups.“There are no industrial relations,” says Mr Alam. “The whole attitude is arrogant and feudal. Owners and government think they are helping the workers. The workers are not treated like workers – they are treated like beggars.”Additional reporting by Anthony Deutsch in Jakarta and Tim Johnston in Phnom Penh
207;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-08-16T18:04:55Z;American Apparel’s deteriorating fortunes mount up;;American Apparel, the troubled US clothing manufacturer and retailer, has an “urgent need” for experienced quality control inspectors at its factory in Los Angeles. It also needs industrial sewing machine operators, mechanics, pattern-makers and a fabric plotter/marker.The job listings on the company website promise “some of the highest wages in the apparel industry”. But they also reflect a crisis in the group’s unique made-in-downtown-LA business model that has been a central part of American Apparel’s rapid expansion.Under Dov Charney, its 41-year old chief executive, the company has created a global chain of more than 280 retail stores in 20 countries in only seven years.Its public profile – which rivals brands with sales far above its 2009 revenues of $558m – has been raised by controversy over Mr Charney’s style, which has included talking openly about his own views on sex in the office, and promoting the sale of sexually explicit magazines in the company’s stores.Wendy Liebmann, of WSL retail consulting, says the brand “did what no one else did” by specialising “in everyday casual wear all based upon stretchy material and T-shirts,” with “a brand that stands for easy, casual, sexy, in-your-face”, under its “made in downtown LA” tag.In spite of facing doubts over the funding of its highly leveraged business, the company weathered the worst of the downturn that followed the Wall Street collapse of 2008. Initially its sales held up better than many competitors and, in April last year, it secured an $80m long-term financing deal with Lion Capital, the private equity fund.But American Apparels’ fortunes have deteriorated sharply since it was required last summer by US immigration inspectors to dismiss about 1,500 workers in Los Angeles – or about a quarter of the workforce – because they lacked proper work documents.In March its shares fell sharply after it warned that it could not give earnings or revenue guidance for the current year because of factors including “the substantial impact of the reduced manufacturing efficiency”.Preliminary first-quarter results, delivered in May, showed its quarterly loss had risen to $17.6m from $3.9m. Comparable sales at its stores fell 10 per cent, in part because of product supply shortages. It carried $83.3m in debt at the end of 2009, and is paying annual interest of 17 per cent on the $65m it owes Lion Capital. Its shares, trading at $4 a year ago, have dropped to less than $1.50.Mr Charney told investors in May that the company would return to profitable growth and return to “a positive place”. But a statement last week on the company’s second-quarter performance said it expected further losses from lower sales and higher costs, including higher manufacturing outlays.Deloitte & Touche, which was brought in as auditors after the deal with Lion Capital, resigned last month, saying that it was seeking information from the company that could affect the accuracy of its 2009 results.The company has repeatedly acknowledged shortcomings in its internal financial controls, such as a lack of adequately trained accounting staff in its international business. And, last week, it warned it would again be unable to file its second quarterly results on time, the eighth delayed filing since it went public in a reverse merger in December 2007. It has yet to file audited first-quarter results, bringing it to the brink of being delisted.The company’s management has played down its problems, with Mr Charney stressing its pursuit of sales growth through new products. It has started selling more “preppy” looking products, such as $58 button-down shirts, and a $62 crew necked sweater, alongside its “hipster” basics.But moving beyond the simple T-shirts, leggings and underwear will also involve more direct competition with rivals such as Urban Outfitters, J. Crew and Gap, which have developed, low-cost offshore supply chains, and who have greater economies of scale. “Now, all of a sudden, they change their competitive set,” says Ms Liebmann.Howard Davidowitz, a veteran retail consultant and investment banker, says the company needs a further inflow of funding to stabilise its finances.Such a move could be accompanied by Mr Charney standing down, as any interested party may well want a higher degree of control than Lion’s arrangement. Mr Charney owns 53 per cent of the stock and, while Lion holds warrants that could give it control of 18 per cent of the company, it is required to vote with Mr Charney on board decisions.However, Mr Davidowitz adds, “the company may lose a lot [from a departure] because the creativity that they have could come from all this craziness”.
208;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-08-08T21:47:10Z;Look east, young unionists, for inspiration;John Lloyd on the growing prowess of unions in Asia;"Workers at a garment factory in Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital, went on strike at the end of last month in protest against the dismissal of one of their union officials. The factory produces for Gap, Benetton and Adidas, whose customers have long benefited from low-cost Asian labour. But union militancy in Cambodia’s textile sector can now count some successes: the minimum wage went up by $11 a month in July – less than the unions wanted, but enough to end the wave of strikes.The large, even heroic, tasks of protecting rights might be declining sharply in developed nations. But they are increasingly common in the catch-up world – especially in China and south east Asia. In many recently (or still) communist countries, labour remains exploited and union activism is badly needed.China is the most eye-catching example. Strikes swept through foreign-owned companies – including Honda, Hyundai, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Toyota – in the south of the country in June, in spite of heavy attention by police. Unofficial as they were, they worked. Party leaders, including Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, called for improved wages and conditions, especially for the low paid and precarious migrant workers, who have formed much of the work force in areas such as Guangdong.Mr Wen told an audience in Beijing that migrants’ work “is glorious and should be respected by society at large. Migrant workers should be cared for, protected and respected.” However, as Simon Clarke of Warwick University, who studies unions in Russia and China, stresses, independent unions in China and south east Asia are often fleeting, while membership remains hazardous. Official unions, unused to militancy, even try to suppress activism.A similar problem is true in Russia, where the legacy of unions wholly dominated – indeed, created – by the Communist party lingers. In post-communist Russia, control by the party has been replaced by control by the state. Established unions suffer from a pervasive culture of poor civic and political activism. As Simon Clarke puts it, Russia’s labour movement “is completely under the thumb of [prime minister] Vladimir Putin.”Yet even if Russia isn’t following suit, the growing strength of unions in Asia is a welcome move; one which will put pressure on the regimes to increase domestic consumption, raise skill levels and develop social and welfare services, especially for migrant workers. True, neither the remaining Communist parties (as in China and Vietnam) nor the old official unions will want to relinquish control that has served them well. Even so, bolstered by newer campaigning unions, the economic struggle can be waged hopefully.Success is a much fainter hope in the west, where unions suffer from a past seen as noble and a present seen as irrelevant. But now with austerity as the posture of choice, unions scramble to reassert themselves. British unions are planning an autumn of discontent with demonstrations, special conferences and possible strikes. That said, French public sector workers, British Airways cabin crew and Greek workers in any sector – all have tested the resolve of their governments and none have succeeded.Indeed, in rich countries unions continue to weaken, especially in the private sector. Even in Germany, where co-operation with employers has ensured power at corporate level, they have been helpless to stop loss of income, to cancel cuts, or to change the government’s mind on raising the retirement age to 67. At the conference in June of the federal unions (DGB) delegates seemed to agree with the centre-right chancellor Angela Merkel – who addressed the union to mild applause rather than catcalls – that “very hard years lie ahead”. Michael Sommer, the DGB chairman, lauded the government’s commitment to social equilibrium – which has meant, in practice, acceptance of layoffs and wage cuts.Yet they might also raise their sights: for if they are unlikely to succeed in their traditional search for better wages they might fare better by returning to the moral force they mobilised in early years. Vast discrepancies in earnings between the bulk of salary earners and those at the top of the corporate sectors can unite ethics and polemics. Labour movements have a chance to sway public opinion and in so doing regain a status they lost with their draining of members and shrinking of ambitions.If not, the declining unions of the developed world may begin to look jealously at the achievements of their less privileged equivalents. “The union makes us strong” was ever the slogan of workers’ movements. But the contrasting strengths of unions east and west illuminate one basic fact: unions do well for their members in rising economies, but in more austere times, moral suasion is their best – and perhaps only – card.The writer is an FT columnist"
209;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-08-08T20:11:38Z;Best Buy taps promotions into smartphones;;Best Buy, the largest US electronics retailer, has become the first leading US retailer to start sending special offers and deals to its customers’ smartphones when they walk into one of its stores.In a sign of how the new generation of internet-connected phones is set to transform traditional retailing, a Best Buy store in San Francisco has deployed a location-based marketing tool developed by Shopkick, a California-based start-up.Customers who activate the Shopkick application on their phones will automatically receive “kickbucks” credits just for entering the store that can be traded for benefits including gift cards, computer gaming credits or music downloads from Best Buy’s Napster service. They will also receive special in-store offers from the retailer.Best Buy will eventually also be able to use the system to send participants in its loyalty scheme promotional offers that can be customised to reflect their shopping history and interests.Richard Rommel of Best Buy said that “the convergence of location technology and rewards to personalise” shopping was at the heart of the retailer’s current business strategy.Credits or price reductions are then automatically deducted from the bill at the store’s checkouts.Best Buy, with more than 1,000 stores in the US, is expected to test the system at stores in other cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Macy’s, the largest department store chain in the US by sales, is also taking part in the launch of Shopkick.Unlike mobile marketing systems based on a phone’s GPS signal, the Shopkick application responds to an audio signal transmitted in the store. As a result it is far more accurate than GPS-based alternatives which can be off by a few hundred yards, and which raise potential privacy concerns because they are automatically activated.“We can tell whether you are inside or outside the door,” said Cyriac Roeding, who co-founded Shopkick last year.The past year has seen the emergence of a number of location-based social-network systems with marketing applications, including FourSquare, GoWalla and Loopt. They allow marketers to offer credits or local promotions to phone users who actively “check in” to locations such as coffee shops and bars. Starbucks, Burger King and Gap have all run reward schemes linked to “geotagging” applications, in spite of low levels of adoption.In-store mobile shopping applications are likely to become increasingly important to retailers as they seek to close deals with shoppers equipped with smartphones that can search and compare prices at rival stores and online.Separately, Levi Strauss, the denim clothing company, is to use camera-phone readable tags in the in-store marketing for the imminent relaunch of its women’s jeans business in the US. Customers who use their smartphones to scan the black and white pixellated QR tags will be directed to a YouTube video explaining the jeans’ new fit system.QR tags, widely used in Japan, have so far largely been used in the US in advertising in fashion magazines, rather than in stores.
210;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-08-05T22:52:25Z;US store sales data give subdued picture;;US chain retailers’ July sales reflected the fitful nature of the recovery, with data released on Thursday showing pockets of strength offset by an overall picture of subdued demand.Several stores that hold the middle ground in the US retail landscape did well, with Macy’s, the largest US department store by revenues, reporting a 7.3 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Limited, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, saw same-store sales rise 7 per cent and raised guidance for the second quarter, as did Kohl’s, a mid-cost department store, whose sales rose 4.6 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said its same-store sales rose 1 per cent, with continued strength at its lower-cost Old Navy stores, and growth at Banana Republic. But sales at its Gap brand stores fell 6 per cent. Gap also raised earnings guidance for the quarter.JC Penney, a mid-price department store, reported its comparable sales fell 0.6 per cent.Dillards and Bon-Ton, two regional department store chains, reported comparable sales falls.Saks, the luxury department store, said comparable sales rose 6.4 per cent, while its rival Nordstrom reported 7.6 per cent growth.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 3 per cent, missing the 3.2 per cent forecast based on Wall Street analysts’ views. The index was pulled down by weakness at teen and youth retailers.TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded clothing, also saw sluggish sales growth of 2 per cent, after seeing much stronger growth from bargain-hunting shoppers during the recession.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the subdued overall picture came despite stepped up discounting and promotions by retailers.
211;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-07-27T20:48:08Z;Consumer confidence data weigh on Wall St;;"US equities nudged down on Tuesday after worse than expected consumer confidence figures erased early gains made after positive earnings reports.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,113.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,537.69 and the Nasdaq closed 0.4 per cent lower at 2,288.25.Investor sentiment was dampened by the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index for July, which said confidence had hit a five-month low. The index fell from 54.3, a revised figure for June, to 50.4, below forecasts of 51.“Generally nobody wants to see a jobless recovery and the consumer confidence number indicates that there’s still uncertainty out there even though earnings numbers have been generally very very good,” said Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners.“The everyday consumer doesn’t necessarily see all that, they see that their neighbour is unemployed.”The S&P 500 retail sector led the fallers, down by 1.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary sector fell 1.2 per cent. Best Buy was down 3.9 per cent to $35.45; Urban Outfitters lost 4.8 per cent to $32.97 and Gap fell 3.9 per cent to $18.29.Before the open, data on the housing market showed a rise in property values of 4.6 per cent in May, compared with a predicted rise of 3.9 per cent. But the S&P 500 homebuilders index fell 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 Financials index edged up 0.1 per cent after positive earnings from European banks UBS and Deutsche Bank and news that new tighter Basel III capital rules would be delayed. US-listed stocks of UBS rose 8.9 per cent to $16.51 and Deutsche Bank’s US shares were up 2.8 per cent to $68.06. Bank of America rose 0.3 per cent to $14.19 and Citigroup was up 0.2 per cent to $4.16.Positive earnings news from the industrials and materials sectors raised hopes of industrial recovery in early trading.DuPont reported its second-quarter profit nearly tripled because of a surge in sales and volume across all five divisions. The company said net income rose to $1.17bn, or $1.26 per share, from $417m, or 41 cents per share, for the same period a year earlier. The chemicals group raised its 2010 earnings forecast to a range of $2.90 to $3.05 per share, excluding exceptional items, from a previous forecast $2.50 to $2.70. Shares rose 3.6 per cent to $40.38.Industrials reporting included Fluor Corp, the engineering and construction group, which said it might reach a record backlog of projects this year because of demand from the energy industry, helped by new awards of $9.3bn. It reported better than expected second-quarter net income, which fell to 87 cents per share compared with analysts’ estimates of 93 cents per share. Shares rose 2.6 per cent to $49.10.Cummins, which makes engines and generator equipment, added to the picture of a rise in industrial activity as it reported better than expected quarterly results and raised its full-year forecast. Sales outside the US, which make up two-thirds of its revenue, rose 51 per cent in the quarter. Shares rose 2 per cent to $79.43. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence group, fell a fraction to $74.87 after it posted a 12 per cent jump in profit and increased its full-year forecast.But the materials sector was pushed down by a more negative mood in steel. US Steel Corporation said it was seeing slower order rates in spite of doubling its sales to $4.68bn this quarter. It posted an unexpected second-quarter loss because of revaluing a $1.4bn loan made to a European loan unit. Shares fell 6.4 per cent to $45.76. The negative outlook pushed AK Steel Holding Corp down 4.7 per cent to $14.49 in spite of reporting better than expected earnings.Gold producers fell as the metal hit an 11-week low because of the rally in equities. Newmont Mining Corporation fell 4 per cent to $55.78. Goldcorp dropped
3.7 per cent to $38.82.US-listed shares in BP fell 1.7 per cent to $38.00 after it reported a $17bn loss for the second quarter, after making a pre-tax provision of $32.2bn for the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It plans to sell assets valued at $30bn to meet the costs."

However, continuing claims dropped to 4.41m from 4.63m last week, significantly better than the 4.6m consensus estimate.“We’re getting a lot of mixed signals at the moment,” said Andrew Neale, partner and portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners. “The data are still not looking great. Earnings estimates have been cut so I am not surprised if companies are beating the reduced forecasts.”Volumes were relatively low, suggesting a lack of broad investor conviction.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent to 1,070.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.2 per cent to 10,138.99 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent to 2,175.40.Same-store sales for the past month from the big retail chains came in mixed on Thursday, helped by warm weather and promotions around the Memorial day holiday. June is traditionally a clearance month for retailers.Macy’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brandsall beat analysts’ average estimates.Macy’s rose 3 per cent to $18.44, Limited Brands rose 2.2 per cent to $24.21, JC Penney advanced 6.7 per cent to $23.24 and Abercrombie was up 7.8 per cent to $35.45. Nordstrom fell 0.2 per cent to $33.69.However, Costco, Target and Gap came in below expectations.Target dropped 0.8 per cent to $50.02 and Gap was down 7.6 per cent at $18.22. Costco still rose 2.6 per cent to $55.71.“June [figures] were lacklustre at best,” said Robert Samuels, senior retail analyst at Phoenix Equities. “Given that retail has significantly underperformed the market over the past month, we think a lot of the bad news is already in most of these names. However, we think a round of earnings cuts is in store for the back half and 2011 as spending remains choppy.”Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent to $26.64 as the fourth-largest US bank by assets said it would cut about 3,800 jobs and close its consumer finance business. The bank said it would take a related charge of $185m, including $137m in the second quarter.Citigroup was up 1.8 per cent to $3.97 after the bank was reported to have agreed to sell about $900m of its private equity portfolio to Lexington Partners as part of an ongoing plan announced last year to reduce its balance sheet.Walt Disney added 0.6 per cent to $33.34 as it said it planned to appeal against a judgment on Wednesday against the media company.A jury in a California court awarded damages of $270m to UK-based Celador Entertainment after a dispute over profits from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?H&R Block was one of the session’s biggest fallers as the stock sank 8.2 per cent to $14.22.

Alan Bennett, a director, will take his role.The company recently reported a 2.3 per cent decline in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which usually accounts for most of its annual profit.Technology stocks were some of the session’s worst performers.Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors, dropped 2.3 per cent to $8.69, Nvidia Corp, a visual computing technologies group, was down 3 per cent to $10.31 and Juniper Networks, a network infrastructure company, erased 0.2 per cent to $25.43.Apple retreated 0.2 per cent to $258.09 even as the computer device maker elaborated on its Asia expansion plans. It said its Shanghai store, which is opening this weekend, is one of “many” it plans in the country.“The Chinese consumer’s love of luxury goods is an enticing opportunity for Apple,” said Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Xcel Energy, an owner of utilities assets that operate in eight US states, gained 1.1 per cent to $21.60 as the company restated its earnings guidance for the full year of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.
214;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-06-24T09:50:09Z;H&M warns of unsold garment stockpile;;Hennes & Mauritz, the Swedish fashion retailer, announced second-quarter results that were broadly in line with analysts’ expectations on Thursday, but warned that relatively weak sales in April and May had left a stockpile of unsold spring garments.This could lead to heavier discounting than previously planned over the summer, the company warned.However, H&M said the third quarter had started strongly, with sales up 22 per cent from last year in the first three weeks of June, easing concerns that fiscal austerity measures in several European countries could hurt consumer spending.The Stockholm-based company, the world’s third-largest fashion retailer, behind Gap of the US and Inditex of Spain, attributed the sluggish spring sales to unusually cold weather across its key northern European markets during the period.Second-quarter net profits rose almost a quarter from last year to SKr5.21bn, narrowly below analysts’ consensus forecasts. But the gross margin was slightly better than expected at 65.9 per cent with the company benefiting from lower purchasing costs because of a weaker dollar.Investors are looking closely at European retailers for any sign of renewed weakness in consumer spending as countries including Spain and the UK announce aggressive budget cuts to reduce deficits. Eurozone retail sales fell 1.2 per cent in April.H&M said its second-quarter sales had risen 2 per cent to SKr27bn, helped by a wave of store openings across Europe, the US and Asia. But like-for-like sales – those made in outlets open for more than a year – fell 4 per cent in May, almost twice the drop analysts had forecast.Shares in H&M were down about 4 per cent on Thursday morning at SKr223.10, but they remain up by almost a quarter from a year ago.The company, known for its “cheap chic” style and collaborations with high-profile designers, said it remained committed to an aggressive expansion strategy that would see 180 stores open during the second half, mostly in Europe, the US and China. It currently operates more than 2,000 outlets in 35 countries.
215;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-06-23T21:37:20Z;Gap tries China for size with four new stores;;Gap, the US clothing retailer, is to open four stores and an e-commerce operation in China late this year in its most significant overseas expansion in more than a decade.The retailer said it would open two stores in Beijing, including one on Wangfujing, the capital’s main shopping street, and two in Shanghai. All four stores, to be owned and operated by Gap, will be large by local standards at more than 17,000 sq ft and will sell clothing from its adult, kids and baby Gap lines.Gap said in a statement that the move into China “marks the start of a long-term, multi-channel consumer market entry strategy . . . that involves more stores in major regions, including Hong Kong, in the coming year”.The company has named two executives with previous experience of the Chinese market to head its operation in the country: Redmond Yeung, former president of the China business of Best Buy, and Lorenzo Moretti, former chief operating officer of Tesco’s Chinese stores.In a reflection of its ambitions in China, Gap has this week also expanded its board, adding Katherine Tsang, chairwoman of Standard Chartered bank’s operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.The retailer also indicated its intention to introduce other brands to the country, which could include its more upmarket Banana Republic stores. Glenn Murphy, chief executive, said the company was “confident” it would “successfully integrate our brands over time into China’s dynamic retail market”.John Ermatinger, head of Gap’s Asia-Pacific business, told the Financial Times the stores would be stocked with a mix of product selected from its Gap businesses in the US, Europe and Japan that would represent “aspirational product at accessible pricing”.Gap will be competing with a range of international rivals already established in China, including Japan’s Uniqlo.Gap is believed to be the first international retailer to launch an e-commerce operation in China at the same time as opening the market, rather than first establishing its brand through its stores.“Its not an investment most brands make when they first enter a country, but our vision was that it is an opportunity we want to take advantage of now,” Mr Ermatinger said.Gap is also planning to open its first store in Italy this year and is launching an e-commerce business in western Europe. Over the past five years it has relied on a franchise-based model to establish a presence in south-east Asia, the Middle East and Russia.
216;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-06-18T22:04:27Z;BP is the company we all love to hate;A slick of corporate hatred is spreading;"Last week I was making polite conversation with a neighbour when, apropos of nothing much, she said: “I really do hate BP.”This woman is British, middle aged, middle class and, as far as I know, has no firm views on anything apart, perhaps, from whether her son’s physics teacher is up to scratch. But she, like lots of perfectly normal people, seems to have got herself covered by the slick of corporate hatred that is spreading even further and more uncontrollably than the slick of oil. It’s not just Americans or lefties or environmentalists who now hate BP. Everyone else seems to as well.Compare this to how we responded to the biggest corporate catastrophe of all time, the gas leak at Bhopal in which thousands of people died. We were horrified. We wanted lessons to be learnt and compensation to be paid. But I don’t remember us all hating Union Carbide with quite the same vindictive intensity with which we now hate BP. If you type “I hate Union Carbide” into Google you get five matches. Do the same with BP and you get 37,400.You could say this was because Bhopal happened 25 years ago on the other side of the world and Union Carbide doesn’t sell products that slosh about in the tank of your car. But I think there’s something else going on too: hating companies and the people who lead them has become a new global pastime.When I was a teenager, hating companies was a much milder affair. This wasn’t because we felt more warmly towards business back then: on the contrary, in Britain the educated classes regarded all commerce with snobbish disdain. In particular, we despised advertising because we thought it was brainwashing. We also hated tobacco companies because their shareholders were making a killing selling things that killed their customers. We didn’t care for bankers because they were parasites and usurers. And we didn’t like oil companies because of the sneaky way that they always pushed up petrol prices when crude prices went up and then seemed to push them up again when crude prices went down.Beyond that, there were a few individual companies that we singled out for special hatred. We hated Barclays and Shell because they did business in apartheid South Africa. Later, we hated Nike and Gap for not doing the right thing by their sweatshop workers. But we didn’t hate them very hard or very consistently; it was a fragmented and feeble effort when set against the universal, concerted loathing that has been inspired by BP.Where does all this hatred come from? Business doesn’t seem to be much more hateful or management more incompetent than it was 20, 50 or 100 years ago. In fact, business mainly is more decent and managers less amateurish and hopeless than they used to be. Instead, I can think of four other things that have changed in the past few years that explain why nice women such as my neighbour are striking out on a crusade of anti-corporate hatred.The first is the emotional hangover of the credit crunch. Our hatred of bankers was wild and uncontrolled and we had never felt anything like it before towards men in suits. Dick Fuld and Fred Goodwin inspired hatred on a scale normally only achieved by an Idi Amin or Osama bin Laden. So much hating has got us into the hating habit.The second cause is executive pay. We already resent how much top people pay themselves, so when people who earn too much show that they are not only incompetent but also insensitive and tactless, our resentment spills over into hatred.The third reason is more subtle, and stems from the great personification of business. In the past decade or so, companies have put a great deal of effort into creating an image for themselves supported by a whole load of values. The more successful they are in creating such a personality, the more there is to love – and hate. The most successful companies in the US – Microsoft and Walmart – are loved and hated in equal measure.And finally, there is the internet, with its power to turn personal emotion into a global epidemic overnight. Hating companies is now fun, easy and varied. There are so many different ways of doing it. You can hate BP on Twitter, Facebook and, most rewardingly of all, on YouTube. If you haven’t already watched the BP Spills Coffee video, in which a group of executives panic when a Styrofoam cup is overturned during a meeting, do so right now. It will make you laugh – and make you hate BP a bit more than you did already.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"
217;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-06-14T00:06:09Z;E-commerce: Innovation brings a touch of class to online shopping;;E-commerce is not generally seen as the sexiest corner of the internet these days. Amazon has become the world’s general store, eBay the world’s flea market. Walmart and Target offer predictably low prices. Brands sell direct through their websites, but hardly make that their focus.Many luxury groups have opted out of e-commerce altogether, believing the risks of selling online – such as brand degradation and counterfeiting – outweigh any benefits.“This whole notion of the web being a channel of discounting went against the very aesthetic of these brands,” says Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research. “There was a belief that there was no way you could communicate your brand essence online.”But in recent years, a flurry of innovation has reshaped e-commerce. Fuelled by a resurgent interest in the consumer web, a raft of technological advances, and evolving opinions of the web itself, companies such as Ike Behar, Burberry and Thomas Pink are discovering ways to reach consumers without sacrificing brand integrity.Applications on smartphones and the iPad have delivered a powerful interface for users to search, browse and buy goods. Ralph Lauren’s Rugby brand and Gap, among others, have developed their own sophisticated apps.Indeed, shopping is proving one of the most popular activities on touch devices. Sales through eBay’s iPhone app last year topped $500m. Purchases included a Lamborghini, a $150,000 boat, and a Bentley.“People are used to the convenience of getting what they want when they want it,” says Fred Felman, chief marketing officer of Mark Monitor, a brand protection specialist. “Buyers online are used to finding speciality, and sometimes very expensive, goods online. They don’t want to talk to a sales representative.”At the same time, so-called “private sale” sites are drawing large followings by offering big discounts on luxury goods. Gilt Groupe, Rue La La and Haute Look take excess inventory off brands’ hands. But instead of throwing it on the racks at a dingy outlet store, the private sale sites take new photographs of models wearing the available merchandise and promote it on well-designed web pages.“It’s a way to get rid of products without a brand tarnishing its reputation in the way liquidation stores might,” says Josh Goldman of Norwest Venture Partners, a venture capital firm with investments in several e-commerce startups.But luxury brands will have to work hard to preserve their margins on private sale sites, too.“As these sites gain more and more power, the economics may start to change,” says Mr Goldman.“Now that this is a maturing market, the margins may start to benefit those who own the customer. Gilt is establishing itself as that brand.”Though some high-end brands are only just starting to innovate online, the internet demand has always existed.“Luxury goods are among the most popular things consumers search for online, and a lot of it is their desire to know what’s going on with them and their desire to own them,” says Mr Felman.Yet, meeting the demand and maintaining the luxury brand’s image was a perennial challenge. Many brands simply outsourced the problem, allowing department stores to resell their goods through their shops and their websites.Some more adventurous brands turned to e-tail sites such as Zappos.com and BlueFly.com.“Luxury sees itself as cooler than everyone else,” says Ms Mulpuru. “They’re the prom queen, the cool kids. God forbid they’d be seen at the table with the computer nerds or the misfits, which is how they perceived the web for a long time.“It was only when they started to see that the computer nerds are also looking at their products that things like Facebook became more accepted.”Even with today’s myriad options, the move to selling online is not without its perils. “As we see internet sales rising for us, we also see an increased level of counterfeiting across the web,” says Deborah Greaves, general counsel for True Religion, the premium denim company.LVMH in particular has waged a fierce war against counterfeiting, filing suits against websites and internet service providers, among others. But aside from assiduous monitoring, there is little that brands can do to stem the tide of fakes flooding the online markets.Even True Religion, which tracks hundreds of sites selling counterfeit versions of its products, cannot turn its back on the web.“We just look at it as another retail store,” says Ms Greaves.With most high-end brands establishing online sales through traditional channels such as resellers and their own sites, they are gaining confidence to venture out.“It’s a huge period of innovation for consumer-facing e-commerce, unlike anything we’ve seen in the past 10 years,” says Mr Goldman. In addition to new applications and private sale sites, Mr Goldman points to local deal sites such as Groupon and LivingSocial, and a new wave of companies that are bringing together location awareness, real-time inventory and deals, and social media.“You’ll always have direct sales,” says Mr Goldman. “But customers look for curation, and social and mobile [media] are enabling real innovation and entrepreneurship today.”
218;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-06-04T01:00:57Z;US store recovery slows in May;;The gradual recovery in US shoppers’ discretionary spending showed signs of slowing in May, according to monthly sales data from leading chain retailers released on Thursday.But several leading retailers suggested that bad weather in the first part of the month, and a shift in the timing of Memorial Day holiday shopping, may have affected spending more than continuing macroeconomic concerns.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 2.7 per cent against the same period last year, 130 basis points below initial expectations.Mr Perkins said the data suggested that consumers had “pulled back the reins on what looked like a fledgling spending recovery in the first quarter”.But the monthly figures were also affected by the timing of the Memorial Day holiday, which pushed sales from the last Sunday and Monday of the month into the retailers’ June reporting period.Sales of summer clothing were also affected by unseasonably wet and cool weather during the first half of the month.Frank Badillo, senior economist at Kantar Retail, argued that the “results provide some sign that the retail recovery will persist” in spite of wealth declines and economic uncertainties.Monthly sales at Target, the discounter whose performance has become a bellwether of broad consumer sentiment, increased 1.3 per cent against a year ago.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said in a statement that the retailer’s “recent experience reinforces our belief that we will continue to experience volatility in the pace of economic recovery”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, which reported a 1.4 per cent increase in comparable sales, cited the impact of the weather, saying its “business trend strengthened toward the end of the month as the weather turned warmer”.Kohl’s, the lower price department store, noted that business improved during the last week of the month, with its comparable sales up 3.5 per cent, better than it had expected.Neiman Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom, the luxury and high-end department stores also continued to provide evidence of the recovery in spending by better off consumers.Neiman Marcus said same store sales rose 7.8 per cent, and noted that its store sales growth was led by its locations in New York City and Texas. Saks comparable sales were up 5.8 per cent, and Nordstrom’s were up 3.7 per cent, with slower growth due to the later start of an annual half-year sale.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent, with only its North America Gap brand stores seeing a sales decline, by 2 per cent.Discount retailers also continued to outperform their full price competition, with TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded goods, reporting same store sales growth of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.Despite the continued sales growth seen by most retailers, their overall sales remain below levels seen in 2007 and the first part of 2008.
219;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-05-21T21:14:01Z;Financial sector leads Wall St rally;;US stock markets found their floor following three sessions of losses, as the financial sector rallied after the US Senate finished its work on the regulatory reform bill.Bank shares advanced 3.6 per cent. JPMorgan Chase led the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gaining 5.9 per cent, to $40.05. Bank of America followed, adding 4.5 per cent to $15.99.Some of the most controversial measures were not included in the final bill, including a stronger ban on banks trading for their own accounts. A final version of the bill will be hashed out with the House of Representatives next week.Goldman Sachs was also 3.3 per cent higher, to $140.62, and Citigroup added 3.3 per cent to $3.75. The sector was still 3.9 per cent lower on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly fell below the key psychological level of 10,000 after the session opened but rallied to stand 1.3 per cent higher at 10,193.39. It was down 4 per cent for the five-day period.“The inmates are running the asylum, this is purely a traders’ market,” said Phil Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Wealth Management, adding that any rebound would first be technical.The S&P 500 indexalso briefly dipped to 1,055, below the trough reached on May 6, when shares made a sudden 5 per cent drop. It then rallied to 1,087.69, 1.5 per cent higher – but still 12 per cent off its 2010 peak.“A 10 per cent correction, even in a bull market, is pretty normal,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff. “The European debt crisis is certainly the catalyst for this renewed round of risk aversion but is not out of line with market patterns over the past century.”The Nasdaq composite was down 5 per cent for the week, but 1.1 per cent higher on Friday at 2,229.04.Counter-cylical shares reversed their pattern for the week and were among the underperformers. Dollar Tree, the discount retailer, fell 1 per cent to $61.04 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from “hold” to “buy”, calling it a “defensive” play on the overleveraged consumer.Walmart was 1.8 per cent lower on the week and AT&T fell 2.2 per cent, both relatively better than the broader indexes.On Tuesday Walmart reported a 10 per cent rise in quarterly earnings. Shares in Target, which also reported earnings, including a rise in same-store sales, were off 1.4 per cent for the five days.Gap raised its full-year profit outlook. The apparel retailer reported a 4 per cent gain in same-store sales in its first quarter. Shares were 1.9 per cent higher at $22.15.According to Thomson Reuters, company earnings for the quarter are up 57 per cent this quarter among the S&P 500 year over year, versus 37 per cent in the previous quarter.Larry Hatheway, economist at UBS, said that, given the continued growth in earnings, “for now, [it] is not evident” that recent weeks are the beginning of a bear market, rather than a correction.Dell, the PC maker, said its margins had fallen nearly 20 per cent and warned of slower demand in the next two quarters, though it blamed seasonal patterns. Its shares fell 6.8 per cent to $13.35.Cyclicals tied to the broader economy gained on Friday, with Alcoa jumping 2.5 per cent to $11.35 and Boeing adding 2.5 per cent to $64.56.But the group was down sharply for the five days. Caterpillar lost 7.4 per cent for the week to $60.09, matching the broader decline. Industrials suffered after a weak Empire State manufacturing survey and a drop in core inflation.Shares of US companies that generate a majority of their revenues in Europe were higher on Friday, but still got hammered over the week. Audio equipment maker Harman International fell 12 per cent, and solar-panel manufacturer First Solar fell 5.6 per cent.
220;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-05-21T00:34:56Z;Sears suffers as Gap mends its bottom line;;Sears Holdings continued to underperform its rivals during the first quarter as it failed to capitalise on improved consumer sentiment and a government-backed surge in household appliance sales.The owner of Sears department stores and Kmart, the discounter, said operating income from its more than 3,900 stores in the US and Canada fell about 25 per cent to $98m against the same period last year. Aggressive price promotions on appliances and lower profits on home electronics at Sears stores had hit gross profits.Comparable sales at Sears department stores rose 1.2 per cent from last year, as sales of fridges and washing machines were boosted by a trade-in scheme aimed at supporting energy efficiency and supported by the government.Sears’ Kenmore brand, the best-selling US home appliance name, has been facing increasing competition from rivals including Home Depot, Lowe’s and Best Buy.The same-store sales gain at Sears stores was the first since it was taken over by Kmart in 2005, in a transaction led by Eddie Lampert, the billionaire hedge fund owner who is now chairman of the combined company.However, Gary Balter, retail analyst at Credit Suisse, described the results as disappointing given the improved performances of most of the group’s main rivals.“Sears was very aggressive in promotions to grow their leading appliance market share, but could not convert that to sell higher-margin products as well,” Mr Balter said.Under Mr Lampert, Sears has cut back on expenses and reduced capital spending on its stores to a level that many retail analysts argue could jeopardise its attempts to win back customers and regain market share.Sears invested $95m in capital spending during the quarter. In contrast, Target, the discounter, invested over $400m in remodelling and new stores.Sears’s 1,320 Kmart stores, accounting for 35 per cent of revenues, reported increased comparable sales, up 1.7 per cent against a year ago, and the third consecutive quarter of growth.Total revenues for the quarter were flat at $10bn. Earnings fell 38 per cent to $16m, or 14 cents per diluted share.Sears’ woes contrasted with the improvement during the quarter at Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer.Gap continued its recovery from several years of declining sales, reporting a 4 per cent increase in same-store sales against a year ago, with gains across its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic brands.The retailer said net earnings rose 40 per cent to $302m, or 45 cents per diluted share, supported by improved gross margins and stronger operating profits. Gap also said it was building up inventory levels, in a sign of growing confidence in stronger consumer spending.
221;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-05-10T20:06:51Z;Stores tackle physical and virtual realities;;JC Penney, the mid-price US department store chain, cut back on expenses last year, as the recession hit its core middle-class shoppers.But it did not stop spending on everything.“We invested heavily in our digital initiatives,” Mike Ullman, chief executive, told investors recently. “During the downturn, under the covers, there was a lot of heavy investment in building muscle to make sure we got a headstart in this.”JC Penney, with more than 1,000 stores, is at the leading edge of digital retailing. In February, for example, it held its monthly board meeting at Facebook’s headquarters in California, to give its board members a crash course in the potential of social networking.Elsewhere, Target, the US discount retailer, is preparing to launch a fully independent digital platform by late 2011, ending its dependence on Amazon, the online marketplace which currently runs its website. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is accelerating work on a new global e-commerce platform. Gap, the clothing retailer, is preparing to launch e-commerce businesses in western Europe, Canada and China.In part, the enthusiasm reflects the lure of online sales growth – which continues to outstrip conventional sales – at a time when few retailers are investing in new store growth.But retailers are also responding to the second stage of the online revolution that began a decade ago.In the first stage, many retailers ran their online e-commerce businesses as separate units.Walmart based its online operation in San Francisco, rather than at its headquarters in Arkansas. Macy’s, the department store, Borders, the bookseller, and Toys R Us, the toy retailer, all initially relied, like Target, on Amazon to run their sites.But three years after Apple launched its first iPhone, the advent of what retailers call “mobile connectivity” is profoundly shaking up the way retailers do business, not only online, but in their stores.“People are going to be making decisions on what to buy in the store with their mobile phones,” says Scott Silverman, executive director of the National Retail Federation’s Shop.org industry group. “What’s going on will affect the mothership – the store – and all of a sudden the store experience is going to completely change.”“I’ve never seen a time like this in retail,” says Andy Murray, head of Saatchi X, the in-store marketing agency that works with customers including Walmart and Procter & Gamble. “I think mobile is changing everything in retail.”Much of the initial attention has been focused on retailers embracing new digital marketing techniques aimed at mobile users, such as sending text messages, and using digital money-off coupons, and on steps to make their existing websites function on mobile browsers. But retailers are also facing a world that is more profoundly altered by the fact that shoppers will now increasingly be online, via their phones, even as they visit a physical store. They will expect a unified shopping experience.“Consumers don’t think of themselves as ‘multi-channel’ shoppers,” says Brett Hurt, chief executive of BazaarVoice, a provider of online reviews and other content. “They just care about the efficiency of the medium.”Customers will expect to see the store merchandise also available online, at the same prices, and merchandised in similar ways. For many retailers, that will require technology systems to co-ordinate prices, inventory and other elements, and changes in their traditional ways of doing things.“Retailers are asking ‘how do I manage my brand across all the channels that affect the consumer?’ ” says Janet Hoffman, of Accenture’s retail consultancy.Tom Nealon, JC Penney’s chief information officer, says its digital platform is seeking “alignment” of the physical and digital experience. “We are not just building a new web page, or dot.com page,” he says, “this is a digital infrastructure that supports every customer touch point …at home, in your car, in the store”.JC Penney is also projecting that its enhanced online presence will lift its e-commerce sales from $1.5bn last year to $2.5bn by 2015, accounting for one fifth of its planned sales growth in the next five years.“That much of our focus on digital is …because we think the survivors in the industry are going to lead in this category,” says Mr Ullman.

Analysts said programme trades may have exacerbated the fall.At mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was down about 4 per cent to 1,120, and then plunged to its intraday low of 8.6 per cent.Tom Schrader, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus, says that once stocks reached 1,200, it triggered computer programmes that were set up to sell off at that level.“There is the possibility of some programme trades going wrong, and trades being executed in error.”“Liquidity at that point was thin, exacerbating the drop,” he added.Rich Adamonis, spokesman at NYSE Euronext, said: “There were a number of erroneous trades…Nasdaq is investigating.”At the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 3.2 per cent to 1,128.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.2 per cent to 10,520.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was 3.4 per cent lower at 2,319.64.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility rocketed up 39.1 per cent to $34.65, its biggest one-day change since February 2007.An unusual move in the Procter & Gamble share price, with the stock dropping to $39.37 from about $62 in a matter of minutes was being investigated by Nasdaq as trading error. The stock was down 2.3 per cent on the day.Financials stocks were some of the day’s worst performers, with Bank of America leading the pack lower by falling 7.1 per cent to $16.28. Citigroup lost 3.4 per cent to $4.04 and JPMorgan was down 4.3 per cent to $40.81.Teen retailers Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale reported significantly weaker April sales, ending a run of three months of gains. Abercrombie’s sales slipped 7 per cent, more than the 1.8 per cent decline projected by analysts, and its shares were 8.6 per cent lower to $40.45. Aeropostale sales fell 5 per cent and its shares lost 6.7 per cent to $27.66.Gap fell 7.2 per cent to $22.91 after its sales fell 3 per cent; analysts were looking for a 1.3 per cent rise on average.Shares in Nordstrom, the high-end department store chain, pulled back 2.3 per cent to $42.49 even as its sales beat expectations to rise 7.5 per cent in the quarter. Rival Macy’s edged 3.5 per cent lower to $22.42 even after it reported a 1.1 per cent increase in same-store sales last month, exceeding its own and analyst forecasts.The company also raised its first-quarter profit forecast to 4 cents per share, excluding some items, compared with the average analyst estimate of 2 cents per share.Warehouse club operator Costco tumbled 3.9 per cent to $58.03 after its April sales data came in slightly lower than expected, rising 11 per cent versus average analyst estimates of a gain of 11.2 per cent.Americold Realty Trust, a warehouse operator owned by billionaire Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa Cos, postponed its $660m initial public offering after slashing the mid-point price by 33 per cent.The offering, which was expected to be the year’s largest US listing, was originally priced at about double the average valuation of property firms worldwide.Internet stocks were in focus as the Federal Communications Commission said it would seek stronger authority to regulate companies that provide internet access after a recent court ruling reduced its powers.Cable operator Comcast and phone company AT&T have both warned that more regulation could damp investment. Their shares were down 6.2 per cent to $18.51 and 2.4 per cent to $25.14, respectively.The FCC proposal is a “nuclear option” with “profoundly negative impact on capital investment”, said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford C.

But ultimately Germany and the others won’t allow the situation to get out of control. It’s a short-term problem that will be extinguished.

The market has run up a lot on expectations,” Mr Neale said.“However, we’ve seen cost-cutting drive profits [in the last quarter] and many companies are still missing top-line growth. It’s not going to be enough to sustain valuations at the current levels,” he added.Pharmaceutical stocks were the day’s best performers, as investors flocked to safehavens and as two of the industry’s biggest names reported strong first-quarter results.Pfizer rallied 2.1 per cent to $17.26 as the company reported better-than- expected results for the first quarter, boosted by its recent acquisition of smaller rival Wyeth.Profit excluding some items was 60 cents per share, beating the 53 cents average analyst estimate.However, the company said the recent US healthcare bill had shaved about $56m from its revenues in the quarter.Rival Merck was also higher, rising 1.5 per cent to $35.81 as it reported first- quarter earnings that also beat estimates.However, the company’s profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago because of acquisition charges from its $41bn purchase of Schering-Plough last year, and its projected full-year earnings were below some analyst estimates. It also said that the healthcare bill will negatively impact its top line.Concerns over monetary tightening in China heavily dragged on the materials sector. Cliffs Natural Resources pulled back 7.5 per cent to $54.55, Vulcan Materials was 5.8 per cent lower at $55.50, while Titanium Metals Corpfell 6.5 per cent to $14.49.Mastercard rose 0.2 per cent to $251.25 as it said profit in the first quarter rose by 24 per cent compared with a year ago, beating analysts’ expectations as consumer spending picks up.It earned $3.46 per share, against $2.80 per share a year earlier and average analyst estimates of $3.14 per share.The Vix index, a measure of the market’s volatility, shot up 22.5 per cent to 24.73, its highest reading since early February.Pharmacy chain CVS Caremark dropped 1.6 per cent to $36.48 in spite of reporting stronger first- quarter results than analysts were expecting, helped by higher revenues and increased stocking of more profitable generic drugs.The company also raised the low end of its full-year earnings forecasts.Apple was 2.9 per cent lower to $258.68 on reports that US antitrust authorities are looking into whether the company’s licensing agreement with iPhone application developers restricts competition in the mobile device market.Blue chip technology stocks were some of the session’s greatest fallers. Microsoft declined 2.4 per cent to $30.13, Dell retreated 4.4 per cent to $15.66 and Google slipped 4.6 per cent to $506.37.Ann Taylor was up 9.3 per cent to $24.76 as the women’s clothing chain said it expects first-quarter earnings to “significantly exceed expectations” and be “substantially better” than a year earlier.However, other leading clothing retailers found themselves under pressure, with J Crew leading the pack lower, falling 4.7 per cent to $46.35.

Many are still uncertain of this recovery.”Small-cap stocks that are cheap relative to their earnings are best positioned to benefit from the current environment, he said.The S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,194.37 on Friday and 1.4 per cent firmer on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,454.05, advancing 2.1 per cent since the start of the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 10,997.35 and 0.6 per cent over the five days.

It expects to make $1.53-$1.68 per share compared with consensus estimates of $1.77.Rob Sands, chief executive, said the forecasts were because of “an uncertain economic environment, continuing pressures on the Crown joint venture and the Australian and UK operations”, as well as investments in marketing and technology. However, its profit for the past quarter beat expectations.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, lost 0.6 per cent on Friday to $55.07 on news that it had cut prices on more than 10,000 products. It follows a drop in sales in its US stores last quarter.Media group AOL was up 10.4 per cent on the week to $27.99 after it announced a potential sale or shutdown of Bebo, the social networking website that it bought less than two years ago.Bebo has been losing market share to rivals and analysts expect it to reach a significantly lower price than the $850m AOL paid.Palm rallied 32.3 per cent over the week to $5.16 amid rumours that the smartphone manufacturer may be bought.Speculation that HTC Corp, a Taiwan-based smartphone maker, may be a potential buyer sent the Palm shares 11 per cent higher on Friday. The company declined to comment.Solid March sales figures released late in the week boosted retail stocks.Over the week, clothing retailer Gap was 5.2 per cent higher at $24.85, department store chain Macy’s gained 5.2 to $23.51 and Nordstrom rallied 2.5 per cent to $42.55. All beat their analyst sales estimates.Shares of coal producer Massey Energy slumped 11.9 per cent to $46.72 over the week following an explosion at its mine in West Virginia that killed at least 25 people.

The index is based on results from 28 retailers.Macy’s, the leading department store chain, was up 0.9 per cent to $22.65 as the company said sales at stores open at least one year increased 10.8 per cent in March from a year earlier, compared with the 7.9 per cent increase analysts had expected.However, Terry Lundgren, its chief executive, said the earlier Easter would hurt Macy’s April sales and forecast flat results for this month.Upmarket rival Nordstrom was 1.6 per cent lower at $41.44 even as it reported a rise in sales of 16.8 per cent, compared with estimates of 10.6 per cent.JC Penney missed expectations, sending its stock
5.5 per cent lower to $30.98. Sales in March were 5.4 per cent higher, compared with Wall Street estimates of a rise of 5.7 per cent.Department stores performed particularly well, with Thomson Reuters recording a 12.3 per cent increase in the sector, versus expectations of a 8.2 per cent rise.Youth fashion retailer Abercrombie & Fitch lost 1.4 per cent to $46.90 as its March sales came in below analyst expectations with a rise of 5 per cent compared with consensus estimates of a 6.6 per cent increase.Clothing retailer Gap climbed 3.1 per cent to $24.59 after its March sales in stores open at least a year rose 11 per cent, beating the 3.7 per cent increase estimated by analysts.TJX, which owns the TJ Maxx discount retail chain, rallied 0.5 per cent to $44.82 after reporting a rise of 12 per cent in same-store sales in March, prompting the company to raise its profit outlook. However, it expects sales growth of only 2 to 4 per cent in April.The S&P retail sector has risen 6 per cent since the start of the year, significantly outperforming the wider index and suggesting that a lot of positive expectations for the sector may already be priced in.Reports that US Airways and the parent of United Airlines have resumed talks about a merger between the two carriers sent both stocks higher. US Airways was up 10.7 per cent to $7.55 and UAL Corp rose 6.8 per cent to $20.23.People close to the situation suggested that the improving US economy had emboldened the airlines to think again about ways to consolidate the sector.The airline sector was higher across the board.Financial stocks were in focus as Chuck Prince and Robert Rubin, former Citigroup executives, testified to the Congress-appointed Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission about events that led the bank to require a $45bn government bail-out. Citigroup was up 2.5 per cent to $4.47, Goldman Sachs rose 1.8 per cent to $179.50 and Bank of America added 0.2 per cent to $18.65.Online retailer Ebay lost 1.5 per cent to $26.46."
226;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-04-08T21:01:13Z;US retailers enjoy spring sales rebound;;US retailers reported their best year-on-year monthly sales gains for several years on Thursday as Easter holiday purchases and renewed discretionary spending helped sales bounce back from last year’s slump.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its same store sales index rose 8.7 per cent for March, the largest monthly increase since it began tracking the data in 2000.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the strong performance was supported both by the early Easter and the easy comparisons with last year, when the index fell 4.8 per cent. But he also saw signs of improving consumer confidence.“Consumers are generally feeling better about their plight and are finally making discretionary purchases and beginning to trade back up a bit,” he said.The strong monthly sales led a handful of large retailers, including Target, the discounter, and Kohl’s and JC Penney, the mid-price department stores, to raise their quarterly earnings guidance.At the top end of the retail market, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, both reported strong increases in comparable sales from last year’s lows, of 12.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively. Their rival Nordstrom reported a 16.8 per cent increase.Meanwhile, Macy’s, the largest department store, saw a 10.8 per cent lift, while JC Penney reported a 5.4 per cent increase and Kohl’s reported a 22.5 per cent increase in same store sales.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, continued its sales recovery, with an 11 per cent increase in comparable sales, with double digit increases across its US Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores. Teen retailers American Eagle, Aeropostale and Zumiez also reported double digit comparable sales gains, although Abercrombie & Fitch delivered a more subdued 5 per cent rise.Target, the mass discounter, also reported a strong recovery in sales, which were up 10.3 per cent on a comparable basis. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the performance “exceeded our expectations, driven by particular strength in our apparel business”.Target’s larger rival Walmart does not report monthly sales numbers.At the lower end of the spectrum, TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on selling remaindered clothing brands, continued the sales growth that saw them outperform full-price rivals over the past year, with 12 and 14 per cent comparable sales increases.John Long, retail analyst at Kurt Salmon Associates, cautioned that, in spite of the strong March performance, consumers were still facing challenges. “We have already seen an uptick in consumer confidence but it is not necessarily something that we believe may be able to be sustained, given the macro-economic story,” he said.

Shares in H&M have risen by about a fifth this year and by about 40 per cent over the past year in anticipation of a turnround.The Stockholm-based company generates a quarter of its sales in Germany but has increasingly sought fresh growth outside Europe in the US and Asia.Quarterly net profit was SKr3.74bn ($514m), up from SKr2.58bn a year earlier. Revenues rose 6.6 per cent from SKr23.3bn to SKr24.8bn.”In view of the continued weak economy during the quarter, the company considers that sales have been satisfactory,” H&M said in a statement.
228;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-03-29T01:30:23Z;Walmart targets Asian online growth;;Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is drawing up plans to launch e-commerce operations in China and Japan, as part of a focus on driving sales by expanding its online presence into new global markets.The retailer already has 282 physical stores in China and 371 Seiyu stores in Japan, but has no direct online sales.It is now setting up systems for adapting its new centralised dotcom technology platform, which it has been developing over the past two years, to work with the two country businesses. A Walmart job advertisement for a “product localisation manager” for Japan and China lists responsibilities that cover preparing for the launch of an e-commerce business.The position is one of dozens advertised by Walmart over the past few months since it set up a new Global.com business unit in San Francisco, headed by Wan Ling Martello. Ms Martello was previously chief financial officer of its international business.Eduardo Castro-Wright, Walmart vice-chairman, said in January that the new business unit would seek to expand “both in developed markets where we currently have stores and an online presence, and in markets where we don’t”.The retailer, with stores in 14 countries, has a strong online presence in the US and in the UK, with its Asda.com business, which is also going to be linked into its new global technology platform.The retailer launched an e-commerce business in 2008 in Brazil, the country with the highest level of broadband penetration in Latin America. In Japan, Seiyu also sells via Rakuten, the country’s largest online marketplace.Walmart’s focus on its online strategy comes as other US retailers are also using the web to expand their international reach.Gap recently said it would also launch an online service in China later this year.It is launching a new e-commerce business based in the UK that will serve western European countries where it does not have stores.Amazon remains the most international of all US online retailers, with sites in six countries outside the US, including China and Japan, which account for almost 50 per cent of its revenues.It has focused since 2004 on expanding its existing international markets, while indicating that it will return to global expansion “over time”.Walmart did not respond to a request for comment on the timing of future international expansion.
229;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-03-25T01:14:49Z;Gap plans foray into Australian market;;Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, is continuing its international growth with plans to open in August the first of a series of franchise stores in Australia.Gap’s franchise network has extended to more than 130 stores in 20 countries since it announced its first international deal in Singapore and Malaysia four years ago.In Australia, Gap has formed a partnership with Brand Republic, a subsidiary of Busby Holdings, which operates Guess and Aldo brand stores.Stefan Laban, Gap’s vice-president of strategic alliances, said the company planned to open 10 to 15 Gap brand stores in Australian cities, which he described as “a very casual market” that would be responsive to the Gap brand.The first store, with 8,000 sq ft on two storeys, is scheduled open in August in Melbourne’s Chadstone Shopping Centre. The company plans to open a second store early next year in Sydney.Gap has also announced plans to expand into China and Italy this year with company owned stores.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, has made international expansion a central part of his efforts to boost Gap’s sales. Even with the additions, Gap still operates in fewer than 30 countries, compared with its rivals Zara and H&M, which have stores in 75 and 40 different countries respectively.Mr Murphy told analysts earlier this month that the retailer would seek to expand its existing franchise store networks, which reach less than a third of their country’s potential markets.The retailer is also planning to launch a European e-commerce site based in the UK later this year to serve 10 western European countries, and to open online sites in Canada and China.International and online business accounts for about 20 per cent of Gap’s $14.2bn in revenues.Mr Laban joined Gap from Nike earlier this year, where he had headed Nike’s retail stores in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which include franchise stores. He previously led the global retail network at Germany’s Escada fashion brand.
230;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-03-12T19:53:40Z;Asos aims to wrest the web crown from Next;;The cover of Asos’ annual report features a banner with the message: “Winning the online fashion race”.It is a large claim.Asos is the UK’s second most popular fashion retail website, having trailed Next, the fashion and homeware group, for the past three years, according to Experian Hitwise.“To win it [is] the point,” says Nick Robertson, the ebullient 43-year old chief executive who founded Asos in 2000.“The reason Next are ahead is that they’ve been around forever but also that they’ve transferred their Directory business onto the internet. The race is still to be won.”Sitting in the company’s art deco headquarters in North London, Mr Robertson exudes confidence and an air of restless ambition.He has taken the company from its first incarnation, As Seen on Screen, selling discount imitations of celebrity outfits online, to a broader proposition as a pioneering fashion e-tailer, offering 870 brands – including Gap, Chloe and DKNY – to 16-34 year-olds.Boosted by early popularity with fashion magazines such as More, which named Asos “most addictive online shopping site” in 2006, the company’s success rests on two trends: the vogue for fast fashion, where catwalk looks are swiftly and cheaply recreated for the non-couture shopper, and the growth of e-commerce.Deloitte estimates online shopping will be worth £25bn ($38bn) in the UK this year, compared with less than £9bn in 2005.Asos sales have risen from £250,000 in 2001 to £165m in the year to March 2009. In the year to March 2010, sales are expected to reach £234m, with pre-tax profit of £20m (£14.1m).The retailer has moved warehouses five times in seven years to cope with its growth.In 2008, it was Aim company of the year, and at the and at the end of 2009, it held net cash of £13.6m.But when Mr Robertson announced in January that sales had risen 38 per cent in 42 weeks – a figure any high street rival would envy – Asos’s share price fell.Growth in the first half had been even higher, at 47 per cent, and investors whispered that the remarkable ascent appeared to be tapering off.Having hit an all-time high of 505p in December, shares fell to 415p in February. They now trade at 461p, giving the group a market capitalisation of £338m.Yet some slowdown is inevitable, Andy Wade, analyst at Numis, says. “Delivering growth on top of extreme growth is very difficult.”The shares are “priced for perfection”, according to Peter Smedley at Charles Stanley, at 25 times 2010 earnings, compared with a retail sector average of 11 times. “The company is still delivering sector-beating sales growth,” he says.“But in the last year, consistently upgraded expectations haven’t been forthcoming, meaning there’s room for disappointment.”Asos faces increasingly aggressive competition.High-street clothing retailers, many of whose web offerings were once bland, tricky to use or non-existent, have begun to replicate the online techniques Asos helped pioneer, from catwalk videos to zoom functions, stronger search and user reviews.“Some of the growth that pure play fashion retailers enjoyed was from relatively low-hanging fruit, because the high street retailers were quite late to embrace the internet,” Richard Hyman, strategic retail advisor at Deloitte, says.“As the embryonic market for online fashion develops, progress inevitably becomes more difficult.”Mr Robertson believes constant innovation is vital.Asos is leading the charge in using social networking to fuel sales, while Asos Premier, a delivery loyalty scheme similar to Amazon’s Prime service, could help protect market share.Customers pay an annual fee of £24.95 to gain unlimited next day delivery, encouraging them to inc-rease the frequency of orders while giving them a loyalty incentive.International expansion is the other engine of growth. Asos generates 25 per cent of its sales from outside the UK but plans to launch country-specific websites in the US, France, Germany and two other markets, one of which will be in Asia.“We’ve got a goal. Let’s get to a billion pounds [in sales] in five years, in five markets,” Mr Robertson says.Achieving sales of £1bn will not just rest on international expansion, industry observers say.While the launch of Asos’ US site – scheduled for the fourth quarter – will be keenly watched, the company must cement its position as an umbrella brand.“Where Asos can excel – and where it has a considerable head start in fast fashion - is in being authoritative on both range and price,” says Peter Fitzgerald, retail industry leader at Google UK. “If you can provide shoppers with a great website experience with access to multiple brands and products…you become the place consumers want to start shopping for fashion.

231;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-03-12T15:28:11Z;Gap chief hails new phase as sales grow;;Glenn Murphy, chief executive of Gap, argued on Thursday that the biggest US clothing retailer has moved beyond its turnround phase, less than three years after he was appointed to head the then-floundering chain.“We are hoping that the word ‘turnaround’ that was synonymous with the word Gap …we can just park that,” he told an investor conference in New York.“I’m sure the word ‘turnaround’ can just go and find another brand now.”His comments followed Gap’s return to positive same-store sales growth across its brands in its fourth quarter, and improvements in operating margins driven by cost cutting and more disciplined inventory management.Mr Murphy argued that Gap’s renewed drive to gain market share in the US would benefit from the slowing of expansion by rival chains, which had during the past decade emulated its own rapid growth of the 1990s.The recession and “the maturing of the apparel business” in North America had shifted the focus away from store expansion by rivals that had cut into the markets of its own 2,500 North American stores, he said.“There will be some Kohl’s [department] stores that will open, and there will be a few more Forever 21s [fashion stores] …but by our crystal ball and the work we’ve done on the next five years its pretty much a level playing field.“It is going to be mano a mano, not based on square footage and capital. It’s based on execution, differentiation, knowing your target customer …and fighting for every one of them.”Mr Murphy, who previously headed Shoppers Drug Mart, Canada’s biggest drugstore chain, delivered a frank assessment of the shortcomings he identified when he arrived, including an “almost criminal” weakness in ensuring return on invested capital, and lack of cost awareness.“It had been a culture that didn’t necessarily embrace really rolling-up-of-sleeves work that needs to get done inside a really great company,” he said.He highlighted the high turnover rate of headquarters staff when he arrived, which reached 23 per cent in 2007 but dropped to 9 per cent in 2009.“You cannot run a business with that kind of turnover,” he said. “Gap brand, over a 10-year period, had seven brand presidents. Shame on us.”Emanuel Weintraub, a retail consultant, said Gap’s stores had seen a marked improvement.“Quality is better, product is better, pricing is better.”JPMorgan Chase’s retail analysts on Thursday raised their price target for Gap’s shares from $22 to $24.Gap shares, which dropped below $11 a year ago, have recovered to pre-crisis levels of about $22.

Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.4 per cent increase and said the number of customers visiting its stores was continuing to rise year-on-year.Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report its monthly same-store sales numbers.Gap, the largest US clothing store chain, continued its sales recovery, reporting a 3 per cent gain in comparable sales across its business.Youth clothing retailers also performed more strongly.

Aeropostale’s monthly comparable sales increased 7 per cent, and American Eagle’s rose 6 per cent.Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 2 per cent increase in same-store sales, after seeing a double-digit decline in February last year as luxury demand slumped.The comparative strength of February’s sales came in spite of a sharp fall in the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index during the month.However, a survey of consumer confidence in March, released on Thursday by RBC, reported a recovery in confidence levels.RBC’s Consumer Attitudes and Spending by Household index bounced back to 58.2, it said, after falling to 18.8 in February.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

China is also now Nike’s largest market after the US.John Anderson, chief executive officer of Levi Strauss, also highlighted the attraction of the new middle class customers in China and India this week, telling a call with analysts that the company was “developing new products for the emerging middle class consumers in markets offering potential for growth, like India and China.”“They really are our growth engine of the future,” he said.Sales in the VF Corp’s comparatively small Asia business - which accounts for around 5 per cent of international sales - have outstripped the recession-hit US and European markets over the past year. The company reported 40 per cent revenue growth in Asia in the fourth quarter, against almost flat revenues of $1.92bn for the business as a whole.VF Corp has said it wants international sales to account for around 40 per cent of its revenues, from 30 per cent in 2009.Eric Wiseman, chief executive officer, said the company’s fourth quarter had been “much stronger than we’d anticipated”, in spite of continued weakness in its Eastern European business, and in sales from its 7 For All Mankind premium jeans business.During the year, VF cut costs by $100m and reduced its inventories by 17 per cent as it responded to the dramatic slump in demand in North America and Europe.In the coming year, the company plans to invest an additional $50m in marketing and other efforts to develop its leading brands, bringing advertising back to levels seen in 2008, but with a focus on its most successful brands.“We are very focused on specific initiatives within our most important and most profitable businesses,” Mr Wiseman said. “We are less democratic with our ad budget this year, we are focused on our biggest and best opportunities, and we are funding those brands at record levels.”He said the company remained interested in additional acquisitions, with a focus on outdoor and action sports brands.VF Corp’s fourth-quarter results were hit by a $114.4m non-cash charge as it wrote off goodwill associated with its acquisitions of Nautica, Lucy and Reef clothing brands. Including the charge, net income was $66.9m, or 60 cents per diluted share, compared with $115.9m of $1.05 per share in the same quarter last year.

240;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-02-04T18:59:39Z;US retailers boosted by strong January;;Spending by US shoppers continued to bounce back from last year’s post-crash lows, with retailers ranging from luxury department stores to teen fashion boutiques on Thursday reporting stronger sales in January.Retail Metrics said its index of chain retailers’ same-store sales figures rose 3.3 per cent, higher than the 2.4 per cent forecast, the fifth successive month of positive year-on-year sales growth shown by the index.Retailers including Gap, Kohl’s and Macy’s, saw their shares rise as they raised expectations for their fourth-quarter earnings.The monthly sales numbers offered further indications of returning demand for prestige and luxury goods, with Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion department stores, reporting increases of 6.8 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, saw its comparable sales jump 14 per cent.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, highlighted a strong performance from its luxury Bloomingdales stores, as it reported a 3.4 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month and raised its earnings guidance.The performance of the prestige stores fits with recent comments from Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing brand company, and from Estée Lauder, the cosmetics maker, which have both reported stronger demand for their higher-priced products.The more mainstream retailers also enjoyed sales that were stronger than had been expected.Comparable sales at Kohl’s, the discount department store, rose 6.5 per cent, although Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said customers “remain conservative in their discretionary spending”.Kohl’s rival JC Penney reported a 4.6 per cent decline in comparable sales, but said this was better than the forecast decline of 5 to 8 per cent.Speciality clothing retailers also fared significantly better than last year, with Aéropostale’s same-store sales up 6 per cent, American Eagle up 10 per cent and Abercrombie & Fitch up 8 per cent.The Limited, which owns the Victoria’s Secret lingerie stores, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales while Gap, the largest US speciality clothing seller, reported a 5 per cent gain, led by a 10 per cent increase at its low-cost Old Navy chain in the US and positive sales at its Gap and Banana Republic brands.Comparable sales at Target, the discounter, rose 0.5 per cent, lower than Wall Street had expected. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports its same-store sales on a monthly basis.January is traditionally a month of transition for retailers, as they dispose of excess holiday inventory and prepare to bring in the spring ranges.
241;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-01-28T10:52:58Z;H&M same-store sales recover;Fourth-quarter results beat expectations;Hennes & Mauritz on Thursday raised hopes of recovery in the European retail sector with its first jump in same-store sales for eight months.Shares in the Swedish group gained more than 8 per cent after it unveiled its December sales figures with better-than-expected fourth-quarter profits.The results suggested H&M could be turning the corner after a series of disappointing sales figures last year and raised optimism about a rebound in consumer demand. Karl-Johan Persson, H&M chief executive, said the economic outlook remained uncertain but predicted same-store sales would increase in 2010.He vowed to press ahead with the group’s aggressive international expansion, with plans to open a further 240 stores this year in the US, Europe and Asia, after opening a similar number in 2009.H&M, the world’s third-largest clothes retailer after Gap of the US and Inditex of Spain, has seized on the economic downturn to snap up vacant retail units.Sales rose 15 per cent in December compared with the same month in 2008, while those in stores open more than a year were up 3 per cent, compared with analysts’ consensus expectation for a 1 per cent drop.Comparable sales fell 6 per cent in the fourth quarter, reflecting weakness in October and November. H&M said consumption remained constrained and the market driven by discounts during the three-month period but there were signs of the gloom lifting.The positive trend continued in January, with total sales up 13 per cent so far this month.New store openings and favourable currency movements helped lift overall fourth-quarter sales by 6.5 per cent to Skr28bn ($3.8bn), while net profits rose 21 per cent to SKr6.2bn.Mr Persson, the grandson of H&M’s founder, took over as chief executive in July, marking a return to family leadership a decade after Mr Persson’s father, Stefan, stepped down.The Stockholm-based retailer, known for its “cheap chic” clothing line, generates about a quarter of its revenues in Germany.But the group has increasingly looked beyond Europe for growth, with launches planned in South Korea and Israel this year following recent expansions into Japan and China. At the end of November, it had 1,988 stores in 35 countries.Analysts praised an improvement in gross margins to 66.3 per cent from 62.4 per cent a year earlier but warned it would be difficult to sustain amid stiff price competition in a discount-driven market.
242;GPS;Gap Inc;2010-01-07T16:07:39Z;US retailers report stronger Christmas sales;;Many of the largest US retail chains reported sales that were at the high end of their forecasts for the important holiday shopping month of December, although sales for most remained below pre-crash levels of two years ago.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of comparable store sales rose 3 per cent, the strongest increase in the index since April 2008.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said “retailers handily exceeded very modest expectations”, supported by “a last minute sales surge that saved the day prior to and immediately following Christmas”.A range of retailers, including Macy’s, the department store, TJX, the discount clothing chain, Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret, and Aeropostale, the youth fashion retailer, raised their quarterly earnings guidance on their stronger than expected performances.Mr Perkins said the positive earnings guidance “came from retailers that were able to keep promotions in check and maintain all-important margins”.Kohl’s, which has picked up business from the bankruptcy of its rival Mervyn’s, saw its same-store sales rise 4.7 per cent, while JC Penney reported a 3.8 per cent decline. Macy’s reported a one per cent increase in comparable sales, while Target, the discounter, said comparable sales had increased 1.8 per cent.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported continued strength at its lower cost Old Navy US stores, where comparable sales rose 7 per cent, and saw its Gap stores in North America report a 1 per cent increase. Comparable sales at its more upmarket Banana Republic stores fell 3 per cent. Overall, the company reported a 2 per cent increase in comparable sales.Sears Holdings, owner of Sears and Kmart stores, saw its shares surge after it forecast stronger than expected earnings. It said same-store sales for the month rose 5.3 per cent at Kmart, the discount store, but fell 4.3 percent at its Sears department stores. Overall, it said same-store sales rose 0.4 per cent in December, but had fallen 2 per cent in November and December combined.Toys R Us, the privately held toy retailer, also reported a 4.6 per cent increase in its comparable sales at its US stores, which reported a 3.9 per cent increase for the nine week holiday season.Saks, the luxury retailer, reported that its comparable sales had fallen by 7.3 per cent over November and December, despite a 9 per cent increase in comparable sales in December that was supported by a shift in a major sales promotion. Neiman Marcus reported a 4.5 per cent same store sales increase in December, after a 9.7 per cent fall in November.Barnes & Noble, the largest US speciality bookseller, said its sales for the nine week holiday period fell 5.4 per cent, and reduced its quarterly earnings guidance.
243;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-12-10T18:19:55Z;Inditex’s Asia push offsets domestic slump;;Inditex, the Spanish clothes retailer, on Thursday unveiled a slight drop in profits for the nine months to the end of October, as aggressive expansion into Asia helped offset weakness in the domestic market.The company, which competes with Gap of the US as the world’s largest fashion retailer by sales, said net profits for the period were €831m ($1.2bn), compared with €843m at the same stage last year.Sales climbed 6 per cent, to €7.8bn, as the group opened new stores in Japan, China and South Korea.Measured in local currencies – stripping out the impact of the strong euro – sales growth was 8 per cent.The company, creator of the popular Zara line of smart, affordable clothing, does not give a same-store sales breakdown at the nine-month stage.However, these appeared to be down by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent for the period, although there were signs of improvement in the third quarter to end-October, according to some analysts’ calculations.They also noted accelerated sales growth in the lead-up to Christmas, which could translate into positive same-store figures in the fourth quarter to the end of January.“Inditex is clearly taking share from independents in Spain and performing well in Asia,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a note to clients.However, others were less upbeat: Credit Suisse calculated a 4 per cent year-on-year fall in same-store sales for the quarter.For the third quarter, Inditex’s net profits were ahead 4 per cent year-on-year at €456m, at the top end of analysts’ forecasts, on sales of €2.9bn.The shares beat a flat Madrid stock exchange to close up more than 3.5 per cent, at €42.7.The company, which also owns the Pull & Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, and Oysho brands, said that the stable results amid the global downturn reflected “a year of robust growth in China, Japan and South Korea”.Inditex has said throughout the year that cost controls and its rapid growth in Asia would help compensate for any weakness in Spain and other countries where recession had hit spending.It also plans to start internet selling of the Zara range in selected countries next year.Although it has dramatically cut the rate of new store openings in response to the crisis, the company has sharpened its focus on consumers in China and Japan.Inditex also has plans to enter India, in a joint venture with the Tata group, next year.Of the 266 new stores opened in the first nine months, about a third were in Asia.At the end of October, the group had a total of 4,530 outlets.“High points of store launches so far this year include flagship locations in Japan and mainland China,” Inditex said.
244;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-12-07T16:01:30Z;Mind The Gap;Growing sales as peers shrink;There is always the odd gem tucked among the muck. Gap, whose first store opened in San Francisco 40 years ago, practically invented speciality clothes retailing for the mass market. In the 1990s, as the world went crazy for cargo pants, sales exploded by an average 22 per cent a year. Then like many innovators, the company over-expanded, lost its way and stalled, while imitators proliferated. Sales peaked in 2004 at just over $16bn, and have been declining ever since. But the measures taken to address those problems mean that the company got a head start on its peers in preparing for this recession.Starting in 2007 under new chief executive Glenn Murphy, the former head of Canada’s largest chain of drug stores, Gap began doing what the rest of the industry has since been forced to embrace: cutting inventory and concentrating on profitability. Growth in floor space was also reined in, and the company returned its Old Navy chain to a focus on value after a misguided foray into youth fashion.The effect of these changes was clear in Gap’s most recent set of quarterly results. Well-positioned for the trend for trading down, Old Navy – which like The Gap chain contributes two-fifths of group revenues, with posher Banana Republic making up the balance – grew comparable sales while most peers shrank. Furthermore, the company declared an end to shrinking stock levels for the fourth quarter and is increasing its marketing spend with the first TV advertising campaign for The Gap since 2006.Investors have already noted some of the improvement. Gap shares have outpaced consumer discretionary stocks and the market since the March lows. But with only modest growth factored into forecasts and valuations, reviving brands, net cash and ongoing international expansion, Gap’s prospects catch the eye.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
245;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-12-03T16:09:34Z;US retailers report tough November;;Leading US retailers reported November sales that were broadly lower than expected, as a post-Thanksgiving rush failed to offset earlier weak demand.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly comparable sales figures, said its index for the month rose just 0.7 per cent from last year, when sales slumped. Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the “the bottom line is that comp store sales were very disappointing ahead of the critical December holiday shopping season”.“The standard line from many retailers was a stronger year-on-year Black Friday [post-Thanksgiving] weekend was not enough to offset very weak sales throughout most of the month.”JC Penney, the low price department store, reported a 5.9 per cent fall in its comparable sales, in line with its forecast of a drop of 4 to 7 per cent, but on top of last November’s 11.9 per cent decline.“Strong sales for the Black Friday weekend offset slightly weaker sales beginning mid-month and leading up to Thanksgiving,” the company said.Kohl’s reported a 3 per cent increase in comparable sales, while Macy’s, the largest US traditional department store chain, reported a 6.1 per cent fall in comparable sales. Macy’s said its post Thanksgiving sales had been “below expectations”, which it attributed to competing sales promotions, and also highlighted the impact of the unseasonably warm weather on winter clothes sales.Target, the second largest discounter, said its comparable November sales were down 1.5 per cent against last November, with softer sales in the first three weeks “substantially offset by better-than-expected sales during our post-Thanksgiving Two-Day sale”.The retailer said it has seen strong sales of consumer electronics, toys and apparel, as well as household goods, small appliances and beauty. It also said that while overall sales levels had decreased, the number of transactions had increased.Walmart, the largest US retailer and Target’s rival, does not report monthly same store sales.Costco, the discount warehouse club that has been one of the beneficiaries of households seeking to cut spending, reported flat comparable sales at its US stores. The company noted that its top line sales were affected by lower food prices and by continuing deflation in flat screen TV pricing, where unit sales were up 15 per cent, while dollar sales saw a mid single digit percentage declines.Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen retailer, reported a 17 per cent fall in comparable sales, far worse than analysts’ expected. Aeropostale sales were slightly worse than expected, with a 7 percent rise, and its shares fell over 10 per cent in New York after its quarterly earnings forecast disappointed market analysts.Low price and discount retailers continued to outperform full price rivals, with both Ross Stores and TJX Companies reporting comparable sales up 8 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported overall comparable sales that were flat, but saw a 6 per cent increase at its low price Old Navy stores, offsetting comparable 4 per cent declines at its US Gap and Banana Republic stores, and a 5 per cent decline in its international business.Luxury retailers Neiman Marcus and Saks reported comparable sales declines of 7.5 per cent and 26.1 per cent, on top of the declines of around 30 per cent seen in November and December last year in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash. Saks said it still expected comparable store sales for the fourth quarter to be down in the high-single digits.
246;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-11-27T20:44:47Z;US consumers aim to dispel ‘frugal fatigue’;;Just after 4am on Friday morning in the Sears department store in the Newport Center mall in Jersey City, a middle-aged shop assistant was discreetly lamenting her lot.“Last year we opened at 5am,” she said. “This year it was 4. Next year, it will be 3 probably. And after that, the whole night.”Behind her, a crowd of shoppers seethed around the check-out desks in the store’s electronics department in pursuit of “early bird” post-Thanksgiving bargains.On “Black Friday” – the day that US pre-Christmas shopping begins in earnest – opening the store even earlier than usual has proved a popular gambit for US retailers, as they slog their way through the slump in consumer spending that hit when Wall Street crashed a little over a year ago.At the other end of the Newport mall, the JC Penney department store had already upped the ante on Sears and its rival Kohl’s.Penney’s was one of the first to move to a 4am post-Thanksgiving opening two years ago, but on Friday the Jersey City store opened at 3.30am – half an hour earlier than advertised.Elsewhere, Gap’s Old Navy clothing chain opened at 3am, when a queue of 150 people was already lined up outside its mid-Manhattan store in New York.Toys R Us moved its opening to midnight, drawing more than a thousand people to its Times Square location. But while shoppers were out in force, it was hard to find anyone planning to spend more this Christmas than last year.Jazz Alexander, a young student standing in a queue of more than 1,500 people outside Best Buy in Jersey City, said she expected her spending this year to be “lower than last year”, while her friend Kiki Jenkins said she was “definitely on a budget”.In an even longer line outside the local Target discount store, Shanae Felder said she was looking for “a little bit of everything”. “I want the vacuum cleaner, the microwave, a GPS system and the TV,” she said, listing four of the discounter’s “door-buster bargains”. But she still expected her spending to remain “about the same” as last year.Although sales data for the period will not come out until next week, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, said his annual morning visits to stores in Manhattan and the New York area suggested the numbers of people turning out to shop this year were similar to last.In 2008, the industry saw a 3.4 per cent drop in sales in the November and December period against the previous year, according to the National Retail Federation. In September the NRF predicted that this year retail sales over the two holiday months would fall 1 per cent.But Mr Cohen said consumers this year seemed more focused on their purchases. “The big difference this year is that the consumer is coming in with intent to buy,” he said.“This year anyone coming out has a mission: they know what they want, where they want to buy it and how much to pay for it. It is more planned.”He also cited anecdotal evidence from shoppers turning out on Friday that suggested consumers who had been holding back on discretionary spending were now prepared to spend on holiday-related promotions, to dispel “frugal fatigue”.Mr Cohen said: “A glaring majority said clearly, yes, they have been waiting to spend, that this is the time, and that they haven’t purchased anything for themselves all year.”Retailers acknowledge there is no guaranteed link between their performance during the holiday season, and the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales.If sales on the day turn out to be up on last year, retailers will need to see steady spending in the weeks up to Christmas and they will hope consumers do not keep their wallets closed in anticipation of price-cuts in the final days before Christmas.
247;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-11-20T21:29:48Z;Tech sector pulls Wall Street lower;;"US stocks edged lower on Friday after disappointing results from Dell added to fears this week that the economic recovery was faltering.The second-largest personal computer maker said profits had plunged 54 per cent during the third quarter. The company has gradually lost market share to rivals such as Hewlett-Packard, which last week reported better-than-expected quarterly results.However, Dell offered some words of optimism for Wall Street, saying sales to companies had increased from the second quarter – the first such gain in 21 months.Dell shares were down 10 per cent to $14.29, while Hewlett-Packard gained
0.4 per cent to $50.04.ADC Telecommunications, which makes equipment for telephone companies, added to the Nasdaq’s woes on Friday after its forecast for the first quarter missed analysts’ estimates.The group has faced weak demand from telecoms operators, which have struggled with regulatory pressure as well as the recession. ADC shares dropped 11 per cent to $5.91.The technology sector led the market lower as a result, adding to its losses on Thursday when a rush of downgrades hit chip­makers.After regaining some ground in late trading, the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,091.38 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,146.04.The Dow Jones Industrial Average shifted into positive territory for brief periods but closed 0.1 per cent lower at 10,318.16.“There have been some recurring concerns about the strength of the economic recovery this week,” said Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities. But he said he did not believe this week’s losses were the start of a substantial correction but were mostly related to the renewed strength of the dollar.Over the week, the Nasdaq has suffered the most, losing 1 per cent, while the S&P was down 0.2 per cent. However, the Dow added 0.5 per cent.DR Horton, the country’s second-biggest homebuilder, dropped 15.4 per cent
to $10.37 on Friday after reporting a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.Horton said rising foreclosures, high inventory levels, increasing unemployment, tight credit for homebuyers and weak consumer confidence meant conditions in the industry were still challenging.On Thursday, the Mortgage Bankers’ Association announced that delinquency rates during the third quarter had hit the highest level since records began more than three decades ago.The previous day, data showing that the number of new houses built last month had fallen for the first time since April also weighed on homebuilders’ shares.Over the week, DR Horton was down 13.1 per cent and KB Home, the Los Angeles homebuilder that targets first-time buyers, lost 5.8 per cent.However, Toll Brothers, the country’s largest luxury homebuilder, has fared better, losing only 3.6 per cent. Last week, the group said orders had surged 42 per cent in its fiscal fourth quarter.Retailers have also been in focus this week after a series of companies disappointed the market with cautious outlooks for the holiday season.AnnTaylor Stores, the women’s clothing chain, added to the sector’s concerns on Friday, dropping 1.4 per cent to $13.62 after reporting lower than expected quarterly revenue and giving a downbeat forecast for the next quarter.Gap appeared to buck the trend, posting a 25 per cent rise in quarterly profits after the closing bell on Thursday.The chain recorded its highest margins in a decade and said sales had rebounded at its Old Navy chain.Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $21.95."
248;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-11-19T21:56:39Z;US retailers turn to power of the app;;Leading US retailers are this year expanding their Christmas sales drive by targeting smartphone users through the new generation of mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone, the Palm Pre and BlackBerry’s Storm.Retailers that have started selling online via smartphones this year include mass discounters Walmart and Kmart, lingerie retailer Victoria’s Secret, home goods store Crate & Barrel, and youth clothing chains American Eagle and Urban Outfitters.Others, including JC Penney, Target, Gap and Toys R Us have launched smartphone applications, or apps, that promote deals alongside services such as helping customers locate physical stores or check the availability of items.Raul Vazquez, chief executive of Walmart.com, said the group’s new iPhone app, which was released in November and is linked to its home electronics sales, had so far been downloaded more than 300,000 times.“We expect by the end of the year to get that number up to 1m,” he said of the app, which includes a feature that allows shoppers to fit a profile of a proposed TV purchase on to a photo of a wall or room.Jason Taylor, head of mobile products at Usablenet, which adapts websites to make them easily navigable by mobile devices, said his company had this month launched “around a dozen” new mobile sites for leading retailers, including office-supplies retailer Staples and cosmetics company Aveda. Outdoor goods store REI, and OfficeMax, another office supplies retailer, are also planning to open mobile commerce sites.“I see a real rush by retailers to have proper mobile channels,” said Mr Taylor.The growing US demand for mobile commerce was underlined last month by Ebay, the online auction site, which announced that about $400m of merchandise had been sold through its iPhone app so far this year. Ebay said some 4.6m people had downloaded the app.
249;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-11-19T21:21:49Z;Gap boosted by strong Old Navy sales;;"Gap on Thursday signalled its intention to start winning back some of the market share it has given up over the past five years, as the largest US speciality clothing retailer reported strong quarterly earnings boosted by sales at its low-price Old Navy chain.The retailer reported a 25 per cent increase in net earnings to $307m, or 44 cents per share, while total revenues rose one per cent to $3.59bn. Its operating margin increased to 13.9 per cent, from 11.1 per cent in the same period last year, which Glenn Murhpy, chief executive, said was the best third-quarter performance for a decade.“Looking ahead to the holiday season, we’re focused on gaining market share as we invest in marketing and present a strong value proposition to customers across our brands,” Mr Murphy said in a statement.The strong results were supported by a 10 per cent increase in comparable sales at the company’s 1,060 Old Navy stores, which account for almost 40 per cent of its sales.The brand has benefited from US shoppers’ increasing preference for lower-price and discount stores since the Wall Street crash of September last year. But it has also been the focus of a turnround effort since Mr Murphy – who had no previous clothing business experience – took over as CEO in July 2007. His appointment followed several years of declining sales under Paul Pressler, who stepped down in January 2007.Gap’s annual sales have declined from a peak of more than $16bn in 2004 to the just over $14bn expected this year.The higher operating margins in the third quarter reflect Mr Murphy’s focus on increasing returns from Gap’s more than 3,000 stores by initially reducing expenses and cutting back on the number of different items stocked.During the third quarter, however, the company increased its marketing spending behind its Gap brand and Old Navy stores in the US by $40m, reflecting its increasing confidence in its store execution. It said it expects to spend an additional $45m on
marketing in the fourth quarter, which will include a return to television advertising for the Gap brand.Gap also announced that its board had authorised an additional $500m share repurchase programme, with members of the founding Fisher family agreeing to purchase $20m of the total authorised amount.The stronger third-quarter performance is likely to strengthen Wall Street’s view that the retailer is emerging from a long period of uncertainty with a greater sense of strategic direction under Mr Murphy.Gap said that it continues to expect its total square footage to decrease by 2 per cent this year as it trims underperforming stores and seeks out smaller, more productive locations.Last month the company announced that it planned to open its first store in China next year, the first new market it has entered with company-owned stores in more than a decade. It will also launch UK-based e-commerce sales for Gap and Banana Republic that will also sell across the EU."
250;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-11-05T22:10:21Z;Wall St storms ahead on productivity boost;;US stocks stormed ahead on Thursday following upbeat jobs data and a surprise jump in productivity as companies fought to boost output in the recession.The Labor Department said non-farm productivity surged to an annual rate of 9.5 per cent during the third quarter, the quickest pace since 2003.The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits also dropped last week to 512,000 from a revised 532,000 in the previous week.Analysts polled by Bloomberg had been expecting initial jobless claims to only drop to 522,000.The report left investors more optimistic ahead of Friday’s key monthly employment report, which is expected to show that the unemployment rate has reached 9.9 per cent from 9.8 per cent in September.“There’s enough evidence now to show that the recession is probably over and we’re in the early stages of recovery,” said Matt King, chief investment strategist at Bell Investment Advisers. “The jobs data was certainly not good but a lot less bad. The unemployment figure will be important too but I wouldn’t be surprised to see that tick up because it’s a lagging indicator.”The S&P 500 closed 1.9 per cent higher at 1,066.63 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1 per cent to 10,005.96.Positive results boosted confidence in the technology sector, giving the Nasdaq Composite its biggest daily gain since July. The index climbed 2.4 per cent to 2,105.32.After posting a larger-than-expected quarterly profit after the closing bell on Wednesday, Cisco Systems was up 2.8 per cent at $23.93.Erik Suppiger, senior tech analyst at Signal Hill Capital Group, said: “The tech sector’s stock response, including Cisco this morning, is reflective of a broad improvement in the spending environment for networking products, in particular, and tech more broadly.”Shares in Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry group of smartphones, showed strong early gains and closed up 0.3 per cent to $57.79 after the company’s board approved a $1.2bn stock buy-back programme.Hyatt Hotels added to the market’s gains on its first day of trading.After the company priced its initial public offering at $25, within the expected range, the shares rose 12 per cent to $28.However, disappointing October sales figures from retailers initially restrained the market. The Thomson Reuters same-store sales index for October rose 1.8 per cent, slightly worse than the expected increase of 2 per cent.Of the 30 retailers surveyed, just over half missed estimates.American Eagle Outfitters, the youth fashion store, was one of the market’s biggest disappointments. After analysts had estimated October like-for-like sales would rise 1.7 per cent, they actually fell 5 per cent, sending shares down 11.6 per cent to $15.79.However, Gap shares rose 3.5 per cent to $22.86 after sales at the chain came in higher than analysts had been expecting. Like-for-like sales at the company’s namesake stores fell 6 per cent but revenue from the group’s Old Navy chain and Banana Republic chains continued to grow.Whole Foods Market, the upmarket grocer, disappointed Wall Street after the closing bell on Wednesday, warning that it would miss 2010 profit expectations.Reduced consumer spending and an ongoing price war with rivals were to blame, the group said. Its shares lost 15.5 per cent to $27.10.CVS Caremark, the pharmacy group, had initially pleased the market with a larger-than-expected quarterly profit. But on the subsequent earnings conference call, Tom Ryan, chief executive, revealed that the company had experienced some “big client losses” in its Caremark unit, which manages prescription filings.The comments added to existing concerns about CVS’s acquisition of Caremark in 2007, causing the group’s shares to plunge 20.1 per cent to $28.87.In the pharmaceutical sector, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals gained 12.8 per cent to $11.39 after the company received its first order for its influenza drug Peramivir from the US government.
251;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-11-05T16:26:28Z;US shoppers still cautious in October;;US chain retailers’ October sales figures on Thursday underlined shoppers’ cautious mood, with many mainstream retailers still seeing flat or declining sales against the lows seen a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store, reported comparable sales at stores open at least a year that were only slightly down from October 2008, decreasing 0.8 per cent. Target, the discounter, also reported sales slightly down at 0.1 per cent, with Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, describing the performance as “slightly better than our expectation”.But sales at JC Penney, the mid-range department store with around 1,000 locations, decreased 4.5 per cent. The company said it had seen better-than-expected sales during the first half of the month, but that sales “turned softer and were below expectations in the final week”. Its rival Kohl’s reported a 1.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, missing Wall Street’s forecast of a gain of almost 5 per cent.Teen retailers also continued to struggle. Abercrombie & Fitch saw its comparable sales fall 15 per cent, and American Apparel saw a 6 per cent drop. Aeropostale reported a positive 3 per cent, but far below the 14 per cent gain expected by Wall Street.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, delivered a positive surprise, reporting a 4 per cent increase that marked its first company-wide comparable-sales increase for two-and-a-half years.Gap’s improvement came against the 16 per cent fall in same-store sales it saw last October, underlining the fact that most full-price retailers are still seeing sales subsantially below pre-crash levels.More well-heeled customers also showed some readiness to spend. Nordstrom, the fashion department store, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales, while Saks saw a 0.7 per cent increase - against last October’s 16.6 per cent fall.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales data, said its index of comparable-store sales rose 2.2 per cent, a second consecutive monthly increase.The index was boosted by continuing stength of off-price retailers TJ Maxx and Ross Stores, which reported same-store sales gains of 10 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, continuing to benefit from consumers’ frugal focus.A monthly survey of consumer confidence released on Thursday by RBC also highlighted a mood of continuing caution. RBC’s consumer attitudes and spending by household index fell to 30.5, down 21.6 points from October’s 51.8 reading. The group described the fall as “the sharpest one-month drop in consumer sentiment since last autumn’s financial crisis”, and cited factors including unemployment concerns.“Although we have pulled back from the abyss, consumer attitudes remain susceptible to negative news,” said Ira Jersey, head of US interest rate strategy for RBC Capital Markets.
252;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-10-16T02:34:25Z;Gap aims to crack China market;;Gap, one of the world’s biggest clothing retailers, is to open its first store in China next year in a push for international growth that will include selling online in the European Union and Canada for the first time.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, said that the company intended to “step up” investment to regain market share and expand international operations after two years working on improving performance.The China store will be the first new market that Gap has entered directly for more than a decade, rather than through the franchising model, launched in 2007, that it is using in the Middle East, Asia and eastern Europe.“It’s a big opportunity …Chinese consumers love American brands,” Mr Murphy said at Gap’s annual investors’ meeting.Mr Murphy contrasted the new approach to Gap’s initial international expansion in the 1990s, when it tried to apply a standard US store blueprint.Gap’s online sales delivered revenues of more than $1bn in 2008, out of total company revenues of $14.5bn, and pre-tax profits of about $250m.The clothing retailer said that it would continue efforts to increase the profitability of its store operations by reducing its total store base square footage by 10 per cent over the next five years, while maintaining store numbers.Its more than 1,000 Old Navy stores in North America reported positive year-on-year comparable sales gains in August and September, its first two months of consecutive positive numbers for more than five years. Old Navy’s sales account for 40 per cent of Gap’s total sales. Comparable sales at Banana Republic and Gap brands have remained ­negative.
253;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-10-08T20:26:22Z;Wall St lifted by earnings and jobs data;;US stocks pushed higher on Thursday after encouraging jobs data and positive results from Alcoa, the country’s biggest aluminium producer, raised investors’ hopes about the pace of economic recovery.The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 521,000 from a revised 554,000 in the previous week. Analysts had been expecting initial jobless claims to only drop to 540,000 last week.The S&P 500 closed 0.8 per cent higher at 1,065.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 9,786.87 and the Nasdaq gained 0.6 per cent to 2,123.93.After the market close on Wednesday, Alcoa kicked off the third-quarter earnings season by posting a surprise profit, following three consecutive quarterly losses.The Pennsylvania-based group said cost-cutting and higher aluminium prices had helped lift earnings. The shares gained 1.1 per cent to $14.35.Alcoa also said there were signs that key markets were stabilising and forecast that global aluminium consumption would rise by 11 per cent in the second half of this year. The optimism spread throughout the materials and industrial sectors, helping to lift United States Steel 3.6 per cent to $44.12.“There’s been some concern about this earnings season and whether revenues would come in strong enough,” said Ryan Detrick, a senior strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.But he said the positive results from Alcoa boded well for the next few weeks. “The earnings season tends to pick a direction relatively early and then it does tend to keep going: the market continues to go higher and defy all sceptics.”Positive surprises from retailers’ September sales figures also helped to lift the mood on Wall Street. “Everybody knows all the issues that the consumer has had so it’s a relief to see that the early numbers look good,” Mr Detrick added.Retailers catering to teenagers and children reported the steepest monthly declines but their results also came as the biggest surprise to analysts, who had been predicting even larger losses.American Eagle Outfitters posted flat sales but analysts had predicted a decline of more than 4 per cent. The shares rose 8.9 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s added 5.1 per cent to $19.53 after the department store chain reported a smaller sales decline than had been expected.Gap sales were below estimates but the shares still rose 2.4 per cent to $22.21 after the retailer said margins had improved.However, Saks, the luxury department store chain, said sales at stores open for more than a year were down 11.6 per cent after analysts had predicted a decline of 11.1 per cent. The shares fell 4.5 per cent to $6.20.Elsewhere in the sector, Liz Claibornesoared 30.1 per cent to $6.81 after the company said JC Penny had agreed to sell its clothing and merchandise in its stores.PepsiCo also beat analyst expectations when it posted its third-quarter results. The maker of Pepsi Cola reaffirmed its 2009 outlook. However, in North America, volumes fell 6 per cent as consumers cut back on spending in supermarkets and restaurants.After an early surge, the shares were down 1.3 per cent at $60.39.IBM trailed the market after the US Justice Department announced late on Wednesday that it was investigating allegations that the software company had abused its dominance of the mainframe business. The shares dropped 0.4 per cent to $122.29.Targacept, the pharmaceutical company which specialises in diseases of the nervous system, lost 8.6 per cent to $20.56 after it announced a 2.2m share offering of common stock.Marriott International, the hotel chain, also weighed on the market after reporting a $466m third-quarter loss, mainly on a charge linked to its timeshare segment and restructuring costs.Even though profits were higher than expectations, the shares fell 0.6 per cent to $26.80.The group also warned that pricing pressures would continue to erode margins next year.
254;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-10-08T19:36:47Z;US retailers in first gain since 2008 crisis;;Leading US retailers on Thursday reported their first monthly sales gain since the financial collapse of September 2008, although most still saw lower sales than a year ago as shoppers remained focused on bargain hunting.The 1.1 per cent rise in Retail Metrics’ September comparable sales index emerged as the Department of Labor reported that the number of workers claiming jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level this year.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, attributed the comparable sales gain in September – the first increase since August 2008 – to stronger autumn fashions and promotions, and comparisons with a year ago when sales plunged. But he warned: “We would not interpret this month’s results as a sign the consumer is back.”The monthly sales figures were supported by a later Labor Day weekend, which shifted some back-to-school sales into September from August.The figures showed shoppers continuing to favour lower-price retailers as they face uncertainties over unemployment and tighter credit. For example, Gap’s Old Navy low-price chain reported a 13 per cent surge in comparable sales, while overall same-store sales fell 8 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, at its more upscale Gap and Banana Republic stores.Comparable sales also rose 5.5 per cent at Kohl’s, the low-price department store, and by 7 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, at TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on remaindered brands.By contrast, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the upmarket department stores, underlined the comparative weakness of US luxury demand, with comparable sales down 11.6 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively.Sales at Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, fell 2.4 per cent, while Target, the mass discounter, reported a 1.2 per cent decline. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said the retailer “remained cautious” about the fourth quarter, despite the stronger-than-expected September. The National Retail Federation has warned that total US retail sales excluding gasoline and restaurants in November and December will fall by 1 per cent to the levels last seen four years ago.
255;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-09-28T15:51:39Z;Retailer who made shopping for jeans easier;;Don Fisher, the co-founder of Gap, one of the world’s largest clothing chains, died on Sunday at the age of 81, forty years after he and his wife Doris opened the first Gap store in San Francisco.The first store - named after the “generation gap” of the 60s - evolved into a chain that flourished by providing a new, more contemporary alternative to the department stores that had previously dominated men’s and women’s clothing retailing in the US.Mr Fisher was chief executive officer of Gap until 1995, but continued to serve as chairman of the board until 2004, when he became chairman emeritus. His son Robert, who served as chairman from 2004 to 2007, remains on the board, and the Fisher family continue to control just under 40 per cent of the retailer’s shares.Glenn Murphy, Gap chief executive, said Mr Fisher and his wife “took a simple idea and turned it into a brand recognised as a cultural icon throughout the world and changed the face of retail forever”.Gap today has annual sales of about $14.5bn, and operates three leading brands - Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy - with over 3,100 stores and a global presence.Mr Fisher said he had decided to open Gap after encountering difficulties when trying to return a pair of jeans that did not fit properly to another retailer, and that Gap’s mission remained making it easier to buy the right fit.He said: “I created Gap with a simple idea: to make it easier to find a pair of jeans. We remain committed to that basic principle”.Gap’s greatest period of growth came after Mr Fisher, who worked in real estate before opening the first store at the age of 41, recruited Mickey Drexler, a young fashion merchandiser, who eventually succeeded him as chief executive.Gap has struggled in recent years to define its role amid a proliferation of speciality retailers that have eaten into its more broadly-defined customer base. In 2007, the company hired Goldman Sachs to conduct a strategic review of its business, leading to speculation that all or part of it might be sold to the then flourishing private equity investors.The brand was one of the first to exploit the potential of a globalised supply chain by establishing production in China, Mexico and other countries with low labour costs. In the late 1990s, Gap was one of the first US brands to recognise the value of protecting its brand by improving monitoring of labour conditions within its supply chain.The Fisher’s philanthropic activities made them important funders of education and artistic activities in San Francisco and northern California, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art . Both he and his wife were avid collectors of American modern art with a collection of over 1,000 works that is currently partially displayed at the company’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco.In the final years of his life he sought to build a private museum for the collection in the city’s Presidio park district but met stiff opposition. That plan was abandoned earlier this year, leaving many to fear the collection might go to New York’s Museum of Modern Art. On Friday it was announced that the collection would stay in San Francisco.Additional reporting by David Gelles in San Francisco
256;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-09-25T03:41:39Z;H&M August sales disappoint;;Hennes & Mauritz shares fell nearly 3 per cent on Thursday morning as worse-than-expected August sales at the world’s third-biggest clothing retailer took the shine off forecast-beating third-quarter earnings .The mixed results indicated that consumer demand remained sluggish in many of the Swedish company’s main markets even as some of the world’s biggest economies pull out of recession.H&M said sales were “satisfying” in Sweden, Norway and Germany as well as in its new markets of China, Japan and Russia. But it warned that revenues remained weak in the US, France and Spain, amid subdued demand and tough price competition.Pre-tax profits in the three months to August 31 were SKr4.77bn ($695m), up from SKr4.59bn a year ago, helped by weakness in the Swedish krona and new store openings.The earnings were slightly better than the consensus forecast of SKr4.75bn, according to analysts polled by Reuters.But August sales fell 3 per cent year-on-year in local currencies, whereas analysts had expected a 5 per cent rise.Comparable sales in stores open a year or more fell 11 per cent, more than twice the 4.9 per cent forecast by analysts.H&M has weathered the global downturn better than mid-market rivals such as Next and Marks and Spencer of the UK. But it rattled the market last month with a bigger-than-expected 3 per cent drop in like-for-like July sales and the August figures could dent confidence further.The group, known for its “cheap chic” formula, is third behind Gap of the US and Inditex, Spanish owner of the Zara chain, in the ranking of global clothes retailers by revenues.It had 1,840 stores at the end of August, up from 1,618 a year earlier and has promised further expansion in China, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere.The company said it had increased its 2009 expansion plan to 240 new stores from the 225 previously projected.Third-quarter revenues rose 12.4 per cent to SKr27.6bn, from SKr25.4bn a year ago. Measured in local currencies, sales rose 3 per cent over the period but fell 6 per cent in stores open more than a year.The company said its gross margin for the quarter was 61.6 per cent, up from 60.8 per cent last year.
257;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-09-03T17:56:15Z;US retailers battle through August;;"US retailers on Thursday reported increasing signs of steadying consumer demand, tentatively signalling the end to the steep year-on-year sales declines that have forced waves of store closures and cost-cutting since last September.August’s comparable sales numbers from leading retail chains again declined during the month but by significantly less than in the preceding months.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of the monthly sales numbers showed a 2.3 per cent decline compared with the 4-5 per cent falls seen in recent months, the best performance for the index since September last year.Several retailers, including Costco, Gap, Target and Kohl’s, delivered better than expected sales numbers, despite the absence of a boost from pre-Labour Day holiday sales.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the numbers suggested the decline in US retail sales may have “bottomed out” in July when the index fell 4.7 per cent.Mid-price and discount retailers also reported anecdotal evidence of renewed interest in discretionary spending – such as strong television sales at Costco, the warehouse club; and stronger women’s clothing sales at JC Penney and Kohl’s, the department stores; and stronger accessory sales at Target, the mass discounter.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said he believed the monthly sales reports showed a shift in the fundamental mood, and “may indeed be the start of a recovery for the industry”.“I think there is a turning point of sorts that will only get better as we look ahead.”Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount stores, reported a 0.2 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month, while Old Navy reported a 4 per cent rise.Target, with more than 1,700 large discount stores, reported a 2.9 per cent fall in comparable sales, against Wall Street’s expectations of a drop of more than 5 per cent. Costco, the largest US warehouse club, said comparable sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, were flat, again better than analysts expected.Retailers’ year-on-year comparable sales figures will improve from September as they contrast with the sharp monthly declines seen after last year’s financial crash. However, overall sales volumes will remain at levels significantly below last year, and most retailers have cut back on inventories for the autumn and holiday seasons.Luxury spending remains depressed. Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, again reported sales sharply down from last year, with comparable declines respectively of 16.6 and 19.6 per cent.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports same store sales on a monthly basis."
258;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-08-20T20:53:42Z;Gap profits slip in second quarter;;Gap, the US specialty clothing retailer, said on Thursday that its second-quarter profits slipped slightly, as it slashed inventory and operating expenses to cope with falling sales.Net income at Gap was $228m, or 33 cents a share, in the second three months of the year, compared with $229m, or 32 cents a year ago. The results beat estimates of Wall Street analysts, but revenues were off by 7 per cent to $3.25bn compared with the same period a year ago.“Building upon two years of work improving our economic model, we’re now putting further emphasis on changing the trajectory of our top line performance,” Glenn Murphy, Gap’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Our focus is to find the right balance between maintaining our cost discipline and making appropriate, targeted investments to gain back market share.”The San Francisco-based company said that its comparable-store sales – the preferred metric among retailers – were down by 8 per cent in the second quarter, while online sales rose by 17 per cent to $224m . Sabrina Simmons, Gap’s chief financial officer, said earlier this month that she was “pleased” with its “consistently healthy merchandise margins”.Since the beginning of 2007 Gap has streamlined its business and cut its operating expenses by $650m. It cut them by $50m in the second quarter.“The defensive approach has them more profitable and somewhat more appealing,” Richard Jaffe, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said. “Now the challenge of creating inspiring and attractive merchandise has begun. There are some encouraging signs that Gap is not done for.”Gap, which also owns the Old Navy and Banana Republic brands, has moved aggressively in recent months to reclaim its position in the denim market, revamping its offerings with trendier, more fitted jeans and harkening back to its more profitable days. Its new “1969” jeans – a throwback to the company’s founding – are meant to lure customers with a more authentic, classic look.Same-store sales were down sharply at Banana Republic, Gap’s smallest unit but most upmarket brand, where they fell by 15 per cent in the second quarter. At the bigger and more bargain-friendly Old Navy, comparable-store sales were off by 4 per cent.Gap slashed its stocks in the second quarter, with inventory per square foot in its stores down by 14 per cent. The company said that by the end of the year it will have shed 50 of its stores. It currently operates in 3,145 locations.Shares of Gap slipped by 0.27 per cent to $18.80 per share in after hours trading on Thursday.
259;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-08-06T21:33:40Z;Wall Street falls on economic jitters;;For the first time this week the S&P 500 closed below the 1,000-point threshold on Thursday, as healthcare, retail, energy and telecoms stocks weighed on sentiment ahead of today’s US monthly jobs report.The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 997.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 9,256.26. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent lower at 1,973.16.Shares in Cisco recovered from early losses and rose 0.6 per cent to $22.31. John Chambers, chief executive of the IT networking company, forecast another drop in quarterly revenue, even though it announced better results than expected.Early trading was choppy as investors reacted to news on unemployment and retail sales.Figures showed that fewer people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, but the effect on stocks was hampered by a rise in the number of people continuing to claim benefits.“The jobs data show we are going in the right direction, and that we have hit the bottom, but we think earnings are going to be the driver of the next bull market as things return to normal,” said Frank Ingarra, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.Poor same store sales in July among 30 major retailers and mixed earnings, along with a JPMorgan downgrade of healthcare stocks, were factors in pulling the major benchmarks lower. Thomson Reuters reported a drop of 5.1 per cent in same store sales last month.However, amid the gloom, several retailers raised their full-year profit guidance.Gap, the clothing retailer, jumped after beating its forecasts for July sales and increased its outlook on quarterly profits. The shares rose 8.2 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s was also able to increase its outlook for second-quarter earnings, bringing them far above analysts’ expectations in spite of seeing weaker sales than had been predicted. Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $15.01.Target slipped 0.2 per cent to $41.71 after reporting lower sales than analyst estimates. The company said the dip in comparable sales from last year was in line with its own forecasts.BJs Wholesale Club, which has shown strength during the recession as customers snap up goods at wholesale prices, saw sales drop more than expected, hurt in part by lower petrol prices. The shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $31.24.Within the healthcare sector, which was lowered to underweight by JP Morgan, shares in Gilead Sciences fell 3 per cent to $45.45, while Amgen lost 2.6 per cent to $60.69.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.4 per cent to $69.73 while Chevron lost 0.8 per cent to $69.25.Telecoms were hurt as shares in MetroPCS, the low-cost mobile telephone operator, slumped 29.2 per cent to $8.99. The company revealed a steep drop in new customers and a rise in the number of subscribers leaving its service and its earnings fell well short of Wall Street’s estimates.Financial shares were generally lower, although Citigroup continued its recent run and closed up 6.2 per cent at $3.80.In the insurance sector, Prudential and Allstate both fell after reporting quarterly results.Prudential easily beat analysts’ profit forecasts but failed to raise the upper end of its full-year outlook and the shares slipped 2.7 per cent to $45.63.Allstate’s shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $27.27 after it missed Wall Street’s expectations, suffering from unexpectedly high pay-outs following recent storms in the southern states.Elsewhere Comcast, the cable company, was able to cut costs sufficiently to bring quarterly profits above analyst estimates. After a warning that the company was seeing a continuing slowdown in the growth in new customers this quarter, the shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at $15.05.Rival satellite television provider DirecTV’s stronger-than-expected revenues failed to translate into a rise in profits after one-off charges. The shares fell 3.6 per cent to $24.84.The first day of trading for CDC Software saw its shares close at $9.99, after being offered at a price of $12.
260;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-08-06T19:04:37Z;US stores suffer gloomy July;;Leading US retailers had another month of year-on-year comparable sales declines in July, and several said they managed to maintain or improve profit margins on leaner inventory levels and reduced price markdowns.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly same-store sales, said on Thursday its index for July was down 4.7 per cent against the period last year. The index excludes Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, which no longer reports monthly sales numbers.Consumer concern over rising unemployment and the economy hit sales, but other factors were the later start to the back-to-school shopping season than last year and the fact that several states moved annual sales-tax-free shopping days to August.Only a handful of retailers reported comparable sales gains, including the “off-price” stores TJX and Ross. Off-price stores, which buy excess stock from other brands, have performed well throughout the recession.Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount-style department stores, also reported a 0.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, its first gain since April last year. Its rival JC Penney said its comparable sales fell 12.3 per cent, while Target, the discounter, reported a 6.5 per cent drop, and Macy’s was down 10.7 per cent.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 2 per cent fall in comparable sales at its US stores, excluding petrol, as lower prices for food and large electronics items including televisions offset continued gains in transactions. Costco’s unit sales of TVs were up 30 per cent on July last year.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks department stores reporting comparable sales down 27 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.Several retailers reported strongest sales in the southwest and north-east of the US but continued weakness in Florida, the south-east and in the Midwest. Kohl’s said its stores in the south-west had recorded double-digit sales gains in comparable stores.In spite of the overall sluggishness, several retailers raised conservative earnings estimates, including Gap, Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said retailers’ attention was focused on the back-to-school selling surge, from the end of August and to the first week of September.“I think inventories are going to be lean, and they could leave some sales on the table as a result …But if I were them, I would take that bet,” he said, noting that in July sales “remained in a rut”.
261;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-07-09T18:21:36Z;US chain stores continue to struggle;;"US retailers continued their slog through the recession in June, with only a handful of the more than 35 leading chains that reported monthly sales numbers on Thursday announcing gains.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same-store sales fell 4.3 per cent for the month, slightly better than Wall Street investors had expected.June had been “setting up to be particularly disastrous”, said Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics. “It actually turned out to be weak, but not as bad as expected.”In addition to economic pressures, retailers were hit by the outbreak of rain and cold weather in the north-east of the US. Year-on-year comparisons were further skewed by last June’s boost to consumer spending from a federal tax stimulus scheme.Only two non-discount retailers reported positive comparable sales gains – Aeropostale, up 12 per cent, and Buckle, up 9.6 per cent. Both are youth fashion chains that have managed to ride trends and outperform their rivals since the downturn began.Most speciality clothing stores struggled. Comparable sales at Gap were down
10 per cent, at Bebe down 29 per cent, at American Eagle 11 per cent, and at Abercrombie & Fitch they were 32 per cent lower.Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, continued to struggle during the month.Neiman said its comparable-store sales had fallen 20.8 per cent with weakness across all categories.Saks’s June comparable-store sales fell only 4.4 per cent as it benefited from
the shift of a spring sales event that fell in May the year before. But comparable sales for May and June were down 15.2 per cent, it said.Target, the discounter, reported a 6.2 per cent fall in comparable sales.Greg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said the performance “continued to reflect a very challenging economic environment”.However, the retailer raised its earnings guidance for its second quarter,
citing improved profit margins, better expense management, and modest improvements in the risk trends in its credit card business.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports monthly sales numbers.JC Penney, the mainstream department store, also raised its earnings guidance after sales fell less heavily that expected.Peter Brown, vice-chairman of Kurt Salmon, a retail consultants, said the June figures represented a continuation of consumers “doing what they’ve been forced to do: saving more and spending less”.Retailers, he said, had become focused on the autumn shopping season, which they would enter with inventory levels sig­nificantly reduced from last year, when the downturn hit."
262;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Its shares were up 2.7 per cent for the week at $51.07.Retailers posted another month of falling same-store sales. The figures for May came in below analysts’ expectations but most retailers were in positive territory for the week.Macy’s same-store sales dropped 9 per cent but its shares rose 9.7 per cent to $12.81 amid the broader market rally.

Their stocks dropped 6.8 per cent and 9.3 per cent, respectively.The S&P retailing index rose 4.8 per cent over the week. The index is up 20 per cent this year.Investors responded to several pieces of economic data during the course of the week, culminating in Friday’s news that the US economy shed 345,000 jobs in May, bringing the unemployment rate to a 25-year high of 9.4 per cent but offering a clear sign that the pace of job cuts is slowing, according to official figures.In deal news, Intel said it would acquire Wind River Systems for $885m in cash as the world’s largest semiconductor company seeks to move into providing chips for mobile devices.Shares in Intel rose 1.3 per cent to $15.92 while Wind River soared 47.4 per cent to $11.63.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 0.3 per cent for the day and up 2.3 per cent for the week at 940.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was flat on the day and 4.2 per cent higher for the week at 1,849.42. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher for the day and 3.1 per cent for the week at 8,763.13.Analysts at JPMorgan said they believed a global synchronised economic recovery would underpin a sharp move higher in the S&P 500 towards 1,100 by the end of the year.They based this in part on a prediction of a solid recovery in corporate high-grade and high-yield markets, measured in both prices and issuance, which would be supportive of higher valuations for equities.The analysts added that equity investor flows, which recently turned positive, could amount to as much as $300bn over the next 12-18 months.The financial sector was in sharp focus throughout the week as investors responded to the latest round of capital raisings and analyst upgrades for companies including Goldman Sachs.Bank of America, the largest US lender, said it had raised $33bn since early May, putting it within striking distance of the government’s mandate that it raise $33.9bn as a result of the regulatory stress test.The capital raised includes $13.5bn from the sale of common stock. BofA rose 5.2 per cent to $11.86.Goldman was up 3.7 per cent to $149.78 after Sanford Bernstein raised its rating on the bank to “outperform”.

265;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Japanese fall out of love with luxury;;Japan’s trend-chasing office workers and ladies who lunch are giving up Louis Vuitton handbags and Chanel jackets for Zara dresses and Gap jeans, making what was a favourite market for luxury manufacturers into one of their biggest headaches.The downturn is forcing customers in Japan to scale back purchases of luxury goods, accelerating a long-term shift in consumer attitudes, according to a report by McKinsey, the consultants.“This is not a blip. This is a long-term shift in the market,” said Brian Salsberg, the author of a McKinsey report on the Japanese luxury goods market, the world’s second largest.Sales of imported luxury goods suffered a 10 per cent drop last year to Y1,064bn ($11.1bn), according to a study published on Tuesday by Yano Research, a Japanese market research group.Yano Research forecast that the market would shrink further this year, falling below Y1,000bn to nearly half the peak of Y1,897bn in 1996 and then shrinking to levels last seen 20 years ago before it entered its era of strong growth.LVMH, the group with brands ranging from Moët to Louis Vuitton, reported an 18 per cent drop in sales in Japan in yen terms in the first quarter.While luxury sales throughout the world are being hit by the recession, Mr Salsberg said that the implications of the latest slump for Japan were likely to be more serious and long-lasting.Japan became the world’s “only mass luxury market” in the 1980s and early 1990s, when Japanese consumers saw ownership of a Louis Vuitton bag or Hermes scarf as a middle-class rite of passage.But the growing confidence of shoppers in mixing and matching cheap and expensive products, coupled with competition from a growing array of luxury services such as spas and expensive restaurants, have robbed the brands of their hold on such spending.Mr Salsberg said the brand makers, which created “a luxury bubble” with “a ridiculous number of store build-outs”, bore some blame for their predicament. He warned that they risked repeating the mistake in China.China was the “growth story” for luxury but if makers flooded the market with stores as in Japan and people were able to buy such goods on every street corner, “the industry is going to destroy itself” there, he said.
266;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-05-22T20:37:46Z;US stocks sell off ahead of long weekend;;"US stocks ended a week of modest gains on Friday after optimism from home improvement retailer Lowe’s on Monday triggered a rally which fears over the
US credit rating failed to extinguish.Reassuring words from Moody’s on Friday helped calm fears of an imminent downgrade for US sovereign debt as the ratings agency said it was “comfortable” with the triple A rating.But equities suffered a late sell-off to take the markets to a fourth consecutive session of losses as investors repositioned themselves ahead of a three-day weekend.The market was also hampered by the failure of BankUnited, Florida’s largest bank, and the largest US bank to fail this year.But the falls came in spite of several pieces of pieces of positive earnings news.Sears, the largest US department store chain, jumped 10.4 per cent to $55.40 after reporting a surprise profit and far exceeding analysts’ expectations.The company cut costs faster than Wall Street had thought and increased its profit margins.It also said it had been able to extend a credit agreement to increase the amount that it can access to $4.1bn.Gap, the clothing company, beat its own forecasts by a single cent after also successfully cutting costs.It saw slower declines at its Old Navy line, although there was weakness from the more upmarket Banana Republic brand. Its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $16.39.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all fell 0.2 per cent. The S&P finished at 887, the Dow at 8,277.32 and the Nasdaq at 1,692.01 That left them in line for weekly advances of between 0.6 and 1.5 per cent.Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab, said a quiet day with low volumes had seen equities drift ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. “There has got to be a reason for the market to go higher, especially after a 30 per cent rally, and I don’t see any reason for that today,” he said.Brett Hryb, senior portfolio manager at MFC Global added: “Nobody wants to be particularly long or short going into a long weekend.”Campbell Soup was another household consumer name to report its results after the market closed on Thursday, beating predictions with its profit, which was boosted by higher prices. Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $27.35.Meanwhile, Autodesk, the engineering software company whose chief executive Carol Bartz left to take over at Yahoo this year, reported higher profit than expected but said it would make more job cuts as the recession continues to bite. Its shares climbed 9.9 per cent to $20.70.Johnson & Johnson ended 0.4 per cent lower at $54.77 after announcing that it would spend nearly $1bn on acquiring its smaller rival Cougar, which develops cancer drugs. Cougar jumped 15.8 per cent to $42.82.General Motors had a turbulent day. Its shares rose in early pre-market trade on optimism over the price that it could get for Opel, its European business, after China’s Beijing Automotive Industry Corp entered the bidding for the company.They then fell back shortly before the bell after the Washington Post reported that the government could force the company into bankruptcy as early as next week. Later reports denied that the government had any such plans, however, quoting unnamed sources.This sent the shares up sharply in early trade but they then slumped again as bondholders rejected the company’s latest restructuring proposals and the Canadian Auto Workers said it was very likely GM would file for bankruptcy.Its shares closed down 25.5 per cent at $1.43, having earlier hit $2.24.Friday’s falls capped two weeks during which stocks have struggled for momentum, falling 2.3 per cent, amid suggestions the rally that began in March may have stalled."
267;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-04-09T15:23:05Z;US retailers see some signs of demand;;March sales figures from leading US retailers provided some shimmers of light amid the prevailing gloom, with a number of store chains reporting signs of an increased readiness to spend by still-cautious consumers.The months comparable sales figures were affected by the shift in the timing of Easter, which drives gift and clothing sales, from March to April this year. The monthly data from store chains can also reflect specific marketing and merchandising, rather than broader economic trends.But the March sales data offered some signs that middle-class shoppers, who snapped their wallets shut in the fourth quarter of last year, may be starting to resume cautious spending.JC Penney, the US department store focused on middle class consumers, said it had seen “a positive response” in women’s clothing and in its home business” as it reported a better-than-expected 7.6 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. The retailer had forecast a low-double digit to mid-teen drop.The retailer raised its forecast for first quarter earnings, which will include a 23 cent pension costs non-cash charge, seeing a loss of 5 to 10 cents against a previous estimate of a 20 to 30 cent loss.Its rival Kohls reported a 4.3 per cent fall in same store sales. Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said the results “exceeded our expectations” and that home furnishing sales had also been its strongest business.Target, the discounter that is also heavily dependent on clothing and home sales, said it had “begun to see encouraging signs” in the operating results of both its stores and its credit card business. The retailer reported a 6 per cent drop in comparable March sales, but said it expected April sales to be essentially flat, due to the Easter shift.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that comparable sales at its Supercenters and discount stores increased just 0.6 per cent, below Wall Street’s expectations. Including its Sam’s Club warehouses, which saw a 6 per cent increase, the retailer’s overall US same store sales rose by 1.4 per cent.But it said it expected its first quarter earnings to come in at the higher end of the 72 to 77 cents per share it forecast in February.Wal-Mart also reported the sixth consecutive month of increases in customer traffic. It said average transactions were lower, which it attributed to the Easter shift, and to moderating price rises in its grocery sales.The retailer said sales were again driven by grocery and pharmacy sales, but said that its home and “do-it-yourself” categories had seen mid-single digit comparable store sales gains.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks reporting comparables sales falls of 29.9 per cent and 23.6 per cent. Both reported weakness across all their merchandise categories.Elsewhere, Gap reported an 8 per cent fall in comparable sales, but said it had stopped the sales decline during the month at its troubled Old Navy division. Gap brand US sales were down 14 per cent, and Banana Republic fell 16 per cent. But the retailer said it had achieved profit margins above those seen last year.Despite the outbreaks of optimism, overall March sales fell by more than Wall Street expected. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index fell 1.6 per cent, against the 0.6 per cent fall it had been expecting. But it also noted that several retailers including Hot Topic, American Eagle and Cache, the fashion retailers, as well as “off price” discounters TJX and Ross Stores had raised first quarter earnings guidance.
268;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-03-23T22:04:13Z;Amazon launches accesories brand in Japan;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, has launched a new e-commerce brand in Japan focused exclusively on shoes and accessories, in part of a broader international expansion of the business category.The new Japanese site, Javari, mirrors the retailer’s Endless.com business in the US, which Amazon opened in January 2007, establishing its first separate e-commerce brand.In the US, the company has described shoes as its “fastest growing retail category”, although it does not break out sales for the business. The online shoe business was previously largely dominated by Zappos, an e-commerce start-up that established a strong customer base with its extensive inventory and free return shipping policy.Gap, the clothing retailer, also launched a separate online shoe and handbag site in the US, called Piperlime, in October 2006.The new Javari site in Japan is constructed with the same architecture and features of the US Endless site, suggesting Amazon could easily expand the business into other international markets where it already has a presence.The company’s UK subsidiary this month started recruiting an expanded team of shoe buyers, saying it intended to expand its online shoe business to offer “more choice than any other retailer at amazing prices.”“Going forward we will be focusing on the continued expansion of this store, building supplier partnerships and improving the customer offering,” the company said in a job advertisement.Both the German and French subsidiaries are also currently recruiting buyers and merchandisers for shoes and handbags - categories currently not included on its French site.In an indication of the fierce competition underway in the online shoe business in the US, Endless, Zappos and Piperlime are currerently all offering customers both free shipping and free returns.Amazon’s five international sites - which also include China - accounted for 45 per cent of its sales in its last quarter of its 2008 financial year. International sales growth also outpaced North America, with sales on a constant currency basis up 31 per cent during the quarter, against 18 per cent in North America.
269;GPS;Gap Inc;2009-02-05T19:36:26Z;US retailers report grim January;;After the toughest Christmas season in decades, US retailers on Thursday reported grim January sales figures that underlined the intensity of their struggle for survival.Gap’s Old Navy stores delivered one of the worst performances, with comparable sales down by more than a third. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 23 per cent drop, echoing the 24.4 per cent drop at Neiman Marcus announced this week.Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, the youth fashion stores, also reported sales down by more than 20 per cent, while JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw mid-teen percentage drops.In contrast, Wal-Mart, the low-cost retailer, again outperformed rivals, with same-store sales up 2.1 per cent for the month, ahead of its own expectations.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart USA, said comparable sales for the past 52 weeks were three times higher than the previous year. “Clearly, our stores are performing very well,” he said.The retailer reported strong sales growth in groceries and healthcare but also said it outperformed the market in sales of home and entertainment products.The comparative strength of discount stores was underlined by Dollar Tree, the chain that sells items for only $1, which reported a 2.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its quarter ending January 31.In contrast, Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, and said it had seen a decline of more than 20 per cent in sales of women’s clothing. The retailer lowered its fourth-quarter earnings guidance.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales, said its index of same-store sales from leading retailers fell 1.8 per cent for the month, the fourth consecutive month the index had fallen.Retailers have announced several thousand job cuts this year, including 1,100 jobs at Saks and 7,000 at Macy’s. Most have also indicated that they are sharply reducing inventory levels.Chris Donnelly, a retail consultant at Accenture, said: “The name of the game is to focus on cash, keep inventories low, and try to ride this thing out.”But he also noted that retailers faced the challenge of managing cutbacks while trying to maintain the customers’ experience of their stores.“Can retailers manage cuts without damaging the customer experience? It is a fine balancing act, so that people don’t feel that they are either going out of business, or are a frustrating place to shop.”
270;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-12-04T20:24:02Z;US retailers suffer worst month this decade;;US retailers experienced their worst month this decade in November, as stores such as Macy’s, Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch reported double-digit falls in comparable store sales amid the economic gloom.But Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, led a small band of retailers that managed to deliver comparable sales growth during the month, beating its own forecast with a 3.4 per cent increase.The retailer said it had seen rises in both customer numbers and average spending per trip, and had benefited from the rapid fall in petrol prices.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said it was “extremely difficult” to provide sales guidance in the current environment, but Wal-Mart forecast December comparable sales at the high end of its quarterly growth estimate of 1-3 per cent.Costco, a warehouse club, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent at US stores, excluding petrol. Its rival BJ’s said sales rose 6.2 per cent. Sales at Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart’s warehouse unit, were up 3.5 per cent.Reflecting increasingly value-focused shopping, Family Dollar, which operates a large chain of small hard-discount stores, also reported a 2.1 per cent gain in comparable sales for the quarter ending November 30.Elsewhere, the figures were largely bleak. Poor performances were exacerbated by a difficult comparison with last year, when the Thanksgiving holiday fell earlier in November and boosted seasonal shopping at the end of the month.While several retailers reported strong sales at the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales, it was not enough to make up for the weakness.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales figures, said its comparable sales index fell 1.8 per cent, the worst monthly performance this decade. Without Wal-Mart, the index would have dropped 9.3 per cent.Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 10.4 per cent drop in comparable sales, worse than its predicted range of a fall of 6-9 per cent.Department stores also struggled, with Macy’s down 13.3 per cent, JC Penney down 11.9 per cent, and Kohl’s down 17.5 per cent. Among speciality clothing retailers, Gap was down 10 per cent, while comparable sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer, dropped 28 per cent.
271;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-12-04T14:00:19Z;Grim corporate news dents mood on Wall St;;A host of glum corporate developments in a wide range of sectors from telecoms to retail were set to push Wall Street stocks lower on Thursday.Merck lost 2.7 per cent to $25.59 in pre-market trade after the drugmaker issued lower guidance for next year. Cost-cutting plans from Dupont failed to stop the shares losing 7.4 per cent after the chemical maker forecast a fourth-quarter loss.Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were down 13.9 points at 854.60, Nasdaq 100 futures were down 15.75 points at 1,140.25, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 137 points at 8,442.In economic news, Labor Department data showed the number of new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell by 21,000 last week.However, continuing claims were worse than expected. Some 4.09m fired workers received benefits in the week to November 22, the most since December 1982, according to Bloomberg.AT&T was up 1 per cent to $28.31 after the group became the latest to unveil substantial cuts to its workforce. The phone company said it would cut 12,000 jobs, about 4 per cent of its total headcount and that capital spending in 2009 would be lower than this year.Another bright spot was Wal-Mart, up 4.5 per cent to $55.85 on the back of better-than-expected revenue. Bargain-hunting consumers helped the discounter lift like-for-like sales for November 3.4 per cent.However, other retailers – which benefited earlier in the week on reports that sales during the Thanksgiving shopping weekend may not have been as bad as expected – could come under pressure after the release of more downbeat sales figures.Target, another discounter, was pushed 5 per cent lower to $32.76 by poorly-received figures.Abercrombie & Fitch was pushed 0.5 per cent lower to $16.50 by a 28 per cent drop in November same-store sales, although Gap was flat at $12.87 in spite of a 10 per cent drop in like-for-like sales.The future of the country’s car makers was likely to be among the primary investor concerns. General Motors tumbled 9.3 per cent to $4.40 and Ford lost 0.4 per cent to $2.69 ahead of fresh executive testimony to plead for aid before Congress, due later in the session.“Will GM Get It?” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients. “At [a] minimum, we see ‘A Bridge to Bridge Loan”. We anticipate GM’s comprehensive and newly specific plan is likely to meet with significantly improved reception upon Capital Hill.”However, it added that even were the group to be granted the funds, “significant risks remain given the perilous operating environment.”European stocks were higher ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 2 per cent to 846.32. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, although Chinese shares were higher on a report that the government may support the country’s banks by injecting funds.Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was 1 basis point higher at 0.892 per cent while the 10-year Treasury note was 1 basis points lower at 2.648 per cent.The rate at which banks lend to each other, measured by three month dollar Libor, fell for a third day to 2.19 per cent.Gold was trading $0.5 lower at $770 per troy ounce.The energy sector could come under pressure as oil prices were lower early in New York. US crude prices were $0.97 lower at $48.90 a barrel.
272;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-12-01T00:26:59Z;Frédéric Dalsace: Learn marketing from Harry Potter;;Professor Frédéric Dalsace is shouldering an almighty task: that of finding a new model for business in the 21st century.On December 5, the marketing innovator will be appointed to a new chair of Social Business at HEC, the Paris business school. His mission is to bring fresh thinking to the role of business in a world where unbridled profit-seeking has brought financial instability and environmental concerns. And to share those thoughts with 500 students on HEC’s masters programme.The French title of the chair – Entreprise et Pauvreté, drawing the link between business and poverty – gives a better sense of just how radical the project is.The two co-presidents of the chair, whose role is to supervise Prof Dalsace, are Nobel prize-winner Muhammad Yunus, the entrepreneurial Bangladeshi economist who built a successful micro-finance institution, and Martin Hirsch, former head of revered French homeless charity Emmaüs and now a French government adviser on action against poverty.Much of the chair’s five-year, €1m-plus funding, is provided by Danone, the French bottled water, dairy and foods group, which has a novel business in Bangladesh that makes high-nutrition yoghurt that is sold by collaborators of Prof Yunus’s Grameen network.Yet as the presidency of Mr Hirsch makes clear, this is not just about concocting some new recipe to make capitalism more digestible in developing countries.“There is no crisis today,” says Prof Dalsace. “It is the end of an era and the beginning of a new era. We have to reinvent the world.“What distinguishes us from animals is that we know we are going to die. We now are too slowly realising that our planet is going to die, that we take too much, that the way we are doing it is not sustainable.”Society, and politicians, should not just focus on a return to economic growth, he says. “We have to shift away from a business model built around quarterly earnings to a new model.”Prof Dalsace does not pretend that he expects to solve the problem. But he hopes to shed some light and stimulate thought. He cites Prof Yunus’s belief that there are “two kinds of firm: profit-maximising businesses, and social businesses – those that neither pay dividends, nor lose money, but which distribute wealth, work and products that answer fundamental needs.”Prof Dalsace says: “My belief is that there is space between these two types, as firms could learn to become profit-satisfiers, and redistribute the surplus to other stakeholders.”Does that sound like communism, he asks with a chuckle? The roots could hardly lie further from Karl Marx. They are more likely to be found in the fabric of France where, as often elsewhere in continental Europe, mutual organisations still play a big part in the financial sector, and where Catholic traditions disparage the selfish pursuit of wealth and emphasise social solidarity.Maybe this is not as strange as it might at first sound in a world reared on Max Weber’s century-old The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.The idea also gels with studies of under 25-year-olds everywhere – the so-called Generation Y – who aspire to a better balance between work, life and doing good.And it is no coincidence that Prof Dalsace and his wife, Marie-Aude, a professor of communications, have children aged 15, 12 and 7.Unlike most of his peers, Prof Dalsace, aged 45, became an academic through his love of teaching. After graduating at HEC, he started his career in a pair of classic old-economy companies: tyre-maker Michelin and packaging group CarnaudMetalbox. He then did an MBA at Harvard, and subsequently joined McKinsey, the consultancy.He acquired a part-time job teaching at Sciences-Po, the Paris university, at 6pm on a Friday evening – a make-or-break challenge.It made him.“I love to teach,” he says. “I think it’s the most important job we have.” After earning a PhD from Insead, he became associate professor of marketing at HEC, specialising in selling from one business to another. Interesting masters and MBA students in how to sell widgets was another tough challenge, but the post also confirmed his talent for research.The most striking fruit of that talent was his notion for the Harry Potter marketing strategy. While reading with his children, Prof Dalsace realised that part of the success of JK Rowling’s teenage wizard novels was that the characters matured, building more intimate connections with readers.He concluded that brands prospered by ageing with their customers, and the more marketing professionals he talked to, the more examples emerged, from the Rolling Stones to Harley Davidson motorcycles. Brands such as Gap, in clothing, or Club Mediterranée, in holidays, that failed to change their offer as their loyal customers aged risked decline.From there, it was a short step to propose that, for some products or services, it might make commercial sense for a successful brand to evolve with the cohort of consumers who had become loyal to it. That could involve changing the content of the brand, its distribution channels, and so on as the purchasing cohort aged. This was radical stuff.“Every brand manager dreams of an eternal brand,” says Prof Dalsace. In reality, constantly re-launching a brand to appeal to a younger cohort might cost more than allowing brands to mature and retain existing clientele at low cost, whilst launching new brands for younger groups of customers.The striking connection between Harry Potter marketing and the new chair of Social Business is that, in both cases, Prof Dalsace is demanding companies think about ageing – and death.As individuals, these are issues we prefer to avoid. But if companies are to achieve the goal of immortality, he believes, they need to confront them, and learn to reinvent themselves as their customers, and the world, both change.
273;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-11-21T22:51:13Z;Dramatic turnaround as bargain hunters arrive;;A euphoric rally drew a torrid week for US stocks to a close on Friday as reports that President-elect Barack Obama had selected Timothy Geithner to be his Treasury secretary helped the market bounce from an 11-year low.Investors welcomed the prospect of an early appointment as it reduced the threat of lingering political uncertainty that could further destabilise markets during the transition period.“We’ve had a lack of leadership at the top,” said Jim Paulsen, strategist at Wells Capital Management. “Most of all it’s just a reminder that we’re having a change.”Citigroup was a notable loser after Vikram Pandit, chief executive, said he had no plans to break up the embattled bank.Up as much as 17.4 per cent early in the session on hopes of a split, sale or intervention by the authorities, the stock closed down 20 per cent to $3.77 and lost 60.4 per cent over the week.The benchmark S&P 500 index endured losses that hit 1.5 per cent at one point as fears over Citi’s fate mounted, but finished up 6.3 per cent to 800.03 after a wave of buying in the last hour of trading.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 6.5 per cent stronger at 8,046.42 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 5.2 per cent at 1,384.35.Gains in technology failed to benefit Dell, down 5.2 per cent to $9.30 as sales trailed forecasts. Cost cutting helped the computer maker unveil better-than-expected profit, but UBS analysts warned “revenue declines may catch up to the bottom line.”Wal-Mart climbed 4.5 per cent to $52.92 after investors appeared to welcome Lee Scott’s replacement as chief executive with Mike Duke, head of its international operation. Among the more spectacular gains, Gap leapt 27.2 per cent to $12.10 after the retailer became one of the few in the sector to reaffirm profit forecasts.Energy stocks recovered much of their weekly losses, up 11.7 per cent overall, as oil prices rallied back above the $50 a barrel level hit earlier in the week.In spite of the market’s spectacular gains, the S&P still lost 8.4 per cent over the week, the Dow 5.3 per cent and the Nasdaq 8.7 per cent.The chilling prospect of a deflationary economy and collapsed car industry pushed the market to two grim milestones, first to a 5½-year low and subsequently to levels not seen since 1997. Analysts said it was significant that the S&P 500 had breached the closing low of 776.76 of October 2002.Some observers warned of the dangers of bargain hunting despite the brutal sell-off. “Currently there are some analysts stating that stocks are cheap and you should enter the market going long equities,” said Christian Blaabjerg of Saxo Bank. “We disagree – we still see stock markets going lower from here.”The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, surpassed the 80 level for the first time this month. “People are more numbed than they are fearful,” said Joseph Cusick of Options-Xpress. “Investors aren’t even looking at their portfolios any more.”General Motors and Ford gained 1.7 per cent to $3.06 per cent and lost 20.6 per cent to $1.43 over the week after Democratic leaders in Congress refused to hand over cash immediately to help the carmakers but urged executives to make another case next month.Concerns over the fate of the pair, along with privately-held Chrysler, have dogged the market for weeks and the bankruptcy of either would be the biggest business failure in US history.Financials were the biggest losers of the week, down 23.7 per cent overall on fears that recent capital raisings may not be sufficient for institutions to withstand more losses.On a brighter note, Grand Canyon Education, the first US initial public offering for more than three months, kicked off trading this week and edged up from its float price of $12. It closed at $12.35.
274;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-11-21T20:50:45Z;Retailers to ramp up price cutting;;Retailers are set to step up price cutting in the run-up to Christmas after a week of sales and promotions aimed at luring reluctant shoppers into stores.The “guerrilla” sale run by Marks and Spencer this week caught the competition on the hop and sparked copy-cat discounting across the high street as rival retailers scrambled to compete with the UK’s biggest clothing chain. More is likely to come.A combination of sluggish spending and tightening credit is making life hard for even the more robust retail chains. Many are deciding that they would rather sacrifice profit margins than be left with piles of stock in the new year, when consumers are likely to be even less willing to spend.Marks and Spencer’s one-day 20 per cent off sale on Thursday came together in a matter of days as it decided that its Christmas trading needed a lift.While Sir Stuart Rose, executive chairman of M&S, declared that his “spectacular” day had “touched the spot” with cash-strapped shoppers, it also hit a raw nerve with the rest of a jittery retail sector. Andy Bond, chief executive of Asda, said he was bemused by the level of discounting that has hit the high street.“People are not holding their nerve,” said Mr Bond. “There is a little bit of panic out there, although conversely this is good for consumers. But this activity should have happened next week when people have been paid [their monthly wages]. I don’t understand why they have done it now.”Mr Bond thinks that the sluggish start to festive spending could be more a reflection of the way Christmas falls this year than a wholesale boycott of the festive spirit. “Christmas is two days later and that will make a difference on spending patterns,” he said.But with Asda and the Centre of Economic and Business research, predicting a fall in spending of up to 5 per cent, some retailers are not prepared to gamble on a last-minute surge.Having opened the floodgates, there is no going back. “There will have to be more promotional activity towards the end of the month because that is when everybody gets paid,” said Maureen Hinton, senior analyst at Verdict Research. “So this is going to be the last chance to get as much of the money out there as possible.”Some chains, from Selfridges to Gap, are running promotions through the internet. In a more subtle tactic retailers will send out batches of discount vouchers on emails to friends and family. These soon get forwarded on to more people, catalysing a surreptitious sale that most customers remain oblivious to.But while the sales are good news for shoppers, they do not bode well for retailers’ profits.A growing list of retailers are facing the threat of administration as they struggle to navigate through sluggish spending and tightening credit conditions.Woolworths was fighting to stay in business on Friday amid increasingly acrimonious talks with creditors.One administrator said he was busier than he had ever been. “The question used to be ‘have you got the expertise to do this?’,” he said. “Now it is ‘do you have the capacity?’.”Tony Shiret, analyst at Credit Suisse on Friday reduced his profit forecast for M&S in the year to March 2009 by 12 per cent to £560m, citing concerns over recent performance.“The reason that [sale] day happened is because of what happened six weeks before. Sales have obviously been poor. This will have a knock-on effect on gross margin and profit forecasts.”
275;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-11-20T23:12:36Z;US stocks reach grim milestone;;More than a decade of growth has been wiped from US stocks after mounting fears over the health of the economy and financial system on Thursday pushed the market to levels not seen since 1997.The grim milestone was passed after data showed new claims for unemployment benefits hit their highest since 1992, oil dropped beneath $50 a barrel and Citigroup continued its descent.Trading was highly volatile after computer algorithms began buying stocks when a key technical level – the closing low of October 2002 – was hit in the morning session. The market subsequently rallied briefly but the gains soon fizzled out.A brutal sell-off worsened into the close when the barrier was breached late in the day. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said the market was “feeding on itself” after a “technical breakdown”.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down 6.7 per cent to 752.44 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.6 per cent to 7,552.29 and the Nasdaq Composite index slid 5.1 per cent at 1,316.12.General Motors and Fordsank as much as 39.1 per cent and 19.8 per cent, respectively, as the clock continued to tick for the embattled pair’s executives to secure a bail-out from Washington.Yet they finished up 3.2 per cent to $2.88 and 10.3 per cent to $1.39 after Democratic leaders in Congress refused to hand over cash immediately but urged executives to make another case for their consideration next month.Makers of car parts remained under heavy pressure. Lear and Goodyear Tire & Rubber lost 12.3 per cent to $1 and 13.5 per cent to $4.18, respectively.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose above 80 for the first time this month. It has been at historically high levels since the crisis worsened in September.Financials were again among the biggest losers, down 10.5 per cent overall on fears that recent capital raisings may not be sufficient for institutions to withstand more losses, particularly on the large amounts of assets linked to mortgages.Analysts said the sector has come under heavy selling pressure since the Treasury’s U-turn on plans to buy these toxic assets.Analysts at Friedman, Billing, Ramsey said the government needed to inject at least $1,000bn into the financial system to restore confidence and improve liquidity.Topping a long list of traders’ concerns, Citigroup dropped a further 26.4 per cent to $4.71 on the prospect of mortgage-backed asset writedowns.The speed of the decline of Citigroup shares will make it even harder for the bank to raise capital. Analysts were particularly concerned about the slide, which came even after Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said that he would increase his stake to 5 per cent.Just as fears over the health of the nation’s financial institutions mounted, fresh evidence emerged of increasing difficulties in the so-called real economy. Ian Griffiths, a dealer at CMC Markets, said: “Recession fears continue to cause traders to panic and there doesn’t seem to be light at the end of the tunnel just yet.”The energy sector was the biggest loser of the day, down 11.2 per cent, as oil retreated below $50 a barrel for the first time in almost two years.More positive news came from the technology sector after the closing bell, when cost-cutting helped Dell unveiled a better-than-expected quarterly profit. The shares, off 5.2 per cent to $9.81, recovered 4.4 per cent in after hours trade.In the consumer sector, Barnes & Noble and GameStop lost 6.5 per cent to $12.25 and 14.9 per cent to $17.50 following downbeat earnings outlooks.Gap, off 5.8 per cent to $9.51, was flat after the bell, when the group reiterated its profit forecast.Grand Canyon Education, the first US initial public offering for more than three months, kicked off trading on Thursday with a 1.3 per cent fall from the $12 a share offering.Meanwhile, David Buik of BGC Partners said that the market declines disqualified a third of the S&P index from membership. Some 186 companies listed now had a market capitalisation of less than $4bn, he said, the minimum value required for inclusion.
276;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-09-22T21:09:27Z;Gap aims at women’s sportswear;;Gap, the US speciality clothing retailer, is acquiring Athleta, a women’s sportwear retail brand, in a $150m deal that marks its first acquisition for over 20 years.The move will take Gap the rapidly expanding $36bn market for women’s “active” clothing, which ranges from work-out wear to sport-inspired every-day fashion.Athleta was founded ten years ago in California, and currently operates as a direct-to-consumer retailer, selling its own-label products such as yoga pants and swimsuits via its website and catalogues to women aged mostly between 25 and 55.Gap said that initially the brand’s site will be added to its unified US website, which allows customers to combine online shopping at its Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Piperlime brands.Athleta’s current CEO, Joe Teno, will remain as president of the brand, reporting to Tony Lenk, the head of Gap’s online operations.However, a Gap spokeswoman, said that company will “of course consider whether other options, including bricks and mortar stores, might make sense over time.”Gap’s last acquisitions were in the early 1980s, when it bought Banana Republic – then just two stores – in 1983. It acquired Pottery Barn, the home furnishings retailer, the following year, but sold it two years later.Two years ago it abandoned its efforts to develop a fourth store chain, Forth & Towne, aimed at older women. Gap has also been struggling to revitalise its Gap and Old Navy brands, whose conventional casual clothes have been losing customers to rival retailers.Glenn Murphy, who took over as CEO of Gap 18 months ago, said the acquisition of Athleta “complements our brands perfectly and allows us to leverage our new online platform to expand into this significant retail sector.”No details of Athleta’s sales were released.The growth of the category has attracted both existing sportswear brands such as Nike and Puma and newer entrants such as Lululemon, a “yoga-inspired” brand that was launched in Vancouver, Canada in the same year as Athleta. Lululemon now has around 80 stores, with over 30 more planned to open this year in North America, and expected annual sales of around $380m.
277;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-08-07T18:26:30Z;Hard-up US shoppers spurn bigger stores;;The boost to US retailers from about $100bn of tax rebate cheques has proved short-lived, with leading chains on Thursday reporting sluggish or falling sales in July, while Wal-Mart warned of slowing sales ahead.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said it expected August sales in stores open at least a year to grow by between 1 and 2 per cent, after reporting 3 per cent sales growth in July.“With the end of the stimulus checks, we know consumers are spending more cautiously, and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month,” said Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US business.Consumers received about $100bn in rebate checks between April and mid-July as part of the Bush administrations’ economic stimulus package from earlier this year. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said its index of comparable retail sales for July rose 2.3 per cent.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that positive factors such as warm weather and the back-to-school shopping season “could not overcome broader macro-economic drags”.The latest monthly sales figures from retailers underlined shifts in US shopping habits identified by Procter & Gamble and other suppliers, as more frugal consumers turn to discount stores, warehouse clubs and to hard discount “dollar stores” and make fewer shopping trips to reduce fuel costs.Mr Castro-Wright said Wal-Mart was also continuing “to see improvement in our customer traffic, relative to last year”, an indication that the low-cost stores are attracting shoppers from rivals.Target, Wal-Mart’s smaller and more upmarket competitor, reported a 1.3 per cent fall in comparable sales, and predicted a further decline in August.Costco, the largest US warehouse club, also reported healthy results for the month, with same store sales excluding fuel sales up 6 per cent in the US.Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,000 small hard-discount stores, saw its comparable sales rise 4.6 per cent, following an 8 per cent increase in June.Department stores and clothing retailers continued to feel the pressure on their monthly sales figures, as they try to stock less, in response to slower demand, and avoid ending up with excess inventory that has to be cleared at sale prices.JC Penney, the mid-range department store whose performance has tracked the broader decline in consumer spending, reported a 6.5 per cent fall in comparable sales, although last July’s numbers were boosted by a shift in reporting of back-to-school sales. But the company predicted sales growth in the low single-digits in August. It also raised its earnings guidance for the current quarter, from 38 cents to 50 to 52 cents, citing effective cost management and inventory control. Its shares rose more than 7 per cent.Its rival, Kohl’s, reported a 10 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. Larry Montgomery, its CEO, said that the reduced inventory had depressed sales but led to improved gross margins.Gap, the largest speciality retailer, said its comparable sales fell 5 per cent, while the figure for its Old Navy stores was down 16 per cent. However, the company said it had successfully increased its margins, it also raised its earnings guidance, to $1.30 to $1.35 from its previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.27.
278;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-08-04T18:32:37Z;Amazon to boost focus on loyalty schemes;;Amazon, the online retailer, wants to sell more goods and digital downloads for loyalty programme points rather than money, as it builds on its experiences supporting a points-redemption promotion for Pepsi.The retailer says in a current job advertisement that it is planning to create a “new rewards redemption platform business” as part of its global payments system, a move that may be aimed both at its own credit card users and members of other loyalty programmes.Loyalty programmes operated by airlines, credit card companies, retailers and others are an increasingly important marketing battleground in the US. LoyaltyOne Consulting, which has worked with a range of leading US companies’ loyalty schemes, estimates that an average family is enrolled in 12 programmes, and actively participates in four to five.Amazon, like other US retailers such as Gap, rewards users of its branded credit cards with gift cards linked to purchases. Leading supermarkets have also linked loyalty card points to cheaper petrol at their filling stations. Best Buy, the electronics chain, has created a programme that allows its customers to exchange loyalty points for goods.Leading credit cards and airlines have increasingly begun using their online presence to give loyalty programme members the opportunity to trade points for goods from leading retailers.Kelly Hlavinka, of LoyaltyOne, noted that programmes operated by airlines and hotels were increasingly offering merchandise. “They have people who have used a lot of points and the opportunity to use them may be limited …so they are looking to broaden their redemption portfolios to give customers a bigger choice for where they burn their points,” she said.American Express’s Shop­Amex site, for instance, offers an online comparison site that allows points accumulated under its Membership Rewards programme to be redeemed on a vast range of products at participating retailers, including Amazon.American Express said merchandise exchange “was really an area that we’re focused on over the past few years, as people have become more aware of it”.Under Amazon’s “Pepsi Stuff” collaboration in the US, the online retailer operates a website where Pepsi’s customers register purchases, acquiring points that can be exchanged for music downloads and a limited selection of electronics and branded clothing.Ms Hlavinka noted that Amazon’s product range and brand could make it an attractive partner for companies that did not see it as a direct competitor.
279;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-07-26T01:26:11Z;Take the long view;;"Forget the one-versus-two-buttons debate, or the can-you-wear-colourful-socks-in-the-boardroom question. When it comes to dividing men along fashion lines, nothing is more heated than the topic of shirtsleeves. Short or long? That is the question.And despite the fact that we are fast approaching the dog days of summer, for most men, it seems, there is still only one answer.“Only T-shirts and polo shirts can have short sleeves”, declares Rufus Albemarle, the British-born designer who last year launched a collection of hand-stitched shirts.Dress shirts and business shirts all have one thing in common: long sleeves. “Short sleeves should never be worn unless you’re on safari,” says the Earl of March, of Goodwood fame. Meanwhile, at the other end of the style barometer, London mayor Boris Johnson adds: “Long sleeves are best because you can always roll them up.”Italian Vogue’s Carlo Ducci knows exactly what’s happening on the catwalk. He says, “In my opinion, shirts must always have long sleeves unless that is they are Hawaiian style or something you would wear to the gym. Besides, long sleeve shirts are more adaptable. The only accessory I like for men are cuff-links and even if I buy a shirt from say, the Gap, I’ll have the cuffs adapted to fit them.”New York lawyer and author Roger Kirby is another advocate of the long sleeve. “Long sleeves, always – except during sporting exertions. Short sleeves, after all, carry the whiff of the simian: isn’t it the chimpanzee that generally performs in something less than a long sleeve?”Gianluca Vialli, ex-manager of Chelsea football club, also bats (or should that be shoots) for the long sleeve. “I only ever wear short sleeves to play football or golf – but they’re polo shirts – not shirts.”French fashion designer Emanuel Ungaro adds: “What I find deeply unattractive are short sleeves,” while Diego Della Valle, chief executive and president of Tods shoes, says, “I only wear light-blue (white for special occasions) buttoned-down Oxford cotton or jean shirts, and I’ve only ever worn long sleeves. They’re just smarter.”According to Palestinian-born Middle East affairs writer Said Aburish, short sleeves are equivalent to short socks. “Both of these expose parts of the body that aren’t particularly attractive,” he notes.Similarly, Luca di Montezemolo, chairman of carmaker Fiat, says: “I absolutely never wear short-sleeved shirts, nor short socks. If it’s extremely hot, then I’ll simply roll my sleeves up a little.”Count Giberto Arrivabene, a Venetian glass designer who lives on the Grand Canal, admits to having only ever owned one short-sleeved shirt: “It was a green one, from when I did my military service. I still wear it sometimes, but only at sea.”Film director Hugh Hudson, (Chariots of Fire, Greystoke, Revolution) also restricts his short sleeves to a specific context. “I made three films in Africa,” he says. “It’s so hot that you can only wear short sleeves on set.” But there is, he says, another exception to the rule. “If you have tattoos, then short sleeves are essential wear, because the tattoo becomes the sleeve. I’m thinking of getting some.”But it’s not only men in the boardroom or at the peak of their careers who seem to favour long sleeves. So too does a 15-year-old Etonian, who asked not to be named. “For a start, the shorter variety look quite odd – they make you look as if you are in the armed forces, not dressed for dinner.”The length of the sleeve seems to be one area in which a man’s fidelity is rock solid. Like the political party they choose to support their entire lives, their allegiance to the long-sleeved shirt shows no sign of swaying.…………………………………………………From crystal cufflinks to elastic armbandsThere is something childish about short-sleeved shirts, suggestive as they are of school or cub scout uniforms, writes Josh Sims. Besides which, long sleeves can always be rolled up, resulting – hey presto – in a short-sleeved shirt that still has the suggestion of a man at work.Long sleeves also create a rare opportunity for self-expression in formal men’s wear, in the cufflink. Just as a man’s tie can send a clear message about the wearer, translating that via the cufflink has become even more of a fine art.According to Simon Carter, managing director of the eponymous men’s accessories brand, crystal cufflinks are the big sellers, replacing enamel as a way of introducing colour.However, classic, plain, Georg Jensen-style textured metals are also in the ascendant. “Call it credit crunch chic,” says Carter, “but when times are tough, there is a demand for a more business-like appearance.”Indeed, self-expression can go too far: novelty cufflinks should be understated, such as the precious metal cigars and crocodiles from William & Son.Meanwhile the choice of a link-free cuff also makes the long-sleeved shirt a point of difference: double cuffs may allow for printed or contrasting inserts, but even the single cuff is now, as Touker Suleyman, chairman of Jermyn Street shirtmakers Hawes & Curtis, puts it, “a key but understated way of making a shirt look different.”Piping, three-button fastenings and a variety of cuts – longer or with curved edges – all assist in reviving the long-sleeve shirt as an interesting garment after years as a commodity item.Don’t, however, be tempted to take the idea of accessories too far. Although Simon Carter is seeing increased orders for elasticated armbands, these are, he says, “more practical than fashion items – for keeping your sleeves out of the ink”. In other words, a look more suited to croupiers, saloon keepers and sheriffs in westerns.www.simoncarter.net

280;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wal-Mart’s sales provide bright spot;;Wal-Mart provided some rare good news from the US consumer on Thursday, delivering surprisingly strong sales for June as retail spending was boosted by federal tax rebates.In a sign that consumers were trading down to cheaper stores amid soaring oil and food prices, same-store sales at Wal-Mart’s US stores rose 5.8 per cent, excluding fuel, above its own expectations of a 2-4 per cent rise.The increase eclipsed the strong growth seen across the industry fuelled by the tax rebates. US same-store sales in June rose an average of 4 per cent, according to consultant firm Retail Metrics. The data beat forecasts by the most since September 2003. Analysts had expected 2.6 per cent.Wal-Mart had mounted a major advertising campaign to let consumers know that they could cash their rebate cheques at its stores and the company said it had benefited from the government’s attempt to boost consumer spending.Industry sales were also boosted by warm weather, which lifted summer seasonal merchandise sales, as well as heavy price-cutting and promotions.Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose in June across all of its merchandise but the strongest growth came in the grocery, entertainment and health business lines. Net sales were up 11.5 per cent, including a 16.9 per cent rise in international sales and a 10.1 per cent jump in Wal-Mart’s domestic sales. The strong international sales were driven in part by results from Asda in the UK, which grew faster than the market because of higher customer traffic, the company said.Wal-Mart raised its profit forecast for the second quarter by two cents to 84 cents a share.“The key story is that the rebate cheques finally kicked in,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. “They started to flow at the beginning of May, but gas prices were still rising fast then.”Wal-Mart said post-rebate outlook remained cloudy but it expected same-store sales to grow 2-4 per cent in July.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 9 per cent jump in same-store sales in June in the US and an 11 per cent rise including its international business. Analysts had expected an 8.1 per cent advance in US sales.As the rebate spending wanes, expectations are that spending will slow. “We’re sceptical that people will keep spending and we expect a very tough time for retailers over the rest of the year,” said Mr Perkins.
281;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-07-08T20:37:10Z;Wall Street rallies in late trade;;Wall Street stocks rallied the most in over a month on Tuesday, bouncing back from bear market territory as falling commodity prices boosted consumer facing stocks and financials roared ahead.Oil was the prime mover on Tuesday, falling about $6 a barrel and dropping below $137 a barrel.That retreat, and some new data showing that tax rebates continue to fuel spending helped consumer-facing stocks. Gap added 5.6 per cent to $16.75 and Ford rose 9.6 per cent to $4.90 while the consumer discretionary sector advanced 2.2 per cent.Office Depot, however, was a weak spot, dropping 31.6 per cent to $7.08 after it said North American same-store sales fell nearly 10 per cent in the second quarter and it warned on operating margins.Consumer staples also fared well, climbing 1.5 per cent. SuperValu rose 5 per cent to $32.67 while Wal-Mart rose 3.9 per cent to $59.11.Results from Pepsi Bottling Group took some of the shine off the sector, however. The company posted second-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations but investors were unimpressed, trimming the share price by 2.7 per cent to $27.88.Industrials and healthcare stocks also advanced, adding 0.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.An analyst upgrade boosted United Parcel Service 4.3 per cent to $60.40 while falling oil prices helped other transport-related stocks gain.GE climbed 3.5 per cent to $28.06, CSX advanced 6.9 per cent to $60.79 and Ryder System rose 4.4 per cent to $70.08.In healthcare sector, stocks rallied a day after S&P equity strategists upgraded the group to “market weight” arguing that with equity volatility likely to remain elevated and valuations low, “investors will re-focus on healthcare’s defensive qualities, allowing for better relative performance. ”Schering-Plough was among the leading gainers, climbing 4.6 per cent to $20.86 after it said its experimental treatment for infertility had met its main goals in a late-stage study.Biogen Idec and Abbott Laboratories gained 6.9 per cent to $62.94 and 5.9 per cent to $57.37 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day up 1.7 per cent at 1,273.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 11,384.21 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent at 2,294.42. Both indices moved out of bear market territory.Financials stocks climbed sharply, adding 5.7 per cent for their biggest one day gain since early April. The Federal Reserve chairman suggested the central bank would give investment banks access to emergency cash into 2009 while the chief executive of JP Morgan said credit losses would ease.The news offered the sector some consolation after a volatile start to the week in which they re-tested five year lows.The most heavily sold stocks made the strongest advances. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual jumped, soaring 11.9 per cent to $17.62, 13 per cent to $13.64 and 16.8 per cent to $5.99 respectively.On Monday a wave of speculation that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government sponsored mortgage entities, might have to raise capital to retain their triple A credit ratings triggered heavy selling .In spite of Ben Bernanke’s soothing comments, there were some moments of excitement.IndyMac Bancorp provided the most spectacular of those, plummeting 38 per cent to $0.44. The California mortgage specialist said it did not have enough capital to offer new home loans and an analyst said shareholders may be wiped out.Energy stocks crumpled in response to the falling oil prices however. The sector fell 1.6 per cent and is now on the brink of a correction from its May highs, down about 9 per cent..Exxon Mobil fell 1.2 per cent to $85.94 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.3 per cent to $89.15.Still, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, warned: “It is a passing thing. I don’t think we are going to get a real break in energy prices until the fourth quarter when prices are seasonally weak and some Fed rate hikes take effect.”The materials sector fared little better, losing 0.6 per cent as commodity prices slipped back and investors worried that a global economic downturn would hurt demand. US Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $150.55 while Nucor lost 4.4 per cent to $63.16.
282;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-06-17T20:54:52Z;Goldman chills Wall Street with warnings;;New York stocks fell on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs both soothed and spooked markets, with second-quarter results that handily beat expectations while its analysts argued that continuing losses and writedowns may force US banks to raise $65bn of extra capital.Goldman said profits fell 11 per cent to $2.09bn, but that was well ahead of consensus estimates as gains in commodities and prime brokerage offset losses elsewhere.The results had little impact on the broader financial sector, however. It slipped 2.9 per cent after a number of analysts, including some at Goldman, wrote downbeat notes on investment banks and cut their targets for regional banks.Analysts at Strategas Research said: “We find it difficult to envision how the majors will be able to put the earnings machine back together in the near-term and therefore it is not time to wade back into the investment banks.”The latest batch of data on housing, industrial production and inflation also weighed on sentiment.Housing starts fell 3.3 per cent to a 975,000 annual rate in May, knocking the S&P 500 homebuilding index down 1.4 per cent.New figures on industrial production also made for sober reading. Large industrials such as Boeingfell back after the Federal Reserve said production slipped 0.2 per cent in May.Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index, a key inflation measure,jumped by a higher-than-expected 1.4 per cent in May due to surging energy prices, although core inflation moderated as forecast.Financial markets have suffered in recent weeks as rising inflation has stirred fears that the Fed will start raising interest rates.However, some remain optimistic on the outlook for monetary policy and equities. David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “We continue to expect that in an environment of increased uncertainty, US equities will outperform. The hawkish noises from the Fed seem to us much more an exercise in expectations management than a warning of an imminent tightening.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,350.93, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 12,160.30. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,457.73.Financials were in focus again on Tuesday after the Goldman results. Of the leading brokerages, Goldman has stood up best to the credit crunch. So far this year its share price has lost about 16 per cent of its value compared with a 29.3 per cent loss for the S&P 500 investment banking index.Goldman shares fell 1.5 per cent to $179.44 on Tuesday while its peers for the most part dropped back. Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent to $29.24 and Lehman dropped 7.6 per cent to $25.14.Zions Bancorp was the biggest sector faller, tumbling 8.6 per cent to $33.97,. The Salt Lake City-based lender was pummelled after it said further increases in bad loans were “likely”.In the consumer discretionary sector, data showing a small increase in weekly chain store sales initially boosted retailers. Analysts attributed the gains to demand for hot weather merchandise, Father’s Day shopping and federal tax rebates.Gap shares rose 0.3 per cent to $18, while Coach added 0.1 per cent to $33.37. But disappointing results from Best Buy and poor appliance sales data for May, which hit Whirlpool, helped drag the sector down 1.3 per cent. Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $43.46 and Whirlpool dropped 3.5 per cent to $66.03.Homebuilders and industrials also came under pressure. Lennar dropped 4 per cent to $15.28 and KB Home lost 3.5 per cent to $18.34, while United Technologies gave up 0.7 per cent to $68.41 and Boeing fell 0.9 per cent to $74.38.Commodity-related stocks were among the few gainers. Energy rose 1.7 per cent as refiners bounced back and bid speculation pushed shares in Marathon Oil3.1 per cent higher to $53.07. Materials added 0.2 per cent, led by Monsanto, which gained 5 per cent to $142.69.The healthcare sector initially made ground after Elan said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug helped some patients. Elan shares added 10.7 per cent to $30, while Wyeth, Elan’s US partner, rose 4.8 per cent to $45.16.But losses for healthcare providers swamped those gains. Humana dropped 3.3 per cent to $44.87.
283;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-06-10T20:39:48Z;Rally in financials brings relief on Wall St;;Wall Street was mixed on Tuesday as a relief rally in financials helped investors to shake off hints about possible rate rises from the chairman of the Fed and a slump in energy stocks.Markets traditionally focus on the outlook for interest rates, and concerns that any rate rises would curtail whatever slow growth the economy was still generating initially knocked stocks.But analysts said that with record oil prices eating away at purchasing power and corporate profits, any moves to address those issues would be more helpful than harmful.Scott Armiger, a vice president at Christiana Bank & Trust, said: “Nudging rates up will drive down oil prices and do more for the consumer than keeping rates low.”The S&P 500 had pared losses by mid-afternoon after bouncing off technical support levels, while the Dow Jones had struggled into positive territory.The downtrodden financials sector lead the way, recovering 1.1 per cent as the most heavily sold stocks rallied off multi-year lows, while four of the 10 leading industrial groups made ground.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,358.39 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent higher at 12,289.36 points. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4 per cent to 2,448.94 points.On Monday, equity markets rebounded meekly from last week’s dramatic sell-off. In a bumpy session of trading, analyst upgrades buoyed the energy sector, offsetting another poor session for financials.That pattern reversed itself yesterday as gains for the dollar dented oil and commodity prices while concerns about windfall taxes on producers also circulated.he energy sector gave up 2.2 per cent, the biggest one day fall since the end of April, while materials lost 1.3 per cent.ExxonMobil fell 1.3 per cent to $87.89. ConocoPhillips lost 2.5 per cent to $92.87 and Smith International eased 3.8 per cent to $80.28.XTO fell 1 per cent to $67.02 after it agreed to buy Hunt Petroleum for about $4.2bn in cash and shares.The banking sector also surprised investors, rising in spite of comments by Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, that added the prospect of higher borrowing costs for consumers and corporations to the list of significant problems facing the industry.Citigroup helped lead the way after Vikram Pandit, its chief executive, told a banking conference in London that liquidity at financial services companies and banks was returning to normal levels after the turmoil caused by the collapse of credit markets last year.Citigroup rose 3.4 per cent to $20.26, JPMorgan added 2.1 per cent to $38.29 and AIG climbed 2.4 per cent to $34.28.The leading gainers were Washington Mutual and National City. The former recovered from a 16-year low while the latter climbed after it said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with regulators over capital, risk and liquidity management.WaMu added 6.9 per cent to $6.68 and National City rose 3.8 per cent to $4.64.Conversely, Lehman Brothers remained in the doghouse after several analysts cut earnings estimates and stock ratings on the back of unexpected second quarter losses. Lehman shares fell 6.7 per cent to $27.50.The technology sector pared losses as investors digested the significance of Apple‘s new, cheaper iPhone.Apple shares, which were a drag on the sector on Monday, added 2.2 per cent to $185.64.Consumer-facing stocks moved higher thanks to better sales data. According to the International Council of Shopping Centres, chain store sales rose 1.7 per cent for the week ending June 7. The ICSC pointed to the federal stimulus cheques that were finally beginning to make an impact on retailers. For June as a whole, ICSC Research expects same-store sales to increase as much as 3 per cent.Gap shares rose 4.1 per cent to $17.69 while TJX, owner of TJ Maxx, added 2.8 per cent to $32.29 and the sector climbed 0.4 per cent.Consumer staples rose 0.9 per cent, led by Coca-Cola, which added 3.9 per cent to $58.01 after Deutsche Bank analysts upgraded the stock.Pepsi followed close behind, climbing 3.4 per cent to $67.58, while Kellogg also rose 3.4 per cent to $52.01.
284;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-06-05T14:58:53Z;Wal-Mart sales jump at rivals’ expense;;Sales at Wal-Mart again outperformed its competitors in May, suggesting that it the US discount retailer is set to benefit greatly from federal tax refunds aimed at stimulating the economy.Wal-Mart’s US outlets open at least a year saw sales rise 4 per cent, supported by strong activity in basic goods, including groceries and pharmacy products. Including its Sam’s Club discount warehouse stores, comparable sales rose 3.9 per cent, against the retailer’s original forecast of an increase in the flat-to-2 per cent range.But a range of other major retailers saw comparable sales fall in May. Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket competitor, reported a 0.7 per cent fall in comparable sales. JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw their sales down 4.4 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, saw its global same store sales fall 14 per cent, with a huge 25 per cent fall in sales at its troubled Old Navy chain, and a 7 per cent fall in Gap brand stores.Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, said Wal-Mart’s comparatively strong performance had benefited in part from spending linked to tax refund cheques cashed by the retailer during the month that had exceeded $350m.While he said that it was not possible for the retailer to know how much of this money had been spent at its stores, he noted that “there’s been a positive difference from that”.Mr Schoewe said Wal-Mart is also benefiting from improved operations, merchandising and marketing at a time when its low cost format is in-line with consumers’ need to economise.May was the first month in which American households began receiving tax refunds of up to $600 per eligible adult under the federal economic stimulus package.Mr Schoewe said that Wal-Mart had also seen an increase in store visits during the month, with greater increases continuing to come at more affluent stores, suggesting that the retailer is gaining market share from competitors as customers “trade down” to the low-price discounter.Customers, he said, remained focused on basics, such as food and pharmacy, which “is a big portion of total basket”.He also noted that Wal-Mart’s home business saw its first growth in comparable sale for two years, which he suggested might reflect reports that Ameicans are saving money by going out less.“While they’re under pressure and disposable income is down it appears to us that that family might be spending more time at home …we’re seeing prepared meals, pizzas and those kind of things ramping up,” he said.Costco and BJ’s, both discount warehouse clubs, also delivered strong comparable sales growth, as Americans turned to their low cost bulk sales. BJ’s, which operates 178 stores mostly in the east of the US, said its sales of food rose 11 per cent, while non-food sales were flat. Its comparable sales excluding fuel increased 6.8 per cent.
285;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-06-01T21:48:01Z;Liz Claiborne to revamp sourcing;;Liz Claiborne, one of the world’s largest clothing companies, is to decentralise its global sourcing operations in a bid to improve its brands’ ability to respond to fashion trends and reduce costs.The company was one of the first US clothing companies to source from overseas, opening its first quality control office in Hong Kong in 1976, the year it was founded.It sources clothing and accessories for brands ranging from Liz Claiborne clothes to Mexx, Kate Spade and Juicy Couture brands from hundreds of vendors in 46 countries through a centralised global buying office, a system traditionally used by clothing companies to deliver economies of scale.However, it will allow its eight leading brand groups to select and handle their own suppliers in a move that Bill McComb, chief executive, said should create a more effective relationship between the “front end” designers and merchandisers and the sourcing operation.Brands will also now be able to work with buying agents, rather than having to rely upon the corporate sourcing office.Mr McComb described the shift as “enlightened decentralisation” since the company will also be giving its corporate sourcing team authority to set coherent quality standards for vendors, and to take a broader view of sourcing strategy.Liz Claiborne, which had sales last year of $4.6bn, has recruited Peter Warner, previously head of sourcing and product development at the Gap’s Banana Republic brand, who will be based in Hong Kong.Mr McComb said the corporate sourcing team’s work would include monitoring the role of China which has been steadily growing since the lifting of global garment quotas over three years ago.“Many of us have become over-dependent on China in terms of a production hub. . .we have not been strategic about it,” he said. The central sourcing operation would “sit down and paint a picture about what the next five years could look like”.The changes are linked to broad changes launched by Mr McComb since he took over about 18 months ago.
286;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-05-08T19:27:15Z;US shoppers stick to the bargain basement;;US shoppers continued to veer towards cheaper stores and essential goods and away from discretionary items in April but brought some relief for retailers after a poor start to the year.Same-store sales, a key retail measure of sales in stores open at least a year, rose by 3.3 per cent against expectations of a 1.1 per cent rise according to Retail Metrics, which analyses shopping trends.The rise suggested a better period for shops after weaker sales over the past few months, but still pointed to a consumer who is contending with record oil bills and falling home prices.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and Costco, the warehouse club, in particular benefited from the upturn in sales, in a sign that cost-conscious consumers are turning increasingly to discount retailers and bulk buying as the US economy slows.Teen apparel retailers bucked the trend among clothes retailers to receive a boost from warmer April weather.Over a two-month period, retail sales growth was much weaker, after sales fell in March. This year so far same-store sales have increased 1.1 per cent on average every month, according to Retail Metrics. That comes after 2.6 per cent average monthly growth in 2007 and 3.7 per cent growth in 2006.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said: “The numbers were slightly encouraging and beat very modest expectations. But I don’t think we are out of the woods yet – there’s just too many headwinds that consumers are facing.“The broader trend is that consumers are retrenching and spending more and more dollars on non discretionary things they have to have,” said Mr Perkins.Wal-Mart said same-store sales rose 3.2 per cent excluding fuel sales, beating the high end of the retailer’s own forecasts of 1-3 per cent growth, as well as analysts’ predictions of 2.1 per cent gain.Wal-Mart said that the “economy continues to get tougher” and customers are struggling to stretch their money to the next paycheck.Eduardo Castro-Wright, Wal-Mart‘s chief executive for US stores, said: “As money gets tighter for them toward the end of the month, sales drop more than we have seen in the past.” The company said that sales of home furnishings remained weak but that it had been lifted by sales of groceries.Costco same-store sales were up 8 per cent compared with the company’s forecasts of 6.1 per cent growth, an indication that consumers are buying goods in bulk increasingly.Gap and Chico’s, which both sell mid-range clothing, saw sales drop 6 per cent and 15.5 per cent respectively.Target posted a 3.1 per cent gain in same-store sales but missed the 4.5 per cent estimate, as consumers avoided pricier items such as jewelry.Retailers are expecting a boost this year as consumers receive tax rebates as part of the package of moves put forward by President George W. Bush and Congress this year in an effort to boost the economy.
287;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Green in fashion for HK’s rag trade;;"Leading Hong Kong clothing manufacturers are coming together to reduce the environmental impact of their factories in response to growing pressure from international retailers.The group, the Sustainable Fashion Business Consortium, is being launched today, World Earth Day.Many Chinese suppliers are being told to clean up operations from their US and European customers.Leading the charge is Wal-Mart. The world’s biggest retailer will in October convene a meeting of 1,000 of its suppliers to set goals for reducing their impact on the environment.Well-known brands such as L’Oréal and Pepsi now ask suppliers to measure their carbon footprints.The 12 companies in the Hong Kong consortium represent every part of the production process, from design to yarn-spinning and textiles, and garment manufacture.Its members supply Marks & Spencer, the UK retail chain, Brooks Brothers, Gap and other brands.Pat-Nie Woo, consortium chairman, said the group was formed to help manufacturers work with retailers, government and agencies to promote environmentally sustainable practices.“To be honest, nobody is sustainable at the moment,” he said.Initial goals include devising a carbon accounting standard specific to the clothing factory.This would allow companies to put labels on clothing that detail its carbon footprint, a feature demanded by more and more retailers and brands.“There has been a very top-down approach towards sustainability by brands and retailers who say: ‘You guys have to do this or we are not buying from you’,” he told the FT.“But in the end, who is running the factories? We are in the best position to tell you what is the best way to calculate the carbon footprint or what are the best green processes to adopt,” said Mr Woo, who is also a director of Central Textiles, one of only two large yarn spinners in Hong Kong.Other companies in the Hong Kong consortium are: TAL Apparel, which supplies Burberry, JC Penny and Nordstrom among others; ladies lingerie maker Ace Style; and Crystal Group, a supplier to Anne Taylor, H&M and Levis.The companies, which predominantly manufacture in mainland China, produce more than 500m yards of fabric and 250m garments every year.With the World Wildlife Fund the group is working to develop low-carbon manufacturing processes in the Pearl River Delta manufacturing hub. The hope is that companies adopting those processes could then sell the resulting reduction in their carbon dioxide emissions as carbon credits.The consortium also aims to come up with a package of measures to reduce waste and streamline production processes.One planned project, for example, looks at ways to recycle leftover pieces of fabric, which account for up to 20 per cent of the total amount of fabric used by a typical garment factory.“It effectively saves you money and it is a great story to tell your customers,” Mr Woo said."
288;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
289;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-04-11T20:34:23Z;Wall Street soured by poor GE results;;Wall Street stocks slumped on Friday and were down for the week after results from industrial bellwether General Electric missed estimates, re-igniting concerns that corporate profits would not escape financial market turmoil.GE blamed disruptions in global capital markets for poor performance at its finance divisions, which had the sharpest first-quarter profit declines.Investors and analysts were unimpressed. Goldman Sachs downgraded GE’s shares, saying the decline in profit raised “credibility concerns”, given that the chief executive reassured the market that the company was on target in mid-March.GE was the leading faller in the S&P500, sliding 12.8 per cent, its biggest one-day drop since 1987, to $32.05.The results were particularly unnerving for investors who bought into diversified and globalised industrial conglomerates in the hope that they would offer a haven from the problems of the US economy.Tyco International fell 3.5 per cent to $44.28, while United Technologies lost 3.2 per cent to $69.53 and Paccar, the truck manufacturer, sagged 3.7 per cent to $44.63. Those losses made industrials the worst performing sector of the week.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2 per cent lower at 1,332.86 points and lost 2.7 per cent over the week, its worst performance in over a month.The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.6 per cent on Friday, and 3.4 per cent over the week, to 2,290.24 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2 per cent, and 2.3 per cent over the week, to 12,325.59 points.GE’s results squashed any lingering optimism after improved forecasts by Wal-Mart helped stocks to rally on Thursday.Randy Frederick, director or derivatives at Charles Schwab, said: “Much as some economists would like to believe that the Fed has solved all of these problems and that the worst is over, I am not convinced. I think this earnings season is going to be fairly weak.”“Volatility indices have been trickling lower but eventually bad news will compound and markets won’t be able to shrug it off any more. I think you have seen the start of that with GE’s results today.”Over the week, an index of financials fell 4.6 per cent.Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan group, secured a $7bn dollar capital infusion but also forecast $1.1bn first-quarter losses.WaMu fell on Friday, slipping 4.1 per cent after Goldman Sachs analysts cut their earnings estimates for the bank and recommended selling the shares short.But the stock ended the week 7.7 per cent ahead at $10.95.An index of investment banking stocks was down 6.3 per cent over the week, led by Lehman Brothers, which fell 9.5 per cent in the period to $39.87.The first-quarter earnings season kicked off with disappointing results from Alcoa, the aluminium producer, on Monday.It worsened on Wednesday, when United Parcel Service, another bellwether of the US economy, predicted that profits would fall as a domestic slowdown took effect and rising energy prices increased costs.Alcoa fell 9.9 per cent to $35.15 over the week, while UPS’s shares gave up 4.7 per cent to $71.89 and dragged down related stocks such a transport companies.Since the new year analysts have consistently revised down their forecasts but at the start of the week they were still predicting earnings growth of about 7 per cent for the S&P 500, excluding financials.In a week light on data, what emerged was mostly negative. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan, dropped again and in March sales at comparable chain stores fell 0.5 per cent, while clothing and department store sales tumbled by much more.Gap lost 5.8 per cent to $17.95, Dillards shed 8.9 per cent to $20.07, while Bed Bath & Beyond, which reported disappointing forecasts earlier in the week, slipped 4.3 per cent to $30.23 over the week.Still, there were winners. Wal-Mart shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $54.80 over the week after the world’s biggest retailer announced improved sales and forecasts as consumers downshifted to value-brands.Energy stocks were only ones to find a modicum of consistent growth however, as oil hit new record prices before easing back and coal producers pushed through significant price increases.Over the week, Peabody Energy added, 7 per cent to $61.07 while Halliburton climbed 6 per cent to $43.52 and Apache rose 4.4 per cent to $131.93.Semiconductor firms Micron Technology and LSI held their ground after upgrades and news that a competitor had successfully increased its prices.Micron added 2.1 per cent to $6.90 over the weekwhile LSI slipped 0.5 per cent to $5.46.

Cisco added 2.2 per cent to $24.04.Lexmark International, the printer maker, and Apple, the consumer technology giant, were also upgraded. Lexmark was among the top gainers in the S&P 500, adding 8.4 per cent to $32.91, while Apple rose 2.1 per cent to to $154.55.Long-suffering semi-conductor stocks also rallied after an analyst at Banc of America said that indicators suggested a bottom might be near for the sector. The S&P 500 Semiconductor index, which has lost about 16 per cent of its value since December, clawed back 2.8 per cent.Intel climbed 3.1 per cent to $22.08 while LSI rose 5.1 per cent to $5.61.The benchmark S&P 500 rose as much as 0.9 per cent before paring those gains at the close. The index finished the day 0.5 per cent higher at 1,360.55, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,351.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.4 per cent to 12,581.98.Wal-Mart’s success came at the expense of high-street retailers as consumers squeezed by higher energy prices and falling confidence downshifted to the mass retailers in search of value.Data showed that same-store sales at chain retailers fell 0.5 per cent in March, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. Apparel and department store sales were particularly badly hit, dropping 11.2 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively. Gap shares fell 2.2 per cent to $18.47 but Dillards climbed 3.1 per cent to $21.14 and JC Penney added 3 per cent to $40.07.For the most part, the first-quarter earnings season has been a downbeat affair and it hit a nadir on Wednesday when United Parcel Service, a bellwether of the US economy, predicted profits would fall as a domestic slowdown took effect and rising energy prices increased costs.Since the start of the year analysts have consistently revised forecasts downward, but at the start of the week they were still predicting first-quarter earnings growth of about 7 per cent for the S&P 500, excluding financials.Amid the broader market rally, financials were a weak spot. Banks and brokerage stocks were hit by a muted report on Lehman Brothers and news that it had bailed out five of its debt funds affected by the paralysed credit markets.Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said Lehman’s survival strategy of deleveraging and derisking would reduce long term returns. “This new harsh reality is sobering to those looking for a quick fix for the financial sector.”Lehman shares swung between losses and gains but by session end were down 0.7 per cent at $40.25.Goldman Sachs shares fell 2.1 per cent to $170.55 and an index of investment banks, which has fallen for six out of the last seven sessions, lost 2.4 per cent.In the healthcare sector Amgen bounced 5.7 per cent to $43.98 after analysts said efforts to overturn an injunction banning Roche from selling an anaemia medicine that violates patents owned by Amgen were unlikely to succeed.Deal activity also provided momentum. In pharmaceuticals, Tak­eda, the Japanese company, proposed a takeover of Millennium Pharmaceuticals for about $8.8bn in cash. Millennium shares rose 48.9 per cent to $24.34.Meanwhile, reports that Yahoo was edging towards a three-way alliance with Google and AOL to protect its independence or at least force its unbidden suitor, Microsoft, to pay more, buoyed related stocks.Yahoo climbed 3 per cent to $28.59, while Time Warner, which owns AOL, added 1.2 per cent to $14.61. Google rose 1.1 per cent to $469.08 and Microsoft moved up 0.8 per cent to $29.11.
291;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-04-10T17:45:24Z;Easter and slowdown depress US sales;;US retailers felt the brunt of the developing slowdown in consumer demand in March, with leading clothing chains and department stores reporting sales that were worse than already depressed expectations.Retailers said demand for the month was affected by the early Easter holiday, which fell on March 23 rather than in April. While Easter generally boosts sales of spring clothing and gifts, the holiday came as cold weather continued across much of the US, suppressing demand. Most retailers also missed a day because of Easter Sunday closures.JC Penney and Kohl’s – low-cost stores that focus on the middle-income heartland – said sales at their stores that had been open at least a year fell respectively by 12 per cent and 15.5 per cent. Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported an 18 per cent fall in comparable sales at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic brand stores. Dillard’s, the medium-sized department store chain, reported a 10 per cent fall in same store sales.Larry Montgomery, chief executive of Kohl’s, said weak sales of “weather-sensitive” items such as shorts, tank-tops and sandals “experienced significant declines …contributing to our sales shortfall”.In an indication that the broad-based nature of the slowdown, Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion store, reported a comparable sales increase of just 0.4 per cent, while Saks Fifth Avenue saw its same store sales fall 2.9 per cent.Nordstrom, a fashion department store that aims at more prosperous customers, reported a 9 per cent fall in comparable sales.However, Wal-Mart, the mass discounter that is the country’s largest retailer, again delivered a comparatively strong performance, with a 0.9 per cent increase in comparable sales at its more than 3,400 Wal-Mart outlets.Target, its more upmarket rival, saw same-store sales fall 4.4 per cent.Wal-Mart raised its guidance for the first quarter, with Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, citing effective inventory management that “has resulted in lower markdowns, expense leverage and reduced shrink”. It is now forecasting first quarter earnings per share of 74-76 cents, from 70-74 cents previously.Many retailers will benefit from an extra selling day in April this year, as a result of the shift in the Easter holiday. Wal-Mart is predicting a comparable sales increase of 1 to 3 per cent.But JC Penney, which predicted a comparable sales fall in the “mid- to high-single digits” in April, said it was expecting “a continuation of the incremental weakness in sales trends we started to see in late February and early March”.
292;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-03-11T18:32:35Z;China Inc looks beyond low costs;;"In Dongguan, a south China manufacturing town where the average shoe industry wage is Rmb960 (£67, €88, $135) a month, one of Nike’s largest contract factories now pays its workers Rmb1,472.Such a differential should spell trouble in an industry where many are struggling with rising costs. But Yue Yuen Industrial is thriving – a fact that could hold lessons for manufacturers far beyond Dongguan and the Pearl River Delta region in southern Guangdong province.The prices of China’s exports have been rising for almost five years. “[China trading] partner country data uniformly show imported footwear, toys, furniture and textile prices falling by around 3 per cent in US dollar terms until 2003, and then rising at 3 per cent to 4 per cent per year thereafter,” Jonathan Anderson, economist at UBS, noted in a recent research report.The recent year-on-year price rises have been remarkably modest considering that labour is just one of many escalating costs that Yue Yuen and others have been contending with. That the company, the Hong Kong-listed arm of Taiwan’s Pou Chen Group, has been able to absorb them provides some clues as to how China’s export juggernaut manages to keep on rolling.Trade and inflation data released this week demonstrate just how difficult an environment China-based exporters now operate in. The Chinese government reported yesterday that the consumer price index clocked a year-on-year rise of 8.7 per cent in February – a 12-year high exacerbated by shortages stemming from January’s severe snowstorms. Adding to exporters’ woes, the renminbi has appreciated 15 per cent against the dollar since mid-2005 and is now poised to break through the Rmb7:$1 barrier.China’s underlying inflationary pressures matter because they could potentially make it much more difficult for exporters to continue to absorb the brunt of domestic cost pressures. Although much distorted by seasonal factors such as this year’s severe winter weather, the country’s January-February trade surplus provided a hint of what could lie ahead, falling 29 per cent year-on-year to $28bn.“We expect [China’s] export figures to rebound in March but continue to anticipate a more moderate slowdown in export growth over the course of the year …A slowdown in China’s export sector constitutes one of the key risks to economic growth,” Jing Ulrich, JPMorgan’s China equities chairman, said in a research note, citing reduced demand in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies that consume two-thirds of the country’s exports.At its factory in Dongguan, however (see picture), Yue Yuen provides ample evidence of the Chinese export sector’s resilience. Last year Guangdong’s footwear exports increased 14.6 per cent to $9.6bn, while textile shipments surged 18.4 per cent to $42bn.Yue Yuen and other large exporters benefit first from the sheer scale of their operations. The 27,000 workers at Yue Yuen’s Nike operations in Dongguan, for example, make 14m pairs of shoes a year – and they are just a small part of a larger manufacturing complex that employs 100,000 people in total.Yue Yuen’s relatively dear labour costs, which are more than 50 per cent higher than the industry average, also mask productivity incentives. At most shoe factories in Dongguan, the average monthly wage is largely determined by working hours and overtime, often in excess of statutory limits. But at Yue Yuen, only about two-thirds of the average salary is attributable to hours worked. “If you have overtime problems you will also have quality and delivery issues,” says Hannah Jones, Nike’s vice-president for corporate responsibility.The remaining third of Yue Yuen’s average salary is derived from productivity and quality targets achieved by team-based assembly lines modelled on the “lean” manufacturing principles pioneered by Toyota. “[Workers] can’t hand off a bad piece [to another team member] and kiss it goodbye,” says Sonya Durkin-Jones, Nike’s compliance director for North Asia. Each of Nike’s lean manufacturing lines is branded with the acronym “NOS” – for the Latin novus ordo seclorum, or “a new order for the ages”. The phrase is also emblazoned on the back of US dollar bills, which perhaps explains how it came to be ingrained in Nike’s institutional memory.Last week senior Nike executives spent three days taking journalists around Yue Yuen’s Dongguan plant, citing it as an example of what they hope to achieve across their entire China supply chain, which encompasses about 180 factories and 210,000 workers. One out of every three Nike shoes is made in China.Yue Yuen’s wage premium pays for itself in terms of increased productivity and quality; another benefit is that the company faces fewer of the recruitment headaches afflicting cheaper rivals in an environment where the balance between demand and supply has swung in labour’s favour recently. “We have been constantly challenged by the environment – by all the overtime offered by some of our competitors,” says Johnson Tong, a manager at Pou Chen. “But workers want to make money, not [rack up] hours.”“In this environment you want to reduce your turnover,” adds Ms Jones. “Time to market is much more of a driver for us. How do you achieve that if you are jumping from one factory to another? It’s not about chasing labour costs. It’s about stability and innovation.”A similar attitude prevails across the Pearl River Delta at Esquel, a privately owned Hong Kong shirt-maker that employs 26,000 workers in production facilities in Foshan. Chaired by Marjorie Yang, daughter the founder, Esquel has a client roster that includes the likes of Gap, JC Penney and Nike. Last year it produced 65m shirts.Like Yue Yuen, Esquel must contend with a range of rising costs. The company has also consciously added to them, investing $50m in clean manufacturing facilities including its own power and water treatment plants. The latter handle everything from sewage to industrial dyes.These investments have rooted Esquel ever deeper in the Pearl River Delta, where it can draw on the region’s pool of textile workers. “You pay for the brain as well as the hands,” Ms Yang says of her workers. “For us stability is most important so we can use our management skills to deal with external problems.”"
293;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-02-29T00:38:27Z;Gap to open high-end UK stores;;Gap, the biggest US speciality clothing retailer, is to open five of its up-market Banana Republic brand stores in the UK this year, beginning with its first planned store on London’s Regent Street next month.Glenn Murphy, chief executive, said the UK stores would mark the start of the expansion of Gap’s second brand into Europe as the company looked abroad for growth while keeping its US store count stable.The company also plans to double the number of franchised Gap stores it licenses internationally, from 70 in the Middle East and southeast Asia at present. Expansion is already planned in Greece and the Balkans.The retailer operates 137 Gap brand stores in the UK and 36 in France. It first launched Banana Republic stores outside North America in Japan in 2005 and started its first franchised stores in 2006.In the US, Gap said it expected its total store square footage to grow by less than 1 per cent. It would be reviewing the effectiveness of its current real-estate strategy, including store size and locations.Mr Murphy, who took over as chief executive last year, said the company would focus on increasing its gross margins during the year ahead, building on successful efforts to reduce excess inventory and resulting price mark-downs last year.The retailer reported a 21 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to $265m, or 35 cents per diluted share, against the same fiscal period last year, which was a week longer. Revenue was down 5 per cent at $4.68bn.Mr Murphy stressed a range of cost-cutting measures in the US, including the introduction of store staffing computer programs.He also intended to increase pressure on suppliers in Asia to ensure they offered Gap prices that reflected the size of its purchasing.Gap’s shares rose more than 5 per cent in after- hours trading to $20.45.
294;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-02-07T21:36:34Z;Wall St rebounds in volatile trading;;"US stocks rebounded on Thursday as bargain-hunters rushed to buy into market weakness and called a halt on a three-day losing run.Consumer stocks surged in volatile trading after reassuring earnings guidance from JC Penney and Gap helped offset earlier disappointment with Wal-Mart’s January sales figures.The sharp upswing bore some of the hallmarks of an over-sold bounce and was led by beaten-down financial, energy and telecoms stocks. The rally stemmed a slide of almost 5 per cent on the S&P 500 this week.In spite of a broad-based rally a weak sales outlook from Cisco continued to weigh on some large-cap technology companies. Utilities stocks also lagged.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,336.91, having fallen 0.7 per cent before rebounding as much as 1.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 12,247 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,293.30.“I think the most likely scenario is that we reached a low in January and we are now in the base-building process,” Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said.A broad range of retailers rallied after JC Penney, up 8.5 per cent at $47.44, said same-store sales declined less than forecast and fourth-quarter earnings would be at the high end of its forecast range. Gap’s shares also rebounded, up 7.2 per cent at $19.65 after its earnings outlook also pleased investors.Elsewhere retail sales figures were generally disappointing, as consumers faced with falling house prices reined in their discretionary spending. However, the S&P retail index climbed 3.7 per cent to 403.51 as analysts said weaker consumer spending was already priced in to many retail shares,Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose only 0.5 per cent in January, much less than the 2 per cent increase Wall Street had expected, and its February sales forecast also offered little cause for excitement. The shares fell in early trading but later closed up 2.1 per cent at $49.84.Upmarket retailer Nordstrom rose 3.7 per cent to $37.67 in spite of reporting a 6.6 per cent decline in same-store sales. Macy’s, up 4.9 per cent at $25.11 had reported a 7.1 per cent sales drop on Wednesday.Technology stocks also pared early losses caused by a cautious sales outlook from Cisco. The networking company said quarterly profit rose 7.2 per cent to $2.06bn, in line with analysts’ estimates, and projected 10 per cent sales growth for the fiscal third quarter, below expectations. The shares rose 1.3 per cent to $23.38.Many investors consider Cisco a bellwether for the sector and its cautious outlook kept shares in a some of large-cap tech companies under pressure. IBM fell 1.2 per cent to $102.34 and Hewlett Packard gave up 3.9 per cent to $40.50.There was mixed news on the employment front. Weekly jobless claims fell 22,000 to 356,000, but the reading was still far higher than many analysts had predicted. Jobless claims had surged the previous week to the highest reading in more than two years, but this time the market was expecting a figure of about 340,000. The four-week moving average of first time claims rose 8,500 to 335,000.“On balance, initial jobless claims have drifted higher, although at this point they remain below levels typically associated with outright recession,” economists at Bear Stearns said.Pending home sales fell a weaker-than-expected 1.5 per cent in December, according to the National Association of Realtors, and were down 24.2 per cent from the previous year. Homebuilder DR Horton rose 1.6 per cent to $15.04 after it posted a narrower-than-expected $128.8m quarterly loss.Consumer products group PepsiCo said fourth-quarter profit fell 30 per cent to $1.26bn from a year ago, when results were improved by a tax benefit. However, revenues rose 17 per cent to $12.35bn and the shares put on 5.5 per cent to $70.41.Rating agency Moody’s said fourth-quarter earnings fell 54 per cent to $127.3m as revenues from structured finance slumped. However, the result was slightly better than analysts had forecast and the stock surged 10.4 per cent to $37.Financial companies closed broadly higher after Jamie Dimon,chief executive of JP Morgan, said a possible downgrade of a key bond insurer would not be “that big a deal” for the banking industry. JP Morgan’s shares rose 3.2 per cent to $45.11Exchange operators also enjoyed a bounce after an analyst said the market overreacted to a Department of Justice call for ownership for clearing houses to be
broken off from futures exchanges. CME Group rose 8.8 per cent to $528.01 after falling 17.6 per cent the previous day."
295;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-02-07T19:45:21Z;US retail sales;;January proved frigid for US retailers. But although declining home values and the wobbly economy have prompted consumers to pare back spending, many retailers closed out the holiday season with fewer patches of frostbite than expected.Same-store sales by US retailers overall dropped 1.6 per cent last month, according to Sanford Bernstein. The broader market reacted uneasily to the results, particularly after Wal-Mart eked out a lower-than-expected same-store sales gain of just 0.5 per cent. Other retailers also undershot estimates, including department stores Macy’s, Dillard’s and Nordstrom and discounter Target.But contrary to expectations that the sky could fall, the sector’s sales decline was shallower than the 2.1 decrease analysts had forecast. Gap, J.C. Penney and several wholesale clubs beat expectations, and their share prices rallied. The Standard & Poor’s retail index, which has bounced sharply since January 15 on hopes that share prices had hit a trough, rose 5 per cent.Pinched by higher housing, gas and food costs and worried over the economy, some consumers are making more deliberate spending choices. This trend is not altogether surprising, given the country’s slightly negative savings rate. Shoppers are searching for clearance-sale bargains and using their holiday gift cards to buy staples. To counter their shrunken profit margins, Macy’s, Ann Taylor and a few other sector laggards have been forced to close stores and slash jobs.Yet after repeatedly ratcheting back earnings projections in recent quarters, other retailers who have managed their inventories well were able to stick to their earnings guidance this time around. Gap boosted full-year profit estimates after selling apparel at better-than-expected prices, and J.C. Penney said fourth-quarter earnings would hit the top end of its range. With market expectations already low, retailers who continue to underperform will struggle to lay the blame anywhere but on their own doorsteps.Post and read comments on this Lex
296;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wall Street drops sharply on AmEx earnings;;Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Friday after a cautious earnings outlook at American Express added to worries that US consumer spending is headed for a sharp slowdown.The sell-off capped another difficult week for equities. Stocks floundered after Goldman Sachs said the US would fall into recession in 2008 and weak retail sales drained confidence.Although Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, tried to assure the market he was prepared to keep cutting rates to stave off a slowdown, stocks struggled to find a footing amid concerns that rate cuts may not be enough.Bank of America’s agreed takeover of Countrywide Financial, the troubled mortgage lender, helped financial stocks avoid the worst of the selling on Friday but the deal did little to stem broader market losses.Investors scrambled to find relative safety this week in pharmaceuticals, healthcare and consumer staples, considered more resistant to a recession. Telecoms and technology stocks were sold.The S&P 500 fell 1.4 per cent to 1,401.01 on Friday for a 0.8 per cent decline on the week. The S&P is down 4.6 per cent for 2008, its fourth worst start in the history of the index.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 per cent this week to 12,606.30 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2 per cent to 2,439.94.The S&P and Dow fell back into “correction” territory on Friday marking a decline of more than 10 per cent from their peak last year. The Nasdaq has fallen 14.7 per cent from its October high.“It’s becoming very moot as to whether we are in a recession. Companies are telling you, the bond market is telling you and consumers are telling you – it’s baked in,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.Financial companies were volatile after Bank of America agreed to buy Countrywide Financial for $4bn in stock. Countrywide moved the market all week amid rumours – which it denied – that it might seek bankruptcy protection.Traders were relieved that the deal saved the troubled mortgage lender from possible collapse. However, Countrywide’s shares fell 24.8 per cent to $6.33 this week, below the $7.16 per share transaction value, and BofA fell 3.4 per cent to $38.50 amid concerns over the deal. Moody’s Investors Service said it would review BofA’s credit rating for possible downgrade.In a further sign of nascent consolidation in the sector, CNBC reported that JPMorgan had held “very preliminary” takeover talks with Washington Mutual. Wamu’s shares rose 12.4 per cent to $14.69 this week.Although banks advanced on Friday amid hopes of further consolidation and more foreign capital, investors are nervous about calling a bottom in the sector.Underscoring the risks, the New York Times reported that Merrill Lynch may take a $15bn writedown in the fourth quarter. Merrill, up 8.7 per cent this week at $54.69, Citigroup, up 1.1 per cent at $28.56, and JPMorgan, 0.2 per cent weaker at $40.86, all report quarterly earnings next week.Fourth-quarter profits in the financial sector are expected to plunge 72 per cent, according to Thomson Financial, with earnings for S&P 500 down 11.3 per cent.Consumer-facing stocks were sold off on Friday after American Express said it would take a $440m fourth-quarter charge to cover rising delinquencies and gave a cautious outlook for this year. American Express’s warning came after Capital One Financial, the card issuer, cut its full-year profit guidance by more than 20 per cent. The shares fell 10.5 per cent to $44 and 7.4 per cent to $42.59, respectively.Economists have long feared mortgage-related losses would spread into the broader economy as consumers unable to make home payments default on loans. AmEx’s warning was particularly worrisome as its high-end clients were considered more resistant to a consumer slowdown.Tiffany & Co added to these worries after the luxury jeweller cut the upper end of its fiscal-year earnings outlook, causing it to sink 13.5 per cent to $35.80 for the period. The news capped a poor week for US retailers after some poor same-store sales from mid-market clothing chains. Gap fell 12.5 per cent to $17.20 this week.Wall Street hopes aggressive Fed action will help prevent the US economy from tipping into recession. However, stocks managed only a mute rally after a speech by Mr Bernanke on Thursday opened the door to further rate cuts.While the domestic economy is seen weakening, some analysts argue US multinationals will suffer less from a downturn because so much of their revenues are overseas. The weaker dollar has also provided a boon for exporters. Coca-Cola fell sharply on Friday but rose 3.1 per cent to $63.77 over the week.Telecoms also sold off after AT&T warned of a slowdown in its domestic consumer business. Shares lost 6.6 per cent to $38.20.However, biotechnology firms continued to outpeform. Biogen Idec put on 6.9 per cent to $59.02 for the week after it delivered upbeat profit guidance.

However, large-cap technology companies continued to lag amid concerns over growth prospects in the sector.The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent in early trade, but recovered to close up 0.8 per cent at 1,420.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9 per cent to 12,853.09 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,488.52.Mr Bernanke said the Fed might take “substantive” action on rates, leading traders to believe the Fed could ease by 50 basis points at the end of this month.“What this did is it indicate the Fed is not going to get caught behind the curve,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said.Many traders have already priced in further rate cuts amid the threat of a looming recession. After the Fed chairman’s comments the futures market factored in a 90 per cent chance of a 50bp cut at the end of this month, with at least two further 25bp cuts seen likely.The financial sector rallied further before the close on reports that Countrywide Financial, the struggling mortgage lender, was in advance talks with Bank of America about a possible merger. Countrywide’s shares soared 51.4 per cent to $7.75.The S&P financial sector climbed as much as 6 per cent off its session-low. Big movers included rival mortgage lenders IndyMac Bancorp and Washington Mutual which climbed 23 per cent to $5.78 and 14.8 per cent to $14.16 respectively.E-Trade Financial, the troubled online brokerage, jumped 22.1 per cent to $2.93. Homebuilders also rebounded with the S&P homebuilder index closing 6.2 per cent higher at 305.05.Blackstone made gains after the private equity group agreed to acquire GSO Capital Partners for up to $930m. Blackstone also announced a $500m stock buy-back programme and the shares rose 9.6 per cent to $19.84.Earlier a profit warning at Capital One Financial had unsettled traders. The credit card company cut its full-year profit guidance by more than 20 per cent because of rising loan delinquencies. The shares closed down 1 per cent at $42.92.After the closing bell American Express reported similar problems. The card issuer said it would take a $440m charge for the fourth quarter as more customers have missed payments. It also gave a cautious outlook for 2008. The shares closed 0.3 per cent lower at $48.92, but slid 5 per cent after hours.US airline shares rose sharply on reports that Delta Air Lines is on the verge of merger talks with both Northwest Airlines and UAL, parent of United Airlines. Delta declined to comment.UAL, gained 23.7 per cent to $32.19, Northwest Airlines gained 32 per cent to $15.85 and Delta rose 18.2 per cent to $15.98.Other transport stocks gained as oil prices fell sharply but falling crude prices hurt a broad range of companies in the energy sector. Hess, the oil producer and refiner fell 2.2 per cent to $92.68.Retailers lagged the market after US stores reported an anaemic set of December sales figures, prompting some companies to lower their earnings guidance.Although Wal-Mart, up 3.2 per cent at $48.40, reported solid results and other low-cost chains fared well, niche retailers disappointed as middle-market consumers cut back on discretionary spending.However, analysts were split on the severity of the problems. Banc of America said the numbers did not “look as bad as feared”.Retailers posting significant December same-store sales declines included AnnTaylor Stores, the women’s clothing retailer, and Gap.

298;GPS;Gap Inc;2008-01-10T15:02:52Z;Wal-Mart stands out amid retail misery;;Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 2.4 per cent rise in December sales, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 2.1 per cent, amid otherwise predominantly bleak sales figures from other leading retailers.The largest US retailer said comparable store sales during the five-week December period were driven by strengths in grocery, pharmacy and electronics.Wal-Mart’s US stores saw sales increase by 2.6 per cent. Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of the US stores unit said that “in a difficult retail environment, we were pleased with our comparable store sales,” and said strong food sales had helped bring in customers for other areas of the stores.Wal-Mart outperformed Target, its main rival, which reported a 0.6 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, after adjusting for a callendar change that saw a week of extra post-Thanksgiving sales shifted to November’s figures.Target’s sluggish performance was broadly reflected across the sector.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures said its index of retailer’s combined comparable sales figures for November and December showed a 1.7 per cent increase, the slowest growth since 2002.JC Penney, the mid-range department store, said its stores sales fell 3.9 per cent for November and December combined, citing “a challenging consumer environment”.The retailer said it now expected its fourth quarter earnings to be at the lower end of its previous guidance of $1.65 to $1.80 per share.Kohl’s, JC Penney’s rival, reported a 0.7 per cent decline in same store sales, on an adjusted basis, and said November and December sales were down 3.2 per cent. It also reduced its earnings guidance, saying that sales had occured later in December, leading to price cutting that would reduce its profit margins.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, posted a 1.1 per cent fall over the two months.Terry Lundgren, CEO of Macy’s said “macroeconomic trends led customers to spend cautiously for the holiday”.Gap’s same-store sales adusted for the calendar changes were down 6 per cent.Costco was another rare bright spot, reporting a rise of 7 per cent, beating estimates of an increase of 5.7 percent, according to Reuters.Saks, whose New York flagship store has benefited from increased European tourist traffic linked to the weak dollar, reported a 10.2 per cent increase in comparable sales over the two month period.A number of retailers cut their fourth quarter earnings guidance after releasing poor December sales, including Limited Brands, AnnTaylor, Chico’s, American Eagle and Men’s Wearhouse.US retailers have been sounding increasingly downbeat in recent weeks, reflecting growing concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending due to a broader slowdown in the economy.US retailers from Office Depot, the office supplies company, to Zumiez, the snowboarding and skateboarding clothing retailer, have been showing increasing signs of suffering over the first weeks of the new year.Talbots, the mid-range clothing chain, said last week it planned to close 78 stores focused on children’s and men’s apparel and Macy’s has said it will close nine underperforming stores.Circuit City, the struggling consumer electronics chain, said on Monday that its December same-store sales fell 11.4 per cent.
299;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-11-23T18:47:05Z;Ailing mortage lenders set tone on Wall St;;The bears remained in charge on Wall Street this week when fears about a US economic slowdown and the continuing fall-out from the subprime mortgage crisis bled confidence from jittery equity markets.With shoppers hitting the stores after Thanksgiving on Friday, beginning the most important shopping period of the year, US retailers were the focus of worries about a lacklustre holiday season.The Federal Reserve added to the prevailing malaise this week after it gave a downbeat assessment of prospects for US economic growth. “We’ve certainly upped the odds of a recession,” Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said.The S&P 500 rose 1,7 per cent to 1440.70 on Friday, closing the week on a high note as traders went bargain hunting after recent sharp falls.However the index was down 1.2 per cent for the week, a trading period truncated by the Thanksgiving holiday and a half-day session on Friday.The S&P 500 has remained below its 200-day moving average for 10 consecutive sessions, a bearish indicator, longer than during the initial summer credit squeeze.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.5 per cent on the week at 12,980.88, briefly falling below its mid-August trough before traders bought into weakness.The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent on the week at 2,596.60. The index has fallen 9.2 per cent from its 52-week high, set on October 31, as technology stocks have struggled to find a footing.Transport stocks, a traditional bellwether of economic sentiment, fared particularly poorly, with crude oil prices rising above $99 a barrel this week.The Dow transport index, down 2.5 per cent at 4,451.07, neared a key bearish indicator, a 20 per cent fall from its high for the year.Among the worst performing stocks this week were Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises that provide liquidity to US mortgage markets by buying, securitising and guaranteeing home loans.The declining value of its mortgage-related securities contributed to a $2bn loss at Freddie Mac this week, with the shares falling 35 per cent to $26.47. Freddie warned it will need to raise capital, possibly by slashing its dividend in half, in order to meet regulatory requirements.Fannie Mae, a rival mortgage agency, was down 20.9 per cent to $32.20, amid continuing worries about the way it accounts for loan losses.Concerns that these agencies will be constrained in their ability to provide liquidity to the broader mortgage market hit a range of financial stocks this week.Countrywide Financial sank 20.1 per cent on the week to $9.65 after analysts said the company could be affected if GSEs stopped buying its mortgages in the secondary market.However, the company said rumours that it would seek bankruptcy protection were “absolutely false”.Meanwhile the big banks once again suffered a torrid week, precipitated by a Goldman Sachs analyst note that forecast another $48bn in writedowns by the end of 2008. Citigroup shed 6.8 per cent to $31.70 after the note said Citi could take $22bn in writedowns linked to its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations, $11bn this quarter, and $11bn next year.Homebuilder stocks were also punished amid a deepening malaise in the US real estate market.The S&P homebuilder index was down 14.3 per cent this week at 318.07, declining for six consecutive days before buyers sparked a rebound on Friday.Shares in Pulte Homes shed 25 per cent of their value this week at $9.63.With house prices plummeting, nervous investors are keeping a careful eye on retail sales amid fears that belt-tightening consumers may deliver a poor shopping holiday season.Office Depot fell 8.6 per cent to $17.50 this week after quarterly earnings fell 9 per cent while Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, was down 11 per cent at $22.27 during the period after it cut its full-year outlook. Gap declined 6 per cent to $18.89 after same-store sales fell 5 per cent.However, the retail picture was not universally bleak. Nordstrom rose 9.9 per cent to $35.72 on the week, after the department store’s quarterly earnings beat expectations. Electronics retailer Circuit City soared 19.5 per cent to $6.51 on Friday, 5.9 per cent higher for the week.Elsewhere, General Motors was the Dow’s biggest faller this week, down 7.2 per cent at $27.16.
300;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-11-23T02:03:49Z;Stores warned of gift card backlash;;US retailers are this season facing the first signs of a backlash from consumer advocates over one of their most profitable lines – sales of gift cards, which the National Retail Federation expects to be worth about $26.5bn (£12.8bn, €17.8bn) over the holiday period.More than half of all US shoppers are likely to buy a gift card, according to the NRF, and more than 80 per cent of them will buy more than two.The forecast 5.7 per cent increase in sales compares with the 4 per cent growth expected for overall retail sales.But earlier this month, Consumer Reports, published by the non-profit Consumers’ Union, ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times highlighting the fact that customers threw away an estimated $8bn last year as a result of unused, lost, damaged or expired cards.“Easy money for retailers. Lost money for you,” the advertisement read.A national survey by the group in October of 1,003 adults found that 27 per cent of those who received gift cards in the previous holiday had still not used one or more of them.Gift cards, which are pre-paid and store-specific, started catching on in the US at the start of the decade. This year more retailers have started reporting both the extent of their gift card liabilities, and the revenue accruing from unused or so-called broken cards.Gap, the clothing retailer, said its gift card liabilities stood at $337m in February this year. It also recognised $31m of income last year when it shortened the period after which it considered a card “broken” from five to three years.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, recorded a $19m gain from broken cards last year, bringing to $78m the total gain since it started recognising the revenues three years ago.It considers a card broken after two years, and had gift card liabilities of $494m in March.Nordstrom, the upmarket speciality fashion store, estimates that 3.5 per cent of all the cards it sells are never used, and has recognised $13.3m since it launched its programme in 1999. Starbucks, the coffee company, recognised $4.4m in unused card income in 2006.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, does not give numbers for its gift card liabilities, but Target, its smaller rival, had $338m in gift cards outstanding in February this year.Amazon, the online retailer, had $183m, up 40 per cent on the previous year, representing 1.7 per cent of its total sales.Retailers, attracted both by the sales and the interest-free loan provided by gift card purchases, continue to expand their offerings, with company’s such as Safeway’s Blackhawk subsidiary now stocking “gift card malls” in supermarkets and drug stores.Innovations include DVD-readable cards used by Best Buy and Circuit City, while Starbucks and others encourage customers to go to their website to customise their card designs.In another sign that consumers may be increasingly aware of the costs of cards, a new website, Leveragecard.com, will next week offer interest on gift cards held online on a site that will allow users both to manage gift cards and retailer loyalty programmes.“We can actually offer 3.65 per cent to people that purchase cards through the site,” says Mark Roberts.
301;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-11-21T22:42:58Z;Cautious Gap gives thanks for profit rise;;"Glenn Murphy, the new chief executive of Gap, on Wednesday reported a sharp rise in third-quarter profits but cautioned about prospects for the current quarter, saying the retailer expected
“a tough economic environment this upcoming holiday season”.Earnings rose 26 per cent to $238m, or 30 cents per share, and Gap raised the top end of its full-year earnings forecast 10 cents to
98 cents per diluted share.But the company’s shares fell more than 5 per cent during morning trading in New York, to $18.97.Gap had benefited from reduced spending and a drive to cut store inventories, it said. But revenues were flat at $3.9bn and
comparable store sales fell
5 per cent, the same decrease
as last year.Marketing costs during the quarter were $75m less than last year, when it launched a largely ineffective television advertising campaign to support Gap brand sales.Gap’s online sales for the third quarter increased
36 per cent to $247m.Mr Murphy, who joined the company this summer with the job of turning round its performance, expressed doubts about the benefits of opening US stores earlier and earlier on the day after Thanksgiving to lure shoppers.Almost all of Gap’s 1,060 Old Navy stores will open for the first time this year at 5am on Friday, two hours earlier than was generally the case last year.Some 170 of its Gap Outlet stores will open at midnight, against 70 last year.The day after Thanks­giving, known as “Black
Friday”, marks the promotional launch of holiday shopping, when millions
of shoppers rush to take advantage of early “door buster” bargains.“The hours just keep
sliding on us,” Mr Murphy said. “We thought 5 o’clock …was more than appropriate and competitive, and now you have some
retailers opening at four in the morning.”JC Penney, which operates more than 1,000 outlets, mostly in shopping malls, plans to open its stores at 4am this year, an hour earlier than last year. Its move increases pressure on other mall-based stores to follow suit.Other leading retailers, including Best Buy, Circuit City and Toys R Us, will again open at 5am.Early opening increases staffing and store overheads, without necessarily increasing traffic significantly.“You get the law of diminishing returns,” Mr Murphy said."
302;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-11-21T22:12:40Z;Mortgage fears depress Wall Street;;US stocks received another bruising on Wednesday amid mounting worries about the US economy.As the dollar hit new lows and crude oil set a record above $99, stocks were on the defensive with fears of a retail slowdown weighing on sentiment before the Thanksgiving holiday.The S&P 500 closed 1.6 per cent lower at 1,416.77, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 1.6 per cent to 12,799.04 while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,562.15.The Dow sank below its mid-August low, an important technical level for traders and the S&P 500 turned negative for the year.The Nasdaq has fallen more than 10 per cent from its peak this summer, the definition of a market correction.Volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called fear barometer – jumped 6.7 per cent to 26.54.The troubled mortgage sector remained foremost in investors’ minds.Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage agency, was down 2.8 per cent at $26 having plummeted 28.7 per cent the previous day.Worries about possible liquidity problems at Countrywide Financial continued to dog the stock. The mortgage lender has said persistent rumours that it might seek bankruptcy protection are “absolutely false”.However, the stock was down 8.4 per cent at $9.42 amid concerns that capital constraints at Fannie and Freddie would prevent the agencies buying mortgages from the secondary market.Residential Capital, GMAC Financial Services’ struggling subsidiary, said it planned to buy back $750m of debt and was considering strategic options to improve liquidity.Shares in General Motors, which still owns a stake in GMAC, closed 0.4 per cent higher at $26.39 after GM said it had “no further obligation” to inject capital into its former financing arm.Meanwhile AIG fell 5.7 per cent to $51.33, after the company said it would discuss its exposure to the US residential mortgage market at an investor meeting next month, sparking fears of further debt writedowns.US retailers again showed worrying signs of a slowdown in consumer spending. Gap lost 6.1 per cent to $18.96 after same-store sales fell 5 per cent.Although third-quarter profit increased 26 per cent, revenue was flat, missing analysts’ expectations.Third-quarter earnings at Limited Brands, owner of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain, fell sharply and it lowered its outlook for this quarter. However, the shares rose 2.4 per cent to $17.96.Deere & Co rose 4.9 per cent to $152.06 after the tractor manufacturer increased fourth-quarter earnings by 52 per cent, helped by a 32 per cent jump in overseas sales.The company increased its dividend and gave an upbeat outlook for 2008.
303;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-11-08T16:03:40Z;Weather and economy hit US stores;;One of the largest US retailers sounded a warning on Thursday over the prospects for holiday sales, after economic worries and warmer than ususal weather led to disappointing October sales.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, said his mid-range department store chain expected “the challenging retail environment to continue for the foreseeable future”, after announcing that sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.8 per cent in October.”Our customers are clearly facing headwinds that are impacting both sentiment and discretionary spending levels, including weak housing market conditions, high energy prices, and uncertainty in the mortgage and credit markets,” he said.Bob Ulrich, chief executive of Target Stores, noted that for the second month in a row the discount retailer experienced soft sales in higher margin categories, including clothing and warm weather items, as the company reported comparable sales growth of 4.1 per cent.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, reported a 1.5 per cent fall in same store sales, while Kohl’s said same store sales fell by 3.8 per cent. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store that traditionally outperforms the sector, reported a 2.4 per cent drop in comparable sales.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chief executive, said sales of outerwear, fleece and sweaters “experienced significant declines …contributing to our sales shortfall” as a result of the warm weather.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, also reported soft apparel sales as it announced that its comparable sales increased by 0.4 per cent during the month. Wal-Mart, which launched aggressive pre-holiday price cuts in October, said it expected comparable sales to increase by between 0 and 2 per cent in November.Speciality clothing sellers were also hard hit. Limited Brands saw its comparable sales fall 6 per cent, while Gap posted an 8 per cent drop. Chico’s FAS reported a 10.6 per cent sales drop and added profit would fall sharply in the current quarter.Retail Metrics, a firm that tracks the monthly same store data, said that its index of sales increased 1.9 per cent for the month, following a disappointing 1.6 per cent increase in September.“There is virtually no momentum coming out of September and October as we head into the thick of the holiday shopping season,” the firm said in its analysis of the data.
304;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-10-11T20:29:13Z;Wall St falls as confidence evaporates;;US stocks erased gains in a volatile afternoon session as confidence suddenly evaporated from the market.Technology shares led the falls after an analyst at JP Morgan lowered his sales estimate for Baidu.com.Large-cap technology stocks, which have lately enjoyed strong gains, were sold down rapidly as momentum evaporated and investors took profits.Traders were also concerned by comments by Axel Weber, a governing council member of the European Central Bank, said the bank may need to raise interest rates to control inflation.Having climbed as high as 2,834, the Nasdaq Composite fell as much as 2.7 per cent from its high to close 1.4 per cent lower on the day at 2,772.20.The S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent lower at 1,554.42 after it hit a new intra-day high of 1,576.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit a new high but closed 0.5 per cent lower at 14,015.12“The technology sector was extremely overbought going into today,” Paul Hickey co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group said.Amazon, down 5.6 per cent at $89.34 and Yahoo 2.5 per cent lower at $27.65 were sold down. Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry, saw some of the heaviest falls, down 5 per cent at $111.Baidu.com, which appeared to spark the sell-off, shed 10 per cent to $308.75 after JPMorgan cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by 3.2 per cent.Having surged to a record high of $641.41 Google closed the day down 0.5 per cent at $621.73.Earlier, positive news from Wal-Mart had helped soothe concerns about the outlook for US corporate earnings and offset weaker sales figures from other retailers.Wal-Mart surprised analysts by raising its third-quarter earnings estimate, helped by improved margins and expenses.The group expects third-quarter earnings of between 66 and 69 cents a share compared with previous guidance of 62-65 cents.But Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose 1.4 per cent in September, slightly less than expected. The shares gained 2.9 per cent to $46.90.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the results showed consumers were still going to the shops.“The reality is that consumer spending is a reflection of jobs and wages, not home values,” he said.There was disappointing news from other retailers as September sales fell below expectations after unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers away.Target, the discount retailer, fell 1.8 per cent to $64.62 after it said fiscal 2007 earnings would come in below its previous guidance of $3.60 a share.Nordstrom was 7.5 per cent lower at $44.97 after it warned lower-than-expected sales would cause third-quarter profit to fall below previous estimates.Gap was 1.4 per cent lower at $19.06 after announcing a same-store sales decline of 7 per cent in September. Analysts had expected a fall of 4.4 per cent.JC Penney fell 7 per cent to $63.27 after same-store sales dropped 4.6 per cent. Same-store sales at Abercrombie & Fitch fell 4 per cent in September. The shares fell 1.3 per cent at $83.45.After disappointing results and forecasts from blue chips on Wednesday, fears rose that third-quarter earnings could decline.“Overall the market is probably headed lower. Earnings growth will slow to around 3 per cent, down from the previous quarter and at levels we haven’t seen for several years,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Avalon Partners. “I believe the market is overbought and third-quarter earnings will weigh.”Carmakers were cheered after the United Auto Workers union ended a strike against Chrysler just a few hours after it had begun.General Motors was among the leading stocks on the Dow, up 4.9 per cent to $39.99, its highest level since the end of 2004. Ford rose 6.5 per cent to $8.76.The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit narrowed more than expected in August, declining 2.4 per cent to $57.6bn.Initial claims for unemployment benefit fell 12,000 last week to 308,000, slightly better than expected.Interest rate futures priced in only a 36 per cent likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by the end of this month but the market still expects another easing by the end of the year.
305;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-09-06T21:09:28Z;Wall St higher on retail sales figures;;Wall Street stocks closed moderately higher on Thursday, reversing earlier losses, as investors digested better-than-expected retail sales for August amid concerns over elevated money market rates.Of the 31 retailers that reported figures for August, 20 had beaten their estimates, according to Thomson Financial, the business information company.Wal-Mart shares were up 0.7 per cent to $42.76 after the largest US retailer said same-store sales rose 3.1 per cent in August, against estimates of 1-2 per cent growth.Target also beat estimates, sending its shares up 2.4 per cent to $63.39.American Eagle Outfitters’ same-store sales jumped 9 per cent, helped by a later tax-free shopping period in Texas and Florida, the retailer said on Thursday. Its shares were down 1.6 per cent at $24.71.Gap shares were 4 per cent lower at $18.25 after it reported a drop of 1 per cent.Macy’s, the second-largest US department store chain, also reported a gain in same-store sales, beating the estimate for unchanged sales, sending its shares 1 per cent higher at $30.87.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,478.55, while the Nasdaq composite was up 0.3 per cent at 2,614.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 13,363.35.“Equities are slightly edgy, credit spreads are marginally wider and the current most overt symptom that all is not right in the boiling room is that Libor rates continue to head in ‘the wrong’ direction, providing an overt symbol of the limitations of central bank liquidity injections,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“Not that central banks are not pursuing appropriate policies, with the ECB continuing to pump in extraordinary amounts of cash.”On Thursday, three-month US Libor set at 5.72375 per cent, a new peak in the floating rate benchmark since the credit crunch started early last month. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “We continue to be bullish on the domestic stock market for the next 6-12 months, as our earnings, valuation and sentiment work all support our positive stance.“Admittedly, an increase in high-yield borrowing costs would be a roadblock for LBO activity and/or stock buy-backs funded with debt.”Mr Levkovich, however, noted some concerns for late 2008 and early 2009.“If the stock market continues to appreciate over the next 12 months or so, as we deem likely, we could see a deluge of money flows back into US stocks.“This would raise the risk profile, in our opinion, and could be an issue to monitor for any excessive bullish sentiment.”Also in the news, Countrywide Financialannounced it would cut another 900 jobs, as the nation’s largest mortgage lender deals with the credit crunch. Its shares were down 1.8 per cent at $18.48.Campbell Soup dropped 3.5 per cent to $36.68 after the world’s largest soupmaker said fourth-quarter profit was 14 cents a share excluding one-time items. Analysts had estimated earnings of 18 cents a share.In economic news, weekly jobless claims declined 19,000 to 318,000, much larger than a forecast 4,000 fall. Investors will focus on the monthly employment report for August due on Friday for a broader view of the underlying trend in the labour market.Meanwhile, non-farm business productivity rose 2.6 per cent during the second quarter, after being previously estimated at 1.8 per cent.Stock market investors also responded to the Institute for Supply Management’s survey of non-manufacturing activity for August.The report was expected to show a decline to 54.5 from 55.8, but actually remained unchanged in August from July at 55.8.The Federal Reserve released the outstanding commercial paper volumes, showing the outstanding level of commercial paper dropped once again over this week to Wednesday.But the decline was smaller than that seen in the previous three weeks.The total outstanding amount of commercial paper fell $54.1bn on a seasonally adjusted basis to $1,925bn.
306;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-07-26T20:55:05Z;Gap appoints new CEO;;Gap, the world’s largest speciality clothing retailer, has named Glenn Murphy, a Canadian with a career in supermarkets and drugstores, as chief executive officer, ending a search that began after the departure of Paul Pressler in January.Until March, Mr Murphy was chairman and chief executive officer of Shoppers Drug Mart, Canada’s leading drugstore chain. He was appointed as CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in June 2001, when the company was held by a group of private equity investors led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and presided over its successful return to public listing five months later.Mr. Murphy, aged 45, also worked previously for 14 years at Loblaw, the leading Canadian supermarket group.Robert Fisher, the son of Gap’s founders and chairman of the board, said Mr Murphy was “known for being a decisive leader with great retail instincts who understands his customers”.“He has revitalised major retail brands by offering new products and significantly improving the store experience,” he said.Mr Fisher has served as interim CEO since the departure of Mr Pressler, who failed to reverse more than two years of falling sales at the retailer.Since Mr Pressler left, Mr Fisher made a series of potentially difficult changes at the retailer, including deciding to close down Gap’s fledgling Forth & Towne fourth brand that was aimed at older women.He also replaced the Gap brand’s chief adult clothing designer, and appointed Marka Hansen as president of the Gap brand, replacing Cynthia Harriss. Ms Hansen has said she intends to narrow the age focus of Gap’s clothing.Mr Murphy, who has no experience in the fashion industry, was chosen after a search headed by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop, with Gap’s founder Don Fisher, Domenico De Sole, the former CEO of Gucci Group, and Bob Martin, a former Wal-Mart executive.There had been speculation that the company would look the fashion industry to replace Mr Pressler, who came to Gap in 2002 from Disney, where he headed the company’s theme park division. However, Mr Pressler’s focus on the science of customer research-driven development was faulted for failing to deliver the inspired fashion needed to maintain Gap’s appeal to customers.Mr Bellamy stressed Mr Murphy’s “proven retail skills and demonstrated financial results” which he said would complement the management team running the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic brands.
307;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-07-08T16:28:46Z;Fast’s fashion statement in Barneys’ bid;;"It is as though The Gap had reached across the Atlantic to swallow Harrods. On Thursday Japan’s Fast Retailing, owner of the mass-market Uniqlo clothing chain, leapt the Pacific to offer $900m for Barneys New York, the ultra-fashionable US department store.The unsolicited bid, which trumps by 9 per cent an earlier offer from an investment arm of the Dubai government, marks the boldest move in an aggressive expansion drive that Fast Retailing’s chief executive, Tadashi Yanai, hopes will turn Japan’s biggest clothing retailer into a global powerhouse.Mr Yanai wants to more than double Fast Retailing’s annual sales to Y1,000bn ($8bn) by 2010 and has earmarked Y300bn-Y400bn for acquisitions to meet that goal. Since 2003 he has bought stakes in Theory, a trendy US clothing chain; Comptoir des Cotonniers in France; and Italy’s Aspesi.Uniqlo, which contributes about 90 per cent of Fast Retailing’s sales, opened a 3,300 square metre flagship store in Manhattan last year, but sales there of its T-shirts, jeans and other basics have disappointed so far. Only about 30 of Uniqlo’s 780-odd stores are outside Japan.“Their brand recognition in the US is zero because they had to start from scratch,” says Dairo Murata, retail analyst at Credit Suisse. “It takes time to build up a new operation with directly owned stores, especially in the US, which is so competitive.”The ambitious Mr Yanai appears to have drawn the same conclusion. Buying Barneys would give him an established property with a respected name and growing turnover. And unlike some of Fast Retailing’s past acquisitions, particularly in Japan, Barneys is not a risky rescue case.“Some of the companies Fast has bought cheaply haven’t really turned around. With Barneys they wouldn’t have to go through that,” Mr Murata says.Barneys does not publish its financial results, but Goldman Sachs estimates it has enjoyed like-for-like sales growth of between 10 and 15 per cent over the past few years.Goldman believes its 34 stores generated operating profits of about $47m on sales of $720m last year, meaning Fast would be paying about 25 times earnings.But Fast will first have to see off its Dubai rival, Istithmar. The buy-out company that is wholly owned by the Gulf state’s oil-rich rulers, is keen on the US retail sector and last year spent $300m to buy Loehmann’s, a discount seller of designer men’s and women’s fashion.Jones Apparel, Barneys’ owner, agreed to an $825m offer from Istithmar late last month.The deal includes a break fee of up to $22.7m should Jones, which bought Barneys for $400m in 2004, receive a higher bid. Istithmar could well sweeten its offer instead.Analysts say Fast has the financial clout to stay in a race with Istithmar. It has roughly Y160bn in cash and highly liquid securities and is debt free, giving it plenty of room to pile on leverage.“At $900m, the acquisition wouldn’t have a big financial impact,” says Machiko Amano of Standard & Poor’s. “If anything the deal would strengthen Fast from an operating standpoint. Of course, if a bidding war develops and the price shoots up there may be cause for concern.”Fast may not find many synergies between Barneys and its core mass-market business, but that might not be its priority.It would most likely leave Barneys’ management in place and supervise from a distance as a portfolio investor, analysts say. A hands-off approach could be the safest course for Fast, which has stumbled in its global growth effort before.Weak sales in the UK after a rushed expansion forced it to cut the number of Uniqlo stores there by more than half from a peak of 21 in 2002.Last year its only profitable foreign division was in Hong Kong: it lost money in mainland China, South Korea, Britain, the US and France.However, Fast has proved willing to take short-term hits to advance its growth strategy.Group-wide sales were up 19 per cent in the first half through February, but net profit fell 15 per cent, as Uniqlo cut prices to offload jackets and other cold-weather clothing during an unusually warm winter."

Like several other line-dwellers, Mr Sanchez planned to turn a quick buck by putting his new iPhone up for sale on Ebay.Rumour had it that the newest Apple gadget, which retails for between $499 and $599, could sell for more than $1,000 on Craigslist or other websites.“I’m looking to double my money,” said Mr Sanchez. “That’s the worst case scenario. I’ll probably get more.”Josh May, 18, of Benecia, California said he was one of “four college kids looking for money”.Spotting a business opportunity, the four formed iWait, offering to stand in line for people who could not do it themselves.Several internet start-ups sent emissaries to wait in line overnight in an attempt to secure publicity for their business by waiting in line, bedecked in
corporate logos and finery.“We have an office full of people who are rotating,” said David Young, an engineer at Slide, a maker of online widgets. “We started turning up around noon yesterday. We weren’t going to start that early, but somebody told us the [San Francisco] Chronicle would be there.”In New York, the first in line was Greg Packer, a 43-year-old former highway maintenance worker who has made a career of being first at famous public events – including the opening of New York’s condolence book for the Princess of Wales.But it was not all about hustling and entrepreneurship.Pablo Defendini, 28, a graphic designer from Brooklyn, said: “The passionate are more quiet, listening to music or working on their laptops.”He described himself as one of them. “The iPhone is a product that is such a long time coming.”"
309;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-06-07T22:33:14Z;Warm May lifts sales at US retailers;;Leading US chain retailers on Thursday reported solid sales in May, as warm weather released pent-up demand from a dismal April and helped offset continuing consumer concerns over petrol prices and the housing market.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 per cent for the month, supported by good performances by upmarket department stores and some speciality clothing retailers.Nordstrom, Saks and Bon Ton department stores all beat Wall Street forecasts. However, Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, missed market expectations for the fourth consecutive month, with a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, highlighting concerns about its integration of the former May’s Department stores it acquired in 2005.At JC Penney, comparable sales dropped 2 per cent, with it citing soft sales in jewellery, women’s accessories and household products, while sales at its rival Kohl’s saw a 10.5 per cent increase.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported a 7 per cent fall in same-store sales in North America, with sales at its Gap brand stores down 3 per cent. The retailer is pursuing a turnround while searching for a chief executive to replace Paul Pressler, who stepped down in January.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 0.3 per cent, although its Sam’s Club warehouse sales were up 5.4 per cent to give a total comparable sales increase of 1.1 per cent.Wal-Mart again said that its consumers continue to be troubled by rising petrol prices, which hit $3.20 during the month.The company said sales of clothing and home goods remained sluggish, but it expected to see improvements in the categories in its third quarter and “significant progress” in the fourth quarter. It said it expected sales in June to be between flat or up 2 per cent.Target, its smaller upmarket rival, said its same-store sales rose 5.8 per cent.
310;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-05-30T23:53:45Z;Nike to promote workers’ rights;;Nike, the world’s largest sports shoe and clothing brand, is to strengthen efforts to combat potential abuses of the 800,000 workers in its global supply chain with a push to promote labour rights, including the freedoms to form and join trades unions.The company says it will set up an educational programme on workers’ rights to freedom of association, to be implemented in all of its contract factories by 2011, the date the company has set for reaching $23bn (€17.1bn, £11.6bn) in sales.Hannah Jones, Nike’s vice-president for corporate responsibility, says the brand is now placing a greater effort on promoting “systemic” change in its supply chain, which would include strengthening the ability of factory workers to speak out on their own behalf about problems.“We believe constructive dialogue between workers and factory management leads to better conditions,” she said. In its latest corporate responsibility report, Nike acknowledges that the strategy of factory inspections embraced by leading brands since the mid-1990s has not eliminated endemic abuses such as unpaid wages and excessive overtime.“Across the industry we continue to see systemic issues affecting workers rights,” the report says.Since facing criticism over workplace abuses in the mid-1990s, Nike has become a standard-setter for efforts to improve supply chain conditions and other companies have followed its lead on corporate responsibility.The report acknowledges the political issues involved – around 65 per cent of Nike-brand footwear is made in China and Vietnam, where independent trade unions are illegal, but where some brands have experimented with “parallel association” through factory-based committees.Neil Kearney, an international trades union representative who reviewed the Nike report, said that a decade of factory monitoring efforts had led to a renewed interest in improving industrial relations at supplier factories.“A number of the leading corporations have now recognised that responsibility for workplace conditions needs to go back to where it belongs, with the employers, and with the relationship between employers and labour,” he said.The report also says that by 2011 Nike will eliminate all “excessive overtime” from its supplier factories – hours worked in excess of local laws or Nike’s code of conduct – in part through efforts by its buyers and design teams to avoid sudden increases in orders or product variations.Other brands, including Gap and Marks and Spencer, have also sought to integrate into their design and planning operations an awareness of the impact on decisions on suppliers.The UK-based Ethical Trading Initiative, which supports supply chain standards, is also focusing its attention on the issue, according to Alan Roberts, its chairman.“If excessive overtime is being created by design practices, then we have to make sure that the brands take responsibility for that,” he said.
311;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-05-10T20:36:05Z;Wall St slides on retail worries;;Wall Street suffered its largest one-day decline in nearly two months on Thursday, as sentiment soured in the wake of much weaker-than-expected monthly retail sales in April.Traders said the poor shop sales and a worse-than-forecast US trade deficit in March provided some investors with an excuse to sell stocks after the market’s recent strong performance.The sharp pull-back in share prices failed to attract significant buying on the dip, as was seen on Tuesday.At late-afternoon, the S&P 500 had closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,491.47, its worst daily loss since a 2 per cent fall on March 13. Energy and healthcare stocks led the major industry groups lower.The Nasdaq Composite was 1.65 per cent weaker at 2,533.74.Since the rally in stocks that gathered steam in late March, analysts say some investors have missed out on gains and have been looking for a buying opportunity in the event of a pull-back.“Our conversations with institutional clients yield interesting anecdotal evidence that many investors have not been positioned long enough, and thus haven’t experienced robust portfolio performance,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.“Indeed, it has been pretty commonplace to hear fund managers complain that the market needs to take a breather or consolidate gains, a tone that implies a desire to buy more shares, but at lower prices than today’s.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,215.13, after it had set its 21st record close for the year on Wednesday.Major retailers reported same-store sales figures for April on Thursday, and the Thomson Financial same-store sales index fell 1.8 per cent last month against an expected 0.4 per cent rise.Of the 51 retailers who revealed their sales, 85 per cent missed their estimates, according to Thomson. “Most retailers have missed expectations and blamed the Easter effect and unfavourable weather,” it said.David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said the much weaker-than-anticipated chain store sales had led the bank to reduce its forecast for total US retail sales in April, due on Friday. The bank expects headline and ex-auto sales to fall 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart was in the spotlight with a sales fall of 3.5 per cent last month, worse than expected. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $47.75.JC Penney closed down 1.8 per cent at $76.80, and Federated Department Stores fell 3.9 per cent to $42.10 after posting weaker than forecast sales.Shares in Gap fell 0.8 per cent to $18.28 after the clothing retailer said April sales fell 11 per cent.In contrast, Costco beat estimates as it delivered a 7 per cent rise in like-for-like sales. Its shares closed a fraction higher at $54.95, down from a high of $56.21 earlier in the day.Thomson said sales prospects for May were looking better and that “the majority indicated stronger sales towards the end of the month, when weather improved.” Mr Greenlaw said: “The near-term health of discretionary buying will probably be closely tied to developments at the gas pump. Some relief on that front finally appears to be in sight, but probably not for a few more weeks.”In earnings news, Whole Foods’ first quarter profits fell 11 per cent year on year, missing estimates amid slowing sales growth and rising costs. Shares in the organic food retailer slid 10.2 per cent to $41.15.EchoStar Communications said first quarter earnings rose 6.7 per cent, but missed estimates and shares in the satellite-television provider rose 0.3 per cent to $48.32.Shares inJohnson & Johnson and Amgen both slid 2.5 per cent to $62.50 and 9.1 per cent to $57.33 respectively, after a Food and Drug Administration panel said their anti-anemia drugs should face further restrictions.Viacom said first quarter net income fell 36 per cent, amid higher production and restructuring costs at MTV. Its shares fell 1.3 per cent to $41.49.Shares in Sara Lee fell 0.4 per cent to $17.02, after the maker of food and household goods said its third quarter profit nearly tripled.Meanwhile, Hershey said higher dairy costs would damp profits this year, sending shares down 3.8 per cent to $52.93.Shares inBarr Pharmaceuticals rose 2 per cent to $53.28 after a broker upgrade in the wake of the company reiterating its earnings outlook on Wednesday.
312;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US stores hit as shoppers scale back;;Continuing economic pressures on consumers combined with cold weather and the impact of an early Easter to give leading US retailers a miserable April, according to same-store sales figures published on Thursday.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said 80 per cent of the leading chain stores reporting same-store sales figures missed Wall Street forecasts, which he described as the worst performance he could remember. Retail Metrics’ index of same-store sales fell 1.8 per cent for the month, after a 6 per cent increase in March.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, also pointed out that the average monthly growth in same-store sales over the past three months was 2 per cent, compared with 4 per cent over the same period last year.“I think the statement is that the consumer has scaled back spending …And the key story is really the ripple effect of slower housing demand on the retail sector,” he said.He also warned of continuing threats to consumer demand ahead, including rising petrol prices, lingering housing problems and future increases in food costs. “It is definitely a tough environment for the retailers, and it doesn’t look that much better in the near term.”Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said its monthly survey of shoppers showed concerns about higher fuel prices had “increased steadily since January”. During April, the retailer reported a 3.5 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year, its worst figures for more than 25 years. It cited factors including the cold weather, which discouraged consumers from buying summer clothing and goods, as well as the effects of a recall of petfood by its main suppliers. Target, its discount rival, said April stores fell 6.1 per cent, having warned last month that sales would be weaker than its original forecast of a decline of 2 to 4 per cent.Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, reported a 2.2 per cent fall in same-store sales, while JC Penney reported a 2.7 per cent decline, both worse the Wall Street analysts had predicted.Gap, the struggling speciality clothing retailer, was particularly badly hit, reporting a 16 per cent fall in same-store sales, including a 14 per cent fall at its Gap brand stores in North America, and a 20 per cent fall at Old Navy. Net sales were down 11 per cent.

Mr Pressler left after failing to reverse two years of falling sales at the retailer’s Gap and Old Navy brands.Mr Muto was previously president at the Gap brand, where he rose through the ranks as a merchandiser, before being asked by Mr Pressler to head Gap’s unsuccessful attempt to launch Forth & Towne, a new brand aimed at older women. Gap said earlier this year it will close down its handful of Forth & Towne stores.Gap has indicated that it plans to give the Gap brand a tighter fashion focus than its previous effort to attract customers aged between 18 and 35.The company is now headed by Robert Fisher, the son of its founders Don and Doris Fisher, who took over as interim chief executive following the departure of Mr Pressler.Mr Muto will also head Gapbody, the brand’s intimates unit.Saks announced the retirement of Brad Martin, its chairman, after twenty years that included seven as chief executive.Mr Martin oversaw the purchase of the upmarket Saks Fifth Avenue stores in 1998 by Proffitt’s, a regional department store group, and served as chief executive of the resulting retail group from 1999 to 2006. Saks has subsequently sold off the regional department stores to focus on the Saks Fifth Avenue stores.The post of chairman will be taken by Steve Sadove, Saks’ current CEO.
314;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
315;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-03-01T22:39:40Z;Gap’s Fisher pledges turnround;;Bob Fisher, interim chief executive of Gap, said on Thursday the company’s leadership was committed to achieving a turnround, indirectly pouring cold water on speculation of a leveraged buy-out at the world’s largest speciality retailer.“Let me me leave no doubt, I am confident we can and will regain our momentum,” said Mr Fisher, a member of Gap’s founding family who took over as interim chief executive in January after the departure of Paul Pressler.“I believe this company still has tremendous potential,” he said.Mr Fisher outlined what he said were some of Gap’s strategic mistakes under Mr Pressler, a former senior Disney executive who took over as chief executive in 2002.He said that Gap was “not clear about who we were”, and lost too much talent in its senior management. He also said that efforts to increase the efficiency of Gap’s global supply chain had “ultimately slowed us down”.“The brands were not able to make fast decisions,” he said, adding that Gap had also allowed its expenses to grown in the expectation that its sales would grow more.Gap’s fourth quarter results underlined the challenge facing the retailer, with a 35 per cent fall in net income as its brands continued to face falling or flat sales despite heavy discounts.It also delivered a conservative forecast for profits during the current fiscal year, as its struggles to turn its business around.The company reported net earnings of $219m, or $0.27 per diluted share, while net sales for the quarter, which included an extra week, rose slightly to $4.9bn.Gap announced on Monday that it would abandon its bid to create a new fourth brand aimed at older women, closing 19 stores established under the Forth & Towne name it launched in early 2005.Gap said it expects its 2007 net earnings to range between 76 cents and 86 cents, including a charge of 4 cents due to the closure of Forth & Towne, below Wall Street’s forecast of around $1.00.
316;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-02-26T18:02:03Z;Gap to abandon new fourth brand;;Gap, the US troubled clothing retailer, is to close down a fledgling line of stores aimed at older women, in a change of strategic direction following the depature last month of Paul Pressler, its former chief executive.The move comes amid speculation that Gap’s management might consider the sale of all or part of the company, following two years of poor sales at its Gap and Old Navy brands.The company’s Forth & Towne stores, unveiled just 18 months ago, had sought to focus on baby-boomer women aged 35 and over, who represent an increasingly important segment of the US clothing market.Gap said that despite an encouraging start “a thorough analysis revealed the concept was not demonstrating enough potential to deliver an acceptable long-term return on investment”.It will take a $40m pre-tax charge in its first and second quarters due to the closure of the brand’s 19 existing stores, most of which opened just last autumn.The new brand was a central element in the company’s growth strategy under Mr Pressler, who has now been replaced as interim president and CEO by Bob Fisher, the son of Gap’s founders.While the stores represented a new attempt to focus on a well-defined market segment, they also took adopted a merchandising strategy that left some customers confused, with four different fashion “selections” in each store, that were supposed to target different life-styles.Todd Slater, analyst at Lazard Capital Markets, welcomed the move, saying the brand “never gained much traction, suffered from fit, style, and image problems, and became a big distraction”.Mr Fisher described the experience with the format as “an illustration of the innovative risks you need to take in our business” and added that Gap wanted to “focus our efforts on stabilising the existing businesses”.Forth & Towne was developed and headed by Gary Muto, a company veteran who was formerly president of the Gap brand, before being moved to the project by Mr Pressler.The decision is the latest in a series of changes made since Mr Fisher took over from Mr Pressler, including replacing Cynthia Harriss as president of the Gap brand with Marka Hansen, formerly president of the more successful Banana Republic stores.Gap subsequently announced the departure of Charlotte Neuville, the head designer hired by the Gap brand in 2005 as part of a bid to reverse falling sales.Some analysts have argued that the moves undertaken since Mr Pressler left, and ahead of the naming of a new CEO, indicate that the members of the Fisher family, who control over 30 per cent of Gap’s shares, are committed to turning Gap around, rather than a sale.Analysts at Merrill Lynch recently argued that there was only a 25 per cent chance of a leveraged buy-out of the company, noting that the Fishers had continued to back the previous management through several failed turnaround bids.Gap’s shares were largely unchanged by the news, trading at $19.71 at lunchtime in New York.
317;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-23T23:57:38Z;Founders’ son dons the mantle at Gap;;A member of the Fisher family is once again running Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer.Robert Fisher, the son of Donald and Doris Fisher who founded the chain in 1969, has taken over as interim chief executive.This follows Monday’s announcement of the departure of Paul Pressler, chief executive since 2002.Mr Pressler’s exit departure follows the failure of efforts to reverse more than two years of slumping sales at Gap, which operates Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores and has annual sales of more than $16bn.Gap says it has begun the search for a new chief executive, but the move underlines the central role of the Fishers, who own more than a third of Gap’s shares, amid speculation over possible strategic alternatives for the troubled retailer.“They have to identify with the company,” says Gilbert Harrison, president of Financo, an investment bank specialising in retail, of the Fisher family’s relationship with Gap.“I think they still believe the company has tremendous potential, and they are going to do everything they can to fix it,” he says.Robert Fisher, 52, the eldest of three sons who started his career as a store manager, took over as chairman in 2003 when his father Don stepped down. Both Don and Doris have remained on the board.The Fishers’ second son, William, also worked at the retailer, becoming head of the international division, before moving into private equity.He co-founded Manzanita Capital, a private equity fund based in London, that is the largest shareholder in Space.NK, the upmarket UK health and beauty chain.The third brother, John, is also a private equity investor. He manages the family’s investment portfolio, and is the principal investor in the Oakland As baseball team.Don and Doris opened their first store because, according to the company, Don could not find a pair of jeans that fitted him.Together with Millard “Mickey” Drexler, who spent almost 20 years as chief operating officer and chief executive until he left in 2002, the Fishers built Gap into a network of more than 4,000 stores, adding Old Navy and Banana Republic to the original Gap name.The wealth generated by Gap turned Don and Doris into members of San Francisco’s business aristocracy, largely dominated by internet fortunes.They are avid art collectors, displaying works from a collection that includes Warhols, Frank Stella and Richard Serra at a gallery in the Gap headquarters building on Folsom Street.They supported the decision to keep Gap’s corporate headquarters in downtown San Francisco rather than moving out to the suburbs.“They’re absolutely a San Francisco institution,” says a local executive who knows some of the family.“They have been incredibly important to the cultural and aesthetic life of the city.”Nationally, the couple have played an active role in backing a network of privately supported public “charter” schools in inner city and rural areas, as well as backing other youth and educational charities.The family has played a leading role in Gap’s efforts to promote its reputation as a good corporate citizen, through supply chain monitoring and other initiatives such as funding the Center for Responsible Business at Haas Business School in Berkeley.But as the family reviews its options, the Fishers’ close association with the brand and their broader interests may lead them to take a wider view of what constitutes an acceptable solution for shareholders.“Bob Fisher cares deeply about not simply the brand, but the values underlying the brand,” says an associate.“He takes this concept of an icon seriously, and wants the values that underlie the icon to be positive.”

This month it emerged that the owner of the Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy and other clothing brands had hired Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, to examine strategic alternatives.The move fed speculation that the company, which has been suffering from two years of slumping sales, could be taken private in a buy-out worth more than $16bn.Gap said on Monday that Mr Pressler and the Gap board had come to a “mutual agreement” about his departure. It added that they had agreed it was “time for a new direction and new leadership” at the company.Gap’s shares rose 2.6 per cent in after hours trading as investors welcomed the announcement. The shares had risen more than 7 per cent this month following news of the strategic review.Robert Fisher, Gap’s chairman and the son of Donald and Doris Fisher, who founded the company in San Francisco in 1969, was appointed interim CEO. He had previously held a number of senior positions at the company, including chief financial officer and chief operating officer.Gap said its board had formed a search committee that would begin looking for a permanent replacement for Mr Pressler immediately.Mr Fisher said on Monday that he would focus on “reinvigorating our brands and charting a new course for the future”.Mr Pressler’s departure follows a separate shake-up this month that saw the departure of two top managers at the Gap and Old Navy brands, which together account for the bulk of the company’s sales.Gap became one of the great success stories of US retailing after a dramatic expansion in the 1990s. In recent years, however, it has struggled to keep up with competitors who have eaten into its traditional customer base, making the company a prime candidate for a takeover or break-up by private equity groups, according to banking sources.Other retailers that have been taken private in recent years include Neiman Marcus, the luxury goods store, and J Crew, a clothing retailer that was acquired and later taken public by Texas Pacific Group.Gap said Mr Pressler would be eligible for up to $14m in severance pay over two years following his departure.Gap on Monday reiterated its earnings forecasts for the full year. It reports its results on March 1.

He believes large pharmaceutical companies will benefit most from a further fall in oil.At the close yesterday, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent firmer at 1,430.73, its highest level since 2000, and a gain of 1.5 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 12,556.08, a new record close and gained 1.3 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.7 per cent to 2,502.82, a rise of 2.8 per cent this week.Apple set a record high of $97.80 after unveiling its new iPhone. That mood was clipped when Cisco said it had taken legal action over Apple’s use of the iPhone name and by reports of Federal scrutiny over backdated stock options given to Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive officer. Shares in Apple were 11.3 per cent higher for the week at $94.62.Marvell Technology, a chipmaker used by Apple for the iPhone, rose 5 per cent to $20.39.Other notable technology shares on the up this week included Yahoo, with a gain of 6.2 per cent to $29.45, and Microsoft, up 5.3 per cent at $31.21, its highest level since 2002.But it was not all good news for technology stocks as Advanced Micro Devices said lower product chip prices would hurt fourth quarter earnings and revenue. Shares in AMD plunged yesterday and were 7.4 per cent lower for the week at $18.26.Citigroup downgraded AMD and, although the news briefly hurt the Philadelphia semiconductor index, it was 2.9 per cent higher for the week.Shares in Intel, AMD’s rival, reversed early weakness yesterday and were up 4.9 per cent over the week at $22.13.Intel has gained 9 per cent since the start of the year and analysts believe the company has taken market share from AMD.“Intel has a reinvigorated product line that third party evaluations indicate have superior performance to AMD’s product line,” noted Citigroup.As tech hummed, oil stocks slid, led by a 5.3 per cent fall to $63.83 in ConocoPhillips. Exxon Mobil fell 0.8 per cent to $72.66, and is the weakest stock in the Dow this year with a loss of 5.3 per cent.The exchange-traded fund that tracks the energy sector of the S&P under the ticker symbol XLE fell 1 per cent to $55.44 this week and is down 11 per cent from the record high of $62.13 set in mid-December.Airline stocks were boosted by the lower oil prices, talk of further consolidation and the prospect of better earnings. The American stock exchange airline index rose 8.4 per cent this week. United Airlines’ parent UAL rose 7.8 per cent to $50.16, and made a new 52-week high. Shares in US Airways Group rose 4.3 per cent to $60.81 after it raised its offer for bankrupt Delta to $10.2bn.Earnings season began this week and Alcoa, the aluminium producer, provided a positive start. Its shares rallied 7.1 per cent to $30.79 after it beat estimates.Genentech rose 3.8 per cent to $86.83 after the biotechnology healthcare group surpassed earnings expectations.A slew of companies report results next week, and Thomson Financial said expect average earnings growth of 9.1 per cent for the fourth quarter.In the past 13 quarters earnings growth has been above 10 per cent.Shares in RadioShack rose 15.1 per cent to $19.35 and St Jude Medical jumped 10.2 per cent to $38.58 as they both raised their earnings outlooks.Sprint Nextel suffered a 10.2 per cent slide to $17.25 this week after it cut operating revenue forecasts for both 2006 and 2007.Manufacturing companies Molex and Schnitzer Steel also issued profit warnings. Molex fell 5.6 per cent to $29.06, and Schnitzer slid 8.1 per cent to $34.66.Shares in Gap rallied 7.5 per cent to $20.30 amid talk of a private equity buy-out for the company.
321;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Gap makes brand changes;;Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, on Wednesday announced two senior management changes at its Gap and Old Navy brands as it struggles with disappointing sales amid speculation over a possible sale of the company.The company said Denise Johnston, president of Gap brand’s adult clothing line, is leaving less than nine months since she joined from Liz Claiborne, the fashion brand company. Ms Johnston was a chief lieutenant of Cynthia Harriss, the brand president, who will handle her responsibilities until a replacement is found.The company also announced the departure of Ivy Ross, the chief designer at Old Navy, who has held the position since 2004. Ms Ross was one of the most high profile creative personalities in Gap’s top management, and previously worked for Mattel developing toys for teenage girls.Gap said earlier this month it was undertaking a brand strategy review at Old Navy and Gap after the failure of a two year push to reverse falling sales. It has also hired Goldman Sachs to undertake a broad review of possible options for the company, which could include a sale of all or part of it.
322;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-09T22:11:17Z;Nasdaq boosted by Apple;;US stocks in the energy and telecoms sectors suffered on Tuesday, but amid the gloom, technology rallied as Apple unveiled new products.The computer and software company surged 8.3 per cent to $92.57 after chief executive officer Steve Jobs unveiled the company’s iPhone among other products.The rally in Apple boosted the information technology sector and the Nasdaq Composite outperformed the major averages and closed 0.2 per cent, or 5.63 points higher at 2,443.83 on Tuesday.The S&P 500 index finished 0.05 per cent, or 0.73 points, better at 1,412.11. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent, or 6.89 points to 12,416.60.The telecoms and energy sectors led losses in the S&P. Oil remained the main talking point among investors, and stocks matched a volatile performance in crude oil prices.“We’ve been keeping an eye on the energy sector over the past year because it has been a leading sector during this bull market,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. He noted the exchange traded fund that tracks the energy sector of the S&P, or XLE, had risen 170 per cent since October 2002, “the largest advance of any S&P sector.”The XLE fell 1.1 per cent to $55.33 on Tuesday and had fallen 11 per cent from its record high of $62.13 set in mid-December. Mr Tower believed the XLE remained vulnerable.“This is not a bullish time for commodity stocks in general. The end of an economic expansion is typically a period where commodity prices experience the most difficulty.”The other main company story on Tuesday was Sprint Nextel, which said its operating revenues for both 2006 and 2007 would be lower than expected and that it planned to cut 5,000 jobs. Analysts downgraded the company, and its shares plunged 11.2 per cent to $17.45.Analysts at CreditSights said the company’s credit profile would “deteriorate in 2007 and beyond”, and that the stock price would fall. Credit insurance against a default was “likely to widen in 2007”.One possible silver lining for Sprint investors, however could be a future buyout.“Investors should be aware that the name is likely to see significant volatility as it is likely to be in the news as a potential takeover target by cable operator,” concluded CreditSights.AES fell 4.1 per cent to $20.16 as the electric utility faces the threat that its Venezuela unit, Electricidad de Caracas, will be nationalised.General Electric was unchanged at $37.55 amid reports that it might sell its plastics division.Shares in Gap fell 0.4 per cent to $20.19. AG Edwards downgraded the stock, saying upside was limited even in the event of a buy-out offer for the company.
323;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-09T19:12:12Z;Gap’s strategic dilemma;;Over the past few years, Gap has shown an uncanny ability not to sell its merchandise. Could the retailer do a better job of getting rid of some or all of its operating businesses? Bringing in the investment bankers is a positive sign. For one thing, it suggests that after years of declining sales and eroding margins, Gap is ready to consider all options.However, its long-suffering shareholders should not hold their breath. Among Gap’s three main brands, only Banana Republic can claim half-respectable results. But the brand only accounts for about 15 per cent of sales and probably under 20 per cent of profits. The company’s real problem is the poor performance of Old Navy and Gap itself. Adding in the operational overlaps between the brands, it looks more sensible to try selling the whole company rather than individual bits.If private equity firms do take an interest, however, it might say more about their desperation for suitable targets than Gap’s appeal. After adjusting for net cash, it is already valued at about 9 times current earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, slightly below the average for recent large retail deals. But unlike many rivals, Gap owns few real-estate assets and instead has significant lease obligations. Capitalising these is tricky, but doing so suggests an underlying ebitda multiple closer to 13 times.Of course, Gap is a prime turnround candidate with impressive brands. But its franchises are fairly mature and highly exposed to fashion risks. Given tough competition, restoring their profitability is likely to take years, even if run by retail geniuses. In the meantime, a private equity buyer would probably have to reduce capital expenditure – making it harder to eventually float it as a growth story. At current valuation levels, Gap might struggle to find a buyer, even if its founding family agrees to sell.
324;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-08T23:17:32Z;Wall St edges higher as earnings season nears;;US stocks lacked conviction on Monday as the onset of the quarterly earnings season outweighed the influence of merger and acquisition activity and stock upgrades.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent, or 3.13 points, to 1,412.84. Of the 10 main groups in the index, seven were positive, led by the industrials sector. Telecommunications led losses.Gap closed 7.3 per cent higher at $20.26. It is said to have hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives, which may include a sale of the company.Verizon fell 0.5 per cent to $36.81. The stock was lower before news that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez plans to nationalise the country’s telephone group , CANTV, in which Verizon holds a 28.5 per cent stake.The S&P energy sector matched a volatile day for oil prices and settled in negative territory after a loss of 4.8 per cent last week. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent, or 3.95 points, to 2,438.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent, or 25.48 points, higher at 12,423.49.Investors were cautious before the start of the fourth quarter earnings season.“Earnings will be watched closely but there will also be a focus on guidance for this year,” said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.According to Thomson Financial, equity analysts expect earnings will have grown on average 9.6 per cent for the fourth quarter, down from a 19 per cent rise in the third quarter. Full-year earnings growth for 2007 is forecast to come in at 9.2 per cent, below the figure for 2006 of 15.5 per cent.Citigroup warned that any confirmation of an earnings growth slowdown for this year was “something the Street may not initially welcome”.Dow component Alcoa, the aluminium maker, will report fourth quarter results on Tuesday. Shares fell 1 per cent to $28.48. Earnings worries were fanned when manufacturing companies Molex and Schnitzer Steel, andTellabs issued profit warnings on Monday. Molex fell 4.9 per cent to $29.28, Schnitzer slid 7.4 per cent to $34.93 and Tellabs, the communication equipment maker, lost 4.4 per cent to close at $10.25.JPMorgan Securities raised its first quarter profit forecast for Apple, up 0.5 per cent to $85.47. Radioshack jumped 11.6 per cent to $18.76, because the electronics retailer expects stronger than forecast fourth quarter earnings next month.Among deals announced, Houston Exploration will be acquired by Forest Oil in a $1.5bn cash and stock transaction. Houston rallied 4.1 per cent to $50.69. Forest slid 3.5 per cent to $30.13.General Electric agreed to buy Vetco Gray, an oil and gas equipment supplier for about $1.9bn. GE was 0.03 per cent lower at $37.55.St Jude Medical jumped 5.6 per cent to $36.95 after the medical device maker said fourth quarter earnings would beat forecasts.
325;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-08T20:38:25Z;Struggling Gap considers sale;;"Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer and an icon of American casual style, is considering a range of options, including a sale of the company, following more than two years of slumping sales.According to people familiar with the matter, Gap has in the past few weeks given bankers at Goldman Sachs a mandate to examine the company’s strategic alternatives, raising speculation that it could be taken private in a leveraged buy-out worth more than $16bn.However, the outcome of Goldman’s review could also involve the spin-off of one or more of Gap’s brands, including Old Navy, the struggling discount chain, and Banana Republic, the more successful chain aimed at young professionals.Gap and Goldman declined to comment. The retailer’s move to hire Goldman came in the wake of another set of disappointing monthly sales figures for the vital holiday month of December, with total sales of $2.34bn (£1.2bn), down 10 per cent from levels two years ago.A sale of Gap would mark an important moment in the history of US retailing. The brand, which was founded in San Francisco in 1969 by Don and Doris Fisher, whose son, Robert, is chairman of its board, expanded dramatically in the 1990s.However, it subsequently lost ground to an increasing range of competitors targeting segments of its old customer base.Efforts to turn Gap around under Paul Pressler, chief executive since 2002, failed to stop the poor performance.The company’s market capitalisation, which stood at $16.4bn last night, is less than half what it was when it reached a peak in 2000. On Monday Gap shares rose 7.3 per cent to $20.26 after CNBC reported news of Goldman’s mandate.Banking sources in New York on Monday said a number of cash-rich private equity firms would be the most likely buyers of Gap. In the past few years buy-out groups have invested in a wide cross-section of US retailers, including Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store chain, and J Crew, the clothing store chain that was acquired and taken public by Texas Pacific Group.Securing the backing of the Fisher family, which controls about 37 per cent of Gap’s outstanding shares, would be key for any buyer.An auction for the company would cast a spotlight on the directors, who include Domenico de Sole, former chief executive of Gucci, the luxury goods group; Adrian Bellamy, chairman of Reckitt Benckiser, the UK consumer healthcare group; and Mayo Shattuck, chief executive of Constellation Energy.The poor holiday results at Gap came in spite of the company’s largest marketing push and an advertising campaign featuring celebrities including Helen Mirren, the actress, and Seal, the singer."
326;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-04T21:26:48Z;Gap admits two-year revamp failure;;Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, admitted that its two-year effort to revitalise its Gap and Old Navy stores in the US has failed, saying it would again review brand strategies at the two divisions.The retailer on Thursday announced a set of disappointing monthly sales figures for the vital holiday month of December, with total sales of $2.34bn, down 10 per cent from levels two years ago.Paul Pressler, chief executive, said: “Given that we did not gain the traction we had expected, the management team, with the active involvement of our board of directors, is currently reviewing Gap and Old Navy’s brand strategies.”His remarks mark another phase in the effort to revitalise the US Gap and Old Navy stores, which account for about three quarters of the retailer’s annual sales of about $16bn.In spite of a heavy autumn marketing push, comparable store sales at Gap North America’s more than 1,300 stores fell 9 per cent on top of a 10 per cent drop last December.Old Navy, the lower-priced unit, saw comparable sales at its more than 1,000 stores fall 10 per cent, also against a 10 per cent drop last year.The company cut its full-year earnings per share guidance to 83-87 cents, against the $1.23-$1.27 previously forecast.It also forecast free cash flow of about $650m for the year, down from an original forecast of about $900m.Carol Levenson, of independent bond analysts Gimme Credit, described the sales figures as “grim” and said she expected the brand review “to lead to restructuring charges and expenses”.Other US retailers reported mixed December sales.Wal-Mart said it had seen a “very strong performance” in electronics, where it launched an aggressive series of price-cuts at the start of November.But it said apparel and home sales had been “soft”, as expected.Target, Wal-Mart’s leading competitor, reported sales growth of 4.5 per cent, in the middle of its own forecast range but below Wall Street’s average estimate.Saks and Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department stores, saw sales jump 11.1 and 9 per cent respectively, both roundly beating Wall Street forecasts.Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said unseasonably warm weather had slowed winter clothing sales.JC Penney said same-store sales increased 2.6 per cent in December, beating analysts’ expectations of 2.4 per cent and last year’s figure of 2.2 per cent.
327;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-04T20:27:49Z;US retailers;;Don’t shop until the prices drop. That seems to have been the mantra of US consumers this holiday season. Before Christmas, it was already evident that it would take hefty discounts to lure in shoppers – and that the tempting bargains might do less than usual to boost sales for items not marked down. Add mounting operating cost pressures and the risks to margins, if not revenues, were clear.Things seem to have turned out even worse on Main Street. With very few exceptions, mostly in the luxury segment, retailers reported December sales that ranged from mediocre to miserable, leaving average same-store sales at about 2.5 per cent year-on-year. Shoppers delayed their purchases until very late and felt more inclined to head to down-market stores such as Wal-Mart. As a result, it appears that deep price cuts were insufficient to generate enough extra volume for a sales boost – suggesting an even bigger dent in profits.Of course, all this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. On the one hand, retailers arguably benefited from an extra shopping weekend before Christmas. On the other, the warm weather hurt winter apparel sales. That added to the pain of chronic under-performers such as Gap but hurt others as well. By contrast, Wal-Mart may simply be regaining its footing after many missteps.Shopkeepers – eternal optimists by nature – are also keen to blame the increasing popularity of gift vouchers, which extend the selling season ever further into January. The shift to online sales is not yet included. But as even the Federal Reserve conceded in its latest minutes, downside risks to both household spending and the economy as a whole appear on the rise. Put plainly, consumers had little reason to feel cheerful this Christmas. Given their chronically low savings to begin with, a bit of stinginess in the face of housing woes, still-subdued median wages and high energy costs should not have come as surprise.
328;GPS;Gap Inc;2007-01-04T14:45:02Z;Warm Christmas hits US retailers;;Christmas resulted in disappointing sales for many clothing retailers in the US who blamed unseasonably warm weather and price cuts for lower than expected sales growth.Last month was the warmest December for 10 years, according to forecasters, and led to higher demand for out-of season clothing rather than winter items.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, confirmed that total sales in December had risen 1.6 per cent against its own estimates of 1 per cent sales growth. Sales at its US store network rose 1.3 per cent.Wal-Mart said that it had seen a “very strong performance” in electronics, where it launched an aggressive series of price-cuts at the start of November. But it said that apparel and home sales had been “soft” as expected, although price cuts in apparel had helped to boost sales. Target, Wal-Mart’s leading competitor, reported sales growth of 4.5 per cent, in the middle of its own forecast range, but below Wall Street’s average estimate.Retailers’ holiday sales are vital because the two months before Christmas can make up for 20 to 40 per cent of annual sales.Costco, the warehouse club that compete’s with Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, delivered a 9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales, beating analyst’s forecasts of 5.7 per cent growth. Sam’s Club sales rose 5.6 per cent. But BJs, the third largest warehouse club, saw its shares drop 14 per cent after it reported sales growth of just 0.6 per cent, and cut its profit forecast.Gap said same-store sales fell 8 per cent, a worse figure than expected, despite swingeing price cuts designed to bring shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores. Out of all of its brands and regions only Banana Republic in the US and Canada reported sales growth, with an increase of 2 per cent on last year. In North America Gap and Old Navy saw sales fall 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, and internationally sales fell by 8 per cent.The struggling retailer also cut its outlook and said it was reviewing its brand strategies for Gap and Old Navy.Department stores delivered a mixed picture. Saks and Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department stores, saw sales jump 11.1 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, both roundly beating Wall Street forecasts.But Federated Department Stores owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said sales at its stores, excluding the May stores acquired in 2005, rose by 4.4 per cent, below its own forecast. The company said sales at more than 300 former May Department Store locations, which have been converted to the Macy’s banner since their acquisition in 2005, “remained weak”, without giving details.JC Penney said same store sales increased 2.6 per cent in December, beating analysts’ expecations of 2.4 per cent and last year’s figure of 2.2 per cent. Children’s clothing and jewellry proved popular with shoppers. Its rival Kohl’s saw sales rise 3.4 per cent, below forecasts.AnnTaylor, another major apparel seller, said it had suffered a 5.3 per cent drop in same-store sales and said its full-year earnings will come in lower than its original guidance of $2.07 to $2.12 a share.Pier 1, the home-furnishings retailer, saw a 10.7 per cent drop in same-store sales, even worse than the 9.4 per cent fall Wall Street had anticipated.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, saw a 4 per cent gain, well below the 9.3 per cent Wall Street expected.Zale said sales increased by 2.3 per cent for the combined months of November and December. It said profit margins were lower than expected because of price cutting.American Eagle Outfitters, the teen apparel retailer, said on Wednesday that same store sales grew 13 per cent for the month, beating Wall Street’s expectations for 8.7 per cent growth.
329;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-12-26T21:49:58Z;US stocks rally in thin holiday trade;;US stocks rallied on Tuesday, as lower oil prices helped offset weakness in retailers amid reports that holiday sales had fallen short of expectations.The majority of gains arrived during the last hour of trading, with volumes at the New York Stock Exchange the lowest seen this year, as stocks enjoyed a rebound after last week’s broad losses.Analysts expect window dressing in stocks could dictate moves this week, as investors purchase those that have experienced solid gains this year in order to embellish their portfolios. This is seen outweighing sales of poor performing stocks, made by investors to lock in a tax loss for their 2006 tax returns.The S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent, or 61.4 points to 1,416.90, on Tuesday. All 10 major groups in the index settled higher, led by the Materials and Financials sectors, while the energy sector reversed weakness seen earlier during the day as oil prices slid.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent, or 12.33 points to 2413.51. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 0.8 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent, or 64.41 points higher to 12,407.63. Boosting blue chips were, Walt Disney, up 1.1 per cent at $34.53, Dupont, up 1.2 per cent at $49.15 and Citigroup, higher by 1 per cent at $55.12.Despite the reversal in oil prices, shares in Exxon Mobil gained 0.9 per cent to $76.05, as investors cheered news the company had won a contract with Libya’s state-run National Oil Corp.Shares in Ford rose 0.9 per cent to $7.49, off a high of $7.57, as news that company officials met with Toyota last week surfaced.Small capitalised stocks fared well, with the Russell 2000 index rising nearly 1 per cent per cent to close at 788.25, and its gain of 17.07 per cent for the year beats the Dow’s rise of 15.77 per cent.The retail sector opened under pressure on Tuesday, and despite paring some losses, closed lower on the day.According to SpendingPulse, which analyses the performance of retailers based on MasterCard data, US holiday sales grew by 3 per cent from the day after Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve this year, compared with 5.2 per cent growth in 2005. The figures were adjusted for the fact that the holiday shopping season was one day longer than last year. Without the adjustment, sales grew 6.6 per cent in 2006, compared with growth of 8.7 per cent in 2005.The S&P 500 retail index was 0.2 per cent lower at 496.89, after hitting a low of 493.86 for the day in early trade.The S&P Department stores index closed 1.2 per cent lower at 262.81.Shares in JC Penney fell 2.3 per cent at $77.74, Kohls was down 01.3 per cent at $68.89 and Federated Department stores slid 0.9 per cent to $37.76.

Wal-Mart rose 1.2 per cent to $46.11In the internet shopping space, shares in Amazon were 1.1 per cent lower at $39.80, despite experiencing its best holiday sales season in history according to company officials. Meanwhile, eBay’ shares rose 0.3 per cent to $30.32, down from an earlier rise to $30.63.Staying with technology, shares in Microsoft had rebounded from earlier weakness and rallied 1.2 per cent to $29.99. The stock price was buffeted by reports that its latest computer operating system, Windows Vista, has potentially serious security flaws.Shares in Savvis gained 2 per cent to $35.92, after the information technology company sold a business unit to Level 3 Communications for $135m. Shares in Level 3 were down 1.2 per cent at $5.59.Shares in Telik plunged 70.7 per cent to $4.77, after thedrug developer said its Telcyta drug did not show asignificant improvement in survival rates for lung cancer patients.In deal news, CPAC said it had agreed to a $42.8m private buy-out. Shares in the maker of consumer and industrial products rose 7.6 percent, to $8.45.Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission announced they had approved Freeport McMoRan’s plan to buy Phelps Dodge in a $25.9bn deal and create the world’s largest copper miner. Shares in Freeport rose 1.3 per cent to $54.54, and Phelps closed 1.5 per cent firmer at $118.63, down from a peak of $123 for the day.
330;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US retail;;Don’t panic – blame the weather. That, at least, seems to be the view among retailers. Atmospheric disturbances are frequently invoked when trying to explain lacklustre sales patterns – and rarely more so than this season.Apparel chains finger unusually high November temperatures for slumps in sweater and coat sales. Wal-Mart is still suffering from Hurricane Katrina, which drove up sales in the south-east last year as people restocked. Add last month’s record downpours in parts of the Pacific north-west and the average 2.6 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales starts to look almost respectable. The weather gods have certainly been up to some mischief.But it is worth noting that their biggest victims were all the usual suspects in terms of chronic weakness. Wal-Mart, for example, now expects same-store sales to be up, at best, 1 miserly per cent in December. That follows the slight decline in November despite aggressive pricing.Gap, where comparable sales declined 8 per cent, is starting to look like a case-study of how not to re-invent a brand. By contrast, many department stores continued to gain market share, suggesting that middle class consumers might not be tightening their purse strings just yet.The bigger issue is that many shoppers appear concerned about their own economic prospects. That makes bargains all the more tempting. At the start of the holiday season, there was anecdotal evidence of shoppers storming the stores to buy big-ticket items at knock-down prices – and then heading for the exit. Add operating cost pressures in much of the sector and the weather might turn out to have been one of the smaller threats retailers faced. Instead, they could end up with lower margins in December – and even slower sales than usual in January.
331;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wal-Mart suffers for its fashion mistakes;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday issued a sombre forecast for sales in December, blaming mis-steps in its efforts to introduce more fashionable and expensive clothing and home furnishings into its low-cost discount stores.The retailer said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow by no more than 1 per cent, after comparable sales fell by 0.1 per cent in November – the first drop since 1996.The company cited continued problems with its home and clothing categories, where its core customers have not responded well to its drive to introduce goods such as the Metro 7 women’s clothing range across its entire store network.Eduardo Castro-Wright, chief executive of Wal-Mart’s US stores division, said: “The home and apparel business is challenging and this will continue throughout the fourth quarter.” He noted that basic items in both categories continued to sell well.The company said it did not expect to see improvements in both categories until spring.The drive to persuade more prosperous customers to buy more than food and basics at the stores has been the focus of an overhaul of the retailer’s marketing strategy over the past year – sometimes at the expense of its traditional low-price message.Mr Castro-Wright said the retailer’s pre-Christmas marketing would focus on “communicating price leadership” and that it would deliver further price cuts in the run-up to the holidays.Wal-Mart’s poor performance in November contrasted with Target, its more upmarket rival, which reported a 5.9 per cent increase in comparable store sales, and predicted growth of 3.5-5.5 per cent for December.Overall, leading US retailers reported a subdued November. Retail Metrics said its monthly index of same store sales growth rose 2.2 per cent, and that more than half the retailers reporting missed their forecast numbers.Several clothing retailers cited the impact of unseasonably warm November weather on sales of winter clothing, and this was also cited as a negative factor by Ann Taylor, the women’s clothing retailer, and Kohls, the low cost department store.The big three traditional department store chains, however, again delivered above-average performances. Federated said November same-store sales rose 8.5 per cent at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores, and raised its estimate for December sales. Saks and Nordstrom saw sales growth of 7.2 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, saw its sales woes continue at its Gap and Old Navy stores. The group’s overall same store sales were down 8 per cent, and total net sales slipped 2 per cent to $1.4bn.

Shares in the retailer closed down 1.2 per cent at $48.29.Gap also missed sales and Citigroup downgraded the clothing chain to a “hold” from a “buy”. Its shares fell 5.5 per cent to $19.50.Wholesale retailer Costco and other retailers, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’smissed analyst expectations.Costco rebounded and setteld up 0.2 per cent at $53. Target was off 1.3 per cent at $56.96, Dillard’s was down 1.7 per cent at $29.29 and Kohl’s was 0.75 per cent lower at $70.54.In contrast, Nordstrom and JC Penney enjoyed a solid October, with their shares up 1 and 2.4 per cent at $46.76 and $76.93 respectively. Federated beat sales but fell 3.9 per cent to $41.35 on a weaker sales outlook. Saks also enjoyed good sales and rose 1.5 per cent to $19.48“It’s striking that the discounters are seeing disappointing sales, while high-end retailers are holding up,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.Beyond monthly sales figures, he believes the real test for the consumer will come when a spillover from the slowing housing market into job creation occurs. “The consumer will follow the economy into a slowdown, not lead it.”The next test for stocks will be the October employment report on Friday.The S&P 500 settled 0.47 points, or 0.03 per cent, lower at 1,367.34, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.33 points, or 0.01 per cent, lower at 2,334.02.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 12.48 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,018.54, having earlier slipped below 12,000.To date, 385 of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings, with 74 per cent above estimates, according to Thomson Financial.Earnings for the third quarter are running 18.6 per cent higher versus a year ago, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Shares in Intel were off their lows, down 1.6 per cent at $20.68, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the chipmaker from “buy” to “neutral” amid weakening demand and persistent excess capacity. By contrast, Dell shares were up 3.3 per cent at $24.80 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the group from “sell” to “neutral” citing disciplined pricing and attention to sales mix.In earnings news, International Paper missed estimates as it reported 39 cents a share versus a forecast 43 cents. Its shares were down 1.6 per cent at $32.50.
333;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Strong month for US mid-range stores;;JC Penney and Federated Department Stores on Thursday highlighted the renewed strength in the middle ground of the US retail sector with strong September sales figures, contrasting with the sluggish performance of Wal-Mart, their supposed nemesis.JC Penney reported that sales at stores open at least a year increased by 8.7 per cent in September, and raised its earnings guidance for the quarter.Federated, the owner of Macy’s, reported a 6.2 per cent increase in comparable sales, following a 16.3 per cent increase announced earlier in the week by Kohl’s.Wal-Mart, in contrast, said sales at its Supercenters and discount stores increased just 1.3 per cent, and expressed disappointment with its clothing sales – despite cool autumn weather that boosted clothing sales at competitors.Lower fuel prices also contributed to a strong month for retailers overall, with Retail Metrics’ index of same-store sales up 3.8 per cent, or 6 per cent excluding Wal-Mart.Donald Soares, a retail consultant at CapGemini, said: “Contrary to the doom and gloom scenario that has been painted over the last couple of months, consumer confidence has rebounded and that is what is driving sales.”While the monthly sales figures can be volatile, the latest numbers reflect a steady shift in the landscape for the mid-range and lower- cost department stores.The segment was once widely seen as trapped between the discounters and high-end stores.Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo, an investment bank specialising in retail, said “the middle tier is fighting back and fighting back effectively …they all realise the exciting thing about retail is that you have to change”.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, argued in research last month that the “retail hourglass” that existed in 2000 – with growth at the high end and low end but not in the middle – had “played itself out by the end of 2005” and that “a new chapter is now beginning”.She cited a series of factors, including the consolidation among companies “stuck in the middle” that led to last year’s takeover of May Department Stores and the sell-off of Saks’s department stores.In another apparent sign of confidence in the department store sector, Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, recently moved significantly to increase his holdings in Federated shares.Not everyone prospered in September. Dillard’s, the regional department store chain, saw its shares fall more than 10 per cent on Thursday, after it announced flat September sales.Gap also reported a 3 per cent drop in same-store sales, despite a huge US marketing campaign aimed at reversing two years of falling comparable sales.

Ford has risen 50 per cent in the past eight weeks.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent, or 4.96 points, at 1,318.07, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent, or 11.85 points, higher at 2,227.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent, or 45.23 points, at 11,543.32.Consumer staples fell out of favour with investors. Procter & Gamble shed 2.1 per cent to $60.56 and Colgate-Palmolive dipped 1.7 per cent to $61.26.“Some of the defensive plays are not the darlings they have been,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.New York Times pushed up 3.9 per cent to $23.15 after it announced that it would sell its broadcast media unit, which includes nine television stations.Pall, maker of filtration systems used in the medical and aerospace industries, surged 11.8 per cent to $30.18 after it beat analysts’ estimates with a 45 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit.
335;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-07-14T19:16:26Z;Gap to launch eight-week TV ad blitz;;Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, will on Monday launch an eight-week US television advertising campaign for its more than 3,000 Gap brand stores, as part of a comprehensive drive to turn around almost two years of falling sales.The TV ads are tied to the launch of the brand’s autumn clothing, and mark what some industry analysts see as a make-or-break moment for Paul Pressler, chief executive since 2002.Cynthia Harriss, president of the Gap brand, has been working over the past year to re-establish its reputation for selling stylish casual basics, after unsuccessful forays into dressier clothing, epitomised by its use of Sarah Jessica Parker, star of the Sex and the City TV series, in its marketing two years ago.“We’ve been re-establishing the essence of our brand and developing a clear point of view about what we stand for,” Ms Harriss told investors last month.Gap is now returning to TV ads after a year’s break, with a range of artists that Ms Harriss describes as “individual style makers”, including Jeremy Piven, the actor, and Natasha Bedingfield, the singer.Since taking over as Gap president in May last year, Ms Harriss has led a overhaul of its head office and store operations, appointing a new designer, Charlotte Neuville, and recently bringing in a veteran fashion brand merchandiser from Liz Claiborne to head its adult segment.Ms Harriss, who previously worked with Mr Pressler at Disney’s theme parks division, has also reorganised the company’s design and merchandising teams to focus on what the company sees at its four main product categories – denim, T-shirts, trousers and skirts and active-wear.The current launch – which sees changes in everything from the design of labels to a new carrier bag – is backed by stores being reorganised into four “store within a store” segments for T-shirts, active-wear, denim and more formal clothes.It has also largely phased out some of its traditional lines, such as men’s khaki pants in various fits.Gap argues that the new focus on categories, rather than cross-category collections, will allow it to deliver more rapidly changing selections of clothes – a step towards the fast-fashion model pioneered by retailers such as H&M and Zara.“Before, we were rooted more in collections, and it was more difficult to have that product constantly flowing into the store,” Ms Harriss says.Gap’s North American division, which accounted for more than $5.1bn of the company’s $16bn revenue last year, has seen flat or falling same store sales for the past seven quarters.The retailer has been squeezed in its 18-34 market between more fashionable competitors, such as Abercrombie & Fitch, and cheaper mass market competitors, such as Target, the discount store.“They’ve really become commoditised,” says Wendy Liebmann, of WSL Strategic Retail. “If I want basic, I’ll go to Target . . . if I want something special, I’ll go to Abercrombie.”Over the summer, Gap sought to build the groundwork for its current campaign with events in its major markets aimed at generating “buzz”. These included sponsoring concerts, and driving a Gap bus around California and on New York’s Long Island.It has also adopted more creative window displays, with monthly changes aimed at reinforcing the overall marketing push.Gap’s autumn line has received guarded reviews on Wall Street, which is also looking for signs of improvement at Old Navy, its lower cost brand, and at Banana Republic.Todd Slater, a retail analyst at Lazard Capital Markets with a “buy” recommendation on Gap, wrote this week after a meeting with management that he believed “all three brands showed varying degrees of heightened competitiveness”. However, he was not overly impressed by the autumn lines, saying he did not believe the range was “compelling enough to move the needle meaningfully . . . over the next couple of months”.Mr Pressler – who last year predicted an improvement in performance this spring that failed to materialise – has said the company expects its sales figures to turn “modestly positive” in the second half of 2006.“We need to get the momentum with our customers . . . It’s not going to be one thing, because we’ve really got a big job to do in winning our customers back,” says Ms Harriss.
336;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-07-11T22:47:03Z;President of Gap’s Old Navy to step down;;Jenny Ming, president of Gap’s Old Navy division, is to step down in the autumn, the latest in a series of senior management changes as the speciality clothing retailer seeks to reverse falling sales across its three main divisions.Ms Ming, who has been with the company for almost 20 years, played a leading role in the launch of the lower cost Old Navy brand in 1994, becoming the division’s president five years later.Old Navy’s more than 950 stores accounted for around two fifths of Gap’s total sales last year of $16.8bn, slightly more than the 1600 Gap brand stores.But over the past two years, Old Navy has been unable to reverse declining sales, struggling to distinguish its range of casual fashion from discount competitors such as Wal-Mart and Target.A push this year to deliver better quality and more on-trend clothing has so far failed to produce improved sales. In June, sales at Old Navy stores open at least a year fell 6 per cent against a year ago, marking the the twentieth consecutive month of declining or flat comparable sales.Ms Ming said in a statement that she believed her departure was right “for me personally, and for the brand”, and that she would seek to smooth the transition to her successor.Her departure was announced as Old Navy is pushing ahead with the launch of an autumn clothing range that is seeking to distinguish itself from the discount competitors with higher quality items, including leather jackets and “special edition” embellished denim that are above its traditional price points.News of Ms Ming’s leaving follows a series of new appointments at the company’s US Gap division, including the appointment last month of Denise Johnston, formerly a senior executive at Liz Claiborne, as head of its Gap Adult operations. Gap also appointed Charlotte Neuville as its new head designer last year.Gap brand is preparing to launch a major integrated marketing campaign next week to support the arrival in the stores of its autumn clothing range, the first to be fully designed under Ms Neuville.

339;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
340;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-05-18T20:39:02Z;Gap profits down as sales slump continues;;Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said it would return to television advertising for its Gap brand stores in coming weeks, as it seeks to deliver a promised turnaround in its overall store sales this autumn.Cynthia Harriss, president of the Gap brand, said the retailer would launch an eight week television advertising campaign in July, two weeks longer than last year, to promote its autumn fashions. It would also continue to invest in what she called “fun, buzz-generating” events in its major markets.Ms Harriss said the retailer would also upgrade its top 200 stores in leading markets over the summer, and would continue to use regular monthly changes in its store window displays to attract customers.The Gap brand, once known for its high-profile television advertising with stars such as Madonna and Sarah Jessica Parker, opted not to use television advertising in the run up to Christmas last year, saying that television had not delivered significant returns on its ad spend.The marketing and store improvement campaign is part of a drive by the retailer to reverse falling sales at all three of its major brands, which contributed to the retailer yesterday reporting a 17 per cent fall in profits during the first quarter, to $242m, or 28 cents per diluted share.Overall sales decreased 5 per cent to $3.44bn, while sales at stores open at least a year fell 9 per cent, compared with a decrease of 4 per cent in the same period last year.Paul Pressler, chief executive, told analysts and investors that the results were generally in line with the retailer’s expectations, and that Gap was still confident that it would see improved sales in the autumn.“We still expect the second quarter will be rough,” he said, adding that the retailer would continue to spend on staffing and marketing in the second quarter.“We look forward to see our improvements in our products and store experience reflected in our results.”Mr Pressler also pointed to the slightly better customer traffic at Banana Republic, the company’s more upmarket brand, which he said was “begining to regain its momentum”.“We still expect that old Navy and Gap will begin seeing improved customer response this fall.”Gap said it “continues to believe that the first half of the year will be challenging”, and again said that it expects its comparable store sales - sales at stores open at least a year - to remain negative in the second quarter.During the first quarter, same store sales at its Gap brand stores fell by 8 per cent, while same store sales at both Old Navy stores and its international division were down 11 per cent. Banana Republic stores in the US recorded a 5 per cent drop in comparable store sales.For the first quarter, the retailer recorded free cash of $225m, against $113m last year. The company reiterated that it expects to generate at least $900m in free cash flow in fiscal 2006.The company reiterated its guidance for fiscal year 2006 earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27.
341;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-05-12T17:30:13Z;Best Buy buys stake in Chinese group;;Best Buy, the US consumer electronics group, on Friday announced its first foreign acquisition outside North America when it said it would pay $180m for a majority stake in Chinese retailer Five Star Appliance.The deal gives Best Buy a foothold in the Chinese consumer electronics market, which is growing at a rapid rate but becoming dominated by a handful of local chains with aggressive expansion plans.Best Buy already has plans to open its own store in a popular shopping area of Shanghai, but the acquisition of Five Star, which has 136 stores and is the fourth-largest chain in the country, gives the US group a chance of competing with the local chains.The Chinese consumer electronics market has been growing at about 15 per cent a year, fuelled by the rapid expansion of the country’s middle class, and sales reached about $55bn last year. By 2010, sales are expected to reach $100bn, Best Buy said.The biggest local chain is Gome, which has about 450 stores and plans to add about 200 this year.During the recent May week holiday, alone, Suning, the second-largest chain, opened 21 new stores in one of the most dramatic examples of the way the biggest companies are trying to establish dominant positions. Suning plans to have 300 stores by the end of the year.In the past year, consumer electronics chains in China have begun to turn their attention to second and third-tier cities, many of which they believe now have enough consumers with the purchasing power to buy their products.Best Buy said the deal had been approved by the Chinese authorities and would be completed in June. Founded in 1998 in the eastern city of Nanjing as a wholesale business, Five Star only opened its first store in 2001. The company had revenues of nearly $700m in 2005, an increase of 50 per cent on the year before. Founder Wang Jianguo will remain chairman of the board and the Five Star stores will continue to operate under their own brand name.Best Buy said last month it had leased four floors of the Jiangshan building in the Xujiahui shopping district of Shanghai, which would become the company’s showcase store in China for its own brand.The company is one of a number of US retailers seeking a presence in China. Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer after Wal-Mart, has been in talks to acquire a stake in Orient Home, one of China’s largest home improvement retailers.Saks Fifth Avenue, the luxury department store, announced plans last month to open its first store in China in Shanghai in 2008 under a licensing deal. Gap, the leading US clothing retailer, said last year it was examining strategies for expansion in China.The company has this year launched a series of franchising deals in southeast Asia and the Middle East that analysts believe could be a model for introducing its branded stores into China.
342;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-05-04T14:24:43Z;US retailers report strong sales in April;;US chain stores reported their strongest comparable monthly sales growth for two years on Thursday, as good weather and the late Easter holidays offset the impact of higher fuel prices.Retail Metrics, a research firm that tracks monthly sales numbers, said its retail index of sales growth at stores opened at least a year rose 6.6 per cent against April last year, the biggest monthly gain since March 2004. The firm had predicted sales growth of 5.9 per cent.The Easter holiday, which can add several percentage points to retailer’s sales growth, fell in March last year. But the April figures overall still exceeded analysts’ forecasts.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said sales at its discount stores at Supercenters rose 7.3 per cent in April, contributing to an overall rise in comparable sales including its Sam’s Club discount warehouse, of 6.8 per cent, the largest rise since August 2003.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said the company was “pleased with strong seasonal sales for Easter”.“Rising fuel costs were overshadowed by the customers’ response to merchandise in apparel for the entire family and consumables…we have seen customers buying more toys, video games, music and movies, in addition to candy, to fill Easter baskets.”Target, Wal-Mart’s largest rival, reported a 10.4 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, which the company said were in line with its expectations.Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, continued to struggle, reporting a 3 per cent fall in its overall same store sales, including a 2 per cent drop at its Gap brand US stores, and a 6 per cent fall at its Old Navy stores. The retailer also warned that stock clearance during May could depress its margins.For the first quarter, Gap’s total sales have fallen 5 per cent to $3.44bn, with same store sales down 9 per cent, against a 4 per cent fall in the first quarter of last year.JC Penney, the department store, reported a 2.6 per cent increase in same store sales, but raised its first-quarter earnings forecast to 88 cents a share from 80 cents previously.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, noted that teenage clothing retailers in particular had produced what he called “a monster month” in April after a sluggish performance in March. The sector recorded a 16 per cent gain, following last year’s 7.7 per cent increase. American Eagle reported a 19 per cent gain, Abercrombie & Fitch a 17 per cent advance.
343;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-04-10T18:50:09Z;Faded denim fails to put colour back in Gap sales;;The latest marketing slogan in the windows of Gap’s US stores may be unfortunate: “Superfade” could be taken not as a reference to the retailer’s latest washed denim offering, but to its dismal sales.Gap announced last week that total sales at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores had fallen 9.3 per cent in March, to $1.35bn. Sales at stores open at least a year were down 13 per cent – the 17th straight month of declining same-store sales.Sabrina Simmons, Gap’s head of investor relations, described the March numbers as “below our expectations”, and noted that April’s results were likely to be depressed by sales clearance of its Spring collections.At Gap brand and Old Navy stores, spring was supposed to mark the beginning of a recovery, following a comprehensive review of design strategy undertaken last year.With a forecast free cashflow of $900m this year, Gap remains on a firm financial footing.It has also announced that it will spend an additional $500m on share repurchases this year, on top of $3bn spent on share repurchases since 2004.But some analysts argue that the company’s failure to attract shoppers might be a symptom of underlying structural issues that go beyond fashion mis-steps, such as its failure last year to respond to demand for premium denim.“Gap is no longer the innovator – or even the best copier of what is coming into style,” says Harry Bernard, of Colton Bernard, a fashion industry consultant.Some industry observers argue that Gap’s size alone makes it harder to respond to the changes in what customers want.With sales of $16.4bn last year, Gap has more than 150,000 employees and more than 3,000 stores worldwide, making the retailer far larger than the competitors it is losing market share to.American Eagle, for instance, a fast expanding chain that focuses on college-age shoppers who might once have shopped at Gap, has annual sales of $2.3bn. It has more than 850 stores in the US and just 20,600 employees.“Gap’s buyers are not as close to the customers as they were in the 1980s,” says Fred Crawford, a retail specialist at Alix Partners, the turnround group. “They have a lot of layers, a lot of bureaucracy. And as formats mature you need to be nimble and quick to respond.”Paul Pressler, Gap chief executive since 2002, admitted last year that his early efforts to bring Gap’s operations and costs under stricter control might have come at the expense of “creating amazing product and compelling store experiences” – an admission that the company had failed to find the correct balance between its commercial and its creative sides.Neil Stern, at McMillan Doolittle retail consultants, argues that Gap has become a victim of its own success.After expanding in the 1980s and 1990s at the expense of the traditional department stores, it has lost important segments of its originally broad customer base to more narrowly focused rivals such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle and Aeropostale.“Now Gap is the one that appears to be the sitting target that is being attacked by retailers who appear younger, hipper and trendier,” Mr Stern says, adding that the retailer is also struggling to define its core customer. “Who is Gap perfect for? I have difficulty answering that question.”Gap has put off its turnround until autumn, with Mr Pressler saying the company believed it would take one or two quarters for improved product in stores to bring in more customers.So far, the members of the Fisher family, who founded Gap and hold about 37 per cent of its shares, seem prepared to give Mr Pressler more time to achieve the promised turnround.Robert Fisher, chairman, said in his annual letter to shareholders this month that despite its problems, Gap had become a “more disciplined and well-managed company” under Mr Pressler, and that the company had the leadership it needed. But he also stressed that “our long term success depends on growing our top line”.
344;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-04-06T20:51:34Z;Wall Street retreats on oil and Merck;;Wall Street lost ground on Thursday as oil prices and higher bond yields once again weighed on sentiment amid uncertainty about the possibility of further interest rate rises.Nervousness about Friday’s employment report also kept investors on edge. The view that the Federal Reserve might keep raising interest rates in response to signs of robust employment growth was renewed after weekly jobless claims fell more than expected.Long dated bond yields rose, sending rate-sensitive financials, homebuilders and utilities into retreat, while a continued upswing in energy prices further undermined transport and airline stocks.The Dow Jones Utility Average shed 1.4 per cent, although soaring commodity prices boosted gold miners and metal producers.At the end of another rollercoaster session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent at 11,216.50 and 1,309.04 respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1 per cent to 2,361.17.Merck led the Dow lower, dropping 3.2 per cent to $34.84 after the pharmaceutical group was ordered to pay at least $4.5m in compensation to a man who blamed the maker of Vioxx for his heart attack.The decision could potentially open the door for a new wave of litigation that could result in Merck paying billions of dollars in compensation.“Although only 9,650 lawsuits have been filed, we believe the company could face over 100,000 cases,” said analysts at Bank of America in a research note.3M was a bright spot on the blue-chip index, however. Shares in the Scotch tapes and Post-it Notes maker jumped 5.1 per cent to $81.38 after it raised its profit outlook for the first quarter.Apple Computer continued to attract buyers a day after it issued new software that allows users to run Microsoft’s Windows operating system on its Intel-based Macintosh computers.Apple shares climbed 6 per cent to $71.24, adding to the 9.9 per cent gain in the previous session.Elsewhere, retailers were in focus as March sales figures were unveiled. Wal-Mart fell 0.7 per cent to $46.56 and Gap dropped 0.5 per cent to $18.57 after the two delivered March same-store sales that fell short of estimates.There were notable exceptions, however. Shares of Bed, Bath & Beyond soared 7 per cent to $40.98 as the home furnishings retailer turned in higher than expected profits in its fiscal fourth quarter.Martha Stewart Omnimedia surged 13.7 per cent to $19.45 after Federated Department Stores said it has signed up home-decorating guru Martha Stewart to create a line of housewares for its Macy’s stores. Federated shares gained 0.9 per cent to $77.36.American Express fell 1.2 per cent to $52.27 after saying it would restate results for the past two years.
345;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-04-06T13:22:41Z;US March retail sales disappoint;;Leading US retailers reported disappointing March sales on Thursday, with bad weather and high petrol prices adding to the impact of a late Easter holiday.Wal-Mart Stores, the largest US discount retailer, said its US same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose 1.4 per cent, slightly higher than the 1.3 per cent figure it issued over the weekend.Same store sales at its US stores rose 0.8 per cent, and were up 4.5 per cent at its Sam’s Club warehouse clubs. Its main rival, Target, reported a 2.2 per cent increase in same store sales.Costco, the warehouse club, beat market expectations with a 7 per cent increase in same store sales.For April, Wal-Mart said Easter demand would help drive 4 per cent to 6 per cent same-store sales growth, while Target predicted a 9 to 11 per cent increase.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said his index of overall same store growth for the month rose 1.9 per cent, missing the forecast of 2 per cent growth. He noted that 60 per cent of retailers reported figures below forecasts that already took account of the Easter holiday.“There may be a bit of a consumer spending slow down coming in, with high-energy prices, rising interest rates and a softening of the housing market,” he said.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, again produced disappointing results, with a 13 per cent slump in same store sales at its US Gap brand stores, 7 per cent at Banana Republic and 15 per cent at Old Navy.Total overall sales for the five week period also fell, down 9 per cent, to $1.35bn.Sabrina Simmons, head of investor relations, said the performance “reflects the challenges we face to increase the frequency of customer visits to our stores”.Teenage clothing retailers, which have strongly outperformed the rest of the industry over the past two years, showed signs of weakness for a second month, according to Retail Metrics’ figures. Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle, Aeropostale all reported sales numbers below forecasts.
346;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-03-02T15:08:06Z;Gap delivers dismal February sales;;Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, continued its dismal performance in February reporting on Thursday an 11 per cent drop in same store sales.The fall was worse than Wall Street’s consensus expecations of a drop of around 5 per cent.Gap said its total sales fell 6 per cent to $865m and that store traffic was also down. The slump comes despite the launch of new spring lines at Gap and its Old Navy chain that were designed to lead a turnaround in the company’s performance.In North America, comparable-store sales fell 7 per cent at Gap, 11 per cent at Banana Republic and 14 per cent at Old Navy. Customer traffic also dropped at each of the three chains, with a decline of 12 per cent at Gap, 15 per cent at Banana Republic and 11 per cent at Old Navy.The company said Gap International comparable sales fell 14 per cent.Overall, February’s heavy snowfalls and cold weather across the northern US states contributed to sluggish sales growth for the month at many major US chain stores, according to figures released on Thursday.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said 60 per cent of the retailers in its monthly same store sales index fell short of forecasts. The firm said this was a “signficant drop” from January and December, when 74 per cent and 65 per cent of retailers beat estimates.Retail Metrics also noted that teen apparel retailers turned in “surprisingly disappointing results” with just a 2.5 per cent gain, against the 14 per cent seen in January. Teen and youth fashion retailers have been some of the strongest performing sectors in the industry.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, confirmed an overall increase in sales at stores open at least a year of 3.2 per cent, boosted by a 21.2 per cent increase in international sales as a result of its acquisition of a majority stake in Seiyu, the Japanese department store chain.But sales at its Wal-Mart US stores rose only 2.9 per cent, against last year’s increase of 4.2 per cent.Target, its main rival, said its same store sales rose 3.6 per cent, in line with its expectations.Both Wal-Mart and Target issued a cautious forecast for sales in March of 1 to 3 per cent, as a result of the Easter holiday falling this year in April.However, Federated Department Stores, the largest US department store chain, said its sales rose 1 per cent during the month, better than Wall Street analysts had expected. Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said in a statement that sales at both Macy’s and Bloomingdal’s “were encouraging and above our guidance.”
347;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-02-24T21:55:52Z;Oil and poor data rein in Wall Street’s gains;;Wall Street ended a volatile week with a mixed performance on Friday as rising crude prices and continuing concerns about US interest rates reined in gains seen earlier in the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1 per cent at 11,061.85 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 2,287.04. The S&P 500, helped by sharp gains in energy stocks, rose 0.1 per cent to 1,289.43.The session capped a choppy week of trading, which saw the Dow lose 0.5 per cent and both the S&P and the Nasdaq edge up 0.2 per cent.Differing inflation readings and volatile crude prices were responsible for the market’s swings.Shares fell on Tuesday after the Conference Board’s leading indicators rose for the fourth successive month, suggesting robust economic growth. However, stocks moved higher the next trading day after benign core inflation data gave hope that the Federal Reserve was almost done with its cycle of monetary tightening.But stocks fell again on Thursday after a drop in jobless claims raised fears of wage-pushed inflation. And on Friday shares put in a mixed performance amid data showing that a decline in aircraft orders at Boeing helped push new orders for US made durable goods down 10.2 per cent in January, the biggest drop in five-and-a-half years.In spite of diverging economic data, James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said most of the figures that came in this week pointed to a strong economy.The week’s trade, he said, was marked by the conflict over whether strong growth is good or bad for stocks. “Most felt that the Fed should be done tightening but the reality is that the economy is too strong for the Fed to quit,” he added.The two biggest US retailers reported fourth-quarter results early in the week, but it was Friday’s earnings miss by Gap which sealed the fate of the sector. The clothing company reported its first annual fall in profit in four years, forcing it to lower its guidance for the current year as it lost customers to rivals like Abercrombie & Fitch. Gap fell 2.1 per cent to $18.43, while Abercrombie, which reported last week, eased 0.5 per cent to $64.92.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, reported on Tuesday, and although it beat forecasts, the company’s statement on its outlook failed to match expectations. Its shares were down 1.4 per cent on the week to $45.45.Fellow Dow constituent Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $41.63, in spite of revealing a better-than-expected 30 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. Meanwhile, Federated Department Stores failed to impress with its fourth-quarter net-profit increase and fell 1.6 per cent to $70.45.Volatile oil prices caused some uncertainty with energy stocks early in the week but Friday’s explosion at a Saudi Arabian facility and further concerns over Nigerian exports helped crude prices and oil companies higher.Sunoco was on Friday upgraded to “outperform” from “peer perform” by Bear Stearns as the broker expected strengthening refining margins. Its shares were up 2.3 per cent on Friday, but only 1.1 per cent on the week to $77.96.The top weekly gainers in the sector were ConocoPhillips, up 1.3 per cent to $62.73, and Valero Energy gained 3.1 per cent to $56.19.Among other movers, H&R Block, the biggest US tax advisory service, lost 9.1 per cent on the week to $23.01 after saying on Friday it had underestimated its own income tax rate, leaving it owing a further $32m and forcing it to restate its accounts for the second time in six months.Shares of Dana fell to their lowest level in three decades amid mounting concerns about the financial health of the autoparts supplier. Its shares ended the week 64.3 per cent lower at $1.51 after ratings downgrades by Moody’s and S&P sent the group deeper into junk status.It was closely followed by Sherwin-Williams, which slumped 21.6 per cent this week to $41.29 after analysts said the paint maker could face millions of dollars in clean-up costs for homes tainted with lead paint following a jury ruling.News that British utility National Grid was in talks to acquire Keyspan for $7.3bn drove up the shares of the biggest natural gas seller in the US 2.5 per cent this week to $41.41.Following the earnings driven gains of last week for Hewlett-Packard, profit taking hit the stock, dragging its shares 6 per cent lower this week to $32.02.
348;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-02-23T21:54:50Z;Gap says sales woes to continue;;Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, on Thursday warned that revamped spring designs had failed to end its sales slump, and that it expected sales at its stores to continue to fall during the first half of the year.The retailer said its stores had seen a 13 per cent fall in traffic so far in February, and that it expected sales to turn only “modestly positive” in the second half of 2006.The decline in store traffic comes in spite of a push to revitalise the company’s core Gap and Old Navy brands that Gap had expected to produce results in the spring collections currently in its stores.At its US Gap stores, the retailer has sought a return to basic “classic” casual items in a more limited selection of distinctive colours, seeking to win back customers it lost after pursuing a more dressy image.Paul Pressler, chief executive, said Gap still believed that the changes it had made would eventually win back customers.“We believe that by making product improvements each season, our traffic will follow,” he said, adding that Gap believed that customer traffic in its stores responded one or two quarters after improvements in its products.“It will take more time to see our efforts reflected in our results,” he said.He said the company’s analysis suggested it had not lost its traditional customer base, but that its regular customers were visiting less frequently.The retailer said that owing to “the continuing uncertainty over the timing of its turnround,” it was issuing a “modest” forecast of earnings per share of $1.23 to $1.27 for the full year, against analysts’ expectations of about $1.35.During the fourth quarter, Gap’s overall sales fell 2 per cent to $4.9bn, with overall sales unchanged at both its Gap brand and Old Navy stores in the US. Its international division store sales fell $20m to $439m.The retailer reported earnings of $337m, or 39 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with $378m for the same period last year.Mr Pressler said that “none of us is satified with our overall 2005 business results …we pursued new approaches but did not deliver on expectations.”During the year, Gap hired a new designer for the Gap brand, and named new executives to lead its children’s clothing, maternity and Gap Body units.Gap noted that its online sales increased 20 per cent during the fourth quarter, supported by a major redesign of its three brand websites. Gap’s shares fell 4 per cent to $18.25 in after-hours trading.
349;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-02-03T22:46:45Z;Wall Street throws the book at Amazon;;Amazon, the online retailer, became the latest internet company to disappoint investors after poorly-received figures from search engine Google earlier this week.Amazon shares plunged more than 10 per cent to $38.33 yesterday as its fourth-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations. Sales missed the target, earnings were sharply lower as aggressive discounts over the holiday period cut into margins, while its earnings forecast for the full year was lower than hoped.Anthony Noto, analyst at Goldman Sachs, cut his price target on the stock by up to $9 to $34-$38 and said the news “reinforced long-term concerns regarding structural issues with Amazon’s business model that are limiting growth in some categories and resulting in rising costs of growth”.Gateway further added to the technology sector’s woes after it also failed to meet analysts’ earnings expectations. Its shares slumped 13 per cent to $2.42 as Bear Stearns slashed its rating to “underperform”.Overall, the Nasdaq Composite index closed down 0.8 per cent at 2,262.58 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each fell 0.5 per cent to 10,793.62 and 1,264.03, respectively.For the week, the Dow fell 1 per cent, the S&P dropped 1.5 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 1.8 per cent.The pullback capped a difficult week on Wall Street, which had to content with, among other things, mixed earnings results and the prospect of further rises in US interest rates following Tuesday’s Federal Reserve meeting.“This week’s trading, particularly the latter part of the week, has largely been driven by broadening fears of inflation,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Concerns that the Federal Reserve would further raise interest rates in March, and possibly again in May or June, were heightened by yesterday’s non-farm payroll numbers showing a higher-than-expected increase in hourly wages.The data suggested the labour market was tightening, which could lead to higher inflation.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said while higher wage growth could be good for the economy in the long run, in the short term, wage-induced inflation would have adverse effects on US equities since the Fed would be forced to continue its cycle of monetary tightening.“Not only would the cost of borrowing go up for corporate America but an interest rate increase would also make the fixed income market more attractive, drawing money out of stocks,” he said.Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries about decelerating earnings growth after several sector bellwethers delivered mixed results.On the Dow, record quarterly earnings at ExxonMobil drove shares in the oil giant up 0.2 per cent higher for the week at $61.39, while aerospace group Boeing rose 4.2 per cent to $71.17 after it more than doubled its quarterly profit and raised earnings guidance.However, the strong performances were offset by sharp losses in Altria, down 5.2 per cent at $70.87, and Citigroup, down 3.9 per cent at $45.06.On Nasdaq, Google learned the perils of high expectations this week after an earnings increase that fell shy of investors’ hopes sent shares plummeting more than 16 per cent, or over $20bn, in after-hours trading on Tuesday.Although the numbers largely met analysts’ forecasts, investors have become accustomed to the company trumping such predictions. The stock managed to recover part of its losses however ending the week 12 per cent lower at $381.55.Elsewhere, January retail sales gave a lift to coffee chain Starbucks and clothing retailer Gap. The former jumped 6 per cent to $33.88, while the latter gained 7.2 per cent to $18.63 for the week.By contrast, the auto parts sector was under pressure following weaker-than-expected quarterly figures from Goodyear Tire & Rubber. The stock skidded 19.4 per cent to $15.21 over the five sessions, making it the worst performer on the S&P.Industrial group Honeywell was the best performer on the Dow, up 3.8 per cent after Citigroup upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy”..
350;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-02-02T21:59:49Z;US stocks end down in spite of resilient retailers;;Strong January retail sales failed to prevent a sharp fall in US stocks on Thursday.Federal Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, Gap and Wal-Mart all reported higher monthly sales as shoppers were tempted out by warmer weather.Federated Department Stores gained 4 per cent to $69.73 after it lifted earnings guidance, Gap rose 3.2 per cent to $18.55 as it delivered higher sales when the market expected a fall, while the popularity of youth clothing label Abercrombie & Fitch sent its shares 4.1 per cent higher to $69.27. Wal-Mart rose 0.3 per cent to $46.28 after its figures came in ahead of expectations.While the wider market ended sharply lower, the S&P 500 retail index managed a gain of 0.2 per cent.“The warm weather helped to bring people out and the use of gift cards” also boosted sales, said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The retailers posted good numbers, their guidance was good, and that’s why they are bucking the market.”However, he said that concern remained about a consumer spending slowdown should the wealth effect from the strong housing market end.In the wider market, stocks fell sharply as investors worried about an unexpected drop in productivity in the fourth-quarter and the effect on interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.9 per cent at 10,851.98, the broader S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,270.84 and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.2 per cent at 2,281.57.Disappointing earnings from Tyco International, the troubled conglomerate, and cable group Comcast also weighed on sentiment. Those stocks fell 5 per cent to $24.80 and 3.5 per cent to $27.02 respectively.General Motors, off 3.7 per cent to $23.60, was the worst performer on the Dow after a downgrade from UBS, while carparts group Dana lost 8.4 per cent to $4.68 as the Securities and Exchange Commission began a formal inquiry into company’s accounting practices.Dana is the worst performing S&P 500 stock this year, off 35 per cent.United Airlines slumped 10.3 per cent to $35.89 on its first day of trading following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.There were some gainers. Starbucks, the coffee chain, jumped 9.7 per cent to $34.40 after it raised guidance on earnings following a record quarter and confirmed plans to open 1,800 new outlets this year.Ashley Reed Woodruff, at Bear Stearns, raised her price target on the stock by $2 to $39-$40. “Starbucks is off to a strong start in 2006. We expect strong US sales growth and profit improvement internationally to continue to drive the shares going forward,” she said.A sharp jump in quarterly profit boosted washing machine maker Whirlpool. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $86.37.
351;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-01-27T23:08:26Z;Wal-Mart fishes for eco-friendly profile;;"Wal-Mart has committed itself to taking most of the fish it sells in North America from environmentally sound sources, in its latest initiative to improve its much criticised record on environmental and social issues.The world’s largest retailer has pledged that all of its US fresh and frozen fish, excluding farmed fish, will eventually come from fisheries certified as being “sustainable” by the Marine Stewardship Council, meaning that the sea areas they come from are not being over-fished.Wal-Mart, which operates 900 fish counters, joins a small group of US retailers, including Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats, which source salmon, pollock, lobster and hoki fish from MSC-certified fisheries.Lee Scott, chief executive of Wal-Mart, set out ambitious targets for improving Wal-Mart’s environmental performance in October, saying that Wal-Mart’s role as the world’s largest retailer gave it “unique” opportunities to raise industry standards.Since then, the retailer has announced it will only source its shrimp from farms meeting industry standards established by the Global Aquaculture Alliance. Wal-Mart has also established “sustainability networks” that bring its suppliers and its buyers together with concerned non-profit groups, covering products including agricultural products, seafood, and gold and jewellery.Rupert Howes, head of the Marine Stewardship Council, said: “It is hugely significant that Wal-Mart is doing this, and setting a real example to the rest of the industry.”However, only a small number of fisheries have been certified as sustainable. This means it will take between three and five years for Wal-Mart to achieve its goal. The company has also been showing new interest in improving conditions in garment and footwear factories – another area highlighted by Mr Scott.But it is still struggling to persuade many of its critics that it is serious about its conversion to the cause of corporate social responsibility.It has been trying for a year to hire a senior director to coordinate relations with “stakeholder groups”, including activist and community groups, a job which it says will oversee the effort “to create a new model of business engagement that uses market-based changes to create societal value”.But there have been concerns about the authority of the new position, given the scope of the challenge facing the company - similar positions at Gap, Nike, Reebok and BP hold the higher rank of vice-president.However, David Schilling, of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibiity, which has co-ordinated numerous shareholder resolutions critical of Wal-Mart, said critics would watch for genuine changes that went beyond its current propaganda war.“If stakeholder engagement developes at a high level and is integrated into the way business decisions are made, then that will be a good indication that the company is beginning to turn the corner,” he said.Wal-Mart faces considerable challenges if it is to adapt its operations to the range of standards now embraced by some of its rivals. Unlike Nike or Gap, both of which have been active in developing supply chain monitoring, it sells a vast range of merchandise ranging from bananas to diamonds; its supply chain uses more than 7,000 factories worldwide for its own brand products alone, compared to around 700 at Nike."
352;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-01-18T23:03:25Z;Gap launches first Asian franchise deal;;Gap, the US clothing retailer, has announced its first-ever franchise agreement as it seeks new international growth in Asia.The agreement with FJ Benjamin Holdings, a leading Singaporean retailer, will lead to the opening of the first Gap and Banana Republic brand stores in Singapore and Malaysia.Frank Benjamin, chief executive, said in a statement his company intended “to aggressively launch and grow these brands”. A first Gap store is expected to open in Singapore later this year, with a Banana Republic store following in 2007, and the opening of about 30 stores by 2010.Andrew Rolfe, the head of Gap’s international division, said FJ Benjamin had “significant expertise in this market and we’re delighted to enter this collaboration with them”.The retailer operates more than 100 upmarket retail outlets in 10 countries in East Asia and Australia, including fashion franchises for Guess, Valentino and La Senza, as well as a range of watch stores and a sports bar in Singapore licensed by Manchester United, the UK soccer club.Gap currently operates 257 international stores in the UK, France and Japan, but it has been struggling with sluggish sales, mirroring its poor performance in the US. Paul Pressler, chief executive, said last year that Gap expected to open another 50 international stores by 2007, returning to growth after reining in the overly-rapid expansion of its US and international networks in the 1990s.Gap’s international division curently accounts for less than 10 per cent of its annual sales of around $16bn.The franchise agreement is expected to be followed by similar deals elsewhere in southeast Asia and the Middle East, where Gap does not have sufficient management infrastructure to support its own stores. Gap said last year it was also looking at possible strategies for opening stores in China, which could include franchises.The franchising of the Banana Republic brand, Gap’s more upmarket clothing name, follows the opening last year of five Banana Republic stores in Japan, the first outside North America.As part of its commitment to its franchising strategy, Gap is also opening a 10,000 square foot showroom in New York, to enable franchisees to select the range of merchandise they want to sell.
353;GPS;Gap Inc;2006-01-05T18:49:47Z;US retailers post modest sales gains;;US retailers reported solid holiday sales boosted by a late shopping surge and big markdowns. But a profit warning from Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, raised concerns about the impact deep discounting could have on earnings.Wal-Mart expects fourth-quarter profits to come in at the low end of its forecast of 82-86 cents a share. Kohl’s, the mid-priced department store, also lowered estimates.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics research, said the margin impact of the promotional activity app-eared to have hurt some retailers, but the lower earnings guidance was “not as significant as many had feared”.Analysts were watching December sales as consumers delayed shopping until late in the month, with many opting for gift cards. Retailers book the revenue from the cards when they are redeemed, not when they are sold, which usually boosts January sales. Gift cards accounted for an estimated 15-18 per cent of consumer spending this holiday season.There were also fears about Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday, starting late, the lack of hot “must-have” items and whether the transit strike in New York would hurt the city’s big retailers.Overall sales rose 3.4 per cent, said Mr Perkins, better than his 3.1 per cent forecast. Factoring out Wal-Mart, sales were up 4.3 per cent. Sixty-four per cent of the Retail Metrics index beat expectations.Wal-Mart confirmed that December same-store sales – from stores open at least a year – rose 2.2. per cent, its weakest December sales increase in five years. The mediocre gain is a blow to the retailer in the wake of an aggressive holiday marketing campaign launched early in the season after it stumbled in 2004.Sales at Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, rose 3.4 per cent, beating expectations.“We are pleased with Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s performance in December, despite disruptions caused by the . . . strike the week before Christmas,” said Terry Lundgren, Federated’s chief executive.The biggest positive surprise came from Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen speciality retailer, which reported a 29 per cent jump in sales. The gain was impressive as most of its merchandise was sold at full price during a season of markdowns. Aeropostale, another teen retailer, surpassed expectations with a rise of 11.4 per cent against expectations of 4.4 per cent.Sales at Target, Wal-Mart’s discount rival, rose 4.7 per cent, while Nordstrom, a luxury retailer, beat expectations with a gain of 7.7 per cent. At Gap, the floundering apparel retailer, sales tumbled 9 per cent – worse than the forecast 3.8 per cent decline.
354;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-12-01T18:24:00Z;US store sales at low end of forecasts;;US shoppers failed to respond as strongly as expected in November to lower petrol prices, favourable weather and deep discounting, raising doubts for retailers about the remainder of the holiday season.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics research, said the same-store sales figures released on Thursday by big US chains were “a little bit disappointing, given all the positive factors”.Mike Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said results from 65 chain stores showed an average sales increase at stores open at least a year of 3.5 per cent, against the ICSC’s forecast of 3.5 to 4 per cent.“It was a promotional month, and those doing the strongest promotions got the sales. The question is: at what cost for the companies? And how do the sales continue into the post-Thanksgiving period, where there is a traditional lull in sales?”He also said there were concerns about a pattern of spending that seemed to have concentrated spending towards retailers offering aggressively low prices, while other areas, such as upmarket department stores, had seen slower growth than previously.“There’s still a lingering concern about the consumer’s willingness to spend,” he said.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, issued a relatively subdued forecast for its December sales of 2 to 4 per cent, after reporting 4.3 per cent growth in same-store sales in November.The retailer’s same-store sales growth outstripped Target, its main discount rival, for the first time this year. Target said its sales at stores open at least a year increased by 2.6 per cent, in line with reduced forecasts made earlier in the month.Sales at Wal-Mart’s Supercenters and discount stores were up 3.8 per cent, while sales at its Sam’s Club discount warehouses were up 7 per cent. For the year so far, Wal-Mart’s Supercenter and discount same store sales are up 3.4 per cent, against Target’s 5.8 per cent.This year, Wal-Mart launched its holiday marketing campaign on November 1, two weeks earlier than last year, when it reported a disappointing 0.7 per cent rise in US same-store sales.Other retailers issued a mixed set of sales results for November, with traditional department stores producing disappointing figures.Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said same-store sales fell 3.4 per cent, the biggest drop in more than two years. Kohl’s, Nordstrom, Dillard’s and Saks all performed more weakly than expected. Gap reported a 4 per cent drop in same-store sales, which included a 5 per cent drop at its Gap brand US stores.
355;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-11-25T20:31:17Z;US retailers launch holiday sales with big discounts;;US retailers launched their annual post-Thanksgiving sales push on Friday with an unprecedented salvo of aggressive price-cutting and early openings in an attempt to bolster sales in the face of higher energy bills and other economic uncertainties.Some big stores, including Wal-Mart and JC Penney, opened their doors this year at 5am, an hour earlier than usual, at the start of the most important shopping season of the year, or Black Friday – the first day of the year on which retailers historically moved out of the red and into profit.Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, said she believed Friday was “one of the earliest and most promotional Black Fridays”. “Many stores opened earlier than ever before and retailers offered unbelievable sales and discounts to get people shopping.”Paul Cohen, spokesman for Visa USA, said the price cutting seemed more aggressive than last year. “The retailers have gotten savvy. They know that consumers are looking for bargains, and they want them spending in the stores now, rather than hanging back and waiting for prices to fall later.”In Howland Township, in northeast Ohio, scores of shoppers braved bitterly cold temperatures and overnight snow to line up in the dark outside their local Wal-Mart, seeking special early-bird bargains on goods including a 42-inch plasma flat screen TV for under $1,000.A few miles away, the Target store at the Eastwood Mall in Niles was swamped by an early morning rush, with lines more than 30 deep waiting for its 18 cash registers at 7am. Best Buy, the electronics retailer, also drew large early crowds with limited time offers including a Toshiba laptop for $380, while Old Navy, Gap’s low cost brand, drew long lines with a holiday scratch card discount competition, and free breakfast snacks at the door.Some analysts expressed worries that the cold weather in the north and east US might depress the weekend’s performance. Mark Rein, a retail consultant for Capgemini who was monitoring shoppers at the Mall of the America near Minneapolis, reported significantly smaller crowds than in previous years, despite lines at stores offering special holiday bargains.Despite the retailers’ marketing emphasis on the weekend sales, the share of holiday shopping carried out over the weekend is gradually falling, analysts say, as consumers start holiday shopping before Thanksgiving. A strong holiday weekend performance can also lead to a larger than usual sag in sales in early December.Last year, US consumers spent $22.8bn over the Thanksgiving weekend, accounting for just over 5 per cent of the total $414.7bn spent in the entire holiday season during November and December.A strong start to the sales should help allay worries that higher energy costs would undermine consumer spending. The Fed said this week that the economy overall was strong and it raised concern about inflationary risks, but it also noted that consumer spending softened towards the end of the third quarter. Confidence has rebounded sharply since then, with data this week supporting the Fed’s view that sentiment would recover from the lows seen after September’s hurricanes.Underpinning the optimism, Visa USA said its transactions at more than 6m retail outlets rose 9 per cent last week against the year before, and were 5 per cent up on the previous week. Visa USA’s online transactions on the Thursday Thanksgiving holiday also increased 28.3 per cent on the holiday last year, to $203m. “Clearly some folks were sneaking away from their family gatherings,” said Mr Cohen of the online sales. “I think we’ll see a rather good holiday season.”
356;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-11-18T22:11:13Z;Gap hopes bright colours will see off sales blues;;"At Gap’s New York showrooms on Thursday night, as the retailer presented its Gap and Old Navy brands’ Spring 06 collection to the fashion media, the talk was of a stronger focus on “fresh casual American style” and “optimistic” colours.But earlier in the evening, the company’s top executives had painted a far darker picture of the performance of the largest US clothing retailer, announcing third-quarter earnings that were down 20 per cent. Overall sales also fell 3 per cent to $3.9bn. And sales at stores open at least a year were down 7 per cent – the fourth consecutive quarter in which comparable sales have fallen.Worse, the number of customers visiting the company’s Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores in the US and internationally was down 8 per cent in
the first two weeks of November.As a result, Gap lowered its full-year profit forecast to $1.12 to $1.17 – against an initial estimate of $1.41-1.45 at the start of the year – and its shares fell 8 per cent yesterday to $17.The continuing sales problems highlight the challenge faced by Paul Pressler, the former Disney executive who took over as chief executive of Gap from Mickey Drexler in September 2002. Since then, Mr Pressler has been given credit for reorganising the company’s finances and operations after a period of rapid expansion under Mr Drexler.But as he announced the latest set of results, Mr Pressler also issued a mea culpa, suggesting the retailer had forgotten about sales while defending the work done to support long-term growth.“This work was critical, but at times we drove operating efficiencies at the expense of creating amazing product and compelling store experiences,” he said.The poor holiday performance in particular has alarmed investors, since this was the season when the company’s Gap brand collection – which accounts for almost half of its sales – was expected to see the first benefits from a refocused design strategy.Following a review of its dismal 2004 holiday season, the company concluded that the Gap brand’s women’s collection had strayed too far from its core appeal as a purveyor of “iconic” American style.Instead it had become too fashion and “occasion” oriented – a trend highlighted by its 2004-2005 multi-million dollar advertising deal with Sarah Jessica Parker, the star of the Sex and The City television series.The refocused winter collection includes a reduced range of products, a stronger focus on key basics such as scarves, gloves and lambswool sweaters, and the expanded range of “optimistic” bright candy colours that will be continued in the Spring collection. But after the initial signs of trouble in its holiday sales, Gap’s executives are now warning that a turnround will take time, while continuing to express confidence in the current design strategy.“We’ve disappointed our customers for several seasons and we know it will take us time to win them back,” Cynthia Harriss, head of the Gap brand, said.With 25 per cent of Gap’s shares still held by members of the founding Fisher family, Mr Pressler’s own position seems relatively secure.Earlier this week, Donald Fisher, Gap’s chairman emeritus, told Women’s Wear Daily, the US fashion industry daily, that Mr Pressler still had his firm support.But Emme Kozloff, retail analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, argued in a note to clients yesterday that being “iconic” might not be enough to stem the decline. “Right now, Gap is experiencing a similar fate to the mature middle market de-partment stores — declining traffic, market share losses to either niche players or large-scale discounters, and a sea of undifferentiated product.”"
357;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-11-17T22:04:06Z;Gap lowers earnings forecast;;Gap’s troubles continued on Thursday as the largest US clothing retailer warned initial holiday season sales were coming in below its expectations, and sharply dropped its full year earnings forecast.Byron Pollitt, chief financial officer, said traffic at its stores during the first two weeks of November were down 8 per cent on the previous year, and that as a result the company was lowering its earnings guidance by 18 cents to $1.12 to $1.17.Gap had hoped the holiday season would start to show the impact of its efforts to attract customers back to its Gap stores in particular, following a review of its design strategy at the start of the year.The company also reported a 20 per cent fall in third quarter earnings to $212m, or 24 cents per diluted share, down from $265m or 28 cents per share, for the same period last year. The earnings drop was in line with Wall Street’s expectations.Net sales also fell during the quarter to $3.9bn from $4bn, while comparable store sales decreased 7 percent, compared with a decrease of 1 percent in the third quarter of the prior year.Paul Pressler, chief executive, said that the results were “unacceptable,” but argued that “the issues we face today are fixable”.Mr Pressler, who headed Disney’s theme park division before joining Gap in late 2002, also issued something of a mea culpa, saying that the company had lost sight of the importance of delivering attractive products and a positive store experience over the past two years, while it focused on reducing costs and improving efficiencies.The retailer has been fighting growing competition from a large range of smaller speciality retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle and J. Crew.It has been struggling in particular to revitalise its Gap brand, which accounts for almost half of its its sales, after acknowledging earlier this year that its Gap women’s range in particular had lost its appeal as a provider of basic casual style.Cynthia Harriss, who took over as president of the Gap brand in May, said the company was returning to offering a more limited range of products with a greater range of “optimistic” colours.“We have disappointed our customers for several seasons, and we know it will take time to win them back,” she said.Mr Pressler also said that Gap was also moving to speed up its design cycle - which currently takes nine months from design to store - in order to be able to respond more quickly to evolving trends.Shares of Gap fell over 8 per cent to $18.51 in trading after the close of US stock markets.
358;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-10-11T22:24:31Z;Gap opts for new designer;;Gap, the US clothing retailer, said on Tuesday it was appointing a new chief designer to its main Gap brand, as it continues to struggle to reverse falling sales that have dragged down its share price.The company said Charlotte Neuville, previously head of women’s clothing design at New York & Company, a smaller clothing retailer, would replace Pina Ferlisi, with immediate effect.Gap cut its profits forecast for the current fiscal ear in August, saying that its initial efforts to revamp the brand’s women’s clothing line had failed to produce the increases in customer traffic it had expected.At New York & Company, Ms Neuville led the design team’s creative direction for women’s apparel, spending nine years at the company. Previously, she held senior design positions at Cygne Designs, Jones New York Sport, Adrienne Vittadini, and Perry Ellis. In addition, she had her own successful apparel collection.Gap has been struggling to win customers since the end of 2004, with Mr Pressler admitting the group had lost its merchandising edge. It has made revamping its Gap women’s collection one of its top priorities. This autumn it has been selling more denim jeans, and offering customers free music downloads to encourage them to try out its new styles.Paul Pressler, Gap’s chief executive, said previously that he did not expect the drive to refocus the brand’s identity to deliver full results until at least the Spring of 2006.The company’s woes contrast starkly with rival smaller fashion chains focused on younger customers, such as Abercrombie Fitch and American Eagle, which have reported sharply rising sales throughout the year.Cynthia Harriss, the Gap brand’s president, said that the group was “excited” about Ms Neuville’s appointment, highlighting saying that with “more than twenty years of design experience, Charlotte has a strong and proven ability to interpret style and provide leadership in product development”.The company’s shares, which closed yesterday at $16.25 have fallen 25 per cent since August.
359;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-10-11T21:15:24Z;Chicago gives new products first bite at the public;;If you make it on Broadway you can make it anywhere, conventional wisdom dictates. But even potential Broadway productions are going elsewhere these days to test audience reaction along with a growing number of companies testing new products, they go to Chicago.Gap, the clothing retailer, and The World of JLo the first clothing boutique launched by actor and singer Jennifer Lopez are among the most recent businesses to test the waters in the Windy City.Gap has opened four of its new Forth & Towne outlets aimed at women over 35 in malls around Chicago. Their success in the US's second city will determine how Gap rolls out the brand across the rest of the world's largest retail market.For Gap, Chicago offered the right mix of demographics, store locations and customer profiles for the launch of Forth & Towne. New York did not.The World of JLo boutique opened last month in the State Street branch of the department store Marshall Field's. According to a spokesman for Field's, Chicago was deemed the ideal place to launch the concept store, which will sell JLo branded perfume, underwear and sunglasses as well as clothes, because it had“a great cross-section urban, suburban, tourists, residents”.So while New York's Fifth Avenue continues to get more national and international attention, it is Chicago, and its North Michigan Avenue, that are testing the latest retail concepts. It was here that the first American Girl Place shop, which sells high-quality dolls that became a national craze, first opened, five years before the New York store. Costco, the discount retailer, also chose the city to try out a new line of caskets which it later offered to the rest of the US.Sears, the department store that changed the face of American retailing with such innovations as homes sold through its catalogue, started in Chicago, as did Marshall Field's, which is set to be rebranded as Macy's.At present Chicago is testing two new store concepts from Best Buy, the electronics retailer Studio D and Escape, which are being targeted at women and young men respectively. And Motorola's wildly popular Razr V3 mobile phone, credited for breathing new life into the group, was born out of a research laboratory in downtown Chicago.Tom Kuczmarski, who runs a local marketing consultancy specialising in product testing, says Chicago is demographically representative of the rest of America. The latest US Census shows that about 37 per cent of Chicago's population is black, 26 per cent Hispanic and 42 per cent white.In addition, the more traditional values held by Chicagoans bring the city closer to the American mainstream than Los Angeles or New York. “We have similar values to smaller towns and we have a very competitive market like the big cities,” Mr Kuczmarski says. Michael Meyers, who runs a boutique advertising agency in Chicago, says companies that test new products in Chicago find that “if it works here, it'll work from the Appalachian mountains to the Rockies”.Like other observers, he says Chicago's location at the heart of the US Midwest has given its people a pragmatism and openness that people in other US cities do not have.Carmakers from nearby Detroit concur. They view Chicago's motor show as the most important for gauging public response to new models: the Detroit event is attended mainly by car industry insiders.Then there's Broadway. By the time New York theatre-goers revelled in Mel Brooks's The Producers and made it a hit, Chicagoans had already seen it. Similarly, Elton John's Aida and Billy Joel's Movin' Out had test runs in Chicago before graduating to Broadway.Chicagoans like to explain the city's appeal by way of an oft-quoted list of innovations: electricity from an atomic reaction was first produced here, they say, and more US Nobel prize-winners came from here than any other US city.All this puts Chicago's second-city complex in a new light and could explain a certain irritation in the voice of locals such as Bob Killian, a branding consultant, when asked to explain Chicago's success as a national testing ground. He dismisses better-known cities in the US as quaint oddities by proclaiming: “New York is the largest New York, LA is the largest LA, but Chicago is the largest city in America.”
360;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-09-20T21:14:03Z;US retailers maintain online silence;;When Gap upgraded its retail websites recently, the project resulted in lengthy closures of the US clothing retailer’s Gap and Old Navy online stores, and a loss of potential sales estimated at $1m a day.But Gap’s investors should eventually find out whether the investment in new technology is paying off. Unlike most other US retailers, the company publishes online sales figures in its quarterly results and breaks down the figures between its three online sites.Gap’s Kris Marubio says the company started publishing its online sales figures last year when they hit $503m, or 3 per cent of total sales of $16.4bn. The move, she says, reflects the company’s broad commitment to transparency.But in spite of the growing importance of online sales, estimated by Jupiter Research to account for about 4 per cent of all US retail sales this year at $79bn, such candour remains the exception.Mike Niemirah, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, says the lack of reporting on internet sales is becoming a challenge for those trying to track retailers’ performance. He would like to see online sales detailed separately in the retailers’ closely watched monthly same-store sales figures. “It is becoming much more difficult to get your hands around what’s happening. The problem is that it is not dictated by any one accounting body, soeveryone will end up doing their own thing.”The National Retail Federation says a survey of its members found that less than half include online sales in their monthly same-store sales figures, a measure that already includes disparities in the way the numbers are reckoned.Even in their quarterly results, some big US retailers can be frustratingly coy. JC Penney, the department store with annual sales of more than $18bn, recently hailed a 30 per cent increase in its online sales but rolled the figure up with its total store and catalogue sales.Target, a mass discounter, happily told analysts in August that its online sales had more than doubled from a year ago, while failing to mention a figure.Similarly, Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, does not provide any online numbers, on the basis that internet sales account for less than1 per cent of its global business. In contrast, its rival Costco reported online sales of $375m last year, or 0.8 per cent of total sales.“My view is that [retailers] should start breaking out the numbers when the online component becomes a significant component of their overall sales, and has a material impact on their performance,” says Patty Freeman Evans, online retail analyst at Jupiter Research, adding that she would put that point somewhere between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of sales.Recent figures from J.Crew, a clothing retailer with an established catalogue business, show how significant internet sales are becoming in some parts of the sector. According to the prospectus for its public share offering filed last month, internet sales – excluding its catalogue business – totalled $122m last year, or 15 per cent of its overall sales.But other retailers opt to combine internet and catalogue sales numbers, including Limited Brands’ Victoria’s Secret (42 per cent of total sales), Abercrombie Fitch (5 per cent) and Urban Outfitters (12 per cent).Ann Taylor, a women’s clothing retailer, combines internet sales with sales at its factory outlet stores(9 per cent), citing competitive factors and a new website as some of the reasons.Mr Niemirah of the ICSC says a push for more information is likely to face resistance from retailers loath to reveal more than they need to Wall Street’s analysts.Eileen O’Connor, head of investor relations at Ann Taylor, says that, while the company does not have any plans to start publishing its internet sales, she expects the sector to change over time. “With the growth of the internet, it’s going to be a big part of everybody’s business, and I’d expecteveryone to start doing so eventually,” she says.
361;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Gap’s online absence lengthens;;Gap, the US clothing retailer, said on Tuesday it could not give a specific date for the full reopening of its two most popular websites, Gap.com and Oldnavy.com, after relaunch closures that have now lasted almost two weeks.Gap shut down all three of its US online retail sites on August 24, saying it would reopen them “soon”, and promising “innovative new features to bring you an extraordinary shopping experience”.But while Gap’s Banana Republic site reopened after two days, both the Gap and Old Navy sites are still down, although test “preview” versions have been made available a limited basis.“We knew they would come back up in a phased approach,” said Kris Marubio, company spokeswoman. “It’s an ongoing process. I don’t have a specific date for you.”The two sites contributed $209m in sales during the first half of the year – an average of over $1m a day - accounting for just over 3 per cent of the group’s total first half sales. Gap is currently struggling to reverse falling sales at its US stores.Ms Marubio noted that Gap had previously announced the site closures, as part of “a total overhaul of our e-commerce platform and our e-commerce websites”. She said the move had been timed to come at the end of the August “back to school” shopping season, but before the run up to the end-of-year holidays.Eric Peterson, an e-commerce analyst at Jupiter Research, said he was surprised by the site closures, and that when he first heard about the long shut down last week, he assumed it was the work of hackers.“It’s 2005, and websites aren’t assembled by rubbing a couple of sticks together and hoping for fire,” he said. “A number of large sites have made significant changes to their sites overall without experiencing problems like this.”“The notion that any company wouldn’t have a simulated environment where they can switch platforms, switch code, test code and do things like that is mystifying to me.”Gap’s online operations have been headed since 2003 by Toby Link, former chief executive of etoys.com, the online toy retailer that was one of the notable retail casualties of the internet bubble collapse.The relaunched sites will give customers a more advanced browsing system, and more accessible details of currently available sizes and colours.
362;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-08-23T13:33:27Z;Gap launches its fourth brand stores;;"Gap, the US clothing retailer, on Tuesday opened the first of a new chain of stores aimed at women over 35, as the retailer seeks to expand its market to the growing “baby boomer” generation of older shoppers.The Forth & Towne stores join Gap’s existing three brands: Banana Republic, Old Navy and the original Gap stores.The first of the new stores was unveiled on Wednesday in the suburbs of New York, with four more scheduled to open in the Chicago area next week. Gap plans to open another five stores next year, with a possible further 20 stores in 2007.The initiative is the most significant strategic move by the retailer since Paul Pressler, its chief executive, took over three years ago, initially reining in the company after a period of rapid expansion and reorganising its finances.Mr Pressler told analysts at the New York store that the decision to target older shoppers was a “natural step” in the expansion of the retailer’s brands, aimed at a market segment where its existing market share was not significant.“Boomers are a rapidly growing segment of the female population; they earn the highest average income of any group of women, and their clothing purchases account for about 39 per cent of women’s apparel expenditure,” he said.The launch also comes as Gap’s three existing brands are struggling to attract customers. Earlier this month, the retailer lowered its earnings guidance for the remainder of the year, saying that an effort to reinvigorate sales had not produced results as early as expected.Women shoppers aged over 35 are estimated to spend over $45bn annually on clothes, and remain the only segment of the US clothing market where traditional department stores, such as Macy’s and JC Penney, still dominate.Jim Fogarty, a retail turnaround specialist at Alvarez & Marsal, said the new stores were “going right at the heart” of the department stores, by offering a range of four differing sub-branded styles with a unified fit, in a single, easy location. “Conceptually, it’s a very neat idea,” he said.A number of newer retailers have already moved into the market for older women, including the rapidly growing Chico’s FAS. Chico’s, which has sales last year of over $1bn, operates more than 700 small-format stores across the US, having doubled in size since 2000, with more than 100 new stores opening this year.Gymboree, which started as a children’s apparel retailer, launched its Janeville chain aimed at women aged over 35 last year. And earlier this year, JC Penney, the department store, introduced a line of clothing by designer Nicole Miller, also aimed at older women."

Shares in Merck were down 8.2 per cent to $28.06.The trial outcome dragged down Pfizer 2.3 per cent to $25.55 and the S&P pharmaceuticals index fell 1.1 per cent on the day.By the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 10,559.23.The Nasdaq Composite was also flat at 2,136.73, and the S&P 500 climbed 0.1 per cent to 1,219.71.On the week, the Dow fell 0.4 per cent, while the S&P dropped 0.9 per cent. The Nasdaq recorded its second straight week of decline, dropping 1.0 per cent.

365;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-08-18T20:52:04Z;Gap lowers full-year earnings forecast;;The problems facing Gap, the largest US speciality retailer, mounted on Thursday, after the company reported flat quarterly sales and sharply lowered its earnings outlook for the remainder of the year.The retailer dropped its 2005 earnings forecast by 14 cents to $1.30 to $1.34, citing month-to-date sales “significently below expectations”, and “concerns about the macro-economic environment”.Paul Pressler, chief executive, told analysts that the retailer’s August results “are trending significentaly below our expectations, driven primarily by decreases in traffic”.Gap also announced that sales for the quarter just ended were flat against the same period a year ago, at $3.7bn. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell by 3 per cent, with its Gap brand and Old Navy stores in the US down 4 per cent, and the more upmarket Banana Republic down 3 per cent.Gap has been struggling to win customers since the end of 2004, with Mr Pressler admitting that the company had lost its fashion edge. It has been seeking in particular to revitalise sales of women’s clothing at its Gap brand stores, increasing its offerings of better quality denim. It has also been encouraging customers into its fitting rooms by offering free I-Pod music downloads.Mr Pressler said on Thursday that the company “remained confident” about its current strategic initiatives, but had not yet seen the improvements it was hoping for in its autumn sales.“None of us are satisfied with our current performance,” he said. He also again said that Gap doesn’t expect the full impact of a reworking of its design strategy to have an impact on results until spring next year.The company’s woes contrast starkly with rival smaller fashion chains focused on younger customers, such as Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, which have reported sharply rising sales throughout the year.Mr Pressler also highlighted recent moves by Gap to develop personal care products for all three of its brands, and announced that Gap would next week open the first of four new Forth Towne brand stores, aimed at women aged 35 and above. It is also about to open its first Banana Republic brand stores in Japan.Gap reported net earnings of 30 cents per diluted share in the second quarter, against Wall Street’s consensus forecast of 29 cents.
366;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-08-18T20:35:21Z;Wall St continues to worry over oil;;"US stocks were slightly lower on Thursday amid seasonally light volumes as investors continued to fret about the recent strength of oil.The critical action in the oil market took place on Wednesday, when crude futures suffered their biggest one-day fall for months.However, the stock market was not moved, said Phil Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher.The markets gave a similar response on Thursday as equities eased back despite data suggesting that the economy will grow into the autumn.Mr Dow said that, since September 11, 2001, markets had gone from one set of concerns to another.“Right now it is oil, before that it was terrorism, then it was Sars. You name it. The market seems to continue to be in a state of denial because of big headline worries,” he said.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 10,552.46. The S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 1,218.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent to 2,135.99.Two well-known US names announced equity offerings. Google surprised analysts when it said it would issue 14.2m shares of class A stock. The offering will raise about $4bn. Shares were off 1.8 per cent at $279.99.Late on Wednesday, clothing retailer J. Crew said it was about to launch an initial public offering expected to raise $200m. It also appointed Saks executive James Scully as its chief financial officer.The majority of J. Crew is owned by Texas Pacific Group, and has been led
by chief executive Millard Drexler.The other clothing retailer built by Mr Drexler, Gap, released earnings on Thursday. The results followed a mixed batch of retailers’ results earlier in the month. Shares were down 1.6 per cent to $20.15Earnings from teenage clothing retailer Hot Topic missed analysts’ expectations in the second quarter and it significantly cut its third and fourth quarter forecasts. Shares were down 10.6 per cent to $14.14Amusement park operator Six Flags shot up 18 per cent to $6.48 after Daniel M. Snyder, the company’s largest investor, said he wanted to triple his stake.Morgan Stanley slipped 1.2 per cent to $52.23 after the company said it would keep the Discover credit card division, in spite of saying last April that it might be spun off.Data storage maker Network Appliance gained after the company said earnings met its forecast, and the company raised the full-year outlook above Wall Street’s expectations. Shares were up 2.3 per cent to $25.10Other technology companies, Synopsys and Harman International Industries, were also up after announcing profits that beat expectations. Shares in Synopsys were up 8.8 per cent to $18.48, while Harman gained 24.7 per cent to $102.40."
367;GPS;Gap Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Top dogs lead the way as pet couture takes off;;The reception area is finished in dark wood veneer, with floral soft furnishings, a couple of armchairs, a widescreen television and two stainless steel bowls on the side, filled with doggie biscuits.Inside, the “guests” can watch colour TV in a $36-a-night suite, before taking a stroll to a well-ventilated and clean “relief room”.They can enjoy a daily bowl of sugar-free pet soft ice-cream and perhaps be called to the “Bone Booth” to take a call from an anxious owner.“Some of the pet parents are on the phone for 20 minutes, chatting,” says Dom Hooper, the manager.But the Petshotel in Huntingdon, Long Island, is not just an eccentric kennel aimed at a small group of pet owners. With space for more than 100 dogs and 20 cats, it is operated by Petsmart, the largest pet shop and supplies retailer in the US. It has more than 700 stores and reported sales last year of $3.36bn.The Petshotel boarding facility slogan: “All the comforts of home” also forms part of one of the fastest growing retail markets in the US.“Sales of pet products and services have been growing at 6 to 8 per cent a year,” says Bob Vetere, head of the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association.Old Navy, the clothes retailer owned by Gap, now sells pet beds and toys. Wal-Mart, the discounter, opened a pet product section on its website this year.Target, its main rival, sells a range of “pet couture” designed by Isaac Mizrahi, recognition, according to Bob Ulrich, chief executive, of “the increased status of the pet within the family”.Petsmart and Petco, its smaller rival, have been profiting from the phenomenon since they started to expand in the 1990s, bringing chain-store economies of scale to the traditionally small-scale pet business.In Huntingdon, the Petsmart stands in a nondescript shopping plaza, adjacent to a Toys R Us, and a Bed, Bath and Beyond.Aquariums line one wall of the 20,000 sq ft store. Among the aisles of pet food and supplies, the live animals on offer range from a $6.99 House Gekko to a $1,599 white Umbrella parakeet. Cats and dogs are not sold, but are available for adoption from local animal shelters.The 8,000 sq ft Petshotel is at the back of the store, behind a colonial-style facade, with brass handled red doors flanked by lanterns.It offers overnight boarding for up to 115 dogs. It also provides a “Doggie Day Camp” for owners who have to leave their pets during the day. Cats, in the interests of group harmony, lodge in an area with a separate air filtration system.Petsmart has set up 20 Petshotels in its stores so far - part of a strategy aimed at using a range of services to boost all-round performance. It is an approach that has proved popular with other retailers in sectors such as home improvements and consumer electronics.David Lenhardt, a Petsmart senior vice-president, says it is a key difference with rivals such as Wal-Mart and Target or grocery stores like Albertson's. “It really creates a much deeper bond with the customer.”The Huntingdon store also offers grooming services and conducts dog training events including a “potty training course” in a cordoned-off area in the middle of the store. Veterinary services, provided through a partly-owned subsidiary, are also available.Petsmart's revenues from services have grown by an annual rate of 26 per cent over the past six years, and accounted for almost 8 per cent of its revenue last year, at $240m.Behind the growth in the pet sector lies an increase in the number of pet owning households - and an important demographic change.It is no longer just young families with children that keep pets. Now owners include the aging baby-boom “empty nester” - and they have more money to spend.Many of them, says Mr Vetere, are increasingly “humanising” their pets in response to the anxieties of modern life.They want “pet spas, pet hotels, pet grooming and pet therapy. They feel guilty when they go away on vacation, and they're looking for facilities that have room services . . . people who will take their pets for walks”.At Huntingdon, the pet hotel has been booked solid over the summer weekends, says Mr Hooper. And sometimes, he adds, the owners, as well as the pets, need some care and attention. “They can be a little reluctant . . . after all, they are leaving their babies with us.”
368;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-05-05T15:11:41Z;US shoppers shrug off petrol price rises;;US consumers largely brushed off the impact of higher petrol prices last month, according to retailers’ sales figures that underlined the continued strength of spending in the luxury and youth apparel and accessories sectors.“It’s a mixed bag, but overall the retailers came in ahead of expectations. It’s not blow-out, but it’s not bad,” said Gint Rimas, analyst at Thomson FirstCall, who noted that market expectations had been damped by the concerns over petrol prices and by unseasonably cool weather.“The consumer is indeed weathering the economic headwinds from high gas prices, worries over high inflation and interest rates, and even job worries,” said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. ‘The consumer continued to spend.”Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer being sold to private investors for $5.1bn, reported a 12.5 per cent increase in sales at its 37 stores, exceeding analysts expectations of a rise of about 8 per cent. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, also reported a better-than-expected 6.9 per cent increase in sales.But several department stores that cater to the middle of the market, which is more likely to be affected by energy costs, also reported better than expected sales. Federated, which own’s Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, saw its same store sales increase 2.8 per cent, against analysts’ expectations of a 0.9 per cent increase.Neiman, JC Penney and Federated increased their forecast for first quarter earnings, with Federated’s shares rising over 5 per cent in New York to $63.58.In one sign of the possible impact of higer petrol prices, Wal-Mart, the largest US discount retailer, said sales in food had been stronger than general merchandise during the month. Wal-Mart, which reported a 0.9 increase in sales, said a drop in the number of visits to its stores by customers had been offset by an increase in the value of each individual sale.Target, the rival discounter, reported a lower than expected 1.3 per cent increase in same store sales, but said it still expected “very strong profit growth” in the first quarter.A new survey of retail executive attitudes, released on Thursday by the National Retail Federation, also showed growing concern about the impact of higher interest rates and petrol prices. The NRF’s demand outlook index, which reflects business expectations for the coming six months, dropped 8.7 points in April to 52.8.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics consultancy, noted that retailers had not cited higher energy prices as a factor affecting performance during April. “If gas prices remain at these levels then it is likely to start pinching,” he said.Gap, the largest speciality apparel retailer, reported another month of disappointing sales, lowering its forcast for first quarter earnings after a five per cent fall in same store sales. Sales at Gap brand stores in North America were down 9 per cent, while sales at its international stores fell 12 per cent.Sabrina Simmons, head of investor relations, cited significantly lower margins as a result of sales to clear remaining spring merchandise.American Eagle, the youth apparel chain, continued its strong performance with a 20 per cent increase in same store sales, while rival Abercrombie & Fitch saw a 16 per cent increase.
369;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-04-21T20:59:57Z;Gap to consider China expansion;;Paul Pressler, chief executive of Gap, said on Thursday that the US retailer would next year “explore entering China,” and would use franchises as well as company-owned stores in its pursuit of further international expansion.Gap was planning to open another 50 international stores by 2007, he said, on top of its existing network of 250 stores in the UK, France and Japan.Mr Pressler was speaking at the company’s first analysts’ meeting since he took over as chief executive in 2002, amid market concerns over recent sales performance at the company’s 3,000 Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores.He said that he was disappointed with the company’s recent performance, but argued that Gap had continued to deliver value to shareholders, and remained strong enough to weather trouble in the volatile fashion apparel market. “We won’t get it right every season,” he said.After reining in its previously rapid pace of expansion seen prior to Mr Pressler’s arrival, Gap is now focusing on renewed expansion of its Old Navy discount stores.“Of all our brands, Old Navy has the biggest opportunity to grow square footage,” Mr Pressler said. The company said it expects to have a further 200 Old Navy stores open by 2007, on top of its existing 1,300 stores.Gap also announced that its planned new brand aimed at women aged over 35 will be named “Forth & Towne”, and will open in four stores in Chicago and one in New York in the autumn.“The overall feel of the name reflects the classic department store, a little bit elevated and special and at the same time comfortable and familiar,” Mr Pressler said.Gap has also seen a series of changes in its brand management team. This week, it announced the appointment of Cynthia Harriss as president of the Gap brand, a position that had been vacant since September last year.Ms Harris, who ran the Disneyland resort in Southern California before joining Gap, is one of several Disney veterans brought in by Mr Pressler, a former head of the group’s theme parks.
370;GPS;Gap Inc;2005-02-03T18:10:40Z;Retail sales up despite freeze;;US consumers, undeterred by severe snowstorms in the Midwest and Northeast, scoured the winter clearance sales in January, helping retailers report solid monthly sales.Analysts had worried the freezing weather would keep shoppers out of stores. But overall same-store sales - from stores open at least a year - were better than expected, despite a slowdown in the final week.While January is historically a big month for sales of discounted merchandise, some retailers reported good sales of early spring apparel.Shoppers also cashed in holiday gift cards. Retailers record the revenues when the cards are redeemed, not when they are first sold.Ken Perkins, principal at RetailMetrics, an independent research firm, said January sales rose 3.3 per cent better than his forecast of 2.6 per cent. Thomson First Call tallied January sales up 3.5 per cent, ahead of the 3 per cent growth expected by Wall Street analysts.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, said US sales rose 2.5 per cent in line with the company's weekend forecast while Target, its discount rival, saw sales rise 9.4 per cent.Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing retailer, was perhaps the biggest upside surprise, with sales up 17 per cent against a forecast of 1.3 per cent, according to RetailMetrics. JC Penney, the department store chain, was another solid performer with a better-than-expected 3.3 per cent gain.Luxury retailers continued to fare well. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store chain, said sales rose 8.8 per cent, while Neiman Marcus Group, which operates Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores, reported a 12.2 per cent jump in sales.While most retailers came in ahead of expectations, there were some disappointments. The biggest stand-out was Gap, the clothing retailer that also operates Old Navy and Banana Republic stores. Its sales fell 7 per cent.Warehouse clubs, which sell discounted goods to fee-paying members, turned in their weakest same-store sales in months, with BJ's Wholesale, Costco and Sam's Club all missing expectations.
371;GPS;Gap Inc;2004-11-18T21:38:48Z;Wall Street stocks take a breather;;"Wall Street finished an uninspiring session marginally higher on Thursday as technology shares shrugged off a cautious outlook from Applied Materials and the broader market flirted with extending recent gains.By the close the S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent up at 1,183.56. The Nasdaq Composite index inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,104.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent up at 10,572.55, mosrtly thanks to Altria Group.Stocks have enjoyed a prolonged rally and have yet to experience a retrenchment that even bulls admit will be needed before the market can climb further. Optimists say such a retreat would be healthy and see it only as a pause en route to further gains.The present rally has lasted 17 sessions and approaches the four consecutive weeks noted by some traders as the average lifespan of so-called buyer panic rallies, which the current rally resembles. During such advances, trading volumes rise alongside share prices, indicating that investors buy stocks motivated primarily by the fear of missing out on gains.However, Louise Yamada and Ron Daino of the technical research team at Smith Barney have pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed a medium-term sell indication into a buy signal. They add that all other equity market indices are giving similar signals and said their initial target for the Dow is 11,300, about 6.4 per cent from its level on Thursday.Among mostly tepid performances for Dow stocks, Altria Group shares put on 2.2 per cent to $58.70 after an upgrade by Goldman Sachs and Prudential analysts who were sceptical that a government lawsuit against the tobacco industry would succeed. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, the largest of the companies targeted.Elsewhere on the corporate news front, the shares of Applied Materials were 1.8 per cent higher at $17.65 after the chipmaker announced its best financial year since 2000 but warned that momentum was likely to peter out.Meanwhile Intel begged to differ as its chief executive officer said he saw ""improved performance"" for the first half of the next year. Shares put on 2 per cent to $24.80.News of a possible mad-cow disease case sent McDonald's shares 1.5 per cent lower to $29.95, alongside Tyson Foods, a beef processing company, which gave up 1.7 per cent to $16.63.The fallout from the global withdrawal of Merck's Vioxx drug threatened to spread to other drugs groups as a regulatory official told lawmakers in Congress other similar drugs needed to be monitored. The NYSE-listed shares of AstraZeneca fell 8.6 per cent to $40.34 while GlaxoSmithKline's US-listed shares lost 3.22. Merck's stock saw limited action while Pfizer's was fractionally lower.Genesco was one of a latest batch of retailers this week to report quarterly results and saw shares put on 9.8 per cent to $29.36, in one of the best showings at the New York Stock Exchange after the company said its Johnston & Murphy shoe brand helped it walk to higher profits and increase its outlook for the year.However, Claire's Stores sounded a less sanguine note for the upcoming quarter and saw shares put one of the worst performances at the Big Board, down 15.7 per cent to $22.45.Williams-Sonoma fared equally badly, down 6 per cent to $36.77 after the retailer of high-end houseware guided investors lower for the fourth quarter after it missed estimates with its results for the current quarter.Kmart shares staged a retreat after a sharp rally in the previous session when the company's $11bn merger with Sears was announced. Sears was 1.5 per cent up to $53.80 and Kmart gave up 4.9 per cent to $103.71.After the closing bell, investors will also get quarterly results from Gap, another clothing retailer. Gap shares were down 2 per cent to $22.54.The shares of Medtronic, the medical device maker, were 7 per cent lower at $48.65 after the company guided analysts towards the lower end of its range for third-quarter profits.Meanwhile Multimedia Games shares rebounded 5.4 per cent to $13.14 from sharp earlier falls after the casino games maker reported a 3 per cent decrease in profits.Salesforce.com, one of the most eagerly anticipated initial public offerings earlier this year, saw shares decline 14.5 per cent to $17.82 amid disappointment at the guidance given by the company after the Wednesday close. The news prompted a downgrade to ""underperform"" from ""neutral"" by Credit Suisse First Boston.On a more upbeat note, the shares of Netflix rose 14 per cent to $11.92 after the internet DVD rental company increased its forecasts for revenues and subscriber growth in the fourth quarter."
372;GPS;Gap Inc;2004-09-10T11:13:06Z;Eisner aims to stay at Disney until 2006;;"Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's embattled chief executive, is to retire when his contract runs out in September 2006.The 62-year-old who has this year alone survived a shareholder revolt, ferocious personal attacks from former directors, and resisted a near-$60bn hostile bid from the Comcast cable group, announced his decision in a letter to the board, released on Friday.His decision could spark an internal succession struggle in a management hierarchy that he created and dominated for most of his tenure, and which, in recent years has been disrupted by a series of high-profile defections.It is also likely to reinvigorate a campaign by former directors, Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, who have been striving since last December to have Mr Eisner fired. Their efforts contributed to a shareholder revolt last March, when 45 per cent withheld their votes for his re-election to the board.Within hours, Mr Eisner was relieved of the title of company chairman.Although Mr Eisner has named Bob Iger, his second-in-command, as his personal ""preferred choice"" to take his place, the board is likely to survey a long list of potential successors - inside and outside the company - as it prepares for the transition.Paul Pressler, Disney's former theme parks chief who now running the Gap clothing chain, is one name that has cropped up in recent months, along with Mel Karmazin, former chief operating officer at Viacom, and Peter Chernin, chief operating officer of News Corp.Mr Eisner who gave no reason for his retirement decision in Friday's letter, told the Wall Street Journal that he had not been influenced either by the Comcast bid nor the dissidents' campaign. The timing was ""not motivated by current circumstances at all"".He pointed instead in his letter to the change in the company's momentum. Analysts say Disney will this year yield earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about $5.3bn after $3.9bn last year.However, the ABC broadcast television network continues to struggle as it has since its acquisition in 1996, and film production and animation are struggling. In recent weeks the weather has taken a hand, battering Florida, site of the group's flagship theme parks.The continued poor performance at ABC may tell against Mr Iger, who has been given primary responsibility for turning it round, and who this year ordered a wholesale shakeout of its management.Mr Eisner, the public face of the venerable company for almost two decades, said in his letter that the deal was vital to the group's growth and claimed the ABC arm, including the ESPN sports television franchise, was valued by Wall Street analysts at up to $53bn.Referring to his handsome remuneration - one of the most persistent sources of criticism, especially during the lean years from 1997 to 2003 - Mr Eisner acknowledged that ""along the way, I have been well rewarded for my efforts and the company's performance"".The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, a participant in this spring’s shareholder rebellion, on Friday said the resignation was “the right move for shareowners”, and called for Mr Eisner to leave the board.“It is not clear to us how a two-year lame duck CEO will benefit shareowners, and his continued presence on the board would prevent the company from the clean break that is needed to restore investor confidence,” the pension fund said."
373;GPS;Gap Inc;2004-09-03T16:23:27Z;Wall St shrugs off bad news in a quiet week;;Wall Street took some disappointing corporate news in its stride this week, with the weaker oil price tipping the balance in favour of the bulls.There was also relief that the summer's final “big event” the Republican National Convention in New York had passed without a terrorist attack.But it was the last week of the summer and activity was muted, in part because many investors and traders went on holiday to avoid the Republican gathering.But while markets were up over the week, they dipped on Friday amid disappointment over a warning from Intel late on Thursday and because solid job creation figures suggested the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates again later this month.By the close, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,260.20. However, the benchmark index was still up 0.6 per cent on the week. The S&P 500 had slipped 0.4 per cent to 1,113.63 on Friday, but it made a 0.5 per cent gain on the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.6 per cent to 1,844.48, for a 0.9 per cent weekly loss.Several strategists said the week's gains should be taken with a pinch of salt, because volumes were paper-thin.The week's economic data were largely tepid. August retail sales were extremely disappointing, with the much-anticipated back-to-school season stirring only modest interest in consumers.The data front took a turn for the better on Friday, with the eagerly awaited August non-farm payroll figures coming in at 144,000 just shy of analysts' expectations of 150,000 new jobs. But June and July figures were revised upwards by a combined 59,000.Although the figures suggest growth is more robust than feared, investors seemed to focus more on the implications for further interest rate rises.The closely watched mid-quarter update from Intel, the technology bellwether, was more than disappointing. The company said demand was weaker than expected and cut its forecasts for third quarter revenues and profit margins. Shares skidded 7.3 per cent yesterday to $20.05, making a new 52-week low and dragging down much of the chip sector with it. Semiconductors scored the week's worst performance on the S&P 500, down 7.2 per cent.Other losers included Advanced Micro Devices, off 6.6 per cent to $10.90 by the close, Xilinx, down 6.1 per cent to $25.59, PMC-Sierra, down 6.9 per cent to $8.69 and Applied Micro Circuits, 4.3 per cent weaker at $3.15.Intel's warning was only one of Thursday's disappointments. Wal-Mart, the retail giant, reported its weakest August sales in four years on the same day.Nonetheless, shares in the world's biggest retailer gained 0.7 per cent to $53.02 on the day, as investors were relieved that the 0.5 per cent same-store sales increase was not smaller.Gap, the clothing retailer, also reported a slimmer-than-expected drop in August sales. Shares climbed 5.7 per cent to $20.08, helping to lead the retailing sector to the session's best showing up 2.8 per cent. Taking the “glass-is-half-full” view to the extreme, markets sent shares of Ross Stores up 9.9 per cent to $23.53 after the company's August sales fell 8 per cent, rather than the 8.8 per cent investors had feared.Costco Wholesale, the membership warehouse chain, slid 1 per cent to $40.41 after the company reported August sales grew 4 per cent, missing analysts' expectations of 7.3 per cent growth by a wide mark.Energy stocks continued to prosper, in spite of the broader markets' relief at the recent pause in the crude rally.The S&P 500 energy group gained 3.9 per cent, the best performance on the week. Winners included Transocean, up 7.6 per cent on the week, Noble 7.9 per cent stronger and Occidental Petroleum, up 5 per cent.Woody Dorsey, a technical analyst at Market Semiotics, said investors' thinking about energy stocks had begun to shift, as they come round to the idea that oil prices may stay relatively high for some time.Although energy stocks have notched the S&P 500's best performance of the year, up 16.9 per cent, they have not kept pace with the soaring price of crude oil.
