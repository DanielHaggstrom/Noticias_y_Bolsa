0;PWR;Quanta Services;2013-06-28T08:42:53Z;Taiwan tech: time to make the switch;;"PC companies just can’t get a break.Shipments from the Taiwanese manufactures that make most of the world’s desktop and laptop computers hit a three-year low last quarter as consumers waited for fixes to Windows and decided to buy tablets and smartphones in the meantime. For those Taiwanese companies, those disappointing stats are one more reminder of the need to diversify away from their core PC business.The set of companies known as “original design manufacturers” or ODMs that design and make computers for groups like Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Apple shipped just 33.2m PCs in the first quarter this year. That is down 12 per cent from the same quarter last year, and down a steeper 17 per cent from 2012’s final quarter, according to new data from market researchers IHS.Worst hit was Quanta, which saw slower orders from at least four main customers, Acer, Asus, HP and Apple, says IHS’ senior analyst Peter Lin.Slowing sales are a danger to the contract manufacturing industry’s business model. Manufacturers like Quanta, and peers like Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, have slim margins, and so make money by churning out high volumes of PCs that are then sold by brand-name tech groups.Later this year, shipments might pick up as Intel and Windows both release new products geared at more mobile, touch-enabled PCs – but it won’t help that Intel and Windows, although their products (chips and software) need to be integrated into the same device, have different release schedules. That mismatched timing will be tricky to manage for the companies hoping to sell to consumers devices with both upgrades.The poor numbers emphasises to manufacturers what they already know – that growth will come from diversifying away from making PCs. And to some extent they are already doing that.Quanta is focusing more on building servers, in higher demand thanks to the growth of data centres used in cloud computing.Terry Guo, founder of Foxconn, spent most of its 8-hour long shareholders’ meeting this week talking about the company’s new initiatives, including spinning off specialised units that make specific components, to pushing into e-commerce and software development.As Guo pointed out, the manufacturing industry has a future, if only because someone needs to make the electronics people are still buying.If the IHS forecast is, right, however, the recovery he and other manufacturers’ bosses are promising will have to come from new initiatives – not the old PC.Related reading:

Varian was up 6.2 per cent to $60.60 after JPMorgan analysts told clients the German conglomerate Siemens would exit radiation therapy treatments, allowing Varian to gain market share.The S&P 500 finished the day at 1,257.81, on solid gains of 0.5 per cent. Trading had been volatile until midday when news that Italian prime minister-designate Mario Monti may form a government as soon as Wednesday triggered a decisive rally.“US markets have been given a reprieve for now,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But that could be reversed in a second if there is bad news from Europe.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 1,257.81.The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.1 per cent to 2,686.2, with support from Apple, by far its most heavily weighted stock.Apple shares rose 2.5 per cent to $388.83 after ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall told clients he expected the company to initiate a dividend policy next year. Apple has not paid a dividend since 1995, according to Bloomberg data.Retail sales figures rose 0.5 per cent month on month in October, but that was not enough to stop
a host of bellwether retail names falling on results releases.Walmart was off 2.4 per cent to $57.46 despite reporting US sales growth for the first time in nine quarters.Sales were driven by discounting that hurt margins, driving profit 3 per cent lower than in the same quarter of 2010 to $3.3bn.“Walmart investors have become accustomed to earnings beats,” said David Shick, head of consumer research at Stifel Nicolaus. “But the company is correct to focus on expanding market share at the expense of the bottom line in the short term.”Walmart’s size and exposure to thrifty consumers have made it a favourite of defensive investors this year and it remains one of the best performers in the S&P 500.Urban Outfitters fell sharply in early trading, before riding the afternoon rally, to end the day up 0.1 per cent to $26.85. Many analysts were alarmed by the level of unsold inventory held at the quarter’s end, a concern that Jeff Black at Citigroup played down.“The stance to the end of the fourth quarter with inventory better aligned with sales reinforces our view that Urban’s margin trough is confined to the second half of 2011,” Mr Black wrote to clients.Office equipment store Staples fell 3.6 per cent to $14.81 on anaemic sales growth of just 0.5 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. Barclays Capital analysts noted, however, that in local currency terms revenue was up 7 per cent year on year.Home Depot was down 0.5 per cent to $38.07 despite beating analyst expectations with earnings per share of 60 cents. Sears Holdings dropped 3.1 per cent to $70.03 after its Canadian namesake – in which it holds a 90 per cent stake – posted a loss of C$45.8m.The focus on retailers took the heat off bank stocks with the financial sector of the S&P 500 gaining 0.4 per cent, despite another sharp rise in the yields of Italian and Spanish sovereign bonds.Citigroup fell 1.3 per cent to $28.02 on reports that a host of hedge fund investors, including John Paulson, had cut their stakes in the bank during the third quarter.High-profile investor flight also hurt professional networking website LinkedIn, which slipped 4.8 per cent to $74.86, on news Bain Capital will sell its entire stake of 3.71m shares, when the newly floated company’s lock-out period ends.PepsiCo was boosted by news that activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken a $146m stake. The stock was up 2.7 per cent to $64.50 on hopes that Mr Peltz will push the board to boost shareholder returns.Quanta Services climbed 2.2 per cent to $19.19, on renewed hope that the Keystone XL pipeline, for which Quanta has a lucrative service contract, will be given the go-ahead if the state of Nebraska’s environmental concerns can be addressed.The hard drive manufacturer Western Digital Corporation slipped 4.9 per cent to $25.05 as the open-ended impact of widespread flooding in Thailand on its factories led another analyst to downgrade the stock."
2;PWR;Quanta Services;2011-11-11T21:53:21Z;Apple under pressure on talk of cut to iPad output;Rare bad week for Apple weighs on Nasdaq;A rare bad week for Apple weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, which ended the week in negative territory even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 recorded gains.Apple shares, which are by far the most heavily weighted in the Nasdaq, fell 3.9 per cent to $384.62 over the week as Ashok Kumar, a tech analyst at Rodman and Renshaw, said the company was scaling down iPad production because of moderating sales.Reports that Apple had reduced iPad orders to China-based suppliers first emerged in late September, but Mr Kumar’s note rekindled investor anxiety.“If moderate macro growth rates persist, tablet demand may fall further,” Mr Kumar said. “Consumers might opt for Ultrabooks, which combine notebook functionality and tablet portability, rather than buying yet another device.”But other analysts said the sell-off in Apple shares was overdone.“All of our store visits continue to suggest strong demand for iPads,” said William Power, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird.Apple’s problems meant the Nasdaq slipped 0.3 per cent over the week to 2,678.75.Europe’s debt crisis was once again to the fore throughout the week on Wall Street.Just as Greece’s political crisis appeared to be nearing resolution, the S&P 500 suffered its worst day in three months on Wednesday and US investors were left scrambling as the Italian government neared collapse.“We’ve got to respect the European overhang,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Federated Investors. “And scale back expectations for a rebound in US equities accordingly.”The S&P 500 did rally on Thursday and Friday as Italian bond yields eased, ending the week up 0.8 per cent, hanging on to positive territory for the year at 1,263.85.But despite the improving news from Europe, financials fell 0.5 per cent. Citigroup was off 3.3 per cent to $29.33 after a judge threatened to tear up the bank’s settlement with the SEC over allegations of mortgage mis-selling.Bank of America, whose Merril Lynch unit faces similar lawsuits, was down 4.3 per cent to $6.21.Insurers fared much better as concerns eased about losses on their European equity holdings.Lincoln National Corp was up 4.9 per cent for the week to $20.22.Even Genworth Financialrose 6 per cent on Friday to end the week at $6.95, after a ratings upgrade from Citigroup.Colin Devine, Citigroup’s insurance analyst, told clients that a planned partial initial public offering of Genworth’s Australian operations “could shore up GNW’s balance sheet while simultaneously improving financial flexibility”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 12,153.68, helped by a flurry of strong earnings releases and a 5.7 per cent gain for Merck after the drug manufacturer raised its dividend for the first time since 2004. Merck shares closed the week at $35.97.A deteriorating outlook for federal government spending knocked Computer Sciences, an IT outsourcing company, which relies on the public sector for most of its contracts. Its shares fell 18.3 per cent over the week to $26.48.But Cisco reported surprisingly robust demand from the government as it beat analyst estimates and its own guidance on earnings for the second quarter running. Its shares rose 5.5 per cent to $19.02.Signs of enduring strength from US consumers helped Walt Disney to a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in profit as spending on its cable services and at its US resorts surged.Disney was up 5.6 per cent for the week to $36.70.Viacom was the standout performer in the S&P 500, its widely traded class B shares rising 9 per cent to $44.90 after a strong quarterly earnings report.Box office revenues of $1.12bn from the latest Transformers blockbuster helped Viacom’s film unit post a 46 per cent increase in revenue compared with the same quarter in 2010.E-Trade Financial fell 14 per cent to $9.09 as the online broker’s board dashed takeover speculation by announcing that it would not bow to shareholder pressure to put the company up for sale.The stock had been trading at a premium on acquisition hopes.Delays to approval of the Keystone XL pipeline project hurt Quanta Services, the infrastructure contractor that had been trading at a premium after announcing it had been awarded a large contract for work on the pipeline.Its shares fell 12.6 per cent to $19.16. Andrew Whittmann at Robert W Baird downgraded the stock to a “hold” equivalent, from “buy”.“Without Keystone soaking up base-level industry capacity, we would expect Quanta’s pipeline business to head into 2012 with industry conditions not materially better than its difficult 2011,” he told clients.
3;PWR;Quanta Services;2011-11-02T22:21:19Z;MasterCard surges after rise in card spending;Wall Street sees wider bounce;Shares in MasterCard surged on Wednesday after the credit and debit card company said spending on its cards was up 18.1 per cent in the quarter to the end of September, compared with the same period last year. Shares rose 7 per cent to $357.66.“The MasterCard results show no signs of a macro slowdown, even in Europe,” said Glenn Greene at Oppenheimer Securities.The spending surge did not appear to be driven by higher consumer borrowing: spending on US credit cards was up 7 per cent year on year, whereas debit cards were up 23 per cent.Wall Street saw a wider bounce, with the S&P 500 up 1.6 per cent to 1,237.90. The benchmark index had pared early gains as Fed president Ben Bernanke said inflation would stay below its 2 per cent target through 2014, but the index moved higher again in the afternoon.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 2.8 per cent, as much as any other sector, in a clear sign of a Europe-driven rally. Bank of America rose 5 per cent to $6.72 and Morgan Stanley 3.3 per cent to $16.76.But insurer Genworth Financial saw the biggest bounce, up 5.7 per cent to $6.17. Genworth has been one of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500 in recent months, with investors wary of its vulnerability to the eurozone.Bank stocks had plunged on Tuesday after the Greek prime minister’s call for a referendum on his country’s eurozone bail-out, but on Wednesday some investors found reasons to be cheerful about the latest twist in Europe’s saga.“Because politicians can change their minds once in power, a referendum could bring more clarity on the issue and force more decisive resolutions than we have seen through the negotiation process,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 11,836.04 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.3 per cent to 2,639.98.Wireless network providers surged after the House of Representatives voted on Monday to bar new state and local taxes on wireless services. The bill was passed on Tuesday. MetroPCS, a national wireless provider, was up 11.9 per cent to $8.57, while Clearwire was up 10.3 per cent to $2.04.Infrastructure contractor Quanta Services was up 11.6 per cent to $22.14 after it said one of its units would be part of a venture that would build Transcanada’s Keystone XL Pipeline.EOG Resources jumped 11.8 per cent to $96.04 as it raised its output of lucrative liquid gas and oil. Liquids production was up 49 per cent compared with the same quarter last year. EOG was spun off from Enron a decade ago as a domestic natural gas driller, but the company has turned to crude oil as natural-gas prices have slumped.Pioneer Natural Resources, which has also struggled to navigate falling natural gas prices, leapt 12.6 per cent to $91.16. The company has suffered significant hedging losses in recent quarters, but this quarter it booked profits of about $200m by marking derivative contracts to market prices.Time Warner was off 0.8 per cent to $33.57, as investors appeared to put a more than 50 per cent year-on-year jump in third-quarter profits down to the box office success of its last Harry Potter film.Fibre optic manufacturer JDS Uniphase rose 8.5 per cent to $12.46 as earnings, excluding some items, of 18 cents per share, easily beat expectations because of high sales of laser products.BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion fell 2 per cent to $18.91 to close below its book value for the first time in nine years. That means RIM’s market capitalisation is now lower than the market value of its property, patents and other assets.Intercontinental­Exchange fell 0.5 per cent to $122.62. Shares had increased as much as 5 per cent after quarterly results showed a 38 per cent surge in income, driven by strong trading volume in its oil futures contracts.CME Group, the largest US exchange group by market capitalisation, bounced back 7.5 per cent to $259.39. The stock had sold heavily on Tuesday, after Craig Donohue, chief executive, said the derivatives broker-dealer MF Global had broken CME’s rules on segregating customer and broker accounts.Medical technology company Becton Dickinson fell 4.6 per cent to $72.60, as income for the quarter ended September 30 fell to $300m and the company’s full-year earnings forecast disappointed analysts.
4;PWR;Quanta Services;2011-08-03T21:19:02Z;US equities turn positive;;US equities managed to steer clear of an eighth-straight decline, as a late-session rally in technology shares powered the end of the streak.The IT sector led all S&P 500 groups, adding 1.2 per cent. The move was primarily driven by sharp gains by MasterCard and Visa, the payment processing networks.Shares in MasterCard jumped 8.5 per cent to $323.90, after touching a record high of $325. Its arch-rival Visa added 4.7 per cent to $87.48.MasterCard reported earnings of $4.76 a share, well above estimates of $4.23 a share. It said payments on its debit card network surged as consumers used more cash and less credit to make purchases.Tech groups that cater to businesses also saw gains. Juniper Networks, which sells computer networking software, added 3.7 per cent to $23.59. F5 Networks rose 3.5 per cent to $93.35.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 0.9 per cent to 2,693.07, leading the big indices.Strong earnings have been greeted with scepticism by many traders because of reduced labour costs. A survey by Challenger & Gray on Wednesday showed a 59.4 per cent jump in lay-offs this July versus last year, while May showed only a 5.3 per cent rise.But that has actually given a lift to technology groups, the best-performing sector in the past month.The broader S&P 500 index added 0.5 per cent to 1,260.34. It rebounded all the way from 1,238, its low on the day, and also a new low for the year. Its closing level is still below its 200-day moving average, but above the 1,250 level that bordered its overall uptrend since March 2009.Technical analysts said it remained to be seen whether these gains were a bear market correction or the resumption of a bull market trend.“We broke the lows of June, we broke lows of March. You don’t get moves like that without the occasional bear market correction,” said Walter Zimmerman, strategist at United-Icap.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the poorest showing, adding just 0.3 per cent to 11,896.44. Selling of large-cap industrial groups suggested “long-term investors were betting on a slowdown”, said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet.The Dow’s steepest decliner was Caterpillar, the manufacturer of heavy equipment. It fell 0.9 per cent to $96.28. Chevron, the global exploration and production group, slipped 0.7 per cent to $102.76.Energy shares were the worst-performing sector, falling 0.6 per cent. Marathon Oil, a refinery group, paced fallers, dropping 5.1 per cent to $27.63.It was downgraded by analysts at Credit Suisse from “outperform” to “neutral”. They pointed to second-quarter earnings of 96 cents that missed forecasts of $1.02, and macro uncertainty. The price of crude oil fell sharply in the US and abroad, with WTI and Brent both seeing drops of 2 per cent on Wednesday.“We believe investors will probably wait for a record of execution … and that looks some way off in these markets,” Credit Suisse said in a note.Positive corporate news provided additional lift. Quanta Services, which provides construction services to power plants, jumped 10 per cent to $18.85 after it raised its full-year revenue forecast to as much as $4.6bn from $4.4bn, citing a strong pipeline of projects likely to be completed as regulatory gridlock ends.Insurance and risk management groups XL Group and Marsh & McLennan also jumped, both citing second-quarter profit boosts that topped analysts’ forecasts. XL shares rose 8.7 per cent to $21.77, while Marsh added 3.4 per cent to $29.45.Media group Time Warnerfell 1.3 per cent to $33.57 after it reported earnings of 60 cents per share. That topped estimates but advertising revenues grew by less than forecast, according to an analyst at Citigroup. “Revenues …were above our estimate,” said Citigroup, “but most of the beat came from films”.Comcast, the cable TV provider, added 0.2 per cent to $22.77. Its earnings similarly topped estimates, at 42 cents a share versus the 40 cents forecast.The maker of Sam Adams beer, Boston Beer, dropped 2.3 per cent to $86.65. It reported a big jump in profit in the second quarter, but lowered its full-year outlook, citing rising input costs. It said it would attempt to pass on price increases to consumers later this year.
5;PWR;Quanta Services;2011-05-31T12:54:37Z;Compal betting on Intel’s Ultrabook to revive PC market;;Intel’s vision of a new category of ‘Ultrabooks’ that would revolutionise the consumer PC industry has won over at least one important convert.Speaking at a separate press conference just minutes after Intel’s keynote speech, Ray Chen, president of Taiwan’s Compal, the world’s second-biggest contract PC maker, praised the idea of Ultrabooks and said it would “ignite the next wave of laptop replacements” next year when those new models come onto the market.Sales of Ultrabooks next year, combined with the launch of Windows 8, would mean that “this year is the only year with such slow growth for notebooks,” Mr Chen said, adding: “[Ultrabooks] will definitely stimulate demand.”PC makers could certainly use the boost after a dismal first quarter this year. Compal saw sales fall by a fifth from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, with operating margins down to a record low of 2.1 per cent. Mr Chen said the notebook market would begin to pick up from the third quarter of this year, when it expects sales to rise 10 to 15 per cent from the second quarter.While its bigger cross-town rival Quanta has branched out to the server market to capture opportunities from cloud computing, Mr Chen said Compal would remain with consumer electronics, but will increasingly focus on developing and touting its own designs and technologies rather than leaving all the decisions up to their customers – the branded vendors like HP, Dell and Acer.A joint venture between Compal and LG in Shanghai, for example, came up with a way to make laptop screens that do not need a frame. Compal is also working on new technology to make ever thinner and lighter casings for notebooks.“We need to transform into a new model of business that emphasises the gap [in capabilities] between what we do and what our competitors do,” Mr Chen said. “By this stage of the industry’s development, it is meaningless to compete on price alone.”But despite his enthusiasm, Mr Chen is also increasingly wary of putting all his eggs in the PC basket. Compal makes smartphones, televisions and tablets (for which Mr Chen said they have gotten so many orders recently that he can’t fill them all), but 90 per cent of sales are still notebook PCs. By the end of this year, he says, he hopes that proportion would fall to 80 per cent.Just to be clear, he added that “this does not mean we expect notebook sales to fall. We just want to expand more quickly” in other products.
6;PWR;Quanta Services;2011-05-30T19:55:35Z;Taiwan’s Quanta moves into cloud computing;;Taiwan’s Quanta, the world’s biggest contract PC maker, made more than 50m notebook computers last year and, for the first time in its 23-year history, generated revenues of more than T$1,000bn ($35bn).But like many other electronics contract manufacturers, Quanta is in a quandary. Rising labour costs in China, rising raw material and oil prices, and a weakening US dollar, are all squeezing profit margins, such that Quanta last year had just T$2.3bn in net profits for a 1.7 per cent margin.Other contract manufacturers are in a similar bind.Taiwan’s Hon Hai, an assembler of Apple products, saw its margins fall to a historic low of 2.6 per cent on an unconsolidated basis in the first quarter of 2011, as costs increased due to its wage increase last year and as it moves factories further inland in China.Compal, the world number two PC manufacturer, last month said it would seek to raise the fee it charges PC brands such as HP and Dell to offset rising costs.Yet moving to lower cost regions and trying to raise prices, may only be temporary fixes. For Quanta, even though it correctly predicted a decade ago that notebook computers would replace desktops, the longer-term solution lies in identifying the “next big thing”, which it thinks is cloud computing.It is because of this that Quanta is moving aggressively into data centres and servers, and challenging established groups such as IBM, HP, Dell and Sun Microsystems.Quanta last month teamed up with Facebook in its Open Compute Project, which seeks to encourage greater innovation and industry dialogue about data centres by making public Facebook’s own custom designs.The PC maker is also surpassing its usual role as a contract manufacturer by directly supplying Facebook and Google with servers, rather than acting through a branded intermediary such as HP or Dell. By doing so, it can earn much richer profit margins than the standard assembly fee it charges for making notebooks for them.“In notebook computers, we are already the biggest, so there is not much room for further growth,” said Barry Lam, Quanta chairman.The company hopes to raise servers’ contribution to overall revenue from about 3-5 per cent to just under 10 per cent by the end of this year.Cloud computing also implies a construction boom in data centres – large buildings that contain thousands of individual servers – by internet companies such as Google, Yahoo and Facebook.Since these are tech-savvy groups, they often prefer their own custom designs over the standard packages offered by large vendors to customers in other industries such as banking, governments, or hospitals.While the scale of this boom is difficult to quantify, Christian Belady, general manager of data centre research at Microsoft, estimated recently that the annual market for data centre construction would reach $18bn in the US and $78bn globally by 2020.While Asian contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai and Inventec, and Singapore’s Flextronics already produce servers on a contract manufacturing basis, they have not been able to challenge large international brands. While Asian producers are unrivalled in manufacturing high-quality tech hardware at a low cost, servers need to be paired with specialised software – expertise that contract manufacturers typically lack.Quanta, however, has been quietly building up this capability over the past two years, the first public result of which was last month’s partnership with Facebook and the fact that it would supply servers for Facebook’s Oregon and North Carolina data centres.So far, HP and Dell appear little concerned that Quanta and Facebook’s open compute design would pose a competitive threat to their businesses.Dell’s marketing director, Drew Schulke, said Facebook’s open compute design would not harm Dell’s business, because the company brings in significant revenues from services compared to hardware.HP said that with the explosion of cloud computing services there is enough business to go around and that HP doesn’t need to worry about Quanta.“We just see it as a huge industry and there’s so many opportunities for everyone out there,” it said.
7;PWR;Quanta Services;2011-05-23T21:26:28Z;China’s computer makers march inland;;"This week, lorries will pick up several thousand Acer computers from a factory owned by Quanta, the world’s largest notebook contract manufacturer, in the western Chinese city of Chongqing. Though unseen by consumers, the shipment will kick off the largest change in global PC manufacturing and logistics in more than a decade.Driven by a surge in labour and land costs as well as labour shortages in China’s established export manufacturing hubs around Shanghai and just over the border from Hong Kong, the world’s largest PC vendors and the half-dozen contract manufacturers serving them are moving inland.The PC industry is setting up vast new factories, development and logistics centres in the cities of Chongqing and Chengdu in western China.Hewlett-Packard, Acer and Asustek, the world’s number one, three and six PC brands by shipments, chose Chongqing. Dell and Lenovo, ranking second and fourth, picked Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province less than 300km away.That spurred Quanta, HP’s largest manufacturing partner, which also supplies all other leading notebook brands, to set up shop in Chongqing as well. Foxconn, which serves HP, Dell, Apple, Asustek and Sony, set up facilities in both cities while Compal and Wistron, two other large notebook contract manufacturers, are building factories in both places. Inventec, a smaller manufacturer, is ramping up operations in Chongqing.“We will become the world’s largest notebook manufacturing base within a year as a result,” says Huang Qigang, a senior Communist party official of the Liangjiang New Area, home to the new factories in Chongqing. “The industry will create total revenues of Rmb700bn and output of 100m notebooks next year.” That would be more than one-third of all notebooks produced worldwide.Chengdu has similar aspirations: Li Yi, vice-director of the city’s investment promotion commission, estimates local notebook output for 2015 at 80m, and of tablet PCs at 150m – more than twice the 2012 global tablet market, according to Barclays Capital.The industry has not seen such a big shift since the early 1990s, when Taiwan’s contract manufacturers started moving their mass production lines to eastern and southern China, winning an ever-larger share of the market from suppliers based in south-east Asia.Conditions are ripe for a rapid expansion in western China. HP shipped its first made-in-Chongqing computer last year. But the world’s largest PC vendor makes only a fraction of its PCs itself, and apart from Foxconn, its external producers were not yet ready in the new location.Now, Quanta’s factory has started production. “ Compal and Wistron will get ready in Chongqing in July and August,” says Oliver Ahrens, president of Acer China, adding that the Taiwanese company expects 50 to 60 per cent of its global PC shipments to come out of Chongqing in the long term. “We will move our complete tablet production over here in the third quarter,” he says.Foxconn, the main manufacturer of Apple’s iPad and therefore the company with the biggest impact in numbers, has already started. One-third of the world’s iPads are being made in Chengdu, with the remainder shipped out of Shenzhen, Foxconn’s traditional main manufacturing hub in the south, say local government officials. “Foxconn employs 80,000 workers in Chengdu now and will have 100,000 by the end of the year,” says Mr Li. “The plan is to expand up to 300,000.”HP and Lenovo say the focus of their new facilities is the local market – more than 50 per cent of China’s PCs now sell in smaller cities away from Beijing and Shanghai. “Moving manufacturing closer to HP users in western and central China results in improved logistics and a shortened delivery cycle; users in western and central China enjoy more timely and convenient access to HP’s products,” says HP.But the new hub has global significance. To offset its inland location, Chongqing has been linked up to transcontinental freight services. This month, an air freight service to Antwerp was inaugurated.In March, a freight rail line that previously ran only to Moscow was extended to Duisburg in western Germany, close to the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Two weeks ago, it was extended to Antwerp, Europe’s third-largest container port after Rotterdam and Hamburg.Mr Ahrens says that this link can help cut transport time to Europe, Acer’s most important market, by two weeks. Shipping out of Shanghai takes 24-28 days, while rail freight out of Chongqing is expected to take 12-14 days."
8;PWR;Quanta Services;2010-06-01T14:21:44Z;Intel ‘port of choice’ no safe haven for Wintel;;"Dadi Perlmutter, executive vice president of the Intel Architecture group, used a curious turn of phrase during his presentation at Computex on Tuesday when describing Intel’s role in the future world of computing.
Besides highlighting Intel’s traditional strengths in designing and manufacturing advanced processors, Mr Perlmutter (pictured) said Intel sought to be the “port of choice” for various operating environments.
This may not sound like a big deal, but to an entire Taiwan PC manufacturing industry that grew up around the close and exclusive alliance between Microsoft and Intel, it must have been a stark reminder of how much the industry landscape is changing.
Even just a few years ago it would have been all but unthinkable that a computer, if it wasn’t a Mac, would be anything other than a ‘Wintel‘ model. This certainty and simplicity facilitated the rise of big contract manufacturers like Quanta and Compal, who assembled computers for a variety of brands.
Now, however, Intel’s ‘port of choice’ strategy, and the fact that Mr Perlmutter demonstrated a few Android-on-Intel devices during his presentation, signals at least a willingness to work on both sides of the Google/Microsoft fight.
This may partly be an effort to push back against Arm’s advance onto mobile computing devices like netbooks and tablets – Acer ported Android onto a netbook running Intel’s x86 architecture at last year’s Computex, but most other device makers simply went with an Arm-Android combination instead.
However, it may equally be because of Meego, the joint Intel/Nokia operating system that would compete with both Android and Windows. Mr Perlmutter had even invited Gianfranco Lanci, Acer chief executive, on stage to confirm that the world’s second biggest PC company will launch Meego-based netbook and tablet products by the end of this year or early next year.
Whatever the reasons, it’s pretty clear that the Windows-Intel alliance is no longer quite what it used to be."
9;PWR;Quanta Services;2010-04-26T11:11:28Z;Quanta chairman stays off TV assembly bandwagon;;Over the past few years, putting together desktop and notebook computers has not been enough for the Taiwanese contract manufacturers that actually produce the vast majority of the world’s PCs.Companies like Compal, Wistron and Hon Hai – relatively unknowns names that brands like HP, Dell and Acer rely on to do the actual manufacturing – have all looked towards TV assembly as the next big driver for growth, particularly as Japanese brands like Sony and Toshiba are increasingly finding it too expensive to manage their own manufacturing operations.Hon Hai, the maker of iPhones and iPods, has moved most aggressively, buying up Sony’s TV plants in Slovakia and Mexico, and merging one of its units with Taiwan’s second-biggest flat-panel maker.The reason is that even though assembly is one of the lower-margin segments of the TV supply chain, it is still more profitable than the 4 to 5 per cent profit margin earned in PC assembly.One name, however, stands out for having not jumped on the TV bandwagon. Barry Lam, chairman of Quanta, the world’s second-biggest PC contract manufacturer, on Monday in fact had some harsh words for his competitors who are branching out into TV assembly.“I’m already 61 years old. I want to value my life and not go do something that gives no contribution to humankind,” Mr Lam said.“What I want to do is research and development [of new, cloud computing-related products] . . . following the “me too”, cost-down model is not the way forward,” he said, although he remained coy about exactly what those new products would be.Quanta’s margins in the first quarter of this year, in results released on Monday, were at the notebook-assembler range of 4.1 per cent, but that has not stopped its profits from rising 22 per cent from last year to T$5.3bn. It expects shipments to increase by another 15 to 20 per cent in the second quarter – even on such thin margins, that should give Mr Lam enough ammunition to fund research and development of his mysterious new products.Additional Reporting by Chen Yu-ting in Taipei

Its shares fell 1.2 per cent to $23.17.The S&P dropped 0.3 per cent to 1,002.72, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to close at 9,280.97.The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,993.05.“The economic news suggests that the economy is bottoming but the turn is going to be slow,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments.There were mixed signs on consumer activity as several blue-chip companies reported quarterly results. Shares in Whole Foods, the upmarket grocery chain, bounced 15.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company beat estimates for sales, profits and margins.Kraft also showed resilience in the food sector after the company, which counts Oreo cookies among its well-known brands, beat analysts’ expectations and raised its full-year profit outlook.But the shares slipped a fraction lower to $28.33
following a recent spike on the back of similarly good numbers from rivals General Mills and Kellogg’s.There were more negative signs on customer spending, however, from Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer group.The company’s revenues disappointed Wall Street and, even though earnings were slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations and the company maintained its full-year guidance, its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $53.91.Meanwhile, Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing company, rose 7.1 per cent to $68.31 after stronger sales and cheaper supply chain costs helped the company post stronger profits and margins than expected.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Electronic Arts saw its shares rise
following impressive results, fuelled by strong sales of The Sims 3 video-game and tight cost
controls.But the stock ultimately lost 6.8 per cent to $20.40, after John Riccitiello, chief executive, warned of continued weakness in the sector, saying orders from retailers remained low.Garmin jumped 23.8 per cent to $33.66 after the satellite navigation system maker beat its earnings estimates and significantly improved profit margins following steep cost cuts.Two of the best-known car rental companies found gains. Shares in Dollar Thrifty rose 14.2 per cent to $20.02 after the company exceeded estimates, having successfully raised its prices and cut costs last year.Some industry analysts now predict the company could become a takeover target for a bigger rival.One of those rivals, Avis, announced a quarterly loss with rental volumes remaining low. But the shares closed up 5 per cent to $9.39 as the company said demand had begun to stabilise."
11;PWR;Quanta Services;2009-04-29T17:30:51Z;Acer aims to topple HP in notebook sales;;Acer vowed to overtake Hewlett-Packard as the top seller of notebook computers, before the end of next year on the back of a range of affordable, ultra-light models.The Taiwanese company has moved into lower-cost products, such as the netbook, which helped it reach a near equal share of broader PC sales with Dell, the world number two.Acer has exploited consumers’ changes in spending habits during the economic downturn, but its market share gains came at the cost of a one-third drop in first-quarter net profits from the same quarter last year to T$2bn (US$60m).T. Wang, chairman, said the shift to cheaper products was inevitable given the global economic crisis, saying: “Under the financial crisis, if you sell at high prices, no one will want to buy.“Some people say Acer is the company that is driving prices down. I don't agree. Our competitors consider [netbooks] junk, but consumers want to buy junk. That’s really ironic.”Gianfranco Lanci, chief executive, expects Acer to sell 10m to 12m netbooks this year, more than double last year’s sales.This would help Acer overtake HP in the global notebook market next year, a year ahead of Acer’s previous forecast, Mr Lanci said on Wednesday. “As for the total PC market, we don’t think that’s our main focus,” he said.Acer moved within 0.1 percentage points of Dell in the broader PC market, with a share of 12.8 per cent by the end of March, according to research firm Gartner.Acer shook up the PC market this month with a range of ultra-thin laptops with long battery life at half the price charged by its competitors. These products, which use an energy-saving Intel processor, will begin shipping this month and will help halt the trend of falling prices for Acer products, Mr Wang said.The Timeline series “is going to set a new standard. Our competitors will come but . . . they will take six to nine months” to replicate the technology used in the computers, Mr Wang said.Acer’s announcement comes as other computer makers in Taiwan also suggested that the worst of the downturn had passed.Compal and Quanta, the two biggest contract manufacturers of notebook computers in the world and suppliers to brands such as Acer and HP, both reported first-quarter results on Wednesday that beat analysts’ expectations.Quanta said it expected shipments in the second quarter to increase by 10 per cent from the previous three months.Acer's Mr Lanci said “revenue and profitability will be slightly better in Q2 than in Q1”.In spite of the growing optimism about business conditions, Mr Lanci said the PC market was likely to see still further consolidation. “We still see too many players in the market,” he said.
12;PWR;Quanta Services;2008-07-30T22:35:04Z;Toshiba, Sony and Fujitsu in laptop price war;;Sony, Toshiba and Fujitsu are all preparing to launch ultra low-cost laptops in an effort to get into the booming market led by Taiwan’s Asustek, whose EeePC sells for as little as $300.Quanta, the world’s biggest notebook contract manufacturer, plans to make such a laptop for Sony, according to sources in Taiwan.Inventec, a Taiwanese laptop manufacturer that also makes a Hewlett-Packard model, is assembling a cheap laptop for Toshiba. And Taiwanese component maker executives say Fujitsu is preparing to make its own ultra low-cost laptop in-house.The move is an attempt to counter the threat from makers of cheap laptops who have been grabbing market share from the high-priced versions of the small format notebooks sold by the Japanese groups.The unprecedented success of Asustek’s EeePClaunched by late last year has already prompted the three biggest laptop makers, HP, Dell and Acer, to announce their own plans for cheap notebook releases.Alvin Kwock, an analyst at JPMorgan, said: “For the Japanese, the rapid emergence of this new market segment is clearly a pain.You see them making this move now because they fear the cheap laptops will cannibalise their UMPCs [ultra-mobile personal computers].”Small, light computers with strong connectivity features that can cost $2,000 or more have remained a niche product after several years in the market.Initially, industry experts believed it would be low-end desktop PCs or existing cheap notebooks that would suffer most from the rise of the new low-cost laptops – also called netbooks, mini-notes or sub-notes.But sales of the EeePC and its rivals show that the cheapest mini-notes, which sell at about US$300, are not as popular as those priced at US$500 or more with stronger technical features.Fujitsu confirmed it was developing a low-cost notebook for Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore. But the Japanese group said it had not decided when it would begin selling it.Fujitsu said it would hold off selling the low-cost PC in Japan until it was clear there was sufficient demand.Sony, Toshiba and Quanta declined to comment. Inventec was not available for comment.
13;PWR;Quanta Services;2008-05-07T22:35:00Z;Pricing pressures hit laptop makers;;Until recently, people buying rice and people buying computers seemed to be living in two different worlds.While the price of rice has rocketed and raised fears of shortages in many countries, the prices for notebook computers appeared to be moving in the opposite direction as PC makers launched low-cost models – the so-called sub-notebooks.But inflation is not just about food and oil. Prices for raw materials used in notebooks have jumped and the fact that most notebooks are being assembled in China, where labour and other costs have been soaring, is also making itself felt.After years of price cuts, the companies that make notebooks – Taiwanese contract manufacturers including Quanta, Compal and Wistron – have decided that they can no longer bear the pain and are asking their branded customers, including HP, Dell and Acer, to share the burden.For the contract PC makers this could end years of sliding margins but it may come at a cost. For this is a time when shoppers in the US and Europe are poised to look for bargains rather than prepare to pay more for a notebook.Instead of buying a mainstream or low-end notebook, increasing numbers might opt for the lower cost sub-notebooks – a product the industry hopes will attract new customers rather than merely offer a cheap alternative to more expensive models.Obermann’s time to actDeutsche Telekom will be reporting its first-quarter results on Thursday, but the figures are unlikely to excite much attention. Investors will be far more interested to hear whether the company’s young chief executive, René Obermann, is ready to take the plunge and join the latest round of telecom industry consolidation.Mr Obermann is coming under increasing pressure from both his big shareholders – the German government and the Blackstone private equity group of the US – and his industry peers to make a big move.Sure, he is trying to take a large stake in the Greek telephone operator OTE, but this is proving no picnic given local union opposition to the deal.In any case, the Greek venture would hardly qualify as a transformational acquisition. Buying Sprint Nextel across the Atlantic certainly would.The price is tempting and the German government would be delighted to see Deutsche Telekom extend its global reach at a time when European rivals such as France Telecom and Telefónica of Spain are entertaining all sorts of consolidation prospects.The problem is that the risks are likely to be even greater than the potential rewards, given the Herculean task of integrating Sprint Nextel with the German company’s T-Mobile offshoot.But then Mr Obermann may have little choice. Caution ended up costing his predecessor his job. Mr Obermann now seems to be facing a similar do-or-die dilemma.BT rings the changesJust over six years after BT spun off its mobile phone business, the UK’s dominant fixed-line telecom group is attempting a wireless comeback.BT plans to provide broadband customers with a BlackBerry-style smartphone, which operates through wifi where possible and the rest of the time relies on so-called 2.5G mobile coverage.It does not look like a “killer app”. The established mobile operators started offering smartphones years ago. BT’s hybrid offering is the kind of thing that makes more sense for business customers looking to kit out sales forces who spend half their time in a wireless office and the rest of the time on the road.But BT is bravely pitching the service at the consumer market.This is a sensible move by BT to tap potential incremental revenues from its captive broadband customer base but it is unlikely to be much more than that. It is hard to see BT taking any sizeable market share in the mobile market this way, nor does that seem to be the company’s ambition.The service is certainly not going to compensate for the challenges facing the group’s core business, where BT is losing domestic revenues to rivals exploiting the deregulation of the so-called local loop.Meanwhile, BT’s global services business, which provides network infrastructure and information technology services to multinationals, remains a work in progress.None of this should have BT shareholders fondly reminiscing for the days when it owned the Cellnet mobile business, and asking why the company ever got out of mobile in the first place. Cellnet became O2, which was bought by Spain’s Telefónica. BT shareholders who kept their O2 shares upon its demerger got a brilliant price for them in the takeover. They should remember that, if BT’s latest mobile comeback ends up making only a modest impact on the bottom line.world.view@ft.com

by Jeanette Winterson
Bloomsbury ₤12.99, 416 pagesWhat would you do if you could control time? Would you parcel it up and sell it off chunk-by-chunk? Would you make the buses run on schedule so you never had to wait in the rain again? Would you protect it or would you manipulate it?This is the question at the heart of Tanglewreck, Jeanette Winterson’s first novel for older children. The book has all the traditional ingredients of a kids’ story. Silver, an orphan with green eyes and freckles is leading a Cinderella-like existence under the evil eyes of her spinster aunt Mrs Rokabye and a spying rabbit called Bigamist (”on account of his habits”). Their lives in the ancient house of Tanglewreck are disrupted by the arrival of the sinister Abel Darkwater who is searching for the Timekeeper, a mysterious watch who controls time. And Abel Darkwater wants to find it now.For Time (with a capital T) has become unsteady of late. A series of Time Tornadoes is afflicting the earth, flinging people back and forth across the centuries - revenge, perhaps, for mankind’s attempt to control time.Abel Darkwater tries to hypnotise Silver into remembering where the watch is hidden. Silver wants to find it for herself. And Regalia Mason, Abel Darkwater’s evil adversary of old, is determined to stop them both. So begins the quest.Regalia Mason is the outstanding character of this novel. She is the chief executive and president of Quanta, a company that makes its money “only selling things that people had to buy - like air and water and oil”. And now Regalia Mason wants to add Time to her portfolio. But is Time absolute or, like radio frequencies that co-exist without interrupting each other, do we tune in to only one reality at any time?Time and truth are recurring themes in all of Winterson’s novels; underneath each story lie other, untold - untellable - stories. In her 1997 book Gut Symmetries, Winterson wrote: “I can’t go back to the past and change it, but I have noticed that the future changes the past.” In Tanglewreck, Winterson has more fun with this conundrum - and finds a solution: for whoever finds the Timekeeper will control both the future and history.Winterson leads us on a lightning tour as we visit the “Throwbacks”, who live underground, speak in old English and talk about the “Updwellers”, leap down Black Holes, zoom back to the 16th century and learn about “Time Transfusions” (time is taken from 13-year-old children and injected into those who can afford it).Younger readers won’t understand everything in this book, but Winterson doesn’t talk down or over-explain. The “Einstein Line”, home to all the popes who existed before 2333, is an appealing place even if you don’t understand the theory of relativity. And Dinger the cat - he’s alive or dead depending on when you look at him - is a happy distraction, whether or not you’re familiar with the concept of Schrodinger’s cat.The adult and childlike are meshed with skill. At times Winterson adopts the repetitious, lulling prose of a more basic story: “Abel Darkwater was a round man. He had a round face, and a round body, and round rings on his round fingers.” When Abel Darkwater tries to read Silver’s mind she forces herself to go blank: “Cabbage, thought Silver, cabbage, cabbage, cabbage.” And like many tales of dastardly deeds, the goodies go by their first name - Silver, Gabriel, Micah - while the villains always have two (even Mrs Rokabye never drops the Mrs).At times the story drops into cliche: a villain wears a white fox-fur coat, while another character, when scared, “swallowed hard and decided to be brave”.In the end, though, Tanglewreck is a fantastical, imaginative and impressive parable. The novel builds to a showdown between the forces of magic - represented by Abel Darkwater - and science and commercialism, fronted by Regalia Mason. Who wins? Well Winterson, known for her opinionated outbursts and lesbian passion, is an old romantic at heart. For what travels faster than the speed of light, in Winterson’s mind at least? The speed of love, of course. And love, as the saying goes, conquers all."
