0;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2019-09-04T15:33:29Z;Tapestry chairman Jide Zeitlin to replace chief Victor Luis;Company behind Coach and Kate Spade labels has lost half its value within a year;Tapestry’s chief executive is leaving the company he sought to transform from a bag brand into a luxury conglomerate, after its shares lost more than half their value within a year.Just three weeks after its latest earnings disappointed Wall Street, the New York-listed company behind labels Coach and Kate Spade on Wednesday announced that Victor Luis is to leave after five years at the helm. He will be replaced by Jide Zeitlin, Tapestry’s chairman since November 2014.Mr Luis joined Coach in 2006 and, after his promotion to chief executive in 2014, led a push to create a US rival to European grand luxury houses such as LVMH, Kering and Richemont.He oversaw the $574m acquisition of Stuart Weitzman footwear in 2015 — Coach’s first purchase since it was founded in 1941 — and the $2.4bn deal for Kate Spade in 2017. The enlarged group rebranded as Tapestry the same year, and signalled its ambition for further deals.However, the company has struggled to integrate its acquisitions and performance has been underwhelming.Mr Zeitlin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, told the Financial Times that the leadership change did not signal a strategic shift but rather a stronger focus on implementation.While Mr Zeitlin did not rule out cost-cutting or store closures, he insisted his focus was on growth. He also said he was committed to continuing Tapestry’s expansion in China in spite of worsening trade tensions: “We are all-in on China . . . We are as committed to China as ever.”The strategy is clear. We need to step up the execution, and Jide will be able to get the best out of this management teamThe sudden departure of Mr Luis, who received a $12.8m pay package in 2018, highlights the struggles American luxury groups have had in replicating the successes of their European peers. Shares in Capri Holdings — owner of Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace — have fallen 65 per cent in the past year.While Coach, which accounts for about 70 per cent of Tapestry’s sales, has managed steady growth, Kate Spade, whose eponymous founder committed suicide last year, has been a source of weakness.Tapestry shares have fallen from just over $50 a year ago to close at $20.44 on Tuesday, giving the company a market capitalisation of $5.86bn. After the announcement of the management change, they rose as much as 5.2 per cent on Wednesday.Mr Luis’s departure is the highest profile in a series of recent management changes. The company has also replaced its chief financial officer this year.In February, Tapestry trimmed its outlook for the year and disappointed investors again in August, when it reported a fall in fourth-quarter profits from $212m to $149m, on sales of $1.5bn. Same-store sales at Kate Spade fell 6 per cent, surprising many analysts who had been expecting a turnround.Mr Zeitlin, 55, has been involved with Coach for more than two decades — first as an adviser, and then joining its board in 2006.The executive is the son of a domestic worker in Nigeria who agreed for him to be adopted aged five by an American family for whom she worked so that he could have a better education.He graduated from Amherst College and then Harvard Business School before joining Goldman, where he rose to become chief of operations.In addition to uncertainty about China, Tapestry faces other challenges. The market for handbags has cooled and remains vulnerable in a weakening economy, while wider struggles in retail, such as consumers’ shift to online, are also a concern.Yet Tapestry executives express optimism that its “accessible luxury” brands will hold up better than others in a downturn. They also believe that fresh designs at Kate Spade, which installed a new creative director in 2018, will begin to revive its fortunes.Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo and a Tapestry director, said the board was unanimous in its decision, and cited Mr Zeitlin’s experience in emerging markets — through his investment firm Keffi Group — as an asset to the company.“The strategy is clear. We need to step up the execution, and Jide will be able to get the best out of this management team,” Mr Menezes said.

So when his property company CK Asset Holdings acquires Greene King, the largest listed UK pub company, for £4.6bn, we should take note.The deal followed weekend protests by an estimated 1.7m people in Hong Kong against China’s grip on the former UK colony. Mr Li, who has been excoriated in the People’s Daily for diversifying out of property in mainland China and Hong Kong into economies including the UK, is clearly unbowed.The same cannot be said of Swire, the trading company established in Hong Kong by a Liverpool textile firm in 1870. Chinese pressure on Cathay Pacific, the airline it controls, over the role of employees in protests, last week forced the replacement of Rupert Hogg, Cathay’s chief executive.Neither does it apply to auditors such as PwC, whose Hong Kong partners issued a contrite statement after Chinese outrage at employees of large accounting firms publicly backing the protests. Nor to the luxury companies Coach and Versace, which had to apologise for suggesting that Hong Kong is a country, and not a part of China.“I aim to be strong enough to be respected, if not beloved,” declared John Samuel Swire, who brought his family’s firm to Shanghai and Hong Kong in the 19th century. But China’s use of multinationals to enforce party discipline on rebellious Hong Kongers is in danger of making them neither.Companies such as Cathay Pacific, 70 per cent of whose flights overfly the mainland, feel unable to resist China’s intolerance of any challenge to sovereignty. But it is humiliating — one point of the open obeisance that China requires — and will hurt elsewhere.The protests, which started in opposition to an ill-judged extradition law and have become a wider call for greater democracy and civil rights, are a turning point for businesses. Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” offered both freedom and access to China; in future, they may have to choose.“It is a very dangerous precedent, and shareholders may ask why they are kowtowing to Beijing,” says Willy Lam, a scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It is hard to proclaim a social conscience in one place and fail to stand up for staff in another.China and its state media have made little effort to distinguish between violence and peaceful protest. The Global Times, an offshoot of the People’s Daily, last week relayed calls for the big four Hong Kong auditors to “fire employees found to have the wrong stance”. Deloitte showed some pluck by specifying that “we respect the right of individuals to peacefully express their views”.Mr Li artfully straddled the line by placing advertisements in papers last week, signed “a Hong Kong citizen”. One included a line from a Tang dynasty poem about an empress who killed her children: “The melon of Huangtai cannot bear the picking again.”That could be taken either as an admonishment against violence, or as a jab at China; the latter interpretation made Mr Li popular among protesters. He can afford ambiguity: having taken control in 1979 of Hutchison, Swire’s old rival, he has hedged his bets. Nearly half of the revenues of CK Hutchison Holdings, another Li family holding company, come from Europe.It helps to be Chinese; history is an obstacle to defying China for groups such as Swire and HSBC, whose original prospectus promised a Hong Kong bank “run on sound Scottish banking principles”. A UK company that makes trouble is liable to be dismissed as colonialist, although rights such as freedom of assembly are in Hong Kong’s basic law.China’s government and media are also practised at encouraging outcries on social media against foreign slights, and consumer boycotts. Liu Wen, a Chinese model, resigned as a brand ambassador for Coach last week after it labelled Taiwan and Hong Kong as countries on T-shirts. “I love my motherland and resolutely safeguard China’s sovereignty!” she wrote.It is fair for companies to condemn violence and call for order and negotiations to settle the dispute. The outbreak of brutality among protesters at Hong Kong’s airport last week damaged the cause and increased the danger of China intervening by sending military police across the border.But businesses have collective strength. David Webb, a Hong Kong corporate governance activist, says Cathay could have “called China’s bluff” after it threatened to block flights over the mainland. That might have deterred foreign investment in Hong Kong and scared the wealthy Chinese who keep family offices there.Those with a big stake in Hong Kong’s future need to do more than fall meekly in line with China and become Beijing’s enforcers. John Slosar, Cathay chairman, was right to insist (before Merlin Swire, Swire’s chief executive, was reprimanded by China’s aviation regulator) that the airline “wouldn’t dream of telling [staff] what they have to think”.Hong Kong was always a balancing act and its equilibrium requires financial and corporate independence, married to China’s market. Its business leaders should learn from Mr Li.john.gapper@ft.com"
2;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2019-05-09T12:03:30Z;Tapestry jumps 12% as Coach parent launches $1bn buyback;Retail group reaffirmed its profit guidance for the full year;Tapestry, the parent company of upmarket brands Coach and Kate Spade, said it would buy back up to $1bn of shares, sending shares more than 12 per cent higher in pre-market trade.The announcement on Thursday came as the retail! group reaffirmed its profit guidance for the full year, and reported adjusted earnings in its third quarter that scraped ahead of Wall Street forecasts, but a fractionally slower pace of sales growth than expected.Victor Luis, chief executive, said the decision to approve the share buyback demonstrated “our confidence in driving long-term, sustainable growth and value”.At the top end of the range, the value of the buyback represents about 11 per cent of the company’s market capitalisation, which stood at $8.9bn at Wednesday’s closing price of $30.75.Tapestry shares jumped 12.2 per cent in pre-market trade today following the announcement, but ended yesterday’s session nursing an 8.9 per cent decline for the year. Three months ago, citing an “uncertain global environment” and “increasingly volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop”, the company cut its full-year earnings and sales forecasts. It maintained that guidance today, which is for earnings of $2.55 to $2.60 a diluted share and for sales to rise by low- to mid-single-digits.For the three months that ended on March 30, Tapestry reported net income of $117.4m, or 40 cents a diluted share, and a 16.4 per cent drop from last year. Adjusted earnings of 42 cents were down from 58 cents a year ago and were one cent ahead of the median forecast in a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Net sales of $1.33bn in the third quarter, although up from $1.32bn a year ago, missed market consensus by $50m.“We are pleased with our third-quarter performance, highlighted by increases in sales and gross margin on a constant currency basis in each of our three brands,” Mr Luis said. “Most notably, we again drove positive comps at Coach and generated a significant sequential comp improvement at Kate Spade with Nicola Glass’s new collection resonating with consumers globally.”Sales at Coach, the company’s main driver of gross profit, dipped $4m from a year ago to $965m. Kate Spade, best known for its handbags and whimsical, colourful designs, saw its net sales rise 4 per cent to $281m. Sales at its luxury shoemaker Stuart Weitzman rose 2 per cent to $85m.
3;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2019-02-07T16:48:18Z;Tapestry shares tumble after profit warning;Luxury goods group behind Kate Spade and Coach cuts outlook for 2019;Tapestry, the parent company behind Coach and Kate Spade, on Thursday joined the chorus of American companies that have sounded the alarm over the outlook for 2019 after it missed expectations for its latest quarterly results and issued a surprise profit warning.Shares in the US luxury group tumbled nearly 18 per cent in early trading as it slashed its full-year profit outlook. The decline puts the stock on track for its third worst day on record, with the loss surpassed only by drops in July 2012 and September 2001.The company said it now expects earnings for fiscal 2019 to come in at between $2.55 to $2.60 per diluted share — or 20 cents lower than the forecast it gave just three months ago. It also predicted sales for the year to increase by low-to-mid single-digit, compared to its previous guidance for a mid-single digit increase.In a statement, chief executive Victor Luis said the company was facing an “uncertain global environment and “an increasingly volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop” this year. He also cited costs related to its ongoing efforts to turnround Kate Spade — the handbag business it acquired for $2.4bn in 2017 — for the guidance cut.Apple, a host of chipmakers, FedEx, Colgate and Goodyear Tire & Rubber are among those that have stoked fears of a global slowdown amid signs that Chinese consumers are tightening their purse strings.Tapestry, which is competing with Capri, the company formerly known as Michael Kors, to build the American equivalent of a luxury conglomerate, is increasingly looking to China to boost growth.The company said its flagship Coach brand, whose leather bags and accessories generated nearly 70 per cent of total group sales during the quarter, was gaining “increased traction” with Chinese consumer. However it cautioned the rise in sales in China is being partially offset by the decline in Chinese tourist spending overseas.Meanwhile, Kate Spade, best known for its handbags and whimsical, colourful designs, continues to struggle. In a bid to restore an aura of exclusivity around the brand and regain pricing control, management has been cutting down on flash sales and pulling merchandise out of struggling department stores, where they are discounted heavily.The strategy has resulted in short term pain. Same-store sales at the brand fell 11 per cent during the fiscal second quarter that ended on December 29. The decline comes despite the relatively easy comparison provided by the prior year period, when the gauge fell 7 per cent.“Comparable store sales were below our expectations, impacted by the lack of distinctive newness in the final collections from the prior design team,” the company said of the underperformance at Kate Spade.Stuart Weitzman, the luxury shoemaker that Tapestry bought for more than half a billion dollars in 2015, saw modest improvements. While sales rose slightly, margins remained under pressure amid production delays and discounting. The unit — Tapestry’s smallest — saw operating profit halved to $11m for the quarter.Sales at Coach were the lone bright spot, with same-store sales at the division up 1 per cent.Overall, Tapestry took in $1.8bn in sales during the quarter, up from the $1.785bn reported in the prior year period but well below the $1.86bn the market was expecting.Net income, at $254.8m, was down nearly a third year-on-year and also undershot analysts forecast.
4;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2018-10-30T11:52:05Z;Coach and Kate Spade help drive Tapestry sales growth;;Growth at Tapestry’s flagship Coach brand and at Kate Spade helped lift sales at the US luxury group, offsetting a sluggish performance in its smaller Stuart Weitzman label.Net sales climbed 7 per cent in the group’s first fiscal quarter to $1.38bn, better than the $1.36bn expected by sales analysts according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profits also came in narrowly ahead of expectations, with adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents beating estimates for 45 cents. Reported net income was $122m, or 42 cents per diluted share, up from an $18m net loss a year ago.A push online buoyed both net and comparable store sales at Coach, both 4 per cent higher in the quarter than a year ago, with margins also ticking higher.While comparable store sales fell at Kate Spade, the label known for its colourful handbags and whimsical designs which Tapestry picked up 11 days into the year-ago quarter, expansion of the label since the acquisition helped lift total sales by 21 per cent to $325m. Operating margins also improved, recovering from a loss in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year to 13.8 per cent in the latest quarter.Delays in development and deliveries of product hit sales at Stuart Weitzman, the upmarket women’s shoe brand, however. Sales slipped 1 per cent year-on-year and the label dropped to a loss of £18m from a $9m profit a year ago.That should improve in the all-important holiday quarter, Tapestry said. Production and shipments had stabilised after investment in its manufacturing capacity and other processes, it said.Full-year diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $2.75-$2.80, helped by a lower projected tax rate, up from the previous guidance of $2.70-$2.80, the company added.“We remain well positioned to drive positive comparable store sales for Coach driven by a broad and compelling product assortment across price points, categories, usage occasions, channels and geographies augmented by an enhanced shopping experience, whether in stores or online,” said chief executive Victor Luis.“For Kate, we look forward to continued distribution growth, notably in international markets, and the arrival of Nicola [Glass]’s first collection in January. And, for Stuart Weitzman, where we’ve made significant progress in creating the infrastructure to support our evolution strategy, we remain on track to return to growth during the holiday season.”
5;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2018-08-14T12:30:25Z;Tapestry forecasts FY19 revenue ahead of market expectations;;Tapestry Group forecast revenue for the 2019 fiscal year ahead of market expectations, while its recently acquired Kate Spade brand provided a boost to its fourth-quarter results.Tapestry — which also counts Coach, known for its handbags and leatherwoods, and shoemaker Stuart Weitzman in its stable of brands — completed the $2.4bn acquisition of Kate Spade in July 2017. It said on Tuesday that its newest label delivered a set of fourth-quarter results that “exceeded our expectations from both a top- and bottom-line perspective”.The Kate Spade brand, known for its handbags and sleek, whimsical designs and bright colours, was drawn into the spotlight following the death of its founder, Kate Valentine, in June.Tapestry, formerly known as Coach, said fourth-quarter net sales rose 31 per cent on a reported basis to $1.48bn in the fourth quarter that ended June 30, boosted by Kate Spade’s contribution, which was not included in the year-ago result. That was ahead of the $1.34bn forecast by analysts in a poll by Thomson Reuters.Net income of $212m, or 73 cents a diluted share, was up about 40 per cent from a year ago, again thanks to the contribution of the Kate Spade business. The market expected earnings of 56 cents a share.Sales, general and administration expenses rose to represent 55 per cent of sales in the fourth quarter, up from 49.5 per cent 12 months ago.Tapestry’s Coach brand saw net sales rise 5 per cent from a year ago to $1.1bn in the June quarter, helped by “outperformance in North America”, while sales at Stuart Weitzman fell 17 per cent to $73m. Net sales at Kate Spade were $312m.For fiscal year 2019, Tapestry expects revenue to increase at a mid-single digit rate to between $6.1bn to $6.2bn, compared to $5.88bn in the 12 months ended June 30, 2018. This is above the median forecast among analysts of $6.08bn. The company projects earnings in the range of $2.70 to $2.80 a diluted share, up from $1.38 in 2018, but slightly lower than analysts’ forecasts for $2.83 a diluted share.In an effort to restore the exclusivity around the Kate Spade brand, Tapestry has cut back on online flash sales and pulled merchandise out of struggling department stores where goods were discounted heavily amid a broader push to regain greater direct control over international distribution of its brands, particularly in Asia. Tapestry announced it had entered into agreements to acquire Kate Spade’s operations in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia, as well as Stuart Weitzman’s business in Southern China.Victor Luis, chief executive, said the company was working towards a goal of generating double-digit growth in both operating income and earnings per share in fiscal 2020. “We will continue to harness the power of our multi-brand model, fuel innovation across brands, drive global growth with an emphasis on the Chinese consumer, and advance our digital and data analytics capabilities.”Tapestry shares were up 4.5 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday morning.
6;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2018-05-21T21:44:59Z;Stuart Weitzman’s creative director resigns;Parent Tapestry says Morelli’s behaviour fell short of standards at times;Accessories company Tapestry on Monday said the creative director of its footwear brand Stuart Weitzman, Giovanni Morelli, has resigned after a little more than a year in the role, noting that his behaviour fell short of the company’s “standards”.The New York-based company formerly known as Coach said while it “greatly admires” Mr Morelli’s creative talents, it is “committed to an environment where every individual feels respected and at times his behaviour fell short of these standards”.Mr Morelli, a veteran of the luxury accessories industry, joined the company last May taking over from founder Stuart Weitzman. He had previously worked at Prada, Marc Jacobs, Chloé and Spanish luxury accessories brand Loewe.The company behind Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman said it has begun the search for a new creative leader and said for now the design team will be under the direction of brand chief executive and president Eraldo Poletto.Mr Morelli’s departure marks the second high-profile exit from Stuart Weitzman over the past two months. Chief executive Wendy Kahn stepped down last month after less than two years at the helm and was replaced by former Ferragamo chief Mr Poletto.Tapestry shares, which are up nearly 2 per cent year-to-date, were little changed in after-hours trade.
7;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Not bagging it: Tapestry knocked by Kate Spade sales woes;;Attention all shoppers, on sale in the bargain bin today: Tapestry shares.Shares in the company formerly known as Coach sank as much as 14.5 per cent on Tuesday as another quarter of eroded sales margins and underwhelming sales growth raises questions over the group’s $2.4bn acquisition of handbag maker Kate Spade last year.In a bid to restore an aura of exclusivity around the Kate Spade brand and regain pricing control, management has been cutting down on flash sales and pulling merchandise out of struggling department stores, where they are discounted heavily.The strategy has resulted in short term pain. Same-store sales at Kate Spade fell 9 per cent in the three months to end of March. The decline follows drops of 7 per cent and 9 per cent during the previous two quarters.“The results at Kate (comps were worse against easier compares) show us that this integration story will likely take time,” said analysts at Jefferies.Stuart Weitzman, the luxury shoemaker that Tapestry bought for more than half a billion dollars in 2015, also struggled. Production delays and weak sales of old styles hit sales and margins, and the unit — Tapestry’s smallest — fell to an operating loss for the quarter.Sales at Tapestry’s flagship Coach brand were the lone bright spot. Same-store sales at the division, which generated more than 73 per cent of total group sales during the quarter, were up 3 per cent.Overall, Tapestry took in $1.32bn in sales during its fiscal third quarter, up from the $995.2m reported in the prior year period and ahead of the $1.31bn the market was expecting.Net income also came in at a better than expected $140.3m, or 48 cents per diluted share.However, Jefferies described the beat as “low quality”, as it was driven primarily by gains from US tax reforms, and noted that gross margin dropped to 68.7 per cent, compared to the 70.9 per cent reported in the prior year period.“We think valuation is high for a company that is not operating on all cylinders.”Tapestry’s decline on Tuesday marks its biggest intraday fall in nine months and knock the stock back down to a near 14 week low.
8;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2018-02-14T00:11:08Z;Coach AW18 show review: Stuart Vevers goes searching for signs;A mystical collection prompts a question: is the British designer off to Burberry?;"A couple of days before unveiling the Coach AW18 collection, the 44-year-old British designer Stuart Vevers walked me through his studio in the vast, newish headquarters of Tapestry (as Coach Inc is now known) at 10 Hudson Yards. Vevers was showing me the ready-to-wear studio, a space that simply didn’t exist when he arrived four years ago.Back then, it was “a couple of seamstresses in a broom cupboard”, he says of the ready-to-wear line’s beginnings. Today, the department is thriving, employing dozens of staff and producing four men’s and women’s collections a year (plus pre-collections). The Coach show has become a tentpole event in the New York Fashion Week schedule.Vevers’ efforts have paid off. The house reported a 3-per cent increase in sales in the last quarter, beating estimates and expectations; Tapestry has since raised its profit outlook for the year. Vevers has been instrumental in helping Coach get back on track. By consolidating the product, repositioning the brand and driving a youthful focus, he has steered the label away from its mall-mom discount-department reputation and placed it firmly in the modern fashion landscape.We wandered into the leather workshop — a longtime feature of a brand whose business, after all, is mostly bags. “This workshop is why I came here,” he said of the on-site studio. “It almost makes me feel nostalgic.”But why so, Mr Vevers? Are these twinging pangs of emotion tied to thoughts of going elsewhere? A large contemporary company in London, perhaps, that urgently needs a radical rethink and creative restructure? Maybe, a billion-dollar label such as Burberry which just so happens to need a new creative director? “I couldn’t possibly comment,” said Vevers.Nevertheless, I persisted. If he moved to Coach for a workshop, what might persuade him to move somewhere else? “Well, I would like to be nearer home . . . ” Like London, then?Sadly, that’s all I got. But in fashion, it was the kind of exchange that suggests a near confirmation. Vevers would be a great choice for Burberry. He works hard, he has an extraordinarily clear understanding of the commercial imperative that underpins a creative role; and he’s widely known as the nicest man in fashion. The worst you could say about him is that he’s a safe pair of hands. His Coach has been cuddly, playful and popular: could he bring more bite to Burberry?Enough. We must stop trying to second-guess the situation and concentrate on the show, where there were signs of a different nature. Coach AW18 was full of mystery and meaning: spiky leather tassels and feather adornments hung from long flowing dresses with bib-yoke details and long trailing sleeves. There were lots of crafty extras: natural embroideries, tooled leatherwork, whipstitching and animal prints. Vevers wanted the women to have a spectral appearance, and the looks were layered and long.After the fun, poppy, glitter bomb of his Keith Haring-inspired SS18 show, Vevers had drawn on a more gothic sensibility here. Although by gothic he meant the 1980s rather than Victoriana, and his Death Valley palette and purple hippie hues were all carefully tempered. “I was also thinking of Jackie [Kennedy] in Paris,” he said of the inspiration behind his fine-gauge knit polo necks and narrow leather jackets. Jackie, possibly the least gothic muse there could be, had helped him find the collection’s urban spirit. And long flowing silhouette, while free-spirited, had a more grown-up attitude about it. Having started to explore eveningwear in recent seasons, here were some very reasonable propositions.Four years after launching Coach’s ready-to-wear with a collection of overcoats, Vevers had dialled down the shearling this season. There were many coats but they were slimmer and more lightweight than usual. Chancing on a vintage find, he had decided to recreate a long, three-quarter-length Bonnie Cashin coat — soft as butter. Cashin, the late American designer beloved for her practical, sporty, athletic pieces, rose to prominence in the postwar landscape when women were becoming more independent. On the coat dangled a large red tab with her name emblazoned across it. Most designers just rip off other archives. It was nice to see the inspiration fully acknowledged. It was also a clever commercial move: by referencing a late great designer, Coach insinuates its own place in a broader cultural landscape — it becomes part of the all-American wardrobe.There were more collaborations as well. When Vevers discovered Chelsea Champlain, a Colorado mom who paints on vintage Coach bags and sells them on Etsy, he got in touch with her via Instagram and invited her to work on the show. She had been working in New York all week and her supernatural, spooky symbols turned up on leather jackets, prints and bags throughout the show. Sign of the times? You don’t get more 2018 than that.Follow the Financial Times Fashion Instagram account @financialtimesfashion"
9;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-09-12T23:45:43Z;Haring is caring: Coach SS18 review;Keith Haring, the beloved New York artist, sat at the heart of Stuart Vevers’ latest collection;"Calvin Klein had Andy Warhol. Coach had Keith Haring. Two giant American fashion houses placed two giants of American pop culture at the core of their SS18 collections.Both collaborations made a lot of sense. At Calvin Klein, where the Belgian designer Raf Simons has spent his first year exploring the codes of Americana and giving them a subversive twist, the Warhol prints— of Dennis Hopper, knives and car crashes — all added an element of danger to his design while exhorting in the brand’s commercial reach. Warhol did edgy with a shrewd commercial eye. So too at Calvin Klein — the Warhol denims were accessorised by handbags hung with bottles of the company’s iconic fragrances. Totally on brand. Warhol would have approved.Similarly, one imagines Haring would have been tickled by the homage at Coach where his cheeky line drawings were emblazoned all over bags, sweaters and leathers.The late New York artist’s brand of accessible optimism seemed a good fit for Coach, which is designed by Stuart Vevers. Haring’s drawings and paintings were designed to be seen on the street. He encouraged the proliferation of his works outside the art world. And that real people should engage with them. “It’s about participation,” he said of his Pop Shop when it opened in 1984.Vevers shares a similarly democratic attitude, albeit as part of a massive corporation, Coach Inc, which with the recent purchases of Stuart Weitzman shoes and Kate Spade bags is currently repositioning itself as a multi-brand proposition. His ambitions for Coach, however, have been to make it inclusive and unpretentious; partnering up with Step Up, the US charity promoting women’s education and empowerment, and sponsoring the recent Gurl Talk festival in London.As big brands go, Coach seems pretty woke and much of that is down to Vevers, who describes himself as “a working class boy from Doncaster” who makes sure he keeps things grounded in reality.Like Haring, his designs are fun, youthful, and easy on the eye. He doesn’t labour over concepts. He’s wary of clothes that “have been touched by the hand of design”. This season he had been thinking about the Coach girl (or boy) on a night out. Dressing Selena Gomez for the Met Ball had started him thinking; he had been inspired again when seeing a guest at a Coach event whip off their day dress to wear the silk slip lining underneath for evening. “I don’t really like the word eveningwear,” he said. “But this collection was about a bit of dress up.”And what does the Coach girl wear to party in? Shiny metallics, glossy leathers, glitter boots and layered slip dresses, which fall to the knee and are decorated with crystal embroideries, for starters. Many were worn with a mesh T-shirt, with a diamanté collars. Others had Haring heart and figure embroideries. She also wore a lot of denim. Mainly jeans.As a company that launched with outerwear, there were dozens of options: fuzzy shearlings, leather bombers and shimmery, silvery varsity jackets. Everything was spangly, or glossy or shone. There was silver glitter everywhere. The boys, meanwhile, wore slim trousers in suiting fabrics with Western shirts in silky pinks and leather blazers or cowboy jackets.The looks had attitude, but were more pretty than provocative. The girls looked like slightly punked-up prom queens: a bit intimidating at first, but really very sweet.Photographs: Catwalking"
10;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-08-15T16:53:07Z;Dick’s Sporting Goods lead retail shares lower;Corporate earnings from big companies paint mixed picture of US retail and sales online;A new crop of earnings data on Tuesday painted a mixed picture of the US retail landscape, revealing who is withstanding the rise of ecommerce and who is suffering from changing shopping patterns. Dick’s Sporting Goods and Coach were the latest to reveal disappointing results, but TJX Cos and Home Depot reported more benign second quarter figures, on the same day that the government’s latest monthly retail sales data showed the American consumer remains healthy overall.US retail sales rose in July by the most in seven months — 0.6 per cent over June compared to Wall Street expectations of 0.3 per cent. Sales were led by a 1.3 per cent increase in “nonstore retailers”, reflecting the shift online. Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Pittsburgh-based sports store, sharply lowered its earnings and sales outlook on Tuesday, sending shares tumbling more than 20 per cent and poised for their steepest one-day decline on record. While athleisure, a term used to describe people’s habit of wearing workout gear outside of the gym, had helped sports retailers buck some of the broader industry pain, Dick’s Sporting Goods and rival The Sports Authority have had a tough time as competition heats up from online retailers. “Disruption in the space is profound,” said Jim Duffy, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, noting that Dick’s Sporting Goods is losing control of pricing, undermining profits. The company warned that comparable sales could decline in the low single digits or stay flat this year, where previously it had expected them to rise by 1 to 3 per cent. Edward Stack, chief executive, said the company plans to spend more on marketing to “aggressively protect” market share. Coach also warned its sales in the current fiscal year may come in below Wall Street expectations, sending shares in the the luxury handbag and accessories maker down 14 per cent in lunchtime trading in New York. Sales have been hit by steep discounting in department stores where Coach generated a good chunk of its revenue, as well as shifting consumer preference for clothing and accessories that do not have conspicuous labels or logos. Retailers perceived to be less vulnerable to ecommerce defied the gloom. TJX Cos reported that same-store sales grew more than expected in the second quarter, as the discount retailer behind stores like TJ Maxx and Marshalls lured more customers to its stores. The chain, which offers designer goods at a fraction of the cost, lifted its full-year earnings outlook and said net sales rose 6 per cent to $8.4bn, beating Wall Street expectations of $8.3bn. TJX is “benefiting from department store closings”, said Paul Lejuez, analyst at Citi, as its business model “remains fairly well-insulated from the online threat”. Home Depot also bucked the malaise, unveiling quarterly results that beat analyst estimates and raising its sales forecast for the fiscal year. The biggest US home improvement retailer is benefiting from a robust US housing market, while some of its products, such as lumber, tend to be much less susceptible to competition from the likes of Amazon.

Coach said it reckons the gains would be driven by the inclusion of Kate Spade with organic sales rising in the “low-single digit” range.The median Wall Street estimate is for fiscal 2018 sales was $5.92bn, according to Bloomberg data.In the fiscal quarter to July 1, Coach said that its sales slipped to $1.13bn from $1.15bn. However, excluding the impact of an extra week in the previous year’s quarter, revenues would have risen 6 per cent. Net profit climbed to $152m from $82m. On an adjusted basis that excludes certain items, earnings per share were 50 cents.Analysts had forecast sales of $1.15bn and adjusted net income or 49 cents a share.Coach shares, up by more than a third since the start of the year, fell as much as 7.1 per cent in pre-market trading. The stock hit a record high of $79.90 in 2012. It closed at $47.92 on Monday.Like rival Michael Kors, Coach has had a tough run in recent years as its aura of exclusivity has been dented by the ubiquity of its products. Sales have also been hit by steep discounting in department stores where it generated a good chunk of its revenue as well as shifting consumer preference for clothing and accessories that don’t have conspicuous labels or logos.Under Victor Luis, who took over as chief executive in 2014, Coach moved to pull back on department store distribution in order to regain more pricing control over its products. Mr Luis has also sought to drive growth through acquisitions. He struck his first major deal in 2015 when Coach beat competition from rival retailers to acquire women’s luxury shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for $574m to bolster its footwear offering.Earlier this year, it agreed to buy rival Kate Spade for $2.4bn in its boldest bet yet to diversify the business away from its namesake brand.
12;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-06-07T04:52:50Z;Global investors develop taste for US high-yield corporate bonds;Pushed from stocks and negatively yielding sovereign debt, traders start to like junk;The risk premium investors demand to hold the highest quality US junk bonds has narrowed to its lowest level in almost a decade as a reinvigorated reach for yield drives investors into the asset class. The so-called spread on double-B rated US corporate debt this week slid to its lowest level since July 2007, with the average yield on bonds in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s index trading 229 basis points above benchmark Treasuries. The decline has been driven by central bank stimulus in Europe and Japan, which has pushed investors across the globe out of their traditional asset classes and into riskier parts of the markets, several investors said.That has manifested itself acutely in double-B rated debt, which sits just below investment grade and has so far outperformed weaker single-B rated credit this year, according to separate data from Bloomberg Barclays. “There is a persistent reach for yield,” said John McClain, a portfolio manager with asset manager Diamond Hill. “Your traditional investment-grade buyers, insurance companies and pension funds continue to dive down to the double-B rated buckets.”Portfolio managers who invest in high-quality US corporate debt have enjoyed a wave of fresh capital commitments, driving them into riskier corporate bonds as well as longer-dated debt to achieve return targets. Analysts with Goldman Sachs note that investment-grade bond funds have had their best five months of inflows on record, attracting $59bn so far this year. High-yield bond funds have recorded outflows over the same period. The shift into US corporate credit, as more than $10tn of debt around the world trades with a yield below zero, accompanies record-high equity valuations, low volatility and a Federal Reserve that is expected to only gradually normalise policy, investors added.“Given that Treasury yields have moved lower and corresponding spreads in the investment-grade universe have moved lower, many global investors . . . may be looking at double-B rated corporate bonds,” said Jon Duensing, deputy chief investment officer of Amundi Smith Breeden.Mr Duensing added that demand was also being driven by European high-yield accounts that had been crowded out of their market as the European Central Bank continues its bond-buying programme. “The non-US investor is the marginal bid to the US market,” he added.The demand for higher-paying obligations was emphasised by a $1bn bond sale from Coach on Tuesday, which is rated triple-B minus by S&P — the lowest investment-grade rating — and triple-B by both Moody’s and Fitch. Fitch has said it anticipates it will downgrade Coach’s rating one notch once its takeover of Kate Spade is completed. The $1bn borrowing, alongside additional term loans, are set to finance Coach’s buyout of the rival handbag maker.Despite unease over the retail sector, bankers underwriting the sale counted orders in excess of $5bn for the transaction, according to two investors briefed on the sale. The handbag retailer priced new five-year debt 140bp above the yield on similarly maturing Treasuries, or at 3.106 per cent. That was more than 20bp below initial price talk marketed to investors, and just slightly above the average double-B rated corporate bond with a comparable maturity, according to Merrill Lynch.“The market feels overvalued from a historical standpoint,” said Mr McClain. “You have to pick and choose your credits wisely right now.”
13;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-05-09T15:37:46Z;Coach warned of potential downgrade after Kate Spade buy – Fitch;;Rating agency Fitch warned on Tuesday that it may downgrade US handbag and accessories maker Coach to the bottom rung of the investment-grade credit spectrum after it completes its takeover of Kate Spade.Credit analysts with the rating agency said the $2.4bn acquisition announced on Monday, which includes $2.1bn of new loans and bonds to fund the deal, would increase Coach’s indebtedness and warned the transaction had “integration risk”.David Silverman, an analyst with Fitch, said he envisioned a one-notch downgrade to triple-B minus, the lowest investment-grade credit rating. Earlier this year, rating agency Moody’s said it was possible Coach could complete a debt-funded takeover of Kate Spade and retain its investment-grade appraisal. Moody’s on Tuesday said it had put Coach’s Baa2 rating on review for a cut.Coach has turned the page on a difficult few years, when the luxury goods market broadly slowed. The company’s hiring of Stuart Vevers as executive creative director from Loewe, a Spanish handbag maker owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has revitalised the Coach brand. New products have flooded stores, including a recent collaboration with Rodarte, which this paper described as selling “extraordinary, delicate, red-carpet worthy dresses and gowns”.Those goods have so far been met by warm consumer interest, despite the company’s decision to cut discounts and pull its goods from some wholesale distributors. Comparable-store sales in North America, a key metric scrutinised in the retail industry, rose 3 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to April 1.

In announcing the deal on Monday, Coach hinted it could do smaller, bolt-on acquisitions as it continues to diversify away from its namesake brand and transition into a multi-brand fashion conglomerate.“In the short term, you could definitely say that we’re not going to be looking at any major acquisitions,” said chief executive Victor Luis. “Certainly, I think . . . we have the financial flexibility to look at other smaller acquisitions in the size of the Stuart Weitzman [deal] or smaller.”Mr Luis made his comments after revealing an agreement to buy Kate Spade for $18.50 per share in cash, following months of rumoured talks. The offer represents a 9 per cent premium to Kate Spade’s closing price on Friday and a 27.5 per cent premium to the undisturbed price of the stock on December 27 2016, the last trading day before news that the company was exploring a sale.Like rival Michael Kors, Coach has had experienced difficult trading in recent years. Its aura of exclusivity became dented by the ubiquitousness of its products and sales were hit by steep discounting in department stores, where it generates a sizeable chunk of its revenue. A shift in consumer preference for clothing and accessories that do not carry conspicuous labels or logos has also weighed on sales.Since taking over the top job at Coach in 2014, Mr Luis has cut back on department store distribution in order to regain more control over product pricing. He has also sought to drive growth through acquisitions.Mr Luis struck his first major deal in 2015 when Coach beat competition from rivals to acquire women’s luxury shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for $574m to bolster its footwear offering.More recently the company made a takeover approach for Burberry, the UK’s biggest luxury goods retailer. The efforts were rebuffed and since then Coach has been a rumoured suitor for other companies including shoe maker Jimmy Choo.Despite the abundance of potential acquisition targets in the sector, Mr Luis said Coach had pursued Kate Spade in part because of the brand’s loyal following among younger shoppers.Mr Luis added that “60 per cent of Kate Spade consumers are millennials . . . and that’s leading in our competitive set here in the US”.Analysts at HSBC said the deal “makes tremendous sense” for Coach.“While M&A is not often seen positively by equity markets in luxury, we believe that for Coach it is different, essentially because acquisitions would dilute the mono-brand risk and would lower the dependency on Coach brand outlets.”Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningJefferies analysts said: “Since their acquisition of Stuart Weitzman, Coach has done a solid job in leveraging the team’s technical expertise and effecting a seamless transition of Stuart Weitzman under new ownership.“Coach plans to follow a similar playbook with Kate, by running the brand independently with no change to creative direction, but leveraging common infrastructure and corporate functions.”Investors appeared to agree, sending shares in Coach up 4.8 per cent to $44.70 in midday trading.Coach said it expects the deal, which is set to close in the third quarter this year, to generate roughly $50m in cost savings within three years of closing. The transaction will be funded through a combination of cash and debt.
15;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-05-08T16:55:23Z;Coach/Kate Spade: in the bag;The vision of a New York-centric fashion house is taking shape;The price war among US retailers has been a boon for savvy shoppers. It has created an opportunity for corporate buyers, too. Kate Spade announced its long-expected sale to Coach on Monday. The deal itself has a red tag attached.Coach, which is aggressively trying to capitalise on the tumult by building what it describes as the first New York-centric fashion house, will pay $2.4bn for Kate. The $18.50 a share purchase price amounts to a 27.5 per cent premium to the undisturbed price in December last year. But just two months ago Kate shares traded as high as $24. Hedge funds anticipated a level of demand for Kate that simply did not materialise.It is not hard to see why. The hip but affordable purveyor of handbags and accessories has been undermanaged since it was created from the remains of Fifth & Pacific. Same-store sales in 2016 rose 9 per cent, a slowdown from 14 per cent a year ago. Coach paid only 9.4 times cash flow, against an average for recent deals in the luxury sector of 14 times. The price becomes even thinner when Kate’s tax losses (worth about $1 per share) and $50m a year in cost savings are included.Selling at such a knockdown price reveals much about the capabilities of its management team. And although Kate is four times the size of shoemaker Stuart Weitzman, which Coach acquired in 2015, it should be digestible for a company whose equity market value is $12bn. Even after paying in cash, debt will only be twice operating cash flow. Coach shares rose 5 per cent after the announcement.Keep up to date on the latest news and insight on deals every weekday morningUnsurprisingly, given the low cost of debt, the deal is expected to add to earnings per share. It also diversifies risk by adding another brand to the stable. Coach is at a relatively early stage in its career as a roll-up, though it has also been linked to Burberry and Jimmy Choo. It has yet to prove it can make acquisitions in challenged sectors work. But paying a reasonable price is certainly a sensible place to start.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

18;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-05-02T13:42:45Z;Bag retailer Coach climbs as less discounting pays off;;A move by US handbag retailer Coach to pull its products out of more than 250 department stores last summer is paying off.The $11bn retailer, whose aura of exclusivity has in recent years been dented by the ubiquitousness of its products, saw its shares jump by the most in 15 months on Tuesday as lower inventory in mid-tier department stores translated into more full-priced sales at its own stores.Same-store sales for North America – Coach’s biggest market – were up 3 per cent during the fiscal third quarter, which ended on April 1. The rise marks the fourth straight quarter of like-for-like sales gain for the company and tops the 1.4 per cent increase the market was expecting.Shares in Coach, up more than 10 per cent so far this year, climbed as much as 9.1 per cent in early trading in New York – its biggest one day jump since January 2016.The gain underscores Coach’s efforts to lessen its dependence on department stores for its sales and regain more pricing control over its products. As the likes of Macy’s struggled with weak traffic and online competition, many have resorted to aggressive storewide promotions and coupons. In the process, consumers have become conditioned to not paying full-priced for goods – not even for so-called luxury items.While gross margin grew 1.9 percentage points 70.9 per cent during the quarter from the year ago period, Coach’s “shrinking to grow” strategy is not without its costs.Revenue for the period fell 3.7 per cent to $995.2m as department store sales in North America dropped 40 per cent following the pullback. The market was expecting a smaller decline to $1.02bn.Net income rose nearly 8 per cent however to $122m, or 43 cents per diluted share. Adjusted for one-off items, net income came in at $130m, or 46 cents per diluted share, ahead of forecasts for $125.9m or 44 cents a share.“Our solid performance this quarter was very much in line with our expectations and our strategic initiatives,” said chief executive Victor Luis. “…despite our deliberate pullback in the North America wholesale channel and the impact of calendar shifts, we delivered earnings growth.”
19;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-02-15T01:09:59Z;Coach AW17, New York: where optimism never goes out of style;Stuart Vevers celebrated his third successful year at the US brand with a playful, positive collection;Stuart Vevers is celebrating his third year with Coach. It does not sound like a long time, but in the current fashion landscape, his tenure, alongside Coach chief executive Victor Luis seems about as enduring as Warren Beatty and Annette Bening’s marriage. Impressive.Under the group’s transformation plan, the company has posted consecutive quarters of growth since April 2016, launched a fully operational ready-to-wear line for men and women and opened a handful of new flagship stores across Europe (Milan opened last week). It has also fully captured the zeitgeist with a bestselling dinosaur, Rexy, who has lately been positioning himself across the bosoms of Hollywood’s elite — Winona Ryder, Julia Roberts, Chloé Moretz, James Franco, Selena Gomez et al. Vevers first fashioned the motif as an unofficial mascot in early 2015: for AW17, he depicted Rexy dragging the Coach logo forwards. The significance was only slightly tongue in cheek.Nevertheless, looking at the chaos facing other brands who have attempted radical reconstruction under a new chief executive team only to fall foul at the first post (see Stefan Larsson’s rapid exit from Ralph Lauren earlier this month), Coach’s successes have set a precedent in an industry grappling to define the contemporary fashion brand. Luis and Vevers understand each other’s strengths and complement each other. Vevers says that Luis has never come to the studio to look at a collection prior to a show. He lets him be. How many other chief executives are so laissez-faire? Not many.At a preview the day before his show, the 43-year-old Yorkshireman reflected on how quickly his creative vision for Coach came together.He was sitting on the tenth floor of the brand’s vast new Manhattan headquarters. “I think a huge amount of our success is due to luck,” he said. “I just remember walking into our first presentation one bitterly cold New York day three years ago, and seeing the shearling coats we had done and knowing that something about them was absolutely right. The signatures all made sense very early on. That,” he added, “and the fact I’ve got a certain amount of experience with brands. So, I know what needs to be done.”For AW17, Vevers combined men’s and womenswear for the first time. But rather than present anything vastly different, he used the collection to take a step back to re-examine his brand signatures. “I’m pulling ideas from my archive,” he said as he brushed past rails of ragged shearling jackets, eiderdown puffas and prairie-print florals. He was only part joking. Vevers realises that creative self-reference after so few seasons sounds a bit daft. But so does he understand that most successful modern fashion houses in recent years have been built on core codes and a consistent vision: see Saint Laurent and Gucci as examples. Vevers’ blend of preppy, fun, folksy Americana, optimism and open-road idealism has served him well and he is not about to change that.On a more technical level, Vevers had worked hard to refine those themes. His super saturated colour palette is brilliantly done, he has worked hard on making his shearlings pleasingly light. Shearling has been a huge feature of the show this season and Vever’s influence in building that market is clear. “Shearling has a different attitude to fur,” he said of its appeal. “It’s younger, it’s more comforting. It’s fun.”There were changes also. For AW17, the coats had more vintage touches, a raggedy raw collar or an embroidered “craft” motif. The Paper Moon dresses were longer and fuller through the body. New bags were brass-framed, more structured, and paired with mini charm bags that slung around the neck. The older bestselling Rogue was miniaturised and embossed with cherries and cars. Meanwhile, the Rexy intarsia knit was joined by a new friend, the Fisher-Price duck sweater. Vevers had drawn on other American influences also: there were 80s hip-hop jackets and oversized baseball hats in shearling, which perched atop the head old-skool style.Vevers has a fairly straightforward sense of playfulness and his designs are not always chic. The shearling-lined sandals with basketball-boot toe and stacked rubber soles would not work for everyone.Neither will everyone adore the cutesy comic insignias. But crucially, his designs make you smile. His brand of happy is infectious. It is totally unsnobby. And in this climate, that kind of positivity is worth its weight in gold.Photographs: Catwalking.com
20;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2017-01-31T12:28:58Z;Coach tweaks sales growth outlook as strong dollar takes a bite;;Fashion retailer Coach Inc said it was lowering its full-year outlook for revenue growth due to the impact of a strengthening US dollar, with quarterly profits and sales coming largely as expected as it continues efforts to burnish its luxury image by reducing discounts and pulling out of some locations.The company said that during the three-month period ending December 31, revenues were $1.32bn, a 4 per cent boost over the same quarter a year earlier and in line with predictions from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Coach said that sales growth was held back during the quarter – its second quarter of fiscal 2017 – by its continued push to “elevate” its brand in its critical North American market with a reduction in promotional activity and closures in some locations. Net income clocked in at $200m, with earnings per share of 71 cents, slightly undershooting expectations for $208.6m in profit and 73.6 cents per diluted share.During the all-important holiday shopping season, Coach said that comparable sales rose about 4 per cent at its brick and mortar locations in North America.While the company is standing behind its previous forecast for double-digit net income and earnings per share growth over the full fiscal 2017, it said that it was now lowering downward its projections for revenue growth, from its previous forecast of low-to-mid single digits to low single digits, blaming “the significant strengthening of the US dollar”.Coach chief executive Victor Luis said in a statement that the retail environment is “volatile and uncertain” but nevertheless “our strategic vision for our brands and our company remains clear.”“Importantly, we are committed to driving relevance for our brands, while building a nimble and scalable business model to support long-term, sustainable growth for Coach,” he added.The company’s shares, which have fallen more than 3 per cent over the past 12 months, are up nearly 2 per cent in pre-market trading.
21;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-12-05T17:25:54Z;Burberry: not Coach class;The luxury goods retailer decided that life with its US rival was not fashionable;"Articles on Burberry once fretted over the wrong kind of customer: reality TV stars, say, or “label-conscious football hooligans”. In fashion terms, aeons have passed since then. Burberry has been decidedly luxurious for a while, and keeps a tight grip on its brand, such as by curtailing licences in Japan. News has broken of another unwanted buyer being rebuffed. US rival Coach made multiple approaches in recent months, all spurned.Neither company has enjoyed easy times recently. Both suffered from a sharp slowdown in luxury spending from a couple of years ago, driven by a state-led clampdown in China. Otherwise their problems are more idiosyncratic. Burberry’s centre on efficiency. Sales in the most recent 12 months are up 25 per cent on 2013, while operating profits are flat. Investors griped about whether chief executive Christopher Bailey, a genius at designing clothes, had the same flair for fashioning a profit. They cheered news of an external appointee taking the chief executive role from next year. Burberry’s reforms concern not the brand but nitty-gritty measures to squeeze more out of it, such as winnowing down the product line and extracting more from of each store. Why not add a handbag or beard oil to that trenchcoat purchase?Coach’s “Transformation Plan” since 2013 has a fair amount of grit, too, such as closing laggard stores. But it suffered more of an image problem, only recently remedied through the efforts of a new designer. In fashion’s hierarchy, Burberry flirts with “aspirational”; Coach claims the dowdier category of “accessible”.Currency moves mask a difficult period for Burberry. In October half-year revenues were reported to be up 5 per cent in devalued pounds, down 4 per cent like for like. But this is a transition, with one-off factors such as the expiry of those Japanese licences. UBS expects like-for-like sales growth of 2 per cent in 2017 and 4 per cent after.The terms of Coach’s overtures are not known. Despite advantages — the strong dollar and their US base, where Burberry has been weak — it is easy to see why the answer was “no”. It is risky for a company to put so much into preserving its brand, only to gamble it in a tie-up with another, supposedly more downmarket. It would also be devastating for morale.Each, separately, has made headway in tough global conditions. Each should continue as they are.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
22;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-12-04T17:05:13Z;Burberry spurned takeover approaches from bigger US rival Coach;A deal would have created a global fashion group with a market value above $20bn;Burberry, the UK’s biggest luxury goods retailer, rejected multiple takeover overtures from US fashion accessories group Coach in recent months, according to people briefed on the matter.A deal would have created a group with a market value above $20bn, bringing together the US company’s leather goods, handbags and shoemaker Stuart Weitzman with Burberry’s trademark luxury outerwear and global retail footprint.Talks are no longer active between the companies and that is not expected to change anytime soon after Burberry saw off the interest from its larger rival, these people added. Burberry and Coach declined to comment.The Coach proposals, which peaked sometime after the summer, were informal and envisaged a cash-and-stock takeover of Burberry. It was unclear at what premium they were made or if Burberry ever engaged in serious talks with the US company.One of the people following the process closely said Coach might have been more successful if had it acted on its interest in the British company earlier this year.Burberry shares struggled in the first half of 2016, under pressure from a slowdown in luxury demand from Asia and questions over its leadership. The weakness in sterling after the UK’s vote to exit the EU has also hurt the value of its share price, though it has benefited from an exchange rate boost to its sales in dollars and euros. Shares in the British fashion group have climbed a third since hitting their lowest level in mid-June to reach £14.11. The company has a market value of £6.2bn and has no debt. In July, Burberry said Marco Gobbetti, head of French luxury brand Céline, would become chief executive at the start of next year, replacing Christopher Bailey from the role he held since May 2014. Mr Bailey will remain the company’s chief designer and will add a new role of president when Mr Gobbetti begins.Its finance director Carol Fairweather was also replaced by Julie Brown, who joined from Smith & Nephew, the UK medical device company. In September, Burberry unveiled a “see now, buy now” at London Fashion Week that allows consumers to buy products immediately after they are shown on the runway.In an interview with the Financial Times last week, Victor Luis, chief executive of Coach, and designer Stuart Vevers declined to comment on rumours of its interest in Burberry.However, the duo have been looking to expand Coach’s focus on outerwear, its European and developing market footprint and diversify its brands.Mr Luis took over as chief executive of Coach in 2014 and helped bring the company back to sales growth after streamlining the business and promoting the brand’s status. Last year, Coach beat competition from rival retailers to acquire women’s luxury shoemaker Stuart Weitzman for $574m to bolster its footwear offering.Shares in Coach have climbed 11 per cent since the start of the year, taking its market capitalisation to $10.1bn. Coach was working with three investment banks including independent advisory group Evercore Partners on the situation. Burberry’s advisers included the London-based advisory firm Robey Warshaw.
23;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-12-01T07:00:45Z;How Coach Inc got its roar back;The US brand’s chief executive Victor Luis and designer Stuart Vevers discuss the house’s transformation;"If the relationship between a brand chief executive and its creative director is an artful choreography, then Coach’s Victor Luis and designer Stuart Vevers are currently performing quite the pas de deux.When Luis was announced as the chief executive at Coach, in 2013, it’s currency was mediocre, its share price nosediving and its reputation all too closely aligned with the mid-market, mall Mom shoppers of suburban America. It was “doing over $4 billion a year,” says Luis in his smooth, lugubrious style from his office in New York, and was a beloved US brand (at least domestically) but it needed a big shake up.Luis initiated a Transformation Plan. His objectives: to streamline the Coach infrastructure (closing underperforming stores, re-evaluating its wholesale distribution, realigning its inventory and re-examining its pricing), and promote the brand’s status. He wanted Coach to be “a very viable, credible fashion source”.The designer put in charge of this makeover was Stuart Vevers, a 43-year-old Yorkshireman who had previously held creative director roles at Loewe and Mulberry. While Luis set about untangling Coach’s flabby distribution and wholesale dependencies, Vevers worked on its image. He launched a ready-to-wear line, Coach 1941, for men and women, in September 2014 and a debut catwalk show the following year.Vevers’ vision for Coach has been big and bold. And people have liked it. In April 2016, the brand announced its first return to growth for three years. That growth has continued to rise in the following two quarters. And while the plan is very much ongoing (it still has major structural weaknesses, especially in its domestic retail market) there’s a new fashionability about the brand that can’t be ignored. Kate Moss, Julia Roberts and James Franco wear it; Winona Ryder and her 12-year-old Stranger Things co-star Millie Bobby Brown sat front row at the spring show; Rexy, the brand’s dinosaur mascot first conceived as a bag charm for the AW15 collection, has become a social media star, and fashion magazines are putting Coach on their covers.In recent weeks, the brand has opened its biggest stores to date; a Coach House on Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, and another on Regent Street, London, multi-storeyed pieces of architecture smack in the centre of the retail world.“This is truly an amazing team effort,” says Luis of the brand’s resurgence. “And I get a lot of satisfaction from the fact we’re pretty much doing what we said we were going to do. The plan has not been to surprise by leaps and bounds, the plan has been to go steady, execute. We knew that we had a lot of negative impressions we needed to remove, which we’ve been working on, but crucially we’ve created a brand that people at Coach, and our consumers, feel better about than we did a few years ago. And by far the most important ingredient in the mix, and perhaps the most significant decision I made, was the recruitment and hiring of Stuart as the person to take us forward.”Certainly Vevers, who combines his experience with a savvy instinct for a commercial hit, has been a good fit for Coach, where he has drawn on his love of Americana to offer a new take on luxury. “I like that while it [Coach] has a great heritage, it’s younger than a lot of the European luxury brands,” he says.Vevers is sitting on a big brown sofa in the basement of the Regent Street store. Before him, a glass table displays a pink, intarsia-knit Rexy sweater; beside him hang racks of shearling overcoats, patched varsity jackets and printed prairie dresses. His cross-body satchels and sorority-style “Rogue” bags in bright eye-catching colours line the shelves. The product is preppy, unpretentious and optimistic.“A big part of the appeal of working here,” he says, “was that I could authentically reference American style and think about what luxury is going to mean to the next generation.” Vevers has a no-nonsense approach to design. Things are either “Straight to Production, Cancelled or Rejected”. There’s no room for maybes. “And very few things are Straight to Production.”Sometimes colleagues can find his northern decisiveness brusque, but he thinks of it as straightforwardness. “My fashion philosophy, which I learnt while working with [British designer] Luella Bartley, is: ‘Work hard and be nice to people.’”It’s an attitude Luis admires also. “Stuart is, like myself, from very humble roots. We believe in hard work, and a much more approachable and democratic view of luxury.”Democratic luxury is the talk of the industry and, Vevers argues, Coach is well placed to deliver it. “There used to be rules of what luxury was — formal, an investment — and they’re just disappearing,” he says. “A sneaker or a sweatshirt can be luxury today. The next generation doesn’t have the same point of view on status as before. Today, it’s about a shared culture; knowing what other people are looking at and identifying with other people through certain things. Which is why I try and include these things in my collections, whether it’s the Rexy key chain or a sweater inspired by the little boy in The Shining. It helps make people feel like they’re part of a gang.” It helps also, that Coach isn’t strictly a luxury label: “Coach isn’t about some fantasy jet-set lifestyle,” he continues. “It’s really grounded in reality. The Coach girl works and she expects her bag to work just as hard.” It’s cheaper, too. As Luis points out: “if you take the Rogue bag, at $795, and compare that with a handbag by a traditional European brand, you’d be looking at three to four times the price.” Coach is making big efforts to leverage its handbags. As of October, bags at $400 and more represented 50 per cent of total handbag sales in their North American retail stores. But the brand isn’t just jacking up the prices. In most instances, “elevating the product” has meant introducing new categories, and then growing them apace.“We want to maintain growth in our core handbag business [currently 53 per cent of sales], but we want to grow the others faster,” says Luis. “Handbags and accessories are a $41bn opportunity globally in the premium space. And footwear is $27 to $28bn. So we’re buying our footwear licence back and developing it [and the Stuart Weitzman brand will leverage this platform to develop Coach as well].” He also plans to exploit the $11bn opportunity he sees in outerwear (or coats).And that’s not all: “Then, I would say, we want to balance our geographic footprint by having a higher growth in Europe and then in developing markets; the Middle East, India, South America, and I would say Russia. And lastly, and this is the highest part of our strategy, is to balance our dependence on one brand.”A focus on outerwear. An increased European footprint. And brand diversification. It sounds as though Luis might be making overtures towards a certain British manufacturer of gabardine trenches.Would Luis care to discuss rumours of a possible buy out or merger with Burberry? “My team would say we never comment on rumours and speculation,” says Luis. “And I wouldn’t add any more than that.” Vevers remains similarly tight-lipped when asked. For now, we’ll have to wait and see. Even Rexy’s keeping schtum.Main photograph: Mark Hartman"
24;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-09-14T21:02:57Z;Coach slips on ‘unhealthy manner’ warning;US stocks retreat as energy sector falls on oil price decline;Coach shares slipped on Wednesday after an investment bank warned that the handbag maker’s sales turnround was achieved in an “unhealthy manner”.The New York-based group said last month that like-for-like sales for its North American Coach brand increased 2 per cent in the quarter to July 2. That marked the first increase since the quarter that ended in March 2013, according to Bloomberg data.The improving sales performance in the North American unit, Coach’s largest by revenue, had helped lift Coach shares by more than 10 per cent this year as of Tuesday’s close.However, the recovery had come as promotional activity at Coach’s lower priced outlets had steadily increased, said Kimberly Greenberger, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.The greater use of promotions at the outlet stores had overshadowed a “genuine” turnround in Coach’s North American full-price unit and also eaten into profit margins, Ms Greenberger said.Indeed, the North American unit’s gross profit margin fell to 61.7 per cent in financial 2016, from 63.8 per cent in 2015, and 64.3 per cent in 2014, according to regulatory filings.Ms Greenberger on Wednesday cut her rating on the group to “underweight” from “equal weight”. The shares dropped as much as 4.8 per cent to $34.55 but recovered to a decline of 2.3 per cent to $35.47 at the close of trading.Elsewhere, Macy’s shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $35.21 after analysts at Citigroup upgraded the department store to “buy” from “neutral” while maintaining their $44 price target.While noting that department stores continue to face structural challenges, such as competition from ecommerce, operating too many physical stores and selling products that can be bought elsewhere, the analysts argue that Macy’s “is doing the right things for the business, which should alleviate pressures in the medium term”.Macy’s recent decision to shutter 100 stores that were cash flow positive, but where the property value exceeded the value as a retail store, helped drive some of the bullishness on the stock.“We continue to believe many retailers, and department stores specifically, have too many stores, which magnifies the challenges,” said Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citi. “Importantly, Macy’s ‘gets it’ and is rationalising its store fleet much faster than most, putting them in a much better position to compete.”Meanwhile, shares in Vitae Pharmaceuticals, a drugmaker focused on medicines for skin conditions, jumped 157.4 per cent to $20.85 after Botox maker Allergan said it would acquire the company for about $639m.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,125.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 18,034.8, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4 per cent to 5,173.8.The technology sector led the way higher, climbing 0.6 per cent, as shares in Apple rallied 3.5 per cent to $111.77.On the other end of the spectrum, the energy sector slipped 1.2 per cent as the price of US crude oil dropped 2.9 per cent on continuing concerns over the global supply glut.
25;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-07-18T20:23:36Z;Battered Groupon shares rally after analyst turns bullish;Deal site buoyant alongside fashion brand Coach, but toy maker Hasbro suffers Star Wars angst;The shares of Groupon, the deals website that has struggled in recent years with concerns about its profitability, rallied on Monday on the back of a bullish broker note.Groupon’s stock price has collapsed by about 80 per cent since its initial public offering in November 2011, which at the time was the biggest IPO since search group Google went public in 2004, as the company’s failure to consistently generate a profit has disappointed investors.The company has in the past nine months promoted Rich Williams to chief executive officer from chief operating officer, and hired a new chief financial officer in the hopes of turning the tide.Management is now “quickly narrowing its product and regional focus to the categories where it can be successful, while deploying marketing dollars to drive growth in North America local deals”, said Samuel Kemp, an analyst at Piper Jaffray.Mr Kemp, who upgraded his rating on the company to “overweight”, said Groupon might be able to drive its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation to about 20 per cent above Wall Street’s expectations in 2018.“Groupon excels at the local deal and, we believe, with the new [management] regime focused on maximising the opportunity in deals the company will be able to properly execute its initiative,” he said, adding that “with more rigorous financial and operational standards, we believe that Groupon will also mature into a company that can consistently drive higher rates of capital productivity, leading to shareholder value creation”.Groupon shares rallied 10.5 per cent on Monday to $3.86, cutting the 12-month decline to 24.6 per cent.Shares of Coach were also in the black after an analyst at Baird issued an upbeat note on the fashion brand.Mark Altschwager upgraded the group to “outperform” following the results of a survey suggesting consumer interest in buying Coach handbags has risen from the year prior. In addition, “improving demand among outlet shoppers [still the majority of business] would represent a key catalyst to drive shares higher from here,” he noted.The shares rose 2.5 per cent on Monday to $43.35, extending their year-to-date rise to nearly 32.5 per cent.Elsewhere, an expectation-smashing set of results failed to prevent Hasbro from suffering its biggest one-day drop since October. Shares in the toy maker fell 7 per cent to a three-month low of $79.54 after analysts expressed concerns that the tailwind its all-important boys’ division has been getting from Star Wars products could be fading.Revenues at the unit — Hasbro’s biggest — grew just 4.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 24 per cent in the first.“The slowdown in [the boys’ unit] is somewhat worrisome,” Trevor Young, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,166.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 18,533.1, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced by 0.5 per cent to 5,055.8.The S&P 500 rose to within less than one point of the record high it notched last week, as investors shook off anxiety caused by the coup attempt in Turkey, and braced for a number of second-quarter earnings due this week.
26;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-02-16T23:32:18Z;Coach AW16 report New York Womenswear;Prairie shirts, varsity jackets and high school sweethearts: Coach’s next stop on an all-American road trip;Coach’s creative director, the British designer Stuart Vevers, is entering his third year at the American house and the brand’s re-emergence as a viable ready-to-wear label is beginning to bear fruit. Results announced at the end of the third quarter saw a net sales growth of 4 per cent and a total sales increase of 7 per cent on a constant currency basis. After a grim year of double digit downs, the brand is finally on an upward trajectory.Detailed coverage from the catwalks of this season’s fashion shows in New York, London, Paris and MilanIt has been a long haul with lots of shop closures, a radical redesign of the house codes and the introduction of a ready-to-wear show that has placed the 75-year-old house at the centre of New York fashion week. Vevers’ vision, meanwhile, has found some real traction among the fashion cognoscenti. His distinctive shearling jackets have been spotted on fashionable backs all over the city this week and his interpretation of cool Americana is increasingly visible. With a few cleverly considered pieces — I might even describe his coats as “cult” — Vevers has given Coach a welcome jolt of fashionability.That said, this is no easy climate to work in. Vevers has passed the two-year mark that claimed his contemporaries Raf Simons at Dior and Alexander Wang at Balenciaga, both designers who brought a shortlived new vision to their respective houses. Creative leadership can be a fleeting thing. Is Vevers watching the clock? No way.“There’s still so much to do,” he explained the day before the show at the company’s headquarters. “But I’m feeling really optimistic about the direction we’re moving in. We’ve touched some early success because we’ve developed a nostalgia for our brand which I think has a real authenticity about it. We’re only young comparatively but we’re one of the few genuine heritage labels in the US and I think we’re developing that heritage in a positive way.”In many ways Vevers’ pseudo-retro aesthetic echoes the same principles that have also rebooted Alessandro Michele’s Gucci. By looking through the archives and drawing on a strict code of Coach motifs, Vevers has developed a line of vintage-seeming, collegiate clothes and accessories that look like they might have always been part of the house. Michele calls his quasi-archival aesthetic “fake vintage” and it is as good a description as any to apply to Coach where Vevers can mine a rich seam of American cultural references and claim them as Coach’s own.For AW16, he had drawn on old portraits: a teenage Jodie Foster, Youngbloods (the 1986 ice-hockey drama starring Rob Lowe), Scooby Doo’s Thelma and 1980s music act Salt-N-Pepa to inform a collection of bold, primary printed varsity jackets (all decorated in college badges), navy peacoats, plaid shirtdresses (rematerialised in a saucy crêpe de chine with pearl button bib fronts), a shearling Revenant coat (tufted into a bearish fluff to seem more antique and pioneer-like), biker jackets and an army of metallic-coloured, buckled, studded booties. The set was styled like a gymnasium: scene of so many iconic high school movies. I spent a lot of time thereafter Googling pictures of Rob Lowe.Vevers isn’t reinventing the wheel here. His preppy, cheery aesthetic echoes many of the themes US brands are built on. Tommy Hilfiger the day before had delivered a “cruise” collection with similarly collegiate naval coats, retro prints and badges. Marc Jacobs has always called on the high school rebel as his muse, while Ralph Lauren invented sorority chic. Even so, Vevers’ collection was pretty, practical, fresh and feminine — it felt authentic.Meanwhile, his response to the “see now buy now” trend was to offer three “Rogue” bags for sale immediately after the show. Vevers has not made his mind up about insta-fashion yet. “I’ve got a lot of questions,” he told me. “Firstly, the ready-to-wear is already a new proposition for the house and I’m not sure how many streams we want to open all at once. Secondly, when is continental Europe going to engage with the idea? And lastly, how will it all work in terms of presentation and editorial?”Knocking out a few extra bags is not such a massive undertaking for a house such as Coach, which has the capital and infrastructure to turn around such orders within a relatively short time. Vevers had decided to insta-sell the Rogue bags two months ago and his manufacturers had not blinked an eyelid. Creatively, however, it is a thornier discussion. “It could be really interesting,” said Vevers, “but there’s still no substitute for the creative energy you feel when you’re working to a deadline. Things that happen in the week before a show are the points at which it all comes together. I can’t quite imagine how I’d work that creativity within an environment when sales and manufacture were all happening simultaneously and with press appointments and showings going on all the time. I love the clean sweep of a collection and the chance to start another season anew.”I’ll second that.For more reports from the shows, go to our fashion weeks pagePhotographs: Catwalking.com
27;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-01-26T21:14:59Z;Coach sales boost helps lift S&P 500;Accessories retailer raises its outlook for operating income;Coach shares jumped on Tuesday after the handbags and accessories retailer said its revenue rose for the first time in 10 quarters as the turnround at the company continued.Shares climbed 9.9 per cent to $33.31 after the New York-based company said sales increased 4 per cent to $1.27bn in its fiscal second quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates. Same store sales, a key industry metric, fell 4 per cent in North America but were modestly better than expected.The retailer said revenues were boosted by its acquisition of Stuart Weitzman last year, with boots in particular selling well in the US, and a strong showing in Europe and mainland China.“We view the strength of Stuart Weitzman against a backdrop of unseasonably warm weather as impressive and see this business as adding stability to the model and a lever for growth over the long term,” Randal Konik, an analyst at Jefferies, said.This came alongside a 7 per cent decline in profits to $170.1m or 61 cents a share. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 68 cents per share topped forecasts.Coach also said it was raising its outlook for operating income, without specifying the amount, and maintained its revenue forecast for the year.The results “reflect the most significant progress to date on our transformation plan despite the difficult retail environment globally,” Victor Luis, chief executive, said. Mr Luis has tried to revive sales at the retailer, which has seen increased competition from brands like Michael Kors, even as years of heavy discounting hurt the brand’s image. The retailer’s shares fell nearly 13 per cent last year.Sprint shares advanced 18.7 per cent to $2.99 after the US mobile carrier reported a second consecutive quarterly net gain in customers.The Kansas-based company, which has sought to stem customer losses by engaging in a costly price war, reported a net gain of 366,000 of so-called “postpaid” phone users — those who are billed for their service on a recurring monthly basis — during the third quarter. That compares to the year ago quarter when it lost 205,000 of these customers.These efforts however ate into the company’s quarterly results, with Sprint reporting a 10 per cent drop in sales to $8.1bn, missing analysts’ forecasts. Net losses narrowed to $836m or 21 cents a share, from $2.4bn or 60 cents a share in the year ago period. Analysts had forecast a loss of 26 cents a share.Shares in Freeport-McMoRan advanced 6.6 per cent to $4.20 after the copper miner announced additional measures to reduce its debt and said it was in talks with “third parties regarding potential transactions”.Arizona-based Freeport said its loss widened to $4.1bn, or $3.47 a share, and sales fell nearly 28 per cent to $3.8bn as the ongoing slump in commodities took its toll on the company’s results. Adjusting for one-time items however, the company reported a profit of 7 cents a share.Shares in trucking company Swift Transportation jumped 21.1 per cent to $16.56 after it reported better than expected fourth-quarter earnings.Energy stocks led the way on the benchmark S&P 500 as crude prices rallied.By markets close, the S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 1,903.63, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.8 per cent to 16,167.23 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1 per cent to 4,567.67.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
28;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-01-20T06:16:50Z;Hong Kong property: bargain bin;Commercial rents dive as shoppers desert high street;"All is not well in the special administrative region of Hong Kong— and not just in the stock market. Shopping, once a favoured pastime in the city, is losing its appeal. Luxury brands have been feeling the pinch for some months, and the malaise is spreading to their landlords. Last September Coach, the US fashion retailer, closed its flagship shop in Central. In November, Burberry said it would give up a floor of its main shop in Pacific Place, a mall owned by landlord Swire Properties.Savills’ data show that high streets have been hardest hit. Last October, the property expert said that rents on three-year high street leases had fallen 30-40 per cent versus prior year levels. Still, the mall format — typically favoured by Hong Kong’s large listed landlords — was relatively resilient. Mall rents rose 2 per cent as a flight to safety in numbers kept occupancy rates firm. Souring consumer sentiment and strained mainland relations suggest the situation may worsen. Macquarie expects the downturn could last until luxury sales bottom at the end of 2016.For some landlords, this could be in the price. Hang Lung Properties, which in the first half of 2015 earned one-quarter of its top line from Hong Kong retail leases, has fallen nearly two-thirds from its 2010 post-crisis peak. Wharf, with 70 per cent of its operating profit coming from Hong Kong retail properties including Harbour City and Times Square, has halved since 2013. The two stocks trade at their lowest historical price-to-book values in more than a decade; only during the Asia crisis have these been lower.Even if the recovery takes time to come through, juicy yields of roughly 5 per cent look defensible. Hang Lung Properties, for instance, has zero net debt. Last year it paid out less than one-third of earnings; even in the worst post-crisis year, 2009, the dividend — which it has committed to maintaining or raising each year — was two-thirds covered by earnings.Shopping may be out of favour in Hong Kong; bargain-hunters should sift through the landlords.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
29;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2016-01-09T17:58:39Z;Coach, Astrid Andersen and Lou Dalton AW16 show report London Collections Men;Pumped-up details that trigger consumer desire at Coach;At Coach, creative director Stuart Vevers is bullish. It’s a year since he showed his first men’s collection for the brand, which means he’s seen customer reaction to his first body of work. “People came into the shops and bought it,” he said the day before his Autumn/Winter 16 show at London Collections Men. “They bought the key pieces, the pieces that I love. That’s given me the confidence that fashion works at Coach.”He’s talking about the shearling jackets and coats that looked so great at Coach’s menswear catwalk debut in London this time last year. They were no-brainier pieces: confident cuts with juicy details that sound simple – big pockets, chunky fastenings – but which trigger subconscious consumer desire. These design skills are a particular talent of Vevers, ones that were missing in his tricksy Spring/Summer 16 collection for Coach. They were back here on this catwalk: oversized zips on biker jackets, almost-too-big buttons on a peacoat, and those commercially friendly generous shearling trims.Vevers was honest about his intention to make clothes of familiarity. “I’m really comfortable that most of these pieces are actually pieces that you know,” he said. His plays on scale are often first rate, especially with his huge padded coats that remain in reality because of their cropped length, as well as the oversized details that create a balance. But sometimes it felt like a bit too much noise. Cut away the brashness, and there were some sweet quieter pieces, like a cute little fine leather jacket worn over a check cardigan. Cardigans: how often do they trouble the mind? They’ve not had much traction of late, though in the dim and distant past (i.e. the millennium) cardigans were quite the rage. Cliffhanger: could we be witnessing their return? Don’t say fashion’s not thrilling.Sometimes it’s about the simplest things. Astrid Andersen showed her hoodies and track pants with tailored coats. Andersen is among the London designers who are boringly labelled as streetwear. This tailored coat was to show that her vision is so much broader, and that men themselves are long used to creating a wardrobe mix. “It’s just a way of dressing,” she said backstage, one where there is no boundary between formal, casual, whatever the labels that need to be swept away. Such is the way that Andersen pushes forwards.There’s a move among some of London’s young designers to just show great clothes. Lou Dalton is among them, particularly with her fine knits produced in collaboration with John Smedley and bled with colour, her lightweight cable knits or plaid zip-ups. Her source material was the Shetland islands, but this was transported to the city, the clothes wearable, the man on the catwalk believable.For more reports from the shows, go to our fashion weeks page on FT.comPhotographs: Catwalking
30;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2015-10-27T20:26:13Z;Coach shares rise as sales beat forecasts;Wall Street indices edge lower;Coach shares were back in fashion on Tuesday, rising 4 per cent by the close of trade in New York.The once high-flying US handbag retailer, which has been struggling to turn around sales over the past two years, reported another drop in quarterly sales and profits — but the results were better than analysts feared.For the fiscal first quarter, sales came in at $1.03bn, compared with $1.04bn in the same period last year. Net income fell from $119.1m to $96.4m from a year ago.Although Coach brand sales in North America fell 11 per cent to $561m during the period, it is a smaller drop compared with those recorded in previous quarters. Coach shares have fallen 15 per cent this year.Coach further fanned hopes among investors by saying it expects to return to top line growth and record positive like-for-like growth in North American sales by the end of the year.Victor Luis, Coach’s chief executive, said the earnings “reflected continued progress in our transformation journey”.Mr Luis is trying reinvigorate the company and regain market share in its core handbag market after the brand was tarnished by years of under-investment and heavy discounting.As part of this drive the company has scaled back on promotions, revamped designs and closed underperforming stores. It also acquired luxury footwear company Stuart Weitzman earlier this year to diversify the business away from handbags and accessories.Meanwhile, UPS delivered a rise in profits but a fall in revenues in the third quarter, sending shares down 2.9 per cent to $103.10.The US package delivery and logistics company, whose massive footprint makes it a closely watched economic bellwether, reported net income rose more than analysts had expected, but revenues dipped 0.4 per cent to $14.2bn on the back of the strong dollar.Net income was up 3.5 per cent to $1.26bn, or $1.39 a share, due to the company’s ability to squeeze more profit out of every package. Analysts had forecast sales of $14.4bn and adjusted net income of $1.24bn, or $1.37 a share.Over the past two years, UPS has been saddled with a sharp rise in costs over Christmas after failing to anticipate the scale of demand in the key shopping season in the US. But on Tuesday the company expressed confidence in being able to achieve the higher-end of its full-year earnings guidance of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.T-Mobile US raised its subscriber outlook for the year yet again after it added more than 1m of the most lucrative type of mobile customers in the third quarter.The company, which under chief executive John Legere has gone from what looked like a certain death three years ago to the fastest-growing wireless carrier in the US, said branded postpaid net adds totalled 1.1m last quarter — the fifth straight quarter of over 1m adds.As a result of the strong momentum, T-Mobile said it now expects branded postpaid net customer additions for 2015 to be between 3.8m and 4.2m, compared with its previous guidance range of 3.4m to 3.9m.Stocks were slightly lower on Wall Street. The S&P 500 was down 0.3 per cent to 2,065.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent weaker at 17,581.43 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 5,030.15.
31;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2015-09-18T19:02:40Z;New York Fashion Week round-up;Social responsibility was the big message — but it was the shows with just one focus that were the most giving;"It was the season that designers gave back to the city. It started with Riccardo Tisci, who opened the week with a Manhattan debut for Givenchy and a sartorial paean to love, loss and family. The show was co-devised with Marina Abramovic and staged before the twin beams of light that annually light the sky on September 11. His was a broad, all-encompassing message of goodwill to all men, dressed up in couture corsetry and lingerie lace.Others were more specific. To celebrate his 10th year in business, Alexander Wang offered 10 reissued pieces from previous collections to raise funds for Do Something, a non-profit organisation dedicated to empowering youth. It was a potent homecoming for the designer, who will make his grand finale for the Paris-based Balenciaga early next month. Prabal Gurung introduced his SS16 collection with 30 Buddhist monks, who chanted a prayer of gratitude for the world’s help during the earthquake in Gurung’s native Nepal in April. Phillip Lim’s 10th-anniversary show invites came with an appeal to “stop and smell the flowers”.Meanwhile the American brand Coach staged its first ready-to-wear show, having previously done presentations, in a prairie-grassed glass box on the High Line. The location underlined the brand’s ongoing relationship with the pedestrian garden on which it hosts an annual summer party, whose ticket price is put towards the walkway’s upkeep. And at DKNY, the city’s native sons and the house’s incoming designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne (better known as Public School) dedicated their inaugural show to their own “backyard”. Social responsibility and philanthropic “journeys” were central to the week’s event.New York was all about giving. I only wish some designers had given more attention to the clothes. Consistently the most commercial and safest of the schedules, this season was especially lacking in verve. Collections were easy on the eye, but seldom arresting.At the week’s start, rumours were circulating that designer Phoebe Philo may be leaving Céline. The shockwaves will be seismic if she does; that so many of her ideas and silhouettes were revisited in New York was testimony both to her commercial influence but also to the label’s diaspora. Many former Céline studio designers are now elsewhere, and this was an interesting place in which to unpick the threads that bind.While Givenchy was exquisite, and the clothes as epic as the message expansive, most of the stronger shows selfishly ignored any notion of spiritual nourishment and just focused on great design. OK, fine, Proenza Schouler did describe its sensual ruffled-knit dresses as “soulful”, but the love and attention here had been lavished on technique and fabric; and the results were deeply alluring. At Rodarte, the Mulleavy sisters found real spirit in a love-song to a 1970s-era, sequin-spun Stevie Nicks.Elsewhere, Ralph Lauren’s French Tricolore-coloured collection was a masterful exercise in fluid, flattering tailoring, simple shirting and immaculate navy knits while, at Calvin Klein, Francisco Costa explored new territory with a blousy floral print and a homage to 1930s original bombshell Jean Harlow. His long-line, silky, chain-embellished slips were teamed with mannish jackets that drew on the “lusty warmth of the morning after”. One of a number of gentle seductions, Costa also nailed the trend for straps, seen trailing down catwalks everywhere from Michael Kors to Public School, and offered an interesting proposition to the much explored language of masculine/feminine style.It was a good season also for the Park Avenue set. Carolina Herrera scored a coup in persuading the Frick museum to allow her to stage her show in its marble-floored Garden Room, and it was delicious to see the 76-year-old designer’s rose-themed collection away from the gloomy Lincoln Centre, where she has traditionally shown. What better accessory for a petal-soft, sheer, organza shirtdress than Whistler’s “Symphony in Flesh Color and Pink”?And Peter Copping had a powerful second season at Oscar de la Renta, where he drew on Spanish themes (inspired by his predecessor’s “passions” and a visit to the Hispanic Society of Harlem) to deliver carnation-strewn prints, bullfighter scarlets and a score of beautiful gowns. Model Julia Nobis (an absolute catwalk favourite and about to complete a medical degree) scored one of the most gorgeous looks of the week when she stepped out in Copping’s black chiffon-and-lace mermaid gown with glove-like black chiffon sleeves and I had a proper moment before a billowing aqua ball gown with black grosgrain bows.Copping wasn’t supporting any major cause with his collection but his show notes included credits for each member of the de la Renta atelier — an unusual gesture in an industry obsessed with status and the supremacy of a single creative voice. In a very noisy week of giving, it’s a sweet irony perhaps that Copping’s quiet tribute to his team was one of the most generous acts of all.For all of Jo Ellison’s reports from the New York shows, go to our fashion weeks page on the FT web app, or visit our New York Collections Women SS16 fashion weeks hub on FT.comPhotographs: Catwalking.com"

Coach advanced 1.5 per cent to $31.93, PVH gained 2.5 per cent to $114.52 and Hanesbrands rose 1.8 per cent to $30.32. Michael Kors, however, decreased 0.6 per cent to $43.37.Kinder Morgan gained 2.5 per cent to $33.96 after analysts with Goldman Sachs added the energy company to its “conviction list”.Dupont, the maker of animal feed and crop protection, rose 1.6 per cent to $53.86 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”, citing its more than 20 per cent year-to-date decline.Restaurant chain El Pollo Loco declined 20.7 per cent to $14.56 after it dimmed its full-year sales growth forecasts.Overall, US equity markets rolled sideways as better industrial production figures than expected were offset by a slide in consumer confidence.The S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,091.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4 per cent to 17,477.40, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.3 per cent to 5,048.23.eric.platt@ft.comtwitter: @ericgplatt
33;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2015-08-04T16:35:57Z;CVS Health dips on retail setback;US stocks slip on call for September rate rise;CVS Health shares weakened on Tuesday after the US drugstore chain warned sales growth in its retail stores had cooled and narrowed its earnings outlook for the remainder of the year.The US pharmacy group said same-store sales, a closely scrutinised metric of underlying growth, rose 0.5 per cent in the quarter, down from a 1.2 per cent gain in the first three months of the year.Net profits in the quarter rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn, or $1.12 per share, on a 7 per cent rise in revenues to $37.2bn.CVS, which also manages pharmacy benefits and the fulfilment of prescriptions on behalf of large insurers and employers, said it expected adjusted earnings to range between $5.11 and $5.18 a share, compared with a previous outlook for $5.08 to $5.19 a share.Analysts on Wall Street expect the company to report full-year results of $5.17 a share.John Heinbockel, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said pressures on the company’s gross margins nonetheless did not “call secular growth into question”.“We view CVS Health as the rare large consumer company that can generate 10 per cent secular earnings before interest and taxes growth, driven by strong underlying growth,” he said.Shares of the company fell 3 per cent to $108.81 in midday trading, wiping more than $4bn off the company’s valuation. CVS Health recovered later in the trading day to close at $109.96. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 0.25 per cent to close at $95.67.Apple shares fell another 3.2 per cent on Tuesday, compounding a fall of 2.5 per cent the previous day, on investor concerns about its growth in China. Shares closed at $114.64 compared with their pre-earnings high of $133 two weeks ago.Shares of Coach, the entry-level US accessories maker, climbed 3.2 per cent to close at $31.41 after the company said it expected sales at its namesake brand to grow in its current fiscal year.Revenues in its fourth quarter, which ran to June 27, slipped 12 per cent from a year earlier to $1bn, while profits tumbled 84 per cent to $11.7m, or 4 cents a share.Analysts on Wall Street had expected the handbag maker to report a profit of $67.5m on sales of $973m.Time Inc advanced 2.6 per cent to $22.43 after cost cuts helped the magazine publisher swing to a profit in its latest quarter.The company, which owns the People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune titles, said sales fell 6 per cent from a year earlier to $773m, ahead of consensus forecasts. The group swung to a profit of $24m, or 22 cents a share, from a loss of $32m a year ago.Baxalta, the Illinois-based biotech recently spun off from Baxter, gained nearly 12 per cent to close at $37.10 after UK-listed, Dublin-based Shire made an approach to take over the maker of treatments for haemophilia and other bleeding disorders.TriNet shares tumbled almost 39 per cent to $16.33 after the provider of human resources services to small- and midsized businesses swung to a surprise net loss in its latest quarter.The group said it lost $1.3m, or 2 cents a share, in the three months to the end of June. Analysts on Wall Street had expected the company to report a profit of $10.1m.TriNet blamed a “higher than expected number of large medical claims” for the loss.Overall, US equity markets slipped after Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said it was “appropriate” for the US central bank to raise rates in September, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.The S&P 500 slipped 0.22 per cent to close at 2,093.32 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.27 per cent to close at 17,550.69.

34;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
35;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2015-05-27T17:22:10Z;Michael Kors plunges on sales outlook;Shares hit as decade of growth in same-store figures comes to an end;Michael Kors shares fell as much as 24 per cent on Wednesday, after the luxury retailer warned that same-store sales growth would be flat this year, ending nearly a decade of gains, with earnings expected to fall short of expectations.The New York-based company said comparable store sales growth, a key industry metric, would be short of Wall Street expectations for a 6.9 per cent rise and a sharp drop from the 10.3 per cent increase recorded in the yearFull-year total sales are expected to range between $4.7bn and $4.8bn, assuming a $200m hit from currency swings, with earnings ranging from $4.40 to $4.50 a share. Analysts had projected Michael Kors would earn $4.68 a share on sales of $5.1bn.The outlook accompanied fourth-quarter results that showed a 13.4 per cent jump in profits from a year earlier to $182.6m. Sales climbed 17.8 per cent to $1.1bn, roughly in line with consensus expectations.John Idol, chairman and chief executive, said the fourth quarter was hampered by weak traffic trends in North America, a drop in sales of watches and an impact from delays associated with issues at ports along the US West Coast.“While we were faced with a number of headwinds in the fourth quarter, we were pleased with the strong performance across our segments and geographies,” Mr Idol said.Sales in the quarter were buoyed by the opening of 121 net new stores over the past year, offsetting weakness in same-store sales. Michael Kors also reported strong gains in its ecommerce operations, echoing a shift in consumer trends already articulated by department stores including Nordstrom and Macy’s and a key point underlying the merger between Yoox and Net-a-Porter, the online luxury goods retailers.Revenues from the company’s digital business climbed 63 per cent in the year that ended in March from the previous period, aided by the launch of a new online website in the US. The company said its expenses in the current year would rise as it expands its ecommerce business abroad.JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight following the results, noting that the company’s outlook was “materially worse” than expected. Nomura added that despite the decline in the share price, investors would probably “need to see signs” of a trough in same-store sales before investing.Shares of the company slid more than a fifth to $46.90, taking their declines to more than 50 per cent since they touched a high of $101.04 in February 2014.Peers across the luxury goods space slid after the earnings report, with shares of Coach falling 5 per cent to $34.68, Vera Bradley declining 4 per cent to $13.48, and Fossil sliding 7 per cent to $70.55.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
36;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2015-01-06T18:06:35Z;Coach: sensible shoes;Weitzman deal is a good step, but there’s further to go;Stilettos can propel one to new heights. Coach hopes that the $574m acquisition of luxury shoemaker Stuart Weitzman will do just that.Once a popular accessories company, Coach has for years been struggling to appeal to the young, affluent, urban types that it targets. A study from Consumer Edge Research shows that these trendy youngsters have been fleeing. Why? They find the brand is not “aspirational” enough.The research, conducted in the third quarter of last year, found that among 18 to 24-year-olds, just 17 per cent found Coach “aspirational”. The figure was 21 per cent a year earlier. There were similar declines among older consumers. And only 9 per cent of those earning more than $200,000 a year found the brand desirable, half the level of a year earlier.In the face of such consumer apathy, same-store sales in North America have been falling for the past few quarters. In the three months ending in September, same-store sales were down 24 per cent. Coach shares fell a third last year. Its market capitalisation, which stood at over $22bn in 2012, is now down to $10bn.Stuart Weitzman is a good fit for Coach. Both target the “affordable” end of the luxury market. The shoe company — directed by the designer of the same name — has delivered annual 10 per cent sales growth over the past five years. It bullishly forecasts that growth could hit 20 per cent in the future. Coach, which desperately wants a piece of that growth, says that the deal will be immediately accretive to earnings per share.That is all very nice, but Weitzman will have only a limited impact on the group as a whole — it has annual revenues of $300m, against Coach’s $5bn. The high heels (and their celebrity backing from the likes of Gisele and Kate Moss) will give Coach some much needed glitz. But the company needs something more substantial if it is to walk out of the swamp in which it finds itself.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

An exact price could not be ascertained, but one of the people said it was close to $600m. A deal could be announced as early as Tuesday.The FT first reported Coach’s interest in Stuart Weitzman, owned by private equity firm Sycamore Partners, last month. The sale process took longer than expected, as buyers sought clarity over the role of Stuart Weitzman, the founder of the eponymous brand. It is unclear what role, if any, he will take in the company if it is sold to Coach.A takeover of the shoemaker would give Coach a higher-end brand to add to its stable of mid-market footwear. Coach, once a star player in the so-called accessible luxury market, has been grappling with sliding sales and profits amid fierce competition from rivals such as Michael Kors, Tory Burch and Kate Spade.Coach shares plummeted 38 per cent last year. In June the company announced a wide-reaching restructuring plan.An acquisition of a premium brand such as Stuart Weitzman would allow Coach to broaden its focus, ramp up its footwear portfolio and develop itself as a lifestyle brand.

Revenues climbed 6 per cent to $5.03bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of $1.85 a share on sales of $4.96bn. Adjusted earnings of $2.30 a share beat expectations of $2.11 a share.The company also boosted its 2014 revenue guidance to a range of $19.8bn-$20bn and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.45 to $8.55.“While we take comfort that it appears Amgen’s base business has largely stabilised, we believe the quarter will be overshadowed by the [October 28] Business Review meeting,” Ian Somaiya, an analyst at Nomura, said.Amgen has been under pressure from activist investor Daniel Loeb, whose hedge fund Third Point has a stake in the company, to split into two.During an analyst meeting, Robert Bradway, chief executive of Amgen, said he was not convinced that splitting the company would add much value to shareholders, according to Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Shares of Amgen climbed 6 per cent to $157.19 and are up 38 per cent so far this year.Kohl’s lagged behind the S&P 500 after the US department store chain warned on Monday that quarterly profits would be at the low end of its earlier guidance as sales softened in October.Lex discusses whether the biotechnology group is better apartIt expects earnings in its third quarter to be at the low end of earlier guidance of between $4.05 and $4.45 a share.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $4.29 per share before Monday’s announcement.Shares of Kohl’s fell nearly 7 per cent to $54.66.Coach shares dropped 6 per cent to $34 after the luxury handbag maker said it expected a mid to high 20 per cent decline in comparable store sales in fiscal year 2015.The retailer reported a 10 per cent decline in sales to $1.04bn in the three months to the end of September that were modestly ahead of expectations for $1.01bn.Profit fell 45 per cent to $119.1m, or 43 cents per share.

40;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-08-12T17:03:03Z;Intercept surges on liver treatment trial;;Intercept Pharmaceuticals shares surged after the biotech company said results from a mid-stage trial of a treatment for liver disease showed the medication was effective.The drug at the centre of the trial, obeticholic acid, also known as OCA, treats patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, which does not currently have a regulatory-approved treatment.The liver inflammation, which resembles liver disease caused by heavy drinking, can lead to cancer or organ failure. The trial showed liver scarring did not worsen in 46 per cent of patients compared with 21 per cent who were on placebo.Analysts with Deutsche Bank forecast the medication could generate annual sales near $9bn at its peak, dependent on approval.“We are more confident in OCA as a leading therapy in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,” Alethia Young, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said. “We view the data as relatively straightforward and better than our expectations.”Intercept, which expects to begin a new, late-stage trial in the first half of 2015, said the treatment also showed some improvement in patients suffering from fibrosis.Mark Pruzanski, the company’s chief executive, noted that the fibrosis results were noteworthy considering the short length of the completed trial and the relatively small sample size.“The fibrosis benefit with OCA treatment is the first time we are aware of that a therapeutic has been shown to significantly improve liver fibrosis in a meaningful proportion of NASH patients, an unexpected and positive finding,” he said.Shares of Intercept surged 16 per cent to $276.12 while rival Conatus Pharmaceuticals, which is also developing medications to treat liver disease, rose 3 per cent to $7.74.The broader Nasdaq biotech index, which has climbed 11 per cent this year, fell 0.4 per cent to 2,635.24.NII Holdings, the Latin American telecoms operator with shares listed in New York, collapsed on Tuesday after the company warned continued losses would likely force it to file for bankruptcy.The company, which once held a market capitalisation near $15bn, saw its valuation slide two-thirds to less than $30m.Juan Figuereo, the company’s chief financial officer, said sales continued to deteriorate as the mobile operator lost 77,000 subscribers in the quarter.He added that NII Holdings, which had $4.8bn in net debt at the end of the period, would “continue to work with our advisers to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions”. NII Holdings shares slid 76 per cent to $0.16.Kate Spade shares touched to a pre-crisis peak on Tuesday before tumbling after the accessible fashion label lifted its full year profit forecast and said second-quarter results eclipsed Wall Street expectations.The company, which also owns the Jack Spade brand for men, said its namesake women’s brand was largely responsible for an almost 55 per cent increase in North American sales last quarter to $208m.The rise in sales in the US, as well as overseas, prompted Kate Spade to lift its profit forecast for the year to a range of $120m to $130m compared with an earlier range of $115m to $125m.America’s fashion market remains an intensely competitive one – both at the high and low end. In an echo of several other fashion retailers, Kate Spade noted a “more promotional retail environment”.The company’s shares, which advanced as much as 10 per cent in early morning trading, fell 26 per cent to $28.81 after executives warned margins would moderate following the second-quarter expansion.Rival Michael Kors declined 3 per cent to $77.44 while Coach fell nearly 1 per cent to $35.98.Gold miners were buoyed by a bout of unease after the government in Kiev said it would refuse entry to a Russian convoy allegedly carrying humanitarian aid.Spot gold prices climbed 0.6 per cent to $1,316.28 per troy ounce as a lack of clarity over Moscow’s intentions with the delivery raised concerns that the convoy could be used for Russia to directly intervene.Newmont Mining shares climbed 2 per cent to $27.06, Goldcorp rose 2 per cent to $28.83 and Barrick Gold advanced 3 per cent to $19.18.Overall, US equity markets shifted lower after two days of gains. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,933.75 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1 per cent to 16,560.54.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3 per cent to 4,389.25.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
41;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-08-05T14:49:16Z;Coach woes go on despite turnround effort;;"Sliding sales and a sharp drop in profits in the fourth quarter capped a tough year for Coach. The latest results beat Wall Street expectations but highlighted the accessories group’s loss of market share to rivals.The New York-listed company said sales in the three months to June 28 declined 7 per cent to $1.14bn, while net income tumbled 66 per cent to $75m. Total sales in North America, the group’s primary market, fell 16 per cent to $691m during the quarter.Coach’s earnings figures on Tuesday were in stark contrast to the stellar quarter enjoyed by fellow affordable-luxury group Michael Kors a day earlier, with the latter’s North American sales eclipsing those of Coach after they rose 30 per cent.But while shares in fast-growing Michael Kors fell on Monday amid fears of heavy discounting and brand overexposure, investors sent Coach stock up 4 per cent to $35.80 by close of trading Tuesday, after the quarter beat analysts’ forecasts.“This has been a challenging year for the company, most notably in the North America women’s bag and accessory business,” said Victor Luis, chief executive.“However it was also a year of many accomplishments, including the successful integration of our retail businesses in Europe, surpassing $500m in sales in China and driving our men’s category to about $700m in sales globally.”Michael Kors: luxury of time

‘It is unbelievable how aware of your watch you become if you just put it on the other wrist’Despite encouraging signs of growth internationally and across product lines, analysts warned that a great deal of work was still to be done to reverse the brand’s fortunes, notably in its home market.While global sales rose 7 per cent to $414m for the fourth quarter, last month Coach announced plans to shut a fifth of its North American main-line retail stores and roughly 7 per cent of its outlets. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had fallen 12.5 per cent since the company announced the store closures.“The North American results are particularly poor and given management have outlined a turnround focusing on upscaling product, the current strategy of shuttering main-line stores seems unconvincing,” said Rahul Sharma, an analyst at Neev Capital.“The brand isn’t dead yet, but there is still a long and uncomfortable road to recovery ahead.”Next month, the first collection by Stuart Vevers, Coach’s new creative director, will hit stores following a strong reception at New York Fashion Week. Before today, Coach shares had slumped 39 per cent in 2014, compared with a 4.9 per cent gain for the S&P’s 500 Index."
42;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-08-04T17:12:13Z;Michael Kors: luxury of time;Challenge is to avoid the fate of Coach;"Luxury populism is good as long as it lasts. Michael Kors learnt that the hard way on Monday after it said that profitability will decline this year after a long run of growth. Investors quickly turned their backs on the trendy fashion company, pushing its shares down 7 per cent. Never mind about the blockbuster first-quarter results. Net profits jumped 50 per cent from a year earlier to $188m; revenues rose 43 per cent; and same-store sales growth passed the 20 per cent mark. But the future is what matters.What hurt the shares was an admission that it was being forced to heavily discount unsold goods and that costly expansion plans will hurt margins. That called into question the company’s core affordable luxury strategy, giving rise to fears that it is growing too fast.The big worry has been – for some time – that the sweetheart fashion brand of America’s 20- to 35-year-olds would turn into the next Coach Inc, a rival which, after a period of rapid store growth, had to downsize to fix its business. Fashion followers, though, say that Coach lost customers on the back of a poorer quality product. Kors has smartly exploited the Kardashianisation of the young female consumer – the flashy “jetset” aesthetic – but at a more affordable price. The risk is that trends change and that Kors cannot change with them. One data-point that must worry Kors is its declining popularity on the web. Google Trends shows that searches for “Michael Kors” have plummeted in recent months.Breakneck growth cannot last forever. The positive here is that Kors’ management is aware of this. That is why a little squeeze on the margins to diversify geographically makes sense. With an operating margin at 33 per cent – significantly higher than its peers – it has room to manoeuvre. Investors should think twice before dumping its shares.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
43;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-06-20T15:57:45Z;Coach slides on store closure plans;US handbag maker’s move triggers price target cuts and downgrades;Coach, the venerable US handbag maker that has struggled amid intensifying competition, continued a three-day decline on Friday after the company said on Thursday it would close more than a fifth of its North American full-price stores.The move, which Coach says will cost as much as $300m and bring its mainline store base to roughly 268 locations, triggered at least 20 price target cuts on Wall Street and three downgrades.Chief executive Victor Luis said that the entry-level luxury handbag market had “shifted dramatically” and at times at an investor day alluded to the successes of Kate Spade and Michael Kors.“We have not put sufficient investments and resources behind our brand and fleet, and we have not demonstrated enough fashion innovation in an increasingly competitive category,” Mr Luis said.Analysts with Wells Fargo said the time it will take to complete the company’s transformation, which will also see Coach shift away from heavy promotions, disappointed the market.“Coach is attempting something very difficult in trying to transform its brand, reduce promotions, and attract new customers,” analyst Paul Lejuez said. “The most similar situation, in our view, is that of JC Penney.”Coach shares declined 3 per cent to $34.73 on Friday, taking its losses since the year’s start to 39 per cent.Rival Ralph Lauren rose 1 per cent to $155.57 while Kate Spade climbed 3 per cent to $39.20. Michael Kors was little changed at $88.60.Shares of Oracle, which makes servers, software and developed the Java programming platform, fell 4 per cent to $40.82 after the company missed expectations on two fronts in its latest earnings report.Sales climbed 3 per cent to $11.3bn, while profits fell 4 per cent from a year earlier to $3.6bn, or 80 cents per share. When adjusted for certain items, Oracle said it earned 92 cents per share.Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 95 cents a share on sales of $11.5bn. The company said it failed to ignite new software licence sales, which account for a third of net revenues.“While Oracle accounting is more conservative than many [‘Software as a Service’] peers . . . the low growth rate suggests that the ‘base’ of SaaS business such as 2012 and 2013 acquisitions Taleo, RightNow and Eloqua is underperforming its market,” Citi analyst Walter Pritchard said.Mr Pritchard also downgraded the company to neutral from buy.Darden Restaurants said on Friday that “legal, financial advisory and other costs related to implementation of [its] strategic action plan,” as well as the writedown of the value of some assets, dented profits in the quarter to May 25.The company, which is based in Florida, has been engaged in a high-profile battle with activist investors over how to generate more value from its businesses.Last month, Darden agreed to sell its Red Lobster chain to a private equity firm for $2.1bn, an agreement that riled several activist funds.Profits in the quarter tumbled 35 per cent to $86.5m, or 65 cents a share. Legal and advisory costs, as well as impairment charges, accounted for 19 cents of the drop. When excluding those costs, the company said it earned 84 cents a share, below Wall Street forecasts.Shares of the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants owner fell 4 per cent to $47.58.RadioShack, which lost almost $100m in the three months to May 3, fell 10 per cent on Friday to 92 cents, taking it below $1 for the first time in at least 30 years.At its height, RadioShack commanded a market value of more than $15bn – larger than retailers such as Nordstrom and Tiffany – and made more than $2.4bn in profits between 2000 and 2010.But a rapidly changing retail landscape, which has felled so-called big box electronics chains CompUSA and Circuit City, has pushed RadioShack’s market value below $100m.Gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson fell 9 per cent to $15.52 after the company forecast full-year earnings below Wall Street expectations.Overall, US equity markets coasted to new record heights. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,962.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.15 per cent to 16,947.08.

44;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;First Solar climbs on import duty plan;;US solar panel manufacturers were lifted on Wednesday by the Commerce Department’s proposal to impose fresh import duties on solar panels manufactured in China.The decision comes after an investigation by the department found components manufactured in the world’s second-largest economy had been subsidised in a way that damaged American counterparts.While the proposal is not yet final, it would impose a tariff of 26.9 per cent on nearly all solar panel manufacturers, although it would differ for several companies.Analysts at Credit Suisse said the duties would weigh on Chinese solar panel manufacturers and could lead to increased prices.“The amount of the duty is worse than expectations of 10 to 15 per cent and will effectively disrupt the market, assuming a last-minute settlement isn’t reached or the final determination isn’t lowered if China provides more information to the US,” Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin said.Shares of First Solar climbed almost 4 per cent to close at $65.39 while SunPower advanced 7 per cent to $34.25. Meanwhile, Yingli Green Energy fell 4.24 per cent to $2.83, Trina Solar declined 4.55 per cent to $12.38 and JinkoSolar slid 7.5 per cent to end at $24.99.Under Armour shares rose almost 5 per cent to $53.63 after brokerage Jefferies lifted its view of the company to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ as the brand’s resonance with consumers accelerates.The investment bank, which conducted a survey of more than 2,000 parents, said the company ranked second only to Nike in terms of “coolness”.“We think sales can exceed $15bn over the next 10 years, based on strong secular athletic trends across multiple categories and our proprietary survey work that shows Under Armour’s growing dominance with the youth generation and women,” analyst Randal Konik said.Coach was under pressure on Wednesday after Sterne Agee downgraded the company to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ as the US accessories retailer continues to struggle through a turnround.Analyst Ike Boruchow said current trends were likely to remain “lacklustre” and there was little visibility into the company’s efforts to boost sales.“While the company’s strategies to kick start the business may bear fruit over the long term, we believe fundamentals will remain challenged in the near term, which continues to put both earnings and the multiple at risk,” he said.Wet weather and the later-than-usual Easter exacerbated weakness in Coach’s North American business at the start of the year, weighing on its still early turnround. Coach shares fell 2.55 per cent to close at $39.Legg Mason shares advanced after the company said it would sell its wealth management business, Legg Mason Investment Council, to Stifel Financial.The business, which manages more than $9bn in assets, follows several other acquisitions made by Stifel this year, including two investment banking businesses.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Shares of Legg Mason rose 2 per cent to $50.18 while Stifel was 1.56 per cent higher at $45.58.Travelport fired the starting gun for its upcoming initial public offering, filing plans with US securities regulators to list shares publicly.The company, which provides reservation software and other services to the travel industry, said it would raise $100m, a place holder figure that is likely to change.Overall, US equities shifted higher on Wednesday after declining marginally a day earlier.The S&P 500 rose 0.19 per cent to 1,927.88, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed slightly higher at 16,737.53. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.41 per cent to end the day at 4,251.64.
45;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-05-28T16:04:26Z;Michael Kors continues to outpace accessible luxury crowd;;Michael Kors beat expectations as North American fourth-quarter sales jumped 43 per cent and more than doubled in Europe, confirming that the US retailer’s assault on the continent’s luxury market continues unabated.Total revenue in the three-month period to March 29 climbed 53 per cent to $917m, up from $597m in the year ago quarter. Profits jumped to $161m from $101m.The company continues to outshine rivals in the aspirational luxury sector such as Coach Inc and Ralph Lauren with its range of jet-set-inspired accessories, footwear and clothing lines.But after 34 quarters of comparable store growth, a volatile premarket trading performance on Wednesday reflected jitters among some investors that the company would be able to sustain its stellar momentum.Shares initially rose 4 per cent before opening flat after slightly lower gross margins and same store sales growth were reported during the earnings conference call, as well as flatter expectations for the next fiscal year.Still, executives remained confident of sustained growth. The share price has more than tripled since its IPO in 2011.“This has been another record year for Michael Kors – and the main reason for continued growth lies in our successful communication of our identity as a leading global luxury brand to customers worldwide,” said chairman and chief executive John Idol, adding that the brand’s social media presence was increasingly driving international sales.Gains came across retail, wholesale and licensing segments as well as geographies, with 101 stores opened globally since the fourth quarter last year.Growth in accessories and watch sales helped drive North American revenue up to $739.4m, as same-store sales increased 21 per cent. The company’s home market accounts for about 80 per cent of total revenue.Revenue in Europe soared 125 per cent to $164.7m as same-store sales surged 63 per cent. Mr Idol said that in time he expected the continent to grow into a $1bn market.The company continues to lead a charge by North American brands to expand their European retail presence, capitalising on a gap in the market left by upmarket European brands who, as they eyed up Asia, lost the loyalty of local shoppers.For the current quarter, Michael Kors forecast that comparable sales will rise about 20 per cent year on year. Revenues are expected to be between $840m and $850m and the company sought to reassure shareholders of continued growth.“We don’t think next year’s operating margins will change significantly higher or lower. If anything we would say our wholesale would come down slightly from where it is today given normalisation,” Mr Idol said.“We are best in class in terms of performance.”
46;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-04-29T17:11:12Z;Sprint’s strength lifts telecoms sector;;Investor focus on the US telecoms sector ratcheted higher on Tuesday after strong results from the country’s third-largest carrier lifted prospects for the broader industry while another operator announced plans to begin mobile service on commercial flights.The announcement by AT&T sent shares in Gogo off by almost a third.Gogo, the biggest provider of WiFi on US airlines, has tapped a steadily growing market as more carriers allow passengers to access the internet.AT&T said it would work with Honeywell to launch 4G LTE service in 2015. The move follows the Federal Communications Commission’s decision last December to review rules that have banned in-flight phone calls.Shares in Gogo weakened by 28.61 per cent to close at $13.12 while AT&T advanced about 1 per cent to $35.41.Sprint, the US mobile operator majority owned by Japan’s SoftBank, said its loss in the three months to March 31 narrowed to $151m, or 4 cents a share, from $643m a year earlier.The unprofitable carrier also reported revenue growth of 1 per cent to $8.88bn, ahead of Wall Street forecasts.“We continue to believe Sprint is taking many of the necessary steps to right the ship on a subscriber side,” Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said.“While this turn likely will not be seen until the second half, it is aligning its cost structure in such a way where we believe the higher end, if not higher, of its 2014 [earnings] guidance is achievable.”Following the company’s results, analysts at Jefferies said Sprint was also facing heightened pressure from smaller competitor T-Mobile, which now offers to pay cancellation fees for new subscribers switching from a rival operator.Shares in Sprint rose 11.31 per cent to $8.27 while T-Mobile advanced 3.38 per cent to end at $29.05. T-Mobile US will report quarterly results later this week.Merck, one of the largest US drugmakers, climbed after the company reported first-quarter results ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Sales at the company fell to $10.3bn in the first three months of the year from $10.7bn in the same period a year ago, as patents expired on several drugs.Profits for the quarter, though, edged higher to $1.7bn from $1.6bn as Merck tightened its cost control.The results come a day after Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser Group confirmed that it was in talks to buy the company’s consumer health business.“Investing in the best opportunities for growth while being disciplined in managing our costs enabled us to deliver bottom-line performance,” Kenneth Frazier, Merck’s chief executive, said.Shares in Merck rose 3.58 per cent to close at $58.71.Wet weather and the later-than-usual Easter exacerbated weakness in Coach’s North American business as strong demand in China failed to offset buyers’ fatigue in developed markets.Coach, the US maker of mid-range handbags and leather accessories, said net income fell by 20 per cent to $191m for the quarter ended in March while revenues dipped 7 per cent to $1.1bn.Analysts at Wells Fargo compared the decline in same-store sales in North America to results at JC Penney in 2012, when the department store attempted its own transformation.“While we do not view the Coach brand or product in the same light as JC Penney, the continuing challenges confronting JC Penney in its transformation are relevant when thinking about the timeline and challenges Coach may face as it attempts to bring in a new customer,” Wells Fargo analyst Paul Lejuez said.Overall, US equity markets regained steam after a turbulent Monday trading day, buoyed by earnings from some of the largest companies.Thus far, more than three-quarters of S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have either beaten or met Wall Street estimates.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.48 per cent to close at 1,878.33 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.53 per cent to 16,535.37. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.72 per cent to end the day at 4,103.54.
47;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-04-29T15:54:37Z;Coach earnings plunge as US sales tumble;;Coach shares tumbled by nearly 10 per cent after the US accessories group reported worse than expected quarterly earnings and a sharp dip in North American sales.Sales in stores open at least a year fell 21 per cent in the group’s core home market, missing Wall Street estimates of a 15 per cent decline. It blamed a later than usual Easter and wet weather for its poor performance.Coach has suffered heavily from increased competition from younger, fresher rivals in recent years, such as Kate Spade and Michael Kors. It is in the early stages of attempting to reposition itself as a more upmarket lifestyle label, but the revamp is adding to costs and has yet to win over customers.Net income for the third quarter ending March 29 dropped 20 per cent to $191m, or 68 cents a share, down from $239m, or 84 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 7 per cent to $1.1bn. Jane Hamilton Nielsen, chief financial officer, warned the company expected sales to fall a further 10 per cent in the quarter ending in June.“These results are absolutely hideous – Coach is being murdered at home by the new kids on the block,” said Rahul Sharma, an analyst at Neev Capital, adding that North American sales had fallen for the fourth quarter in a row. “The model continues to be in big trouble and this was a big miss despite washed out expectations.”Victor Luis, chief executive, said that the group had recorded sharply lower traffic levels in stores, while internet results were hit by a decision to cut discounts and reduce invitations to flash sales at its factory site.He added that the strongest signs of growth in the period came from sales of handbags priced more than $600.Stuart Vevers, creative director, was poached last year from Loewe in a bid to revamp Coach’s stale product mix and store design. His first collections will hit stores in September.The group benefited from strong demand at its footwear division and in emerging markets. International sales rose 14 per cent to $441m excluding currency swings. China sales jumped 25 per cent.
48;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2014-01-22T16:00:43Z;Coach shares fall after earnings disappoint;;Shares in Coach fell almost 7 per cent on Wednesday as investors reacted to weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings from the US accessories retailer during the critical holiday shopping season.The New York-based company said overall sales slipped 6 per cent to $1.42bn in the three months ended December 28, down from $1.5bn in 2012.Same-store sales in the company’s core North American market dropped 13.6 per cent, considerably worse than the 6.8 per cent decline that had been predicted by Wall Street. Total sales in the region were down 9 per cent to $983m.Profits fell to $297m, or $1.06 a share, from $353m, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier.“We continue to be disappointed by our performance in North America, which was impacted by substantially lower traffic in our stores,” said Victor Luis, who took over as chief executive earlier this month.Many US retailers were badly hit by a decline in bricks-and-mortar store spending over the Christmas period, as shoppers tightened their belts and turned increasingly to online purchasing.Coach has also suffered from increased competition from younger, fresher rivals in recent years, including Michael Kors, Kate Spade and Tory Burch. After the departure of former creative director Reed Krakoff late last year, it appointed Stuart Vevers from Loewe to oversee an overhaul of its accessible luxury lines, which include handbags and shoes. Mr Vevers’ first collections will be unveiled next month during New York Fashion Week.“Few observers are surprised that Coach has missed forecasts yet again – its had two horrible quarters and a stock buyback of $350m,” noted Rahul Sharma, analyst at Neev Capital, while pointing to China as a potential bright spot for Coach. Same-store sales were up by 10 per cent, although the brand’s retail presence in the country remains small.
49;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2013-10-22T13:38:54Z;Coach profits down on declining US sales;;Coach reported smaller than expected first-quarter profits and sales growth on Tuesday, with weakness in its core US market weighing heavily on the handbag and accessories brand.The company said net income fell 1.6 per cent to $217.9m, or 77 cents a share, from $221.4m, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier.Coach shares dropped 6.9 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.North American sales – which account for almost 70 per cent of the company’s overall revenue – fell 1 per cent to $778m in the three months that ended September 28.Coach’s global sales also slipped 1 per cent to $1.15bn, after currency headwinds virtually eradicated signs of international growth. Analysts on average had expected sales of $1.19bn, according to Thomson Reuters.Some analysts say the company is continuing to struggle with a dramatic rise in competition within the lifestyle luxury sector. New homegrown rivals outperforming Coach include Michael Kors, Kate Spade and Tory Burch.“Coach is still rapidly ceding market share to glossier contenders, and that’s reflected in these sluggish sales figures,” said Rahul Sharma, managing director at Neev Capita, who added that he saw parallels in the company’s performance with Louis Vuitton at the top end of the handbag market.“Despite rolling out new product lines, online operations and heavily reducing logo volume, it will take both brands a long time to build a newer, fresher kind of resonance with customers after oversaturation in the space.”Investors have also been unsettled by recent extensive management changes at the company.Following the departures of both Coach’s North American president and chief operation officer this year, Lew Frankfort, chairman and chief executive, will be replaced by Victor Luis, the company’s chairman and chief commercial officer, in January. Stuart Vevers also replaced Reed Krakoff, executive creative director, in September, after Mr Reed’s 17 years with the company.
50;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2013-09-30T13:21:55Z;Asian route to the top at luxury brands;;Once upon a time the route to the executive suite of a luxury brand led through manufacturing and distribution. Not any more. These days, the way to the top appears to run increasingly through Asia.From the recent appointment of Victor Luis, previously president of Coach’s Asia business, to incoming chief executive of the company, to the naming of Sebastien Suhl, once head of Prada’s operations in Asia, as chief executive of Givenchy last year, it seems experience in the emerging markets of the east has become a de rigueur part of a CEO’s résumé.And Messrs Luis and Suhl are but two of a group that includes Pierre Denis, former Asia managing director of Christian Dior who took the reins at Jimmy Choo in July 2012, and Christopher Zanardi-Landi, who oversaw expansion in China of Louis Vuitton, and returned to Paris last year to become the group’s global executive vice-president.The driving force behind the appointments is partly a significant shift in global spending patterns over the past decade. China, the world’s third-largest consumer of luxury goods, will become number one by 2015, according to Goldman Sachs. While data from Bain Capital suggest that southeast Asian markets, driven by newly wealthy spenders from booming economies such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, grew more than 20 per cent in the past 12 months.Meanwhile, in Europe and the US, luxury sales are increasingly made to emerging market tourists who descend upon London, Paris and New York, rather than local shoppers.Floriane de Saint Pierre, a Parisian headhunter responsible for placing numerous high-profile designers and executives within the world’s leading fashion houses, says these appointments are of no surprise given that more than 50 per cent of most luxury labels’ profits now come from Asia. Coach, led by Lew Frankfort, has publicly stated that mainland China is both its fastest growing market and its largest geographic growth opportunity.“It is clear that Asian customers are younger, savvier and the future face of luxury spending – companies realise that they need leaders who understand them inside out. And executives just don’t have that knowledge without time on the ground,” says Mrs Saint Pierre.The FT’s online hub for creative and commercial coverage of the luxury goods industry, featuring news, views and special reportsIndeed, some in the industry believe the hierarchy has not yet changed enough.“The lack of Asian nationals in senior executive positions across the region is a global issue for the industry – brands can no longer rely on their traditional recruitment technique of poaching from competitors as few people have the necessary savvy and expertise,” explains Gilles Auguste, consultant and author of Luxury Talent Management.The era of the western executive with a translator in mainland China is over, he argues. As pioneers return home to run operations from Europe and the US, luxury groups urgently need to create “leadership duos” that hail from both developed and developing markets.This year has already heralded the appointments of two Asia-born chief executives at leading global brands – albeit men who have honed their skills in the west. Taiwanese founder of Nautica David Chu joined jeweller Georg Jensen in February, and South Korean William Kim arrived at fashion label AllSaints in March.Still, other companies remain sceptical about the idea that managerial expertise should derive from experience of a geographical sector.“We always keep old guard management when entering new territories versus locals from that country or region,” said Neil Clifford, Kurt Geiger’s chief executive, at the Financial Times’ Business of Luxury conference last June.“Long-term employees who understand our business inside out are far better equipped to grow our company, regardless from where in the world that experience has come from.

Coach launched the company with Mr Krakoff in 2008.Mr Krakoff spent 16 years at the helm of Coach’s creative management, and has been widely credited for his role in a turnround at the New York-based company which has a market capitalisation of $15bn.Mr Krakoff, who will show his latest seasonal collection at New York Fashion Week on Wednesday, has become Reed Krakoff’s largest shareholder and will serve as creative director. Valerie Hermann will continue as chief executive and Mr Ein, founder and chief executive of Venturehouse Group, will become chairman.“Part of our decision to pursue this deal has been our belief that when management takes ownership of a business, it makes a sizeable difference to its growth story,” Mr Ein told the Financial Times.He believes the company is carving out a profitable new niche in the crowded global luxury market.“Although there are plenty of American ‘accessible luxury’ labels, very few at the high end are yet to compete successfully with European rivals – we see a huge opportunity for significant expansion that builds on the foundations of the last four years,” he said.Henry Ellenbogen, portfolio manager at T Rowe Price, a mutual fund that has invested in successful US luxury retail companies such as Tory Burch and Michael Kors, said: “We have an extremely strong record in the sector and see this business as a future force to be reckoned with on a global scale.”
52;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2013-08-09T10:49:14Z;Michael Kors v Coach: in and out;The diverging fortunes of two fashion brands;Fashion is a notoriously fickle business. One season you are in, the next you are out. Take the luxury goods companies Michael Kors and Coach. The latter is “aspirational” rather than a super-high-end brand, while Michael Kors is built like a pyramid with a luxury line at the pinnacle balanced on broad-based less expensive lines.Growth at Coach, the older and more mature of the two, began to fade at the end of last year. Its cloth logo bags have fallen out of style, replaced by sleeker studded versions made by the likes of Michael Kors and others. For the past four quarters, same-store sales in Coach’s core North American market have risen less than 1 per cent on average. Michael Kors, by contrast, has seen its comparable store sales in the region grow 37 per cent in the period.In the equity market, companies also go in and out of fashion – growth stocks one day, value stocks the next. Investors in Michael Kors have watched their investment rise 65 per cent over the past year. The shares now trade on 25 times forward earnings. Coach shares, on the other hand, have lost 2 per cent over the same period and have a price-to-earnings multiple of 14 times. Given the two companies’ diverging fortunes, the differing valuations seem fair.Coach is cracking the whip in an attempt to stay relevant. It is trying to reinvent itself as a more upmarket lifestyle brand, selling a complete range of products against mostly handbags and accessories. The management team is also turning over, including the chief executive, the head of North America and the creative director. Stuart Vevers, formerly of brands including Louis Vuitton, Mulberry and Loewe, will take over Coach’s creative direction.Investors in Coach, therefore, have to believe that it can return to growth by broadening its products, including the men’s business, as well as expanding internationally. Helpfully, China has remained strong and Coach’s balance sheet is still robust enough that growth can be bought – it has about $1bn of net cash. Finally, management turnover could end up being a blessing in disguise.Meanwhile, at Michael Kors, already a lifestyle brand, the story is much simpler. Investors are buying its explosive growth, both in the US and globally. Risks involve anything that would derail that growth, chief among them that the brand becomes so popular it cools. A potentially nice but terrifying problem to have.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
53;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2013-07-30T15:20:49Z;Coach loses ground to sleeker rivals;Net income in fourth-quarter drops 12% as US sales slip;Shares in Coach fell almost 10 per cent after the latest results for the upmarket US accessories company indicated it was losing ground to its leaner and glossier rivals.Its fourth quarter net income for 2013 fell by 12 per cent to $221.3m, missing estimates of $251m as a result of weaker sales in North America.Excluding items such as restructuring costs, impairment charges and inventory writedowns, earnings per share for the final quarter rose to 89 cents from 86 cents, roughly in line with analysts’ expectations.But same-store sales slipped by 1.7 per cent in the company’s core market, as increased competition compounded a slump in popularity of its women’s accessories and full-price products. This was the second drop in North American comparable sales in the last three quarters.“We were not satisfied by our performance . . . it has not been business as usual,” said outgoing chief executive Lew Frankfort, adding that the company would take significant steps to reposition itself to improve domestic growth.The company announced plans to streamline its North American store base, closing 16 full-price stores while opening 15 factory discount stores – a clear step towards greater dependence on factory outlet sales for the region.Total net sales of $1.22bn for the quarter to June 29 represented a like-for-like increase of 6 per cent, missing the forecast $1.24bn.For the full year, net sales were $5.08bn – up by 7 per cent when compared with $4.76bn in 2012.Despite its modest overall sales growth, Coach continues to trail fellow US accessible luxury brands like Ralph Lauren and Michael Kors, which have seen a rise in market capitalisation by more than 20 per cent since the start of 2013.While Coach’s international sales rose 7 per cent to $386m for the fourth quarter – and 10 per cent to $1.54bn for the full year – this compares with Michael Kors boast of a near-doubling in sales revenue outside North America in its fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts recently.“Coach has been up and down recently, however it is evident that rival brands are all innovating and growing at a much faster rate,” said Rahul Sharma, managing director at Neev Capital.“Given at one point it had the whole playing field to itself, we’re witnessing serious brand fatigue – not helped by the unsettling upheaval amongst its management team.”In April, Mr Frankfort announced his intention to step down as chief executive at the end of the year and appointed Victor Luis, the company’s president, to replace him.Other contenders for the role, Mike Tucci, North American president, and Jerry Stritzke, chief operating officer, have subsequently announced their departures, while Reed Krakoff, Coach’s creative director, is also leaving in order to focus on his eponymous fashion brand.Coach has agreed to sell the brand to a group led by Mr Krakoff in a deal expected to conclude at the end of the next fiscal quarter. Mr Krakoff will then exit the company, to be replaced by Stuart Vevers who was poached from the LVMH-owned leather accessories brand Loewe.Coach shares were down 8.5 cent to $52.95 by midday in New York trading.
54;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2013-06-02T13:57:09Z;US brands bet big on Europe;Labels target bigger slice of €74.2bn luxury market;US brands such as Ralph Lauren, Coach and Michael Kors are betting on Europe’s retail sector by increasing their presence on the continent with the aim of securing a larger slice of its €74.2bn luxury market.Last Wednesday, Michael Kors reported a 97 per cent increase in fourth-quarter sales revenue for Europe, as well as revealing plans to double both its retail and wholesale presence in the region over the next 12 months.“We’re seeing big business in all local European markets,” said chief executive John Idol last week, as the group reported record full-year earnings of $2.1bn for 2013.“We are probably one of the few companies that can say we are excited about our business in Spain, in Italy and in Greece, as well as healthier markets like the UK, France and Germany.”Ralph Lauren, which derives a fifth of annual sales from the continent, forecast accelerated growth thanks to expansion of their long established store network into under-penetrated central and eastern Europe. Other premium fashion labels including Tory Burch and J Crew have also recently confirmed that they see major growth opportunities within the region.Given that a gloomy economic climate continues to weigh heavily on consumer spending in both the UK and the eurozone, a high-profile move across the Atlantic seems counter-intuitive to many.Yet the European luxury market remains the largest and most lucrative in the world. Data compiled by Bain & Co show that the European region accounted for 35 per cent of all luxury sales by area in 2012, followed by the Americas and Asia-Pacific generating 31 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.Europe’s growth potential, added to the continent’s high household consumer spending per capita, has attracted US brands to the continent’s luxury market. In recent months, many have begun to reap the rewards of pricing decisions made by their European industry rivals.Some continental labels have been plagued recently by flat or negative regional sales: last month, Italian accessories group Tod’s said that total revenue for its latest quarter had slipped by almost 5 per cent thanks to a decline in spending within its core home markets.Claudia D’Arpizio, a Milan-based partner at Bain & Co, said that local consumers were now turning away from certain European luxury brands, after product prices were raised to bring them closer in line with those of mainland China.Chinese tourists were behind one-third of overall luxury sales made in Europe last year. Many choose to shop abroad as a result of heavy-duty taxation placed on imported products at home.“After spending heavily on Chinese expansion, European brands decided to rebalance global prices to try and make good on their investments, thinking it would encourage Chinese to spend more in their domestic market. Instead, they have alienated cash-strapped local consumers at home,” Ms D’Arpizio said.As a result, a growing vacuum at one end of the luxury market is now being filled by US brands offering products at more accessible prices.“These US businesses have pioneered the concept of an affordable luxury lifestyle brand. When you take their diffusion lines into account, their average accessories price point hovers around the $300-400 mark, significantly less than that of European labels,” said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Citigroup.“For recession-hit consumers who have maintained an appetite for stylish product, American labels are becoming an increasingly seductive alternative.”
55;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Coach bags growth amid leadership changes;Boost in earnings for largest US luxury accessories brand;Coach reported better than expected quarterly earnings and raised its annual dividend on Tuesday, sending its shares up as much as 13 per cent, at the same time as North America’s largest luxury accessories maker revamped its leadersip.Third-quarter net income rose 6.2 per cent to $238.9m or 84 cents a share, up from $225m, or 77 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had projected 80 cents a share, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Total sales revenue for the three-month period ended March 30 was $1.19bn, an increase of 7 per cent from the $1.11bn reported for the same quarter last year.Coach also announced the departure of Reed Krakoff in June 2014 after 16 years as the group’s president and executive creative director.His exit in order to focus on his own luxury label – currently owned by Coach and which the company has now said it would consider selling – comes just six months after chief executive Lew Frankfort’s decision to step down, ending a 33-year tenure with Coach.Mr Frankfort was keen to downplay any impact the leadership change might have on the business.“We are expecting a seamless transition ahead, thanks to our excellent creative and management teams and several recent strategic hires that will strengthen and reinforce the implementation of our long-term goals,” he said on Tuesday.However, the departure of the two men – widely considered by many to be the architects of Coach’s success story and dominance in the US accessories sector – comes as the brand implements several core changes to its creative and commercial strategies.The FT’s online hub for creative and commercial coverage of the luxury goods industry, featuring news, views and special reportsThe upmarket label known primarily for its handbags is in the process of repositioning itself as a “global lifestyle brand”, expanding its product offerings to include menswear and footwear collections in order to cater to multi-regional consumer tastes.Coach’s fashion shoe business, which launched in March, had grown rapidly in just five weeks to represent 12 per cent of turnover in stores featuring footwear, said Mike Tucci, president of the company’s North American division.International sales rose 6 per cent to $382m in the quarter, driven in particular by a 40 per cent rise in sales in China. In North America, same-store sales were up by 1 per cent after a drop of 2 per cent in the last quarter, marking a turnround amid increased competition from rival affordable luxury labels such as Michael Kors and Tory Burch.Shares closed 9.87 per cent higher at $55.55 in New York.
56;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2013-01-23T23:39:49Z;Coach must get back in vogue;Aspirational rating unlikely unless handbag maker can show progress;Coach shares have fallen out of fashion. North America’s largest handbag maker had disappointing quarterly sales and profit during the critical holiday season, sending the stock down 16 per cent on Wednesday. Net sales rose 4 per cent year on year, but same-store sales in North America, which account for two-thirds of the business, fell 2 per cent.Competition among “aspirational” brands such as Coach, where price points are lower than for luxury brands, but higher than those at chain stores, is heating up. The notable rival is Michael Kors. Same-store sales at Michael Kors have increased just under 40 per cent on average for the past four quarters compared with 5.7 per cent at Coach, not including the latest quarter (Michael Kors has not reported yet). Yes, Michael Kors is a younger brand in growth mode. But fashion is about staying relevant no matter your age. Coach is trying to adapt with a plan to reinvent itself as a “lifestyle” brand – flogging a broader range of products rather than specialising in handbags.Coach has proven itself to be a durable brand. Quarterly same-store sales in North America have fallen only a handful of other times: the quarter including September 11 2001 and the four that followed the height of the financial crisis. And the average annual return on the stock for 10 years through 2012 was 13 per cent, nearly double that of the S&P 500. But now the company must get back in vogue. It is still unclear what lifestyle Coach wants to represent and finding that kind of vision can be a challenge for a company not rooted in apparel. The shares, trading at a drab and dowdy 12 times next year’s earnings after Wednesday’s slide, show the uncertainty inevitably associated with such a transition. An aspirational rating is unlikely until Coach can show concrete progress.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
57;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2013-01-23T17:44:10Z;Coach weighed down by tough holiday season;Sales stagnate in domestic market;"Shares in Coach tumbled nearly 17 per cent in early trading on Wednesday, as a tough holiday season and sluggish recovery from superstorm Sandy weighed heavily on second-quarter sales for North America’s largest handbag maker.Coach’s , US same-store sales fell for just the third time in 11 years, undermining the company’s leading position in accessible luxury accessories.While overall sales of handbags and accessories of $1.5bn reflected a like-for-like increase of 4 per cent, US sales – which represent around two thirds of the total Coach market – rose by just 1 per cent in the company’s most critical quarter, with same-store sales down by 2 per cent and falling short of expectations.Overall net profit for the period which ended on December 29 rose by just 1.5 per cent to $352m, or $1.23 a share, up from $347m, or $1.18 a share, a year earlier.“We were disappointed by our performance in North America, where the holiday season proved challenging …and competition intensified,” said Lew Frankfort, chief executive.He blamed the slowdown partly on a significant drop-off in foot traffic within both full-price and factory stores, and wholesale division weakness. .The expansion of several newer rivals, including Michael Kors and Tory Burch, has attracted the attention of Coach observers, as the battle for customer loyalty has intensified in the wake of Kors’ successful initial public offering in December 2011.“Michael Kors now offers a far more interesting and diverse product portfolio than Coach, both in terms of design and materials,” said Brian Sozzi, chief equities analyst at NBG Productions.He said changes in Coach’s retail strategy, including more leather in handbags,and “repositioning itself as a lifestyle brand”, suggested “they are starting to feel the heat”.Coach sought to deflect investor fears by pointing to a rise of 12 per cent in international sales to $411m and doubled menswear growth, but increased sector competition has left analysts bearish.“The share price reaction this morning shows a dwindling trust in the brand’s unrealistic expectations of its position; market dynamics are shifting far quicker than Coach’s management has internally planned,” Mr Sozzi said.Coach shares fell to $50.98 in New York."

Despite all that ballyhoo about the absolutely extraordinary unprecedented growth of the luxury market, etc, etc, only three luxury CEOs actually make the list. Oops.But who are these unmasked men? (They are all men.) Lew Frankfort, CEO of Coach, who leads the industry pack by a wide margin at number 21 – the only luxury name in the top 50 (by standard definition); Sidney Toledano of Dior, at 68; and Patrick Thomas, CEO of Hermès, who is retiring this year, who comes in at 72. Chapeau, guys.There are some consumer giants, to be sure – Pablo Isla Alvarez de Tejera of Inditex, aka Zara’s owner, who is 52; Blake Nordstrom, of Nordstrom’s department stores, 80; and Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, who is number two, and who is about to make a play in luxury (more on that in tomorrow’s post). And David Simon, of Simon Property, the luxury developers, is number eight. But I find it interesting there are so few others from the haute ranks. There are a lot more, for example, from the world of commodities. In fact, it makes me rethink some of my assumptions about these brands and their supersonic growth.It also makes me wonder if Amazon really should go after the high-end after all. Is that the way to greater returns? Have we all been drinking the Koolaid? Seduced by the image?And you can’t say: “Well, there’s an issue because the HBR failed to take into account the designer side of the equation” – because Apple’s Steve Jobs is number one, and he never underestimated the role of aesthetics. Besides, Mr Toledano had that whole John Galliano/anti-Semitism glitch two years ago, and it doesn’t seem to have hurt them one weeny bit. Indeed, this seems to indicate that designer kudos and share price have very little to do with each other at all – design itself, of course, being another matter.Anyway, take a read of the ranking. Tell me what you think…"

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
60;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2012-07-31T18:25:13Z;Coupon cut hits Coach in US market;;Coach shares tumbled 18 per cent as meagre sales growth in North America signalled more caution among US consumers and tougher competition from rivals in the market for handbags and accessories.The US handbag brand said like-for-like sales in North America rose just 1.7 per cent from a year ago in the past quarter, much worse than Wall Street forecasts that it would come close to repeating the previous quarter’s 6.7 per cent growth.Analysts had been watching for signs of weakness in China, where Hugo Boss, the German fashion group, said on Tuesday that its sales growth had dropped sharply amid a slowdown in Chinese economic growth.But while Coach’s China business grew steadily, its US troubles came as a shock to the market, even though businesses selling more mundane products – such as Starbucks – reported a deterioration in consumer spending in June.Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors described Coach’s North American sales as “pretty ugly”. The company’s shares fell 18.1 per cent to $49.60, their lowest level in nearly a year.Part of their weakness stemmed from a decision to stop offering discount coupons at Coach outlet and factory stores, a move that turned off consumers still eager for bargains against the backdrop of a tepid US economic recovery.Ms Widlitz said: “They went away from coupons and were so confident they could get more [profit] margin. And guess what? The consumer told them: ‘You’re wrong’.”She said Coach had fallen into the same trap as JC Penney, the US department store, which posted a 19 per cent fall in quarterly sales earlier this year after replacing its array of discounts with a more steady pricing policy.“Consumers need a reason, an excuse, to feel OK about spending money on things you might not need,” Ms Widlitz said. Coach reinstated its coupons later in the past quarter.In China, Coach said it had recorded “double-digit” sales growth at stores open at least a year, while revenues rose nearly 60 per cent thanks to the opening of new stores.Claus-Dietrich Lahrs, chief executive of Hugo Boss, said Chinese consumers were feeling “kind of insecure” as his company reported quarterly sales growth of 1 per cent in China.Hugo Boss shares fell 5.5 per cent to €82.03, hit by a profit forecast that was lower than market expectations.In North America, Michael Binetti, an analyst at UBS, said Coach’s performance reflected intensified price competition from the likes of Michael Kors and Kate Spade, rather than broader economic worries.“There has been very good market growth for the category, but the competitive dynamics have obviously got more challenging,” he said.While it did not provide a figure for the quarter, Coach said the overall market for women’s handbags and accessories in North America grew by 10 per cent in the past 12 months.

62;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2012-01-27T18:02:15Z;Luxury brands long to bond with China’s elite;;Diamond earrings glistened, stiletto heels tapped and the sequins on a mermaid gown shimmered as Miss China sashayed down a New York catwalk, passing within a perfume waft of a compatriot named Lina Li.Ms Li was among a group of wealthy Chinese who had paid for a behind-the-scenes glimpse of western luxury at Bergdorf Goodman, a genteel department store for the affluently elegant, which put on a fashion show in their honour this week.“I liked it a lot. It was my first fashion show,” said an enthusiastic Ms Li. She glanced down at her sweater and jeans and added sheepishly: “I didn’t dress properly.”The co-founder of a Shanghai recruitment agency, Ms Li is the kind of person that Bergdorf Goodman and other luxury retailers want to meet. But if the feeling is mutual, so is a measure of puzzled incomprehension.Chinese shoppers have become a fixture of the luxury retail scene in the US and Europe, drawn by prices that can be up to 50 per cent lower than tax-elevated levels at home. But many upscale brands have yet to bond with the truly wealthy – China’s million millionaires.“It’s like they’re dancing with each other but sometimes going past each other,” says Christine Lu, co-founder and chief executive of Affinity China, a luxury club that organised the New York tour, named Dragon Week, to coincide with the lunar new year.That is why several brands agreed to host some of the 80-plus Chinese participants, among them Mont Blanc, the pen maker, which squeezed a Steinway piano into a store for a recital by Lang Lang, the Chinese pianist.Piaget, a watch brand, unveiled a $58,000 timepiece engraved with a gold dragon. Estée Lauder gave them a tour of its eponymous founder’s corner office and the first samples of an expensive new eye balm. J Mendel, a fur coat maker, showed them its workshop.According to provisional figures from the Chinese Tourism Academy, Chinese took 70m overseas trips in 2011 and spent a total of $69bn, an increase of 25 per cent from the previous year. They are also increasingly discerning.Even when luxury brands get the basics of hiring Mandarin speakers and accepting the China UnionPay credit card, Ms Lu says that misunderstandings with the wealthy can still arise.Western luxury retailers like to ingratiate themselves by building “unique relationships” that depend on employees learning about customers’ lives and anticipating their needs.But Ms Lu says that China engenders a “natural distrust” of pushy sales associates and that many of the rich guard their privacy jealously. “We cater to a demographic that doesn’t want you to know who they are.”Retailers can also make the error of judging people by appearances. “I remember one guy,” says Kaan Cedric Turk, US general manager for Zilli, a French clothes maker that sells a $26,000 ostrich leather jacket.“He came without speaking a word of English. Wearing sneakers and a raincoat … And he spent an amount of money that was mind-boggling.”Bain & Co says that in 2010 one-quarter of the Rmb212bn that mainland Chinese spent on luxuries was outside the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. Coach, the handbag brand, says that at peak travel times Chinese tourists can account for 15-20 per cent of its sales in New York, Las Vegas and Hawaii.While ordinary Chinese overwhelmingly prefer group travel, research by the Hurun Report last year found that 80 per cent of the wealthy eschew it and its association with hurried bus tours.Dragon Week provides the opposite. “It’s kind of like a concierge service, offering them access and experiences they can’t get otherwise,” says Renee Hartman of the China Luxury Network, part of Affinity China.Champagne is abundant and the guests – most of them under 50 and proficient in English – get a list of events and choose their own itinerary. For a Dragon Week pass, excluding flights and hotels, they paid nearly $4,000.China’s rich are no more homogenous than anywhere else’s, so while some seek pampering, Affinity helped others to research private schools and buying a US home.As a vogue for bling fades, many wealthy Chinese are also eager to understand why the high prices of luxuries are warranted. “They are interested in understanding the history of the product, how it’s made, the quality, how to take care of the leather,” says Victor Luis, president of Coach’s international business.Ms Li, the Shanghai recruitment agent, came for something else. “We are looking for new lifestyles,” she says at a cocktail party as Diane von Furstenberg and Oscar de la Renta, the designers, greeted guests nearby.“I don’t know fashion. I want to know the world a little bit more. I’ve been working hard for 10 years. I didn’t have time to buy.”
63;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2012-01-27T00:31:05Z;Double-digit growth for top luxury accessories labels;Salvatore Ferragamo, Tod’s and Coach all post big gains;Salvatore Ferragamo, Tod’s and Coach have reported double-digit sales growth in their annual reports, confirming that 2011 was a stellar year for the world’s leading luxury accessory labels.Salvatore Ferragamo, parent company of the Italian luxury label famed for its leather accessories, reported total revenues of €986.5m for fiscal year 2011, a just over 26 per cent increase at current exchange rates from the year before. Footwear, handbags and leather products made up 74 per cent of the group’s total turnover.International markets, with the exception of Japan, boosted revenues by around 30 per cent compared to a year earlier. The top performing region, Asia-Pacific, saw a 33.5 per cent rise in market growth and a turnover of €357.7m, accounting for 35 per cent of the group’s overall sales worldwide. Latin America also saw a boom in like-for-like sales, which were up 34.5 per cent.At the Salvatore Ferragamo autumn/winter 2012 men's wear show held last week in Milan, Michele Norsa, the label’s chief executive, said the euro’s weakness against the dollar was an advantage for the Florence-based company. “ The slipping euro can help boost European luxury companies’ earnings, as their foreign revenues are worth more in home currency terms,” he told Bloomberg.“Crucially, despite the ongoing debt crisis, the reputational value of the ‘Made in Italy’ label in terms of quality manufacturing and heritage has not been marred – our global sales are still very strong,” said Mr Norsa.Separately, Tod’s Group closed 2011 with a 13.5 per cent rise in sales at €893.7m, helped by strong gains in Asia and robust growth in its Tod’s footwear business. Revenues for the Tod’s accessories label, the Italian group’s primary earner, climbed 19.8 per cent to €487.6m.Sales at Hogan, the group’s smaller, contemporary accessories line, gained 4.7 per cent to €281m. The company said the performance was hampered by the struggling economy of Italy, Hogan’s main market. Footwear, accessories and leather goods made up €791.5m of the groups’s 2011 revenues.Industry insiders have commented on the accessories spending trend by the luxury consumer.“There has been a structural shift in spending over the last decade, where women are spending more and more on their accessories,” said Lew Frankfort, chairman and chief executive officer of Coach, explaining that the category has recently grabbed a significant proportion of market share from apparel lines, growing 5 per cent to 10 per cent over the course of 2011.The group’s pricing strategy – Coach-branded bags can range from anywhere between $200 and $1000 – has meant that more aspirational buyers can get their hands on a luxury label piece, for less.The US-based handbag maker announced a 14.5 per cent jump in second-quarter net sales to $1.45bn on Tuesday, thanks to competitive pricing and retail expansion in Asia. The company, which already has 65 stores in and around China, plans to open up to 30 more by the end of 2012.Female customers will not be the brand’s sole target. The majority of these accessories stores will be “dual-gender”, hoping to cash in on the booming high-end men's wear market in Asia. Coach has said that it expects its men’s bag lines to grow to over $1bn in annual sales within the next three to five years.

The benchmark US index had opened sharply lower after Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, said it would likely declare Greece in “selective default” once the country concludes its debt restructuring, but the index pared losses on positive US economic data.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 12,675.75 but the Nasdaq Composite index ticked up 0.1 per cent to 2,786.64Stocks were further boosted after the close of trading, when Apple reported record fiscal first-quarter profits and revenues, easily surpassing analyst expectations as iPhone sales surged. That sent Nasdaq futures up 24½ points in after-hours trading.Apple rose as much as 12 per cent to $468 in after-hours after it closed in regular trading at $420.41, down 1.6 per cent.Tech stocks had already outperformed after fourth-quarter sales at Western Digital, the hard disc drive manufacturer came in significantly above expectations, given the disruption to the company’s supply chain caused by flooding in Thailand. Shares rose 6.3 per cent to $36.88.“Our thesis that WD can systematically recover and gain share is playing out much faster than anticipated with much higher profit,” Ben Reitzes at Barclays Capital told clients.That helped semiconductor manufacturers, which build components for hard disc drives, and the Philadelphia Sox index of semiconductor stocks climbed 0.4 per cent.Data storage computer manufacturer EMC Corp climbed 7.3 per cent to $25.14 as fourth-quarter earnings rose almost a third year-on-year. Disruption to Western Digital’s supply chain had left EMC facing higher prices for hard disc drives, “but the company has done a great job of getting its allocation of disc drives without suffering too much margin degradation,” said Jason Noland at RW Baird.Nasdaq futures accelerated further in after-hours trading, after Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings that were 30 per cent above consensus expectations, and also offered strong guidance for the current quarter.Verizon Communications fell 1.6 per cent to $37.79 after reporting an overall net loss of $2.02bn, hampered by pension costs and lower margins on smartphone sales.Investors continued to express doubts in the new management team at Research In Motion, sending shares in the BlackBerry handset manufacturer down 3.5 per cent to 15.01, barely 50 cents higher than they started the year.Investment bank Jefferies said RIM is at a “cost disadvantage” compared with other smartphone producers and that significant restructuring will be necessary to compete in the future.McDonald’s reported strong fourth-quarter earnings with net income rising 11 per cent from a year ago but share sold off 2.2 per cent to $98.75.Insurance group Travelers narrowly missed analyst estimates, logging $618m of net income in the fourth quarter compared with forecasts of $620m but its shares fell 3.8 per cent to $58.00 for the worst performance in the Dow Jones.Kimberly-Clark also succumbed to disappointment surrounding its fourth-quarter earnings. The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies reported that net income fell 19 per cent from a year ago and that it expected a “difficult” start to 2012. Its shares were off 1.7 per cent to $72.27.Coach climbed 5.8 per cent to $67.97 as the luxury retailer defied the gloom cast by Tiffany, which earlier this year reported a year-on-year fall in holiday sales at its flagship New York store. Same-store sales at Coach’s North American stores were up 8.8 per cent.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, fell 1.7 per cent to $36.86 after fourth-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates because of lower output at its Australian operations.
65;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2012-01-24T18:04:50Z;Positive outlook on Luxottica’s horizon;;Sales at Luxottica, maker of Rayban sunglasses and owner of Sunglass Hut, rose 10 per cent last year at constant exchange rates, to €6.22bn. The world’s largest eyewear manufacturer and retailer said it was positive about the outlook for this year.Luxottica said consumers had continued to shop in its stores and that wholesale trade was “excellent” last year. Sales even of its premium and luxury eyewear ranges, Rayban and Oakley, were “strong”.In the fourth quarter, amid the threat a global economic slowdown, the Italy-based group said sales continued to grow compared with the same period a year earlier across all its operations in the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America.Luxottica said it expected 2012 to be “positive” for its retail division, while it considered the outlook for its wholesale business was “promising” on the basis of orders and consumer reception to its new eyewear licence with the US luxury goods brand Coach.Andrea Guerra, chief executive, said he expected the group to reap the benefits this year of recent expansion in Latin America with the acquisition of local brand Tecnol in Brazil and the expansion of Sunglass Hut into Mexico.

But large commercial lending banks, which have rallied strongly this year, retreated somewhat with Bank of America off 2.7 per cent to $6.61 and Citigroup down 2.7 per cent to $30.74.Despite Friday’s losses, bank stocks had a strong week overall. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs both advanced more than 4.5 per cent, while Citi and BofA both hit two-month highs during the week.The S&P 500 came within touching distance of 1,300 for the first time since the end of July, as it reached five-month highs on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Through Wednesday’s close the benchmark US index had enjoyed its best start to the year since 2006, and it ended the week up 0.9 per cent at 1,289.09 – a 2.5 per cent gain for the year.A recent run of positive US economic data was halted, as December retail sales disappointed, but some equity analysts said US markets should continue to “decouple” from European counterparts.“Everything is set for a rally, from seasonal tailwinds to resilient data, if the S&P 500 doesn’t break out soon, I don’t think it will at all this year,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at RW Baird.The Dow Jones climbed 0.5 per cent over the week to 12,422.06, lagging the S&P 500 as large energy stocks weighed on the blue-chip index.Chevron fell 2.1 per cent to $106.09, after the company issued a profit warning, citing falling margins at its Gulf Coast refineries. ExxonMobil shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $84.88 over the week.The Nasdaq Composite index fared better, climbing 1.4 per cent to 2,710.67, as China’s plans to double solar energy capacity in 2012 boosted stocks. SunPower Corp ended the week up 13.2 per cent to $7.55.Tiffany fell 10.1 per cent to $59.10 over the week as the luxury department store cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its flagship New York store.Asia-Pacific same-store sales rose 12 per cent year on year, but investor reaction suggested emerging market growth may not inoculate luxury brands like Tiffany and Coach against developed market worries.“No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach shares slipped 1 per cent to $62.02 over the week.Urban Outfitters ended the week off 9.2 per cent to $25.13, after investors responded to the unexpected resignation of Glen Senk as chief executive, by sending shares down 19 per cent in just one day.Erika Maschmeyer at RW Baird downgraded the stock to a “hold” equivalent from a “buy” equivalent, while Paul Lejuez at Nomura worried for the retailer’s turnround prospects, telling clients: “If Glen can’t do it, we wonder who can.”Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies suffered as the US natural gas price hit multiyear lows, falling more than 5 per cent on Wednesday, and again on Thursday.Cabot Oil & Gas retreated 16.7 per cent to $67.13 and Range Resources was off
10.8 per cent to $54.16.Supermarket chain Supervalu fell 14.5 per cent to $7.04 as the company recorded a fourth-quarter loss of $750m for its third fiscal quarter.Analysts had been expecting a profit of a similar magnitude, according to Bloomberg data.The company’s margins held steady and Supervalu said that, once one-off costs associated with store closures and employee severance payments were factored out, the business had been profitable.Homebuilders rallied as Lennar declared earnings of $30.3m, only $1.7m down on the same period in 2010.Factoring in house price moves, the company’s margin on home sales improved to 19.4 per cent, suggesting some health in the property market.Lennar shares climbed 7.9 per cent to $22.01 and DR Horton was up 7.2 per cent to $13.91."
67;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2012-01-10T22:12:55Z;Tiffany loses lustre amid sluggish sales;Luxury brands struggle in mature markets;Shares in Tiffany & Co fell 10.5 per cent to $59.94 as the luxury retailer it cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its New York store.November and December sales in Tiffany’s Americas region, which includes Canada and Latin America, were up just 2 per cent compared with 2010, while sales at its flagship Fifth Avenue store falling 1 per cent, despite strong spending by tourists.Asia-Pacific same-store sales climbed 12 per cent but investors had been focused on developed markets since Tiffany forecast “weakness” in European and north-eastern US sales in December, an announcement which had also triggered a big share price fall.The sell-off suggests the rise of an emerging market middle class may not inoculate the likes of Tiffany, Coach and Ralph Lauren against developed market worries. “No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach fell 0.8 per cent to $62.33 while Ralph Lauren fell more than 3 per cent at the opening before recovering to close up 0.7 per cent to $147.32.Elsewhere, US markets were in bullish mood, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,292.08, its highest level since the end of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,462.47 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent to 2,702.5.“Everything is in place for a big rally,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “If the market doesn’t break out now, I don’t think it’s going to at all this year.”Life Technologies rose 8.3 per cent to $46.17 after unveiling a DNA reader.But BorgWarner, which makes powertrains for engines, had the best performance in the S&P, climbing 12.3 per cent to $72.25 after forecasting record sales and earnings growth.Urban Outfitters, the clothing retailer, said Glen Senk, chief executive, had resigned on Monday. That sent its shares down as much as 11 per cent to $25.91 after hours.Elsewhere, the rally was broadly cyclical. Materials and industrial stocks were to the fore after Alcoa kicked off the quarterly earnings season on Monday. Alcoa reported a first loss from continuing operations in two years but was positive about demand in 2012. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $9.44.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China, rose 2.8 per cent to $21.33. Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 4 per cent to $68.82.Bank investors continued to show signs of optimism, with Bank of America climbing 5.7 per cent to $6.63, while Citigroup climbed 3.2 per cent to $30 for its highest close in a month.“Absent new negatives equals a positive?” asked Goldman Sachs analysts, summing up the attitude of investors to large universal banks, which have emerged bruised but intact from big share price falls in 2011.Shares in Goldman climbed 3.8 per cent to $98.33 and Morgan Stanley was up 4.3 per cent to $16.89, although data showed trading levels in capital markets were down as much as 36 per cent compared with 2011 so far this year, which may bode ill for investment banks.Separately, Goldman Sachs warned against buying regional bank stocks, which have appreciated 20 per cent as a group since October lows, arguing price-earnings ratios were still high on a forty-year basis. Investors paid little heed, with Regions Financial up 3.8 per cent to $4.70 and Zions Bancorp up 1.6 per cent to $18.17.Shares in the New York Stock Exchangeclimbed 4.6 per cent to $27.79 on an Financial Times report that European regulators would block its merger with Deutsche Börse. The proposed tie up has weighed on NYSE shares, as Deutsche Börse’s price fell with European financials last year.A new year rally, which had seen shares in Juniper Networks appreciate as much as 10 per cent, came to an end as the wireless network provider said it would miss fourth-quarter earnings guidance. Shares fell 0.9 per cent to $21.50.Credit Suisse analysts said internet service providers would “continue to look to suppliers [such as Juniper] to deliver greater performance at lower cost,” as households consumed ever more bandwidth on unlimited packages, without corresponding revenue growth for ISPs. Shares in internet service provider WebMD fell 28.5 per cent to $26.25 as it pre-announced a fourth-quarter revenue miss and said its chief executive had resigned. Yahoo shares were little affected, up 0.3 per cent to $15.51.Most of the share price action appeared driven by WebMD’s decision to terminate “discussions with several potential acquirers of the company.” Speculation of a takeover by Yahoo had seen the company’s market capitalisation climb more than a third since October 6.
68;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-12-14T22:59:25Z;Kors shares open 25% higher;;Shares of Michael Kors, an upmarket fashion and accessories brand, jumped 25 per cent on their debut on the New York Stock Exchange.On Wednesday night, Kors launched the biggest-ever public offering in US fashion, selling more shares than expected in a deal that will value the company at nearly $4bn.The New York flotation surpassed the $882m offering of Ralph Lauren in 1997, according to Dealogic, despite growing concern over the resilience of luxury spending.The deal was heavily oversubscribed and priced at $20 a share, above the projected range of $17 to $19. Investors in the company sold 47.2m shares, more than the 41m initially offered and raising $944m. The sale valued the company at $3.8bn.In trading, the shares opened at $25, and as of midday are at $24.25, a rise of 21.3 per cent. That is better than the average US IPO this year, which saw a first-day gain of 10 per cent, but well below the biggest “pops” of the year, such as the 109 per cent jump for LinkedIn.Michael Kors is a high-profile brand in the US, where it earned 89 per cent of its $758m revenue in its past fiscal year, but it wants to expand its presence in Europe and Asia, where it lags behind rivals such as Coach, Burberry, Hermès, Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs.At the IPO price, Michael Kors’ valuation is equal to 44 times its net earnings in the past four quarters, compared with Burberry’s valuation of 24 times trailing earnings and a multiple of 19 at Coach.Vanessa Friedman blogs on the fashion/luxury industry from both a corporate and consumer point of viewStacey Widlitz, an independent retail analyst, said: “It’s coming to the market at a time where we’re questioning the rate of growth in luxury, so the valuation …is quite expensive compared to peers.”Luxury has been one of the most resilient parts of retail since the global financial crisis, thanks to the continued spending of well-off consumers but in recent months stock market volatility and the eurozone crisis have raised concerns over whether they will retrench. “The idea is to get this IPO in before we see any downturn in luxury,” said Ms Widlitz.The company was founded 30 years ago by Michael Kors and continues to make clothes that are classic rather than trendy. However, the majority of its wholesale and retail sales now come from accessories such as handbags, leather goods, jewellery and watches.The company is registered in the British Virgin Islands and has its headquarters in Hong Kong.Since 2004, awareness of the company in the US has been boosted by the role of founder Mr Kors as a judge on Project Runway, a reality television show about fashion designers.Mr Kors is the company’s chief creative officer and the IPO will reduce his stake in the business from 11.7 per cent to less than 9 per cent.Unlike many companies that take months to build investor demand, Michael Kors filed to go public just two weeks ago.Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique, an investor advisory, said the deal came together quickly thanks to the company’s established brand and its strong following among international financiers.“Investors consider them a comparable name to Burberry and Prada in the high-end market,” he said. “They also have free advertising on the television show.”Despite its Hong Kong base, Michael Kors decided to go public in the US after companies such as Prada debuted poorly in Hong Kong. Prada’s $2.1bn IPO in June priced at the bottom of its projected range and the shares fell in first-day trading.Michael Kors’ biggest shareholder is Sportswear Holdings, a private equity group led by Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll that also owns stakes in Tommy Hilfiger Asia and Hackett.It acquired a majority stake in Michael Kors in 2003, which will be diluted to 37.7 per cent from 51.9 per cent by the share offering.

Metal, mining and energy stocks soared on rising commodity prices, and hopes that monetary easing in China would offer support to the country’s resource-intensive construction industry.Steel stocks performed particularly strongly with Alpha Natural Resources, which mines metallurgical coal used in steelmaking, rising 28.2 per cent to $24.11, AK Steel Holding rose 16.8 per cent to $8.22 and US Steel climbed 24.9 per cent to $27.81.“The Policy accommodation may support Chinese steel consumption, reducing the chances of oversupply, which would depress prices and hurt US companies,” said Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie.But other analysts said the rally had more to do with trading patterns than fundamentals.“Steel stocks are heavily short sold, and shorts are buying shares to cover their positions,” said David Lipschitz at Crédit Agricole Securities.Some energy stocks sat out the rally, as investors remained wary of companies carrying debt.Transocean fell 3.9 per cent to $42.76, after announcing plans to issue 29.9m new shares and raise up to $2.5bn in the corporate bond market, to refinance outstanding debt.Robin Shoemaker at Citigroup said the dilution effect could reduce earnings per share by as much as 55 cents to $3.85 in 2012.“We believe Transocean is partially financing with equity to meet near term liquidity obligations while trying to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating,” he told clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 9.5 per cent, led by Citigroup, which climbed 19.2 per cent to $28.17 and Morgan Stanley, up 17 per cent to $15.52.Hospital owners and medical device manufacturers had a tough day on Friday after Wells Fargo said Medicare carriers in 11 key states will perform pre-payment audits for inpatient hospital linked to certain cardiovascular and orthopaedic conditions from the start of the new year.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare fell 10.7 per cent on Friday to end the week up just 0.2 per cent to $4.18. Device manufacturer St Jude Medical tumbled 7 per cent, to end the week up 3 per cent to $35.83.Western Digital Corporation rose 25.8 per cent to $31.44, hitting levels not seen since flooding forced the hard disk drive manufacturer to close production facilities in Thailand more than a month ago.The company raised its current quarter revenue forecast to at least $1.8bn from a previous maximum of $1.25bn, as supply chain pressure eased.Fertiliser companies underperformed broad markets, as concerns mounted that Indian farmers will import less nutrient.Mosaic and Potash Corporation suffered losses early in the week as Indian farming co-operatives pushed for discounts on potash imports of up to 35 per cent in dollar terms, to reflect rupee weakness.Mosaic ended the week up 3.8 per cent to $51.78 and Potash Corporation up 4 per cent to $42.29.CF Industries, which supplies India with nitrogen-based fertilisers, had fared better earlier in the week, but fell Friday to close the week up just 0.7 per cent to $140.73, as reports suggested Indian orders for urea declined significantly in November compared with October."
70;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-11-30T16:03:05Z;Coach to list on Hong Kong stock exchange;Luxury label will be the first US company to list on Hong Kong Stock Exchange;American luxury label Coach is set to become the first US company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with trading scheduled to begin this Thursday.The accessories label, which generated sales of $880m last year, will retain a primary listing in New York. No new stock or capital will be raised through the new secondary listing.The group has applied to issue 293.6m depository receipts, with each depository receipt representing one-tenth of one share of common stock.The move is widely seen as an attempt by Coach to raise its profile and brand awareness with potential eastern investors, as the group seeks to capitalize on enormous growth recently seen in Asia’s luxury market.“This year we estimate consumers in and around China to approach 10 per cent of Coach’s overall sales,” Lew Frankfort, the group’s chief executive, said recently. “Over the next 3 to 5 years, we predict that will grow further to 20 per cent.”Coach has been aggressively expanding its retail presence in the region, where it generated sales of $185m in 2011. There are 71 Coach stores in China, with plans to open in a further 30 locations by the end of 2012.The group has also been in negotiations to take direct control of its retail businesses in Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia, giving it greater control over brand activity within its fastest growing market.The decision by Coach follows in the footsteps of several Western prestige brands that have gone public in Hong Kong this year, including Prada, Samsonite and L’Occitane.

American has called time on attempts to renegotiate pension and benefit costs with pilots.Semiconductor manufacturer Corning suffered heavy selling after unexpectedly lowering fourth quarter sales guidance.The stock fell 10.8 per cent to $13.19, as the company said sales of a major LCD screen product will rise only 5 to 10 per cent quarter on quarter, compared to prior guidance of a 20 per cent sequential rise.Hospira fell 9.1 per cent to $28.17 after RBC Capital Markets said a long running Food and Drug Administration investigation into the medical device marker’s main manufacturing plant may cause “widespread” production breakdowns, and take two to three years to correct.Netflix fell 3.4 per cent to $67.57 after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s debt another notch, citing the risks involved in the video streaming website’s capital intensive overseas expansion.Home Depot was the standout performer in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. Shares rose 5.3 per cent to $38.96 after the company’s chief financial officer told an analyst breakfast meeting that November sales had been better than expected.Hard-drive manufacturers Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $27.80.The company was following on the coat tails of rival Seagate Technology, which was up 3.7 per cent to $16.58, after releasing a positive update to fourth-quarter guidance, even as widespread flooding in Thailand wreaks havoc with supply chains.“[Seagate’s] guidance update was driven by increasing industry-wide prices [for hard drives] rather than anything company specific,” said Joe Yoo at Citigroup.Mr Yoo said rising prices should reduce Western Digital’s fourth quarter net loss to roughly $150m, compared to the company’s most recent guidance of $300m.Banks gave back some of their gains from Monday’s rally.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.31, leaving the investment bank up just 0.4 per cent for the week, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up almost 3 per cent.Bank of America was down 3.2 per cent to $5.08, after touching a new year low of $5.03 during the day.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran gave bank executives some cheer, arguing retrenchment by European lenders from the US markets could benefit midsize US banks.“This creates an opportunity for US banks such as US Bancorp, PNC and Wells Fargo who are big enough to serve large corporate borrowers and are now able to replace Europeans as they pull out,” Mr Foran wrote to clients.PNC was up 1.2 per cent to $50.83.

The company declined to comment on specific plans, but has been eyeing an entry into the UK market for some time. Another US retailer, lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret, has signed a deal to open premises at the Stratford development, although the opening will be delayed to coincide with its flagship New Bond Street store in London’s west end next year, according to people familiar with the situation.In another international first for the soon to be opened scheme, Bosco Sport, the Russian sportswear retailer and a sponsor of the forthcoming winter Olympics in Sochi, is on course to take its first shop outside Russia and Ukraine at the development. Westfield, Bosco and Victoria’s Secret all declined to comment.News of the likely signings comes as overseas retailers continue to flock to the UK, despite the economic backdrop that is forcing Britons to rein in spending as they grapple with higher food and fuel prices.Coach, a US accessories retailer, will open its UK flagship in Bond Street early next month as it pushes into Europe. Forever 21, the US fashion chain, recently opened on London’s Oxford Street and will be one of the anchor stores in Westfield Stratford City when it opens its doors on September 13.Crate and Barrel has already adapted its website to allow orders to be taken from UK customers, but plans to establish a physical presence have until now been stymied by the high rents and inflexible lease structures within the UK retail property market.The retailer’s transatlantic move comes as John Lewis begins competing with the chain in New York through a revamped website.John Burton, the Westfield director in charge of the £1.45bn ($2.37bn) Stratford project, declined to comment on individual deals.However, in an interview with the Financial Times he said: “Retailers recognise that the games in themselves bring an aura to this development.” He added that high numbers of international visitors would produce “a halo effect”.“If you look at Stratford now, and what it was like five years ago, it’s extraordinary,” said David Reiss, founder of international fashion chain Reiss, which was one of the first chains to commit to taking space.“A lot of retailers were questioning where the core customer was going to come from, and we worried about the quality of other retailers who would be in there,” he said.“But Westfield has managed to attract a lot of big brands.”
73;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-08-26T14:29:02Z;Wall Street sticks to positive territory;;"Wall Street ended the week more than 4 per cent up, its first weekly rise since mid-July.Stocks had edged up during a see-saw week in anticipation of Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s Jackson Hole speech. Bulls expected him to signal a new round of quantitative easing, or at least detail other policy options at his disposal. In the end Mr Bernanke promised only to act “as appropriate”.But despite a dip immediately following the speech on Friday morning, the S&P 500 rallied strongly to close at 1,176.79, up 1.5 per cent on the day, 4.5 per cent for the week.Yet despite the week’s gains, the broad index has not been able to scale and hold the psychologically important 1,200 mark. Selling bears offered resistance whenever the index neared that level.“There was much anticipation given the potential binary market outcome,” Robin Lowe, head of equities at Man Group, said of Ben Bernanke’s speech. “However, the near-term interpretation has been one of minimal change.”Market lows last week meant “lots of funds who successfully held on to shorts have been increasingly cutting those positions as those stocks hit the bottom end of price targets”, according to Mr Lowe.But he warned that caution among hedge fund managers could hold back any rally. “For now, funds are largely in a wait-and-see mode. Few hedge funds are initiating aggressive new long-term positions or changes in view.“Some funds might also be facing redemptions in coming weeks, from investors who opted to take money out when markets fell earlier in the month, but had to serve a notice period,” he added.Financials were the big gainers this week, with bank stocks in the S&P 500 index up 5.1 per cent. But despite, Warren Buffett’s $5bn investment in Bank of America, Citigroup led the pack, up 11.2 per cent at $29.84.BofA was up 10.5 per cent at $7.76. But concerns persist about legal risk from mortgage selling and foreclosure practices, as well as the size of the bank’s mortgage book.Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr said the “sell-off [in BofA] may be overdone” and set a target price of $11, even before Mr Buffett’s investment.But Mr Schorr said the stock still compared unfavourably with Citigroup, citing Citi’s better tier one capital ratio, 6.7 per cent to BofA’s 5.1 per cent; smaller mortgage portfolio ($431bn to $1,600bn at BofA); and less legal risk from continuing claims relating to mortgage mis-selling and trading.Sprint Nextel shares were a surprise faller in a week where it was reported that the cellular network provider would be able to offer customers the iPhone 5 later this year. The company’s shares were down 5 per cent for the week at $3.25.The iPhone reports had led Sprint shares to rise 10 per cent on Tuesday, trading as high as $3.66, the biggest single day rise for the company this year.“Sprint has been losing market share in the lucrative post-paid [monthly contract] market to Verizon and AT&T, because they have superior smartphones. With the iPhone 5 it can compete for those all-important high-margin customers. It could be very significant,” according to Michael Nelson at Mizuho Securities.But investors reassessed the move over the week, and Sprint was among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index for three successive days, as analysts warned the iPhone 5 will hurt margins, even if it attracts subscribers.“The subsidy [network providers pay iPhone users] is $400 per phone. That is almost double that of other phones,” UBS analyst John Hodulik warned. “The impact on Sprint’s margins and cash flow is likely to be more severe than expected given its already low level of profitability.”Sprint shares have now declined almost 40 per cent since the start of market volatility earlier this month, while its competitors Verizon and AT&T are flat for the month, significantly outperforming the market.Tiffany & Co was up 20.0 per cent for the week at $69.01, after a strong quarterly earnings report. Strong demand from the Asia-Pacific region drove quarterly earnings of 86 cents a share, well above expectations of about 71 cents a share.The world’s second-largest luxury jewellery retailer raised its earnings per share forecast for the year ending January 2012 to $3.75 from $3.55.Shares in leather retailer Coach, up 19.2 per cent at $54.76, capped a rare good week for retailers, as consumer discretionary shares in the S&P 500 rose 6.0 per cent, one of the best performing sectors, after several weeks of heavy losses.Zillow shares were up 31.0 per cent at $31.38 as the online property search company reported a profit in its first quarterly results as a publicly traded company. The shares are now trading well above the IPO offer price.Homebuilder PulteGroup also rose 13.3 per cent for the week to $4.48 after better-than-expected house price data.First Solar was up 13.7 at $100.71 after a bullish Goldman Sachs note on the solar industry and an upgrade from Collins Stewart, which noted the company’s low price-to-earnings ratio and a backlog of orders for projects in Nevada and California.Semiconductor manufacturers endured a mixed week. Shares in Micron Technology slumped more than 6 per cent on Wednesday after the company warned of lower revenue, because of weak demand from computer companies. But Micron shares closed the week up 8.9 per cent at $5.66.Applied Materials was meant to fare better because it supplies solar panel manufacturers as well as computer firms, but its shares underperformed the market, up only 1.8 per cent at $11.06, on weak sales from its solar unit."
74;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-08-02T21:02:39Z;US stocks tumble most in a year;;US stocks fell the most in a year on Tuesday, their seventh straight losing session in a row, as worries about the economy outweighed the resolution of the debt ceiling deal.The resolution of the debt ceiling deal, with the Senate’s “yes” vote and President Barack Obama’s signature, only served to unleash a wave of selling, driving the S&P 500 index down 2.6 per cent, its biggest single-day drop since August of last year. The broad index is now down 0.3 per csent for the year.“Stock market sellers had been held in check by the prospect of a debt ceiling relief rally,” said William Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “The largest effect is that it allows investors to focus more fully on the deterioration in the economic fundamentals.”Consumer discretionary and industrial groups were pacing declines, dropping 3.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.Traders were disappointed early on by earnings at Archer Daniels Midland, the food processing group, and by a poor report on consumer spending.The S&P 500 index ended the session at 1,254.05, well below its 200-day moving average of 1,284. Technical analysts said the next resistance level was 1,250, its March low.The Nasdaq Composite index was 2.8 per cent lower at 2,669.24 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.2 per cent to 11,866.62.ADM shares fell 6.2 per cent to $28.60 after it reported second-quarter earnings of 60 cents per share, missing analysts’ target of 84.8 cents.Shares in Emerson Electric, a manufacturing conglomerate, slipped 4.1 per cent to $47.06 after the company warned that orders would slow in the latter part of the year. “US and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft patch,” it said.Parker Hannifin, a manufacturer of mechanical equipment, fell 8.5 per cent to $70.88, its lowest for the year, after it warned that orders from the military and defence sector would be soft, and provided guidance for the year below what analysts were expecting.Retailers began their portion of the earnings reporting season on Tuesday with Coach, the high-end designer, seeing sharp falls after it was reported that personal spending slipped 0.2 per cent in June, below the 0.1 per cent growth expected by economists.“The data on personal income and spending suggests that the third quarter begins with no momentum from the consumer sector,” said Mr Delwiche.Coach shares were off 6.5 per cent to $61.03, down from their all-time highs of $67 reached in July.Retailers are the last major economic segment to report earnings. Many of those reporting later this week were down, including Nordstrom, down 5.8 per cent to $47.05, and Macy’s, off 5.6 per cent to $27.63. Tiffany, the jeweller, paced all declines in the S&P, falling 8.2 per cent to $73.38.The fear is that the non-farm payroll report on Friday, a key measure of consumers’ ability to spend, could be as poor as last week’s GDP figures and Monday’s industrial production survey.“If retailers report weak numbers or guidance, we could see another leg lower in the S&P index,” said David Rovelli, managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Genuity.The debt deal itself is, in part, adding to consternation as those who believe that US stimulus spending has played a crucial part in supporting markets fear that spending caps will make it nearly impossible to approve any additional government help.“We’ve been operating under the assumption for the last two years that equity investors should be bullish until the bill comes due, as democracies rarely choose deflation,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas. “But the bill has come due and we have to reduce our outlook.”Trading in consumer groups would be weaker if not for McGraw-Hill, the US publishing group that also owns Standard & Poor’s.Its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $44.43 after Jana Partners, a hedge fund, revealed that it had taken a stake, leading to speculation that the company may be broken up .Shares in Pfizer, the drugmaking giant, dropped 4.6 per cent to $18.14 despite it topping second-quarter earnings-per-share targets, coming in at 60 cents versus 58 cents. It said it was bracing for further declines in sales of established drugs such as Lipitor.Exchanges group NYSE Euronext was off by 4.9 per cent to $31.40. It reported earnings of 61 cents in the quarter versus forecasts of 59.5 cents, but warned that revenue capture could slow if trading volumes rebound.MetroPCS, the US wireless group, fell sharply by 37 per cent to $10.26 after it reported earnings well wide of the mark at 24 cents per share versus the 28 cents per share forecast.That result dragged down competitors as well with American Tower falling 3.8 per cent to $50.50.
75;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-05-17T17:35:33Z;Doubts on Hong Kong secondary listings;The record is littered with more failures than successes;Hong Kong looks set to become the next hot destination for secondary listings but history appears to cast doubt on the benefits of such moves.When the Brazilian mining group Vale cross-listed its shares in the Chinese city in December, it claimed that it was a milestone that would have “positive effects on liquidity, shareholder base and pricing of our shares”.But so far that has not been the case. Asian investors have shunned Vale’s Hong Kong-listed stock, just as they have shunned shares in Prudential since the London-listed insurer took a secondary listing in Hong Kong a year ago.On average, just a few thousand Vale shares have changed hands each day in Hong Kong – compared with average daily trading volumes in the millions for the company’s shares in São Paulo and New York.Richard Dobbs, a director of McKinsey who was the author of a 2008 research paper titled “Why cross-listing shares doesn’t create value”, says that, for companies already listed in developed markets, there is little evidence to support the conventional wisdom that listing on a foreign exchange gives access to more investors, greater liquidity and a lower cost of capital.“In an age when electronic trading provides easy access to foreign markets, the argument that foreign listings can give companies a broader shareholder base no longer holds,” he says.In spite of the lack of proven financial benefits, a number of companies have decided to undertake secondary listings on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Coach, the New York-listed luxury goods group, and Kazakhmys, the London-listed Kazakh copper miner, have announced plans to list in Hong Kong. BNP Paribas, France’s largest bank, has also filed an application for a listing, according to Hong Kong newspapers.According to Mr Dobbs: “The question is whether this is just another one of those fads in finance that will come and go, create a lot of fees and costs for people but won’t actually create value, or is this the new big thing?”History suggests a fad, as Hong Kong becomes one of the world’s hottest financial markets because of its position as a gateway to China.During the past century, a succession of financial centres have emerged as fashionable destinations for foreign companies to take secondary listings. Often these cross-listings allowed companies to access investors they would otherwise be unable to reach, given the restrictions on international financial flows at the time. In the 1970s – when stocks and bonds were still traded in paper form – London was the leading destination (see chart). Tokyo was the place to be in the 1980s, as global companies rushed to take part in what turned out to be a vast bubble in Japanese stocks.In the 1990s and 2000s, the number one place to cross-list was New York. Many companies chose to do so to create share schemes for their US employees.But after the boom years, many of the companies that cross-listed in the US and Japan have since quietly retreated or have seen their foreign listings fade into obscurity.When British Airways and Air France delisted from US exchanges in the late 2000s, they estimated they would save about $20m each in annual service and compliance costs, according to McKinsey.Yet while cross-listings have not been an unbridled success throughout history, there are many potential benefits, says Kenneth Tse, head of JPMorgan’s depositary receipts group in Asia.“These companies come to Hong Kong mainly to demonstrate their commitment to Asia and also to significantly raise their profile, although not many of them have plans to raise funds immediately,” he says.Neither Vale nor Prudential raised any capital when they listed in Hong Kong and neither have any plans to do so. Kazakhmys has said it may sell up to $200m of new shares to “assist liquidity” on the Hong Kong exchange.Many of the companies cross-listing on Hong Kong appear to be doing so less for financial reasons than as a form of advertising.Lew Frankfort, Coach’s chief executive, said the listing would “raise awareness of the Coach brand among investors and consumers in the China market as well as throughout Asia”.There will be no easy way to prove whether a Hong Kong listing is a more effective branding tool for companies such as Coach than traditional methods such as an investor roadshow or consumer advertising.“If it’s purely seen as a PR trick to gain a bit of short-term profile and business momentum, that’s not going to be very successful,” says Tim Payne, a partner at Brunswick, the public relations group. “But if it underpins a real view that over time you’ll have greater Asian retail and institutional interest in your stock, aligned to a stronger role for your business in the region, then I think that should be very logical.”Many cross-listings have been successful. Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics group, has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1970 – a move that helped boost its expansion in the US.But the record of cross-listings is littered with more failures than successes. There is no evidence as yet that Hong Kong will prove an exception.
76;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-05-12T16:57:31Z;Coach to shift manufacturing from China;;Coach, the US accessories brand, is planning to shift up to half of its manufacturing out of China to escape rising labour costs at the same time as it moves aggressively to expand its sales in the country.Lew Frankfort, Coach’s chief executive, said that over the next five years the company would cut its China production to 40-50 per cent of its total from 85 per cent at present by opening factories in lower-wage economies including India, Vietnam and the Philippines.Coach’s plans point to the shift in China’s role from workshop of the world to consumer of first resort. Coach is aiming to make annual sales of $500m in China within the next three years.The move is also reminder that while China’s consumer class is expanding because incomes are rising, companies manfucturing goods in the country to meet that demand face the risk of narrower profit margins.Mr Frankfort said: “We are subject to rapid wage increases in China among employees working in the manufacturing sector, which we support. We work with factories to offset high labour costs through improved efficiency and lean manufacturing.”But he also said: “We are beginning to diversify production out of China into other Asian countries that are not enjoying that level of prosperity.” He was speaking at conference of the Committee of 100, a Chinese-American group in New York.The Chinese government is trying to encourage a shift in the economy from being heavily export-led to depending more on domestic consumption. As part of that process, it has encouraged a substantial rise in wages in coastal manufacturing cities such as Shenzhen in the past year.Li & Fung, a Hong Kong-based consumer goods sourcing and logistics company, said in March that wages had risen by 20 per cent in China this year, heralding “a new era in sourcing with higher prices”.Coach’s sales in China doubled last year to $100m and it is aiming to boost them to $500m by 2014 and secure a 10 per cent share of the luxury accessories market.Coach has nine stores in Hong Kong, 44 in mainland China, and is planning to add 11 new outlets in this quarter.“We are pacing our growth. We could profitably open twice or three times the number of stores we open each year,” Mr Frankfort said.It is especially keen to tap into the market for men’s handbags – or “man bags”. Coach says men account for 45 per cent of spending on handbags and accessories in mainland China, whereas they make up only 25 per cent across Asia and 15 per cent globally.
77;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-05-10T17:20:36Z;Coach eyes China men’s market;;Coach, the US leather accessories brand, is to list its shares in Hong Kong as part of a strategy to access the lucrative Chinese market for men’s hand bags – or “man bags” – and other luxury products.The company wants to cultivate a global base of shareholders and customers akin to its European rivals Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy and Burberry – and in China potential investors and man bag owners are often one and the same. The listing is expected to take place before the end of 2011.Lew Frankfort, Coach’s chairman and chief executive, said last month the company was eager to capitalise on men’s untapped enthusiasm for its products in China, where they account for nearly half of all spending on handbags and accessories.Coach said it believed it would be the first US domestic issuer to do a secondary listing in Hong Kong. Its plan is an example of how financial markets can be used for product marketing where retail investors are very active.Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London, said: “They’re on a big retail push in Asia. This gets them more exposure to people in financial markets, who are big spenders on these types of products as well.”The company said no additional shares would be issued and it would raise no capital through the listing. The shares of other foreign companies with secondary listings in Hong Kong have traded only thinly, notably those of Brazil’s Vale.Coach said men account for 45 per cent of spending on handbags and luxury accessories in mainland China, whereas they make up only 25 per cent of spending across Asia and just 15 per cent worldwide.Stacey Widlitz, an independent retail analyst, said “the acceptance of accessories is more evolved” among men in China than in the US.Victor Luis, president of Coach’s international division, said last month: “In China men participate heavily in the category, both for self purchase and for gifting to other men …There is tremendous opportunity for us to take a larger share of a growing market.”So far the company has not tapped into it: men accounted for just 3 per cent of both Coach’s $3.6bn global and China sales last year.“Our target consumers in China and Hong Kong are those who are interested in luxury, have a certain minimum income level, and were born after the Cultural Revolution,” said a spokeswoman, “and presumably the retail investor is also the more affluent shopper.”Coach has nine stores in Hong Kong, 44 in mainland China, and is planning to add 11 new outlets in the current quarter. Its sales in China last year doubled to $100m and it is aiming to raise them to $500m – and a 10 per cent market share – by 2014.
78;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2011-02-24T01:38:03Z;Retailers resist lease obligation plans;Dissident companies find ally in Revenue & Customs;Plans to force companies to be more transparent about leasing obligations have been some of the most contentious put forward in the dash to converge US accounting standards with those followed in Europe and some other countries.The proposal that more leases should be placed on the balance sheet could cause assets and liabilities to balloon at some businesses, potentially putting companies in breach of loan agreements.Retailers and airlines have been particularly hostile to accounting for their leased shops and aircraft in this fashion. New Look, a British clothing retailer, says it would “require further investment to update our covenant models and legal financing documentation in order to maintain financial covenant headroom”.Marks and Spencer, a UK high street stalwart, denies that leasing arrangements as they stand are a way of hiding liabilities, arguing that it is often impossible to buy the stores it operates. Coach, a US handbag-maker, argues that investors already get enough information from current lease disclosures. Iata, which represents the airline industry, dismisses the plans as too complex, costly and impractical.Standard-setters will not have been surprised by such opposition to their insistence that the system of operating and finance leases – also known as capital leases – should be replaced with just one accounting model. They say operating leases disguise a company’s leverage because the underlying obligations drip through the profit and loss account as a series of rental expenses rather than being capitalised in one highly visible lump.It was always clear which industries would yelp at the ideological shift towards full balance-sheet disclosure advocated by the FASB, overlord of US GAAP, and the IASB, custodian of the IFRS system followed in the EU. But dissident companies have backing from a less obvious ally: the UK taxman.HM Revenue & Customs says the changes would mean that “much of leasing tax law will no longer function as intended, or at all”. While imperfect, the current system was “well understood and deeply embedded within business culture”, it adds.Deeply embedded does not mean unassailable though. It appears unlikely that the standard-setters will compromise on the main thrust of their plans. Operating leases are marching towards the balance sheet.Yet as the standard-setters work towards finalising the rules, there have been signs they are softening their position on secondary issues. Some variables that were going to feed into the capital valuation of the leases may be simplified, while leases that could be characterised as service contracts may be exempt.Curiously, having fought for the principle of one model for all leases, the standard-setters seem willing to usher in a partial two-tier system at the margins. Deliberations last week led to a tentative acknowledgement that, when it came to the treatment of profits and losses, something akin to the old model was not so bad.This intellectual inconsistency is unlikely to unravel the broader reform. But it could cause some extra harrumphing by chief financial officers as they prepare to shunt billions of pounds of assets and liabilities out of the shadows.
79;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-12-13T23:02:49Z;Burberry bid talk continues despite price label;PPR dismisses suggestions it will pounce on rival;Burberry’s high-heeled shearling-lined ankle boot was one of the must-have items for the autumn-winter season, spawning a rash of imitations across the high street.But could the company, best known for its red, black, tan and white check, be as desirable to a corporate acquirer as its aviator jacket was to the fashion pack?Shares in Burberry have risen almost 13 per cent since the start of the month on speculation that it could be the subject of a bid.Even though one of the most frequently touted buyers, PPR, has dismissed suggestions that it is preparing to pounce, some luxury goods experts believe it is only a matter of time before Burberry becomes the target of a predator.“From a luxury goods perspective, if someone wants the growth from a fast-moving brand, Burberry is in that camp,” says Kate Calvert, analyst at Seymour Pierce.Angela Ahrendts, chief executive, has built on the work of her predecessor, Rose Marie Bravo, who took the business from classic to cutting edge.Ms Ahrendts has concentrated on developing the Burberry brand and expanding it in emerging markets. Earlier this year, she paid £70m to buy out Burberry’s Chinese franchises, taking direct control of its 50 stores on the mainland. But there is still more to go for, for example in China, where it could have up to 100 stores in the next couple of years.John Guy, analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, points out Burberry is one of the few luxury goods groups free from family control or a blocking stake.“It is the only 100 per cent free-float listed company out there, with real size and scale, and with the opportunity still to grow further,” he said.PPR has long been mooted as a possible predator. But François-Henri Pinault, its chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times that although Burberry was “a magnificent brand, it does not meet our acquisition criteria”.Analysts at JPMorgan said apart from anything else: “Burberry is simply way too big for PPR – it would need to sell all of its retail assets and its CFAO minority [African distribution arm] to come anywhere close to Burberry’s current enterprise value.”The finances of LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury goods group by sales, would stretch to Burberry, but Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive, appears to have set his sights on the top of the market with the recent disclosure of its 17.1 per cent acquisition of Hermès, the silk scarves and Kelly and Birkin handbags group, for €1.45bn (£1.2bn). LVMH would not comment.Another group with the financial firepower to acquire Burberry is Richemont. But Mr Guy is sceptical that it would want to move “out of its comfort zone” of having in excess of €2bn in net cash at the end of this year, according to consensus forecasts, to a debt position.A tie-up between Burberry and Coach has also long been speculated on, but people familiar with the situation played down the prospects of the US group making acquisitions.This could leave private equity, or a consortium of Chinese buyers.But even here Burberry could prove too big a mouthful. Its market capitalisation is close to £5bn, without accounting for any premium for control.Meanwhile, shares in Burberry – now above £11 – stood at just 175p in November 2008, raising questions as to why a potential acquirer would wait until now to strike.According to Ms Calvert, the shares trade on almost 22 times 2011 earnings, adjusted to the end of the year.This is at a premium to the luxury sector – excluding Hermès – which trades on 19 times.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to close at 11,089.80, falling 1.1 per cent over the week, and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,534.56 but rose 0.4 per cent on the five days.The S&P 500 materials index lost 1.3 per cent, with Alcoa, the aluminium producer, declining by 0.9 per cent to $13.19 and Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore producer, also sinking 0.9 per cent to $69.03.Del Monte gained 4.5 per cent to $18.80, and 7 per cent over the week, after the food producer agreed to a buy-out by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity house. The deal values Del Monte at about $5bn, including debt, or $19 per share.KKR edged lower by 0.8 per cent to $12.74 after it made the acquisition.CPI International, the telecoms equipment maker, was bought by an affiliate of Veritas Capital for $19.50 per share in cash, or $525m. The shares jumped 33.5 per cent to $19.31 after the offer, which was made at a 35 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price.Retail stocks were mixed even though investors were expecting a bumper start to the holiday shopping season. The S&P 500 retail index dipped 0.4 per cent, after climbing 2.7 per cent during the week.Stores offering large discounts to get customers queueing outside in the middle of the night included Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Best Buy nudged down 0.1 per cent to $44.75 as Brian Dunn, chief executive, said in the mid-morning that the consumer electronics retailer was “pleased with our traffic so far”. But Walmart lost 0.5 per cent to $53.73 and Target was lower by 0.7 per cent to $56.88.Online retailers were not left out of the Black Friday excitement with Amazon.com offering special deals throughout the week. Shares in Amazon added 0.1 per cent to $177.50. Department stores were also mixed. Macy’s gained 0.4 per cent to $26, while Nordstrom fell 0.3 per cent to $43.60 and JC Penney slid by 0.9 per cent to $32.51.SanDisk climbed 11.1 per cent over the week to $44.99.

81;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-11-15T01:59:12Z;UK remains a target for world’s retailers;;The UK is set to remain a target market for overseas retailers, as store groups ramp up their expansion plans in Europe, the Middle East and Africa amid increasing confidence, according to a property consultancy.CB Richard Ellis said confidence had returned to retailers in the EMEA region, with more groups intending to extend their store networks next year.It found that 77 per cent of the retailers surveyed were planning to open more than five stores in the EMEA region by the end of next year. This is a significant increase from 12 months ago, when half of the retailers intended to open less than five stores this year.More than half of the retailers surveyed intended to open between one and 20 stores, with the average at about 30 stores.“Intentions are much greater for 2011 than they were for 2010,” said Peter Gold, head of cross-border retail, EMEA, at CBRE.The supermarket sector is set to be the most active, followed by coffee and restaurant chains, as well as the value and denim fashion sector.CBRE found that 28 per cent of mid-range fashion retailers are aiming to open 30 or more stores in 2011, higher than the 16 per cent reported a year earlier.Germany is the most popular country for expansion given its populous cities. Retailers are also eyeing Poland, France and Spain, where property is more affordable.The UK is the fifth most popular market, with 29 per cent of the retailers surveyed targeting the country.A number of overseas retailers, including Coach, the US handbag and accessories retailer, Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie chain, and young fashion groups Forever 21, and Vero Moda are expanding in the UK.Mr Gold said overseas retailers used the UK as a “stepping stone to broader international [expansion]”. A presence in the UK also provided retailers with “international credibility”. “Everyone has a plan for the UK,” he added.However, retailers are also eyeing emerging EMEA markets, which accounted for more than half of the top 20 target cities.CBRE found that retailers preferred to consolidate and expand into new cities in countries where they already have a presence, instead of entering new markets.
82;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-11-05T00:01:08Z;US shoppers regain taste for ‘luxury light’;;From lingerie and handbags to organic vegetables and lattes, America’s middle-class shoppers are regaining some of their taste for the aspirational and discretionary products that were hard hit by the economic downturn.In a sign of the changing mood, Victoria’s Secret, known for its $50 bras and sexy marketing, said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year had risen 14 per cent in October compared with the same period last year.Starbucks, home of the indulgent $3 coffee, saw an 8 per cent increase in comparable sales at its US stores during its most recent quarter, continuing a yearlong revival of its fortunes.Shares in Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural grocer whose sales slumped at the start of the recession, rose 15 per cent to $47.27 after it reported an 8.9 per cent increase in identical-store sales over the past five weeks.Joel Bines, a retail consultant at AlixPartners, said there was growing evidence of a return of what he called “luxury light” spending by aspirational consumers, on top of the recovery at the top-end luxury market seen since the start of the year.“In 2008 and 2009, the aspirational consumer evacuated the segment . . . and then began slowly to creep back in again. They are starting to unlock the purse strings a bit,” Mr Bines said.Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, underlined the continuing strength of demand from the wealthiest US consumers, with October’s comparable sales up 11.5 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department store, reported a 4.8 per cent increase in October same-store sales at its full-price stores.The figures released on Thursday followed the announcement of a strong quarterly performance last week from Coach, the handbag and leather accessories brand, which predicted double-digit sales increases in the holiday season.Blue Nile, the online jeweller, is also forecasting a holiday quarter sales rise of between 3 and 12 per cent.Overall October sales figures from US chain retailers presented a more mixed pattern, with the Retail Metrics monthly index rising 1.5 per cent, its smallest gain since April, with unseasonably warm weather weighing on clothing sales.Additional reporting by Greg Farrell in New York
83;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-10-26T15:59:31Z;Coach benefits from resilient demand;;Coach, the upmarket US handbag and accessories brand, said on Tuesday it expects double-digit sales and earnings growth during the holiday shopping season, underlining the recovery in discretionary spending among more prosperous consumers.Lew Frankfort, chief executive, said the company was benefiting from the “resiliency” of demand for handbags and accessories in North America, and from its continuing international growth, as it reported first-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.Coach’s forecast sales rise comes at a time when most retail industry estimates are predicting subdued holiday sales growth for the retail sector as a whole of about 2 per cent.Coach’s quarterly sales rose 20 per cent to $912m against a year ago, despite what Mr Frankfort called “muted” consumer demand, while net income rose 34 per cent to $189m, with earnings per diluted share of $0.63.Coach’s direct-to-consumer sales at its own stores increased 19 per cent to $775m, with double-digit sales growth in its fledgling China business, and a 3 per cent increase in sales in Japan on a constant currency basis.Indirect sales to department stores and other wholesale customers increased 27 per cent to $136m, with the company seeing “significant” growth in shipments into US department stores and to international wholesalers.Mr Frankfort said Coach’s surveys of its shoppers in the US during the quarter showed that their “future purchasing intent” was at the highest level seen for the past two years.The company says it expects continue to expand its US footprint of 345 stores at an annual rate of around 8 per cent in its current fiscal year, at a time when most retailers are growing by less than 5 per cent.It is also planning to add another 25 new locations in China, where it currently has 49 stores, increasing its square footage by about 60 per cent. It reported sales of over $100m from its fledgling business in China in its last fiscal year.Mr Frankfort said that he believed Coach could increase its share of its market from 5 per cent currently to around 15 per cent, similar to the share it has achieved in Japan, where it has 160 stores.Coach is also beginning to expand into Europe, with plans to open its first stores in the UK, and new locations in France, Spain, Portugal.Coach avoided the steep sales declines seen by the broad luxury sector during the depths of the US recession, supported a decision to avoid sales at its main stores, and to instead introduce more moderately priced product lines.Coach’s shares closed up $5.30, or 12 per cent, in New York at $49.78.
84;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-10-17T22:55:59Z;US retailers to ride wave of China web sales;;Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is about to launch a website for its Sam’s Club stores in China, in a sign of the growing interest of global retailers in online sales in the fast-growing market.Gap, the US clothing retailer, will open a Chinese online sales site next month, to complement the opening of its first stores in the country.Japan’s Uniqlo, a rival of Gap, launched an e-commerce business in China last year, while Adidas, the sportswear company, opened an online store in August on Taobao, China’s dominant internet marketplace. Coach, the US handbag retailer, intends to open an online store in China next year.The retailers’ push comes as growth in China’s e-commerce market is expected to take off. Online retail sales increased by 117 per cent last year to $39bn, according to iResearch, a Beijing-based company.“About two-thirds of Chinese have been online for three years or less, and half for less than two – and in the past it has taken about three years for an internet user to become an online shopper,” McKinsey, the consultant, revealed in a recent report on Chinese internet use habits. “Assuming that this conversion continues, tens of millions of new e-commerce consumers could be just around the corner.”This prospect is particularly alluring for companies as Chinese consumers appear to trust retailer and manufacturer websites and are likely to search for product information there. “That is a stark difference from the US, where consumers prefer to consult consumer and third-party reviews, such as Amazon,” the McKinsey survey said.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s global e-commerce business, told a meeting with investors last week that the retailer was “excited about the size of the opportunity” for online sales in China.Walmart expects China to overtake both Japan and the UK over the next five years to become the world’s second-largest e-commerce market behind the US, with projected online sales of $230bn, against a forecast $490bn in the US.One in four of China’s 400m internet users buy online, according to the state-run China Internet Network Information Centre.Walmart said it will use its own internet platform for the service, which would support the handful of Sam’s Club stores it currently has in China, rather than its more numerous Walmart and Trustmart locations. But it said the service would include both next-day delivery and information on product availability in store for Sam’s Club’s customers, who are primarily small businesses and local retailers.Gap is working with a local partner, Shanghai Yi Shang, which will handle distribution and fulfilment of orders. Gap is believed to be the first retailer to launch an e-commerce business in parallel with the opening of its first stores.Toby Lenk, head of Gap’s direct sales, said last week that online sales were viewed as “a really exciting opportunity long term”.Taobao, owned by Alibaba, provides internet “store fronts” for retailers and dominates online merchandise sales in China.However, Baidu, the search company, is preparing to launch a rival marketplace with Japan’s Rakuten.Wan Ling Martello, chief operating officer of Walmart’s global e-commerce business, said that both she and Mr Castro Wright had been “completely, absolutely blown away by how much Chinese customers have embraced e-commerce”.Dan Brutto, head of the international business of UPS, the parcel logistics company, said its decision to seek a domestic delivery license in China was driven in part by demand for business-to-consumer shipping.“A lot of customers are asking us, ‘Hey, can you help us in China? I have a plant in China that I now want to use to service the Chinese consumers.’ So we think there is demand,” Mr Brutto said.Additional reporting by ­Jeremy Lemer and Kathrin Hille
85;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
86;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-10-16T03:21:14Z;UK business faces economic challenge;;"With just days to go before the government spells out its spending cuts for the years ahead, Economy Watch, naturally, has its eye on the business world.That is because it is logical to believe that with the country and households struggling to reduce debt, it will be down to business to step up to the plate and provide the demand for goods and services that keep the economy ticking over.So let’s look at that high street icon, WH Smith, which this week produced strong profit growth, but did so despite lower sales. In fact, profits are so strong it plans a further £50m share buyback and has raised its dividend.Two points here: profits cannot grow indefinitely by squeezing costs. Second, while those profits eventually get recycled back into the economy as investors spend the money, it does so more slowly than if the company, say, planned to refurbish half its shops and hire more workers.What is good for WH Smith shareholders is probably not good news for the wider economy if every company follows suit. And other economic signals this week suggest that more, not less, business expansion is needed.Two closely watched surveys – one from chartered surveyors and another from retailers – show why.The surveyors are even more gloomy about house prices than they were a month earlier and retailers said that although sales rose, most of that reflected food price inflation. Indeed, John Lewis, purveyor to the solid middle classes, noted it had just had its most challenging week for the second half of this year. And grocers report that a record 37 per cent of all goods are being sold on promotion.But there was better news from Coach, the upmarket US handbag company, which wants to open stores in Britain, seeing demand here for its products. Indeed, the picture for growth is so robust that one member of the nation’s interest rate setting committee called for a rise in rates right away.However, there was a decidedly mixed picture from jobs data this week: the claimant count rose for the second month in a row; the number of people in jobs rose strongly but much of that was in part-time work; the number of vacancies fell and long-term unemployment rose to its highest level in 13 years.Outsourcers say they expect a pick-up in demand as the services that local authorities provide are turned over to private providers. But Travis Perkins, the builders’ merchants, said anxiety about those cuts was making consumers put off home improvements.And shares in BT, which generates 10 per cent of revenues from the government, fell earlier this week as investors mulled the implications of a report on wasteful government spending.Economy Week, then, is holding its breath, awaiting next week’s spending review and watching for signs that business is jumping into the breach that the government leaves behind it."
87;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-10-13T01:26:17Z;Coach targets UK in European push;;Coach, the US handbag and accessories retailer, is planning to open up to 15 British outlets over the next three years, as part of a push into the European luxury goods market.It will open a unit at Westfield, the shopping centre in west London, in the first half of next year, followed by a flagship store on London’s New Bond Street, probably in June.However, Lew Frankfort, chief executive, said the group’s ambitions were more extensive than the two initial stores, with plans for 10-15 locations in the UK over the next three years.Coach experimented with a London store on Sloane Street in the 1990s. It believes it is better positioned to break into the European market now because many consumers know the brand from travelling to the US. Across Europe, Coach aims to have sales of $250m in five years’ time.“We are very serious about our entry into Europe and our goal is to become a significant brand in all the markets where we participate,” said Mr Frankfort.Coach has already taken its first steps into Europe. In France, it has an exclusive arrangement with Printemps, the department store. It opened its first shop within a Printemps store in Paris in June and, over the coming years, it plans to open in nearly all of Printemps’ locations.It also has a deal with Spain’s El Corte Inglés and on Saturday opened its first shop within the department store chain, in Madrid. Longer term, Coach has Germany and Italy in its sights.Coach underlines the trend of US retailers targeting Europe. London has enjoyed a boom in overseas travellers taking advantage of the weakness of sterling to spend at stores ranging from Burberry to Primark.But Mr Frankfort said currency movements were not the prime motivation for the UK push, which is to take place in a joint venture with men's wear brand Hackett. “It only adds to our confidence that we are going to be successful in the UK. What is attracting us to the UK, is the consumer, who is much more focused on innovation, relevance and value,” he said.While many British retailers are concerned about the outlook, amid expectations of higher taxes and swingeing cuts to the public sector, Coach believes an age of austerity could play into its hands, as it targets the trend for affordable luxury that has benefited brands such as Mulberry. “There is a ‘new normal’ which reflects cautiousness on the part of consumers, and a reluctance to spend frivolously,” said Mr Frankfort.While Coach sees potential in Europe, it remains keen on emerging markets. It has 41 stores in China and plans to open another 25 during this financial year to June 2011. In the longer-term, Brazil and India are on its “radar screen”.The retailer has been cited as a potential merger partner for Burberry but Mr Frankfort said: “I don’t think Angela [Ahrendts, chief executive of Burberry] or I are thinking about that right now.”The company, known for its distinctive “C” logo, was founded nearly 70 years ago in New York.
88;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-03-26T21:11:24Z;US stock indices up for fourth week in a row;;US stocks were flat on Friday after fourth-quarter growth figures were revised downward and fears of military tensions on the Korean peninsula flared up.US gross domestic product grew at a 5.6 per cent yearly rate at the end of 2009, according to the commerce department, lower than the previously estimated rate of 5.9 per cent.“Each time they revise GDP, the composition has become less favourable to the near-term outlook,” said Zach Pandl, US economist at Nomura Securities in New York. “Underlying growth in sales, excluding inventory affects, has gotten weaker each time.”The market was supported on Friday by consumer sentiment figures.The University of Michigan’s index in March was 73.6, in line with expectations, revised upward from earlier estimates of 72.5.But traders used the sinking of a South Korean ship, which was being investigated as a possible attack by North Korea, as an opportunity for profit-taking.“The market was looking at Korea as an excuse for moving lower,” said John Stoltzfus, senior market strategist at Ticonderoga Securities. “We have the worst stuff in the rearview mirror. It’s not time to put on the party hat, but it was a decent week.”US indices climbed each week in March, the first four-week winning streak since last April.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher at 1,166.59, gaining 0.6 per cent since the start of the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1 per cent to 10,850.36 and 1 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent at 2,395.13 for a weekly gain of 0.9 per cent.Financials saw gains once again. Fitch, the ratings agency, said that proposed US regulatory reforms would, on balance, reduce risks for banking companies. Among the advancers was Citigroup, which was up 1 per cent to $4.31, benefiting from speculation the government might convert its warrants into shares. It rose 10.5 per cent on the week. Bank of America, was up 0.9 per cent to $17.90 for a 6.4 per cent weekly gain.Radioshack led S&P 500 gainers, adding 8.5 per cent to $23.65, after a report that it could be sold for $3bn to Best Buy, its bigger rival.The much larger electronics chain was up 5.3 per cent on the week, part of a group of closely watched consumer shares that gained after strong earnings reports.Lululemon Athletica, a sportswear retailer, was up 21 per cent on the week and Qualcomm, a maker of networking equipment, rose 4.4 per cent over the five days.“We just haven’t heard any household name companies putting out strongly negative reports,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies.Urban Outfitters, the clothing retailer, rose 3.1 per cent to $37.98 after an upgrade by analysts at JPMorgan from “neutral” to “overweight”. Luxury retailer Coach was also upgraded by JPMorgan. It rose 4.2 per cent to $40.31.Consol Energy issued $2.75bn of notes in advance of its planned purchase of Dominion Resources’ oil and gas reserves. It slid 1.1 per cent to $42.50 for a 6.7 per cent weekly decline.Genzyme, the drugmaker, saw its shares rise 3.7 per cent to $53 after being raised to “outperform” by analysts at Leerink Swann, the healthcare specialist group. Shares in Genzyme have been volatile as investors track activist Carl Icahn’s interest in the company, which was down 10.7 per cent on the week.Pfizer fell 1.4 per cent to $17.14 on Friday after a jury told it to pay $142m in damages related to promoting a drug for unauthorised uses.The health sector, knocked about after the US approved a healthcare reform bill, was down 1 per cent on the week, with energy and utilities also lower.The worst individual performer in energy was Chesapeake, whose shares pulled back 7.6 per cent for the five days.
89;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-02-24T20:33:49Z;Saks upbeat for higher-end retailers;;Saks, the luxury department store chain, added to a mood of cautious optimism at the higher end of the retail sector on Wednesday after last year’s slump in consumer spending.The chain was one of the retailers hardest hit by the collapse of luxury spending after September 2008, regularly reporting double-digit falls in same-store sales in subsequent months.Steven Sadove, the chief executive, said Saks was shifting cautiously “from defence to offence” in the coming year, as it predicted same-store sales growth in the low to mid single digits against the 15 per cent fall in 2009. “Our customer has adjusted to the new reality and is operating accordingly. And they are back to buying,” he said.“Full-price selling is up. They are adjusting to the new world, where there is a little less supply, and they better buy it when it’s available . . . That’s gotten into their psyche.”Mr Sadove said the retailer, with 53 department stores and 55 outlets, would remain conservative in inventory planning but would take more calculated risks in its merchandising as it continued efforts to reduce promotional selling.“We are trying to wean ourselves and wean the consumer away from promotional activity,” he said.Saks reported a fourth quarter loss of $4.61m, or 3 cents a share, down from a loss of $99.7m a year earlier and better than Wall Street expected. Revenue fell 3.4 per cent to $811.3m.Along with other high-end retailers such as Coach and Neiman Marcus, Saks has lowered average overall prices of clothing by reducing the mix of the highest price fashion it stocks. It has also cut costs by about $105m over the past year, taking steps that included reducing staff and employee benefits.Saks is also planning to increase its investment in its e-commerce business during the coming year, which saw 23 per cent growth in the fourth quarter. Recent initiatives at the group have included testing limited time private sales online, where speciality sites such as Gilt.com have experienced sharp growth during the recession. Mr Sadove said that the retailer was also eyeing opportunities to expand its online offering of gourmet foods, home goods and other areas.The retailer’s more optimistic tone follows other evidence of a gradual revival of high-end spending in the US, including strong same store sales growth at Nordstrom, Saks’s rival, and improved holiday sales at Tiffany, the jewellers.Saks also highlighted an improvement in sales at its US flagship store on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, which accounts for about a fifth of its total sales.
90;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2010-02-05T22:29:41Z;Wall St volatile after mixed US jobs report;;US stocks see-sawed on Friday after a mixed monthly jobs report created further uncertainty about the pace of the economic recovery.While the unemployment rate fell to a five-month low, the labour department also reported a surprise decline in January payrolls.Futures initially turned positive on the data but the market continued to fluctuate.After dropping 1.8 per cent at one point, the S&P 500 staged a dramatic last-minute recovery, closing 0.3 per cent higher at 1,066.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 10,012.23 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,141.12.On Thursday, Wall Street suffered its worst daily losses since April last year after fears over European sovereign debt and disappointing weekly unemployment data unnerved investors.The Vix index, which tracks market volatility through option prices and is known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, jumped more than 20 per cent on Thursday and edged very slightly higher on Friday.Over the course of the week, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent, the Dow lost 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq was 0.3 per cent lower. The benchmark index has fallen 4.4 per cent since the start of the year.Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said he believed the market was facing a correction of at least 10 per cent as the earnings season continues to weigh on investors’ confidence. “As people have come to accept the idea that we’re in recovery, their expectations have risen.“There’s been a tendency when companies have reported – unless they’ve shown not only good solid earnings progress but improved revenues or business fundamentals – for investors to be disappointed.“Expectations may be a little high here relative to the economy and what companies are able to deliver. And because the market has run up so much, this is pushing us into a general correction.”Tyson Foods helped lift the market higher, rising 4.7 per cent to $14.65 after the company swung to a first-quarter profit.The results were also better than had been expected, thanks in part to lower grain costs for its chickens.Simon Property Group, the country’s largest owner of shopping malls, posted a sharp decline in quarterly profit due to writedowns and lower occupancy rates.However, the results were also better than expected, helping to lift its shares 5.6 per cent to $73.36.American Axle & Manufacturing, an auto parts supplier, initially rose after cost cuts enabled the company to post a quarterly profit. The group, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy in September, gave an optimistic forecast for this year. However, the shares were later down 10.6 per cent to $8.42.Airgas showed one of the market’s steepest gains, surging 40 per cent to $60.96.Air Products and Chemicals, Airgas’s rival, launched an unsolicited $5.1bn cash bid for the company in an effort to become the country’s largest industrial gas group.Meanwhile, shares in Air Products fell 6.9 per cent to $68.64.Aetna posted a lower quarterly profit than analysts had been expecting due to higher costs at its disability business.However, after early weakness, its shares were up 1.3 per cent at $29.61.In the retail sector, Coach lost 0.4 per cent to $34.32 after Goldman Sachs cut the country’s largest maker of luxury leather handbags to “neutral” from “buy”.Retailers were in focus earlier this week as companies posted their January sales figures.The 29 retailers that posted their monthly revenues recorded an average sales rise of 3.3 per cent after analysts had been expecting a 2.5 per cent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Investors feared the move could also curb demand for commodities and slow the global economic recovery.The S&P 500 energy sector was down 1.7 per cent after the price of US crude fell to its lowest level in about a month. Chevron lost 1.9 per cent to $78.15 and Peabody Energy was down 2 per cent to $48.55.Investors paid little attention to a mixed US housing report, which showed a decline in housing starts and a rise in building permits.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said the strengthening dollar was the main reason for the market’s declines.“It’s nothing to do with the earnings or because the economic numbers were all that bad. It’s the message coming out of China that’s putting pressure on the commodity markets and that’s strengthening the dollar.”He added: “The good news that Mr Brown won in Massachusetts is actually being overshadowed by the strengthening of the US currency and that’s what is causing this selling.”After regaining some ground in the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1,138.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 10,603.15 and the Nasdaq was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,291.25.Inergy, the distributor of bottled gas, added to the woes in the energy sector after launching an offering of 5m shares at $36.25 to help reduce debt. It lost 2.2 per cent to $36.70.A rush of quarterly results from banks also unsettled the market in early trading although the S&P 500 financial sector still outperformed the market throughout the day.Bank of America reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss of $5.2bn, mainly as a result of its decision to repay US government bail-out funds. Non-performing assets increased to $35.7bn but the group said it had seen a stabilisation in credit costs in its consumer businesses.The shares initially dropped on the headline figures but were later up 1 per cent at $16.49 as investors dissected the results.Wells Fargo swung to a fourth-quarter profit even after repaying $25bn of government aid. Loan losses jumped to $5.9bn in the fourth quarter from $3bn a year earlier, mainly as a result of the mortgage portfolio it inherited from its acquisition of Wachovia in 2008. The bank’s shares were down 1.6 per cent at $27.82. Morgan Stanley fell 1.7 per cent to $30.63 after the bank’s fourth-quarter profit fell short of the consensus estimate due to lower trading revenues.In the retail sector, Coach, which sells upmarket handbags, beat both profit and revenue expectations. Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 3.2 per cent in North America after four successive quarters of declines, adding to confidence in the luxury goods sector. Last week, Tiffany, the US jeweller, raised its profit outlook after strong holiday sales.Coach’s investors appeared to have priced in the group’s positive quarterly results and shares in the company dropped 5.6 per cent to $35.35.Profit-taking also hit the technology sector. After the closing bell on Tuesday, IBM raised its forecast for this year and reported higher quarterly profits and revenues than had been expected. After rallying in the lead-up to the results, the shares were down 2.9 per cent to $130.25.Lexicon Pharmaceuticals defied the market’s pessimism, surging 14.2 per cent to $2.25 after the pharmaceutical company reported encouraging results from a trial on its experimental diabetes drug.
92;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2009-10-09T17:34:22Z;Versace leaves Japan and courts China;;Tucked away on the lower ground floor of a Shanghai shopping mall is a modest boutique that could represent the future for Versace.While the Italian designer label this week announced its retreat from Japan, the largest luxury goods market, it signalled grand ambitions in China.Versace has opened 20 boutiques in the country and is planning more.Soon its clothing range – items in which price up to Rmb25,000 ($3,700) – will be displayed in premises in Shanghai’s Plaza 66 mall, where it hopes to catch the eye of China’s wealthy entrepreneurs.But potential customers are not just the rich. Shanghai’s women office workers are renowned for spending a month’s salary on a handbag or pair of shoes.Versace is hoping they will pay Rmb4,000 for a pair of purple trainers or Rmb8,000 for faux crocodile boots.Versace is not the only luxury brand banking on China.Ermenegildo Zegna, the Italian menswear designer, was one of the first luxury brands to enter the country more than 15 years ago.LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods group, is moving into the country aggressively as are Cartier, the jewellery maker, and Coach, the bag brand.China has a rapidly growing number of rich people – 825,000 with a personal wealth of more than Rmb10m, according to The Hurun Report, a luxury-business research group known for its annual China rich list.They are just as obsessed with high-end brands as the Japanese, and their love affair with luxury is in its infancy.“China will become not just a market you hope to sell into but one you design your strategy around, just as Japan has been,” says Yuval Atsmon, a luxury-industry expert at McKinsey in China.But luxury brands have a lot to learn about the Chinese consumer. More than 55 per cent of Chinese consumers only started to buy luxury products in the past four years, according to a McKinsey study.Their traits differ from those of the Japanese. “The Chinese wealthy consumer is 20 to 30 per cent younger than in Japan,” Mr Atsmon says.“More than 60 per cent of luxury goods in Japan are bought by the older generation, as the younger generation, with growing unemployment and a lack of rising income, has less legitimacy to be spending big.“In China, it’s the other way round.”As Zegna found, China was first a big market for menswear, as men have the buying power, but is slowly evolving into a womenswear market.McKinsey expects the growth in luxury goods consumption to come from cities that are not well penetrated by international businesses.Luxury groups tend not to be represented in places such as Chengdu or Wenzhou. But Chengdu has more wealthy consumers than Detroit, the group’s research shows.“The top ten products on these people’s wish-lists are very different from wealthy consumers in other markets,” says Rupert Hooge-werf, founder and publisher of the Hurun Report.He points to the dominance of luxury property, furnishings and luxury cars in the spending profiles of China’s rich.He believes establishing credibility is the psychological driver of most luxury goods purchases in China.“When you deal with government officials, you have to convince them you really are someone to be taken seriously, so you need to come in a top-range car,” he says.Some analysts question Versace’s prospects on the mainland. Shaun Rein, of Shanghai-based China Market Research, says young Chinese are looking for value as well as branding.“They are not looking for a Versace-type dress or shirt that is so showy they can only wear it once every month or two,” he says.“Many have just enough money for entry-level goods like a Gucci key chain or Louis Vuitton purse”. But increasingly, luxury in China is moving beyond handbags.For champagne makers, the country is full of promise. The Chinese champagne market is 20 times bigger than it was at the turn of the century. Some 1m bottles were consumed last year against 50,000 in 2001, according to champagne house Laurent Perrier.Mr Rein expects diamond sales in China to rise 15-20 per cent per year, and high-end red wine sales to rise steeply too.
93;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2009-04-22T02:29:09Z;Coach sounds upbeat note;;Coach, the US handbag and accessories company, provided a shaft of light amid the prevailing retail gloom on Tuesday, saying it had seen improved traffic in its full-price US stores and an overall return to pre-Christmas sales levels.Coach’s shares gained more than 10 per cent in New York to trade at $20.75, supported by its decision to initiate a 30 cent annual dividend.Lew Frankfort, chief executive, said the company was “encouraged by the stabilisation of our business”, and that it was “in a position to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities, while continuing to return capital to shareholders”.Coach said sales at its 433 US stores had fallen just 4.2 per cent during the quarter – compared to the 13.2 per cent drop it reported in the Christmas quarter – marking a return to the comparable store performance seen before Thanksgiving last year.In contrast, leading luxury department stores continue to report comparable sales declines of over 20 per cent.The company, which thrived on the surge in demand for “aspirational luxury” before the economic crisis erupted last year, has avoided discount sales at its full-price stores, while relying on its 109 factory outlets to sustain sales. It has also been introducing new, lower-priced models, designed to attract more budget-conscious consumers.Mr Frankfort said that by the start of the company’s first quarter this summer, around 50 per cent of the handbags on sale at its stores would be priced between $200 and $300, as compared to around 30 per cent in its current fiscal year. As a result the average unit price of goods would go down by 10 to 15 per cent.The company hopes to provide goods at prices that the customer “is willing to spend or is able to afford”, Mr Frankfort added.Both Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury retailers, are also pressing their suppliers to develop designs at lower prices, in response to recessionary mood.The impact of Coach’s efforts to hold prices in the US resulted in a fall of 19 per cent in its indirect sales through other retailers and at department stores, which have been actively putting competitors’ products on sale.Coach’s overall sales were down 1 per cent at $740m.Coach is also cutting the number of stores it will open in the US in its next fiscal year, down to just 20 from the 40 seen in 2009 and 2008.But it is stepping up its international sales, which account for about 25 per cent of its business, with a particular focus on China where it has 25 stores. Mr Frankfort expects to open 10 new stores annually in the country in the next five years.He also hopes sales in China would expand to over $250m by 2013 from about $50m today, and for Coach’s market share to increase to at least 10 per cent from 3 per cent.Coach’s profit fell 29 per cent to $114.8m, or 36 cents per share, in the quarter ended on March 28.
94;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2009-04-12T19:31:14Z;Coach confident of taking China share;;China’s development of native luxury brands will have no impact on the continued expansion of western luxury goods companies there, according to the chief executive of Coach, the US leather goods and accessories brand.Lew Frankfort said the worldwide economic slowdown was set to raise further China’s importance to the luxury goods sector, not just as a manufacturing centre but, more significantly, as a growing consumer market.While Coach announced in January that it would halve its rate of expansion in North America, reducing the number of annual store openings there from 40 to 20, Mr Frankfort said he was likely to accelerate development plans in China.Speaking at the end of a visit to China, he said: “I am leaving this trip with a view that our numbers might be conservative . . . We see sophisticated [Chinese] consumers shopping and international brands thriving.”Coach estimates that China will represent 10 per cent of the $25bn global luxury handbag and accessories market by 2010. The US group currently has 17 shops in mainland China, in addition to eight stores in Hong Kong and two in Macao.The Chinese mainland has more than 100 cities that have populations of more than 1m, and “all of these cities will be candidates for Coach one day”, said Mr Frankfort.China has not escaped the global downturn, but Mr Frankfort insisted Coach’s own performance so far provided evidence of the robustness of Chinese consumerism in the face of a broader economic slowdown. In the quarter that ended in March, Coach posted an increase of about 30 per cent in same-store sales in China, he said.Mr Frankfort said he was in no doubt that China would develop its own luxury brands, but insisted that such indigenous products would likely provide competition only “on the margins” for the big western companies because “their positioning will typically be below the positioning of the luxury European brands and Coach”.He drew a comparison with the Japanese market, where western brands have thrived alongside domestic ones, and where Coach now has about 20 per cent of its sales.Mr Frankfort added: “I believe that new [Chinese] brands will generally not be able to obtain the perceived status of the imported brands because they won’t have the heritage and authenticity. However, to the extent that they make well-made products that are priced compellingly, they will be successful.”
95;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2009-02-02T22:44:36Z;Luxury goods succumb to the cycle;;A year ago, Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH, chastised analysts for classifying the Louis Vuitton-to-Dom Perignon group as a cyclical stock, arguing that the world’s biggest luxury goods company “constantly delivers results, whatever the cycle”.Its growth relied on wealthy individuals rather than economic cycles, he argued. That confidence will be tested on Thursday when Mr Arnault delivers the group’s 2008 results.Luxury sales held up strongly for most of 2008 but since the summer, the combination of falling asset prices and the growing number of economies entering recession, has led to a sharp slowdown in discretionary spending.Richemont, the Switzerland-based owner of Cartier and Montblanc, this month described current market conditions as the worst it had encountered for 20 years. It said it saw “no cause for optimism” in the economic climate as it reported a 12 per cent fall in sales in the three months to the end of 2008.Bulgari of Italy last week reported a 17 per cent fall in jewellery sales and a drop of 28 per cent for watches in the last quarter as Francesco Trapani, chief executive, predicted a “very difficult” 2009.The final quarter of last year was tough for the industry, especially in the US, where jeweller Tiffany and leather goods company Coach, reported disappointing Christmas sales.Spending Pulse, which estimates retail spending, says luxury goods were the worst hit retail category in the last two months of 2008. Sales fell more than 34 per cent between November 1 and December 24, compared to the same period in 2007.The bearish sentiment has led to big discounting, and cuts of 40 per cent in the Christmas sales in some upmarket Milan stores.Stefania Saviolo, a professor of business fashion at Bocconi University’s management school, said: “Overall the Christmas period was not good. There was still a presence of international buyers, but Italians were not buying. My perception is that it is related to a lack of confidence.”Many luxury goods companies are following clients in tightening belts, through a mix of job cuts and slowing expansion plans.Burberry, the UK fashion house, is looking to cut £35m ($49.7m) by laying off 540 employees – about 9 per cent of its workforce – and closing one of its two UK factories, in spite of better-than-expected sales last month.Chanel, the French couture company, is laying off 200 temporary workers. Luxottica, the Italian eyewear maker, which produces glasses for brands such as Chanel and Prada, said it would suspend production for four days this quarter, temporarily laying off 6,000 workers.Coach, the US leather goods company, will expand its range of items priced below $300 this year, in effect lowering prices 10-15 per cent. It will also cut back expansion plans in North America.The gloom is not universal. Some companies are upbeat, notably Tod’s, the Italian leather goods company, which last week said it would deliver higher sales and profits this year.Swatch, the Swiss watch-maker, is seeing an improvement in sales and orders for the first three months of 2009 compared with the trend of November and December. It predicts a rebound in the second half, and says it now expects “a mild increase in consumption and sales for 2009”.LVMH is expected to report net profit for 2008 of €2bn ($2.6bn), in line with the previous year. Analysts expect a sharp fall in sales growth to 5 per cent from 13 per cent in 2007.Its exposure to emerging markets and strong brands make it more resilient than most. But analysts predict tough times ahead.“Luxury is a cyclical industry – even the high end slows down,” says Luca Solca, luxury goods analyst at Bernstein Research. “Mr Arnault will have to concede that this is a cyclical industry, as it always has been.”Additional reporting by Vincent Boland in Milan
96;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2009-01-21T21:43:30Z;Banking stocks lead Wall Street recovery;;Banking stocks led a strong recovery on Wall Street on Wednesday after a raft of earnings, some not as dire as feared, attracted bargain hunters back to the battered sector.Financial institutions that have endured epic falls in recent sessions made a comeback during the market’s best performance in more than a month, which recovered much of the heavy inauguration-day losses.Custodian banks did well after coming under particularly heavy selling pressure in the previous session in the wake of bleak earnings and unrealised losses from State Street. The sector received a boost from better-than-expected fourth-quarter from Northern Trust, which leapt 30.9 per cent to $57.51.“To think all the banks are in the same abyss…that’s not necessarily the case,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment. “But whether this is a bounce that’s going to have legs in really the question.”State Street, whose shares more than halved in the previous session, recovered 14.6 per cent to $17.07.PNC Financial Services jumped 37.1 per cent to $30.16 as investors were relieved that it was not seeking yet more capital.Even US Bancorp, whose 65 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profit was even worse than expected, found positive territory.The shares closed up 4.9 per cent to $16.09 even though the figures prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade its view to ‘sell’ and warned the group would need to cut its dividend.Financials, up 14.6 per cent overall, dominated the leaderboard. Citigroup, which sank 40 per cent last week and 20 per cent in the previous session, bounced 31.1 per cent to $3.67. JPMorgan climbed 25.1 per cent to $22.63 and Bank of America31 per cent to $6.68.Trading in the wider market was volatile and the benchmark S&P 500 index briefly entered negative territory during the morning.But the S&P 500 closed up 4.4 per cent at 840.25 after a strong rally into the close. That was back above a nadir reached last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 3.5 per cent higher at 8,228.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 4.6 per cent stronger at 1,507.07.Still, some observers questioned the view that the new administration would help the equity market maintain momentum.Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth Management, wrote in a report: “While high expectations have, historically, mostly been associated with poor equity performance in the post-election year, low expectations [for example, for Clinton and the two Bush presidencies] have mostly been associated with good performance.”Technology was the best-performing sector outside financials, up 5.4 per cent overall on unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter results from IBM. The stock advanced 11.5 per cent to $91.42, helped by a full-year outlook that topped expectations.Other earnings were due for release after the market closed, including Apple, up 5.9 per cent to $82.83.Meanwhile, the energy sector received a boost as oil prices rallied.Retailers and homebuilders came under pressure throughout the day, but although the two sectors underperformed the market, they nevertheless finished higher overall in the broad based rally.Homebuilders ended 2.1 per cent stronger in spite of more gloomy data for the sector. A preliminary reading of the National Association of Home Builders’s index, which measures industry sentiment, fell in January to the lowest level since the gauge was created 24 years ago.Bucking the upward trend in retail, Coach lost 7.3 per cent to $14.72 after the handbag maker disclosed a fall in second-quarter profit.Wal-Mart fell 2.8 percent to $49.14 after Credit Suisse cut its view of the world’s largest retailer from “outperform” to “neutral”.“Even Wal-Mart is not immune to the economic slowdown,” wrote Michael Exstein, analyst. “The incremental benefit it realized from consumer trade down in 2008 might not repeat itself in 2009.”Airlines also ignored the positive momentum as the volatile oil price hurt earnings.AMR and UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, both disclosed a fourth quarter loss and the shares dropped 23.7 per cent to $7.98 and 6.1 per cent to $10.91, respectively.
97;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2009-01-21T18:02:03Z;Coach to scale back US store openings;;Coach, the US leather goods and accessories brand, is to scale back planned new-store openings in the US and sell more lower-price handbags as it fights the slump in discretionary spending.Lew Frankfort, chief executive, described the recent Christmas period as the worst he had seen in 30 years but stressed that Coach had avoided discounting prices in its full-price stores to protect its brand.The company said second-quarter sales fell 2 per cent to $960m, while earnings fell 14 per cent to $217m, or 67 cents per diluted share.“We will continue to protect our brand,” he said, although the strategy meant that Coach’s more than 300 full-price stores had seen declining traffic at a time when “virtually the entire mall was on sale”.In addition to a previously announced 13 per cent fall in comparable store sales in North America, the company reported a 19 per cent drop in indirect sales through US department stores.Mr Frankfort said discounting by department stores had reached “unprecedented levels”, with Coach opting to exclude its products from the 50- to 75-per-cent price cuts seen in luxury stores such as Saks and Neiman Marcus.However, Coach has used its network of more than 100 factory outlet stores, where it sells end-of-line and lower-cost bags, to support sales.The retailer said it planned to respond to slower discretionary spending from this summer by “rebalancing” its mix of bags and other items to include more products in the $200 to $300 range, resulting in an estimated 10- to 15-per-cent drop in the average price of its products.“We realise that consumer spending after this period will not return to the same levels,” Mr Frankfort said.Coach will cut its planned expansion in North America from about 40 new stores a year to about 20. However, it said its plans for new stores remained unchanged in China, where it saw double-digit comparable sales growth during the quarter.● Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, announced on Wednesday that Brad Anderson, chief executive, will retire in June. He will be replaced by Brian Dunn, currently chief operating officer.Mr Anderson has presided over dramatic expansion by Best Buy, including a retail joint venture in Europe with the UK’s Carphone Warehouse.

99;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2009-01-12T13:59:15Z;US stocks fall on dismal jobs numbers;;A week marked by bleak corporate developments from a host of sector bellwethers drew to a close with more selling pressure on Wall Street on Friday after data that showed that the US economy last year shed the most jobs since 1945 further underscored the depth of the recession.The market opened broadly flat as the bleak non-farm payrolls data from the Labor Department showing that 524,000 jobs were lost in December were no worse than traders’ biggest fears and broadly in line with the figures economists forecast in a Bloomberg poll.“About as dreadful as feared,” wrote Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets.But a sell-off soon after the open took the market beneath the level at which it started the year. By mid-afternoon in New York the benchmark S&P 500 index was down 1.4 per cent at 896.86, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1 per cent weaker at 8,652.94 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.9 per cent lower at 1,585.88.The energy sector led the declines, down 2.1 per cent overall after Chevronwarned it expected “significantly lower” fourth-quarter earnings, which heightened concerns that even the biggest oil companies are being hurt by the recession. The shares were off 0.7 per cent at $73.71.Homebuilders were one of the worst performing subsectors, down 10.1 per cent after a worse-than-expected quarterly loss from KB Home. The shares dropped 1.9 per cent to $14.29.Consumer stocks also did badly on a profit warning from leather goods group Coach, which shed 11.5 per cent to $18.50.They were the latest in a series of glum corporate outlooks this week, which included sweeping layoffs and lower earnings guidance from a range of blue chips, such as Intel, Wal-Mart and Alcoa.Friday’s declines left the S&P 500 on course for a loss of 4 per cent in the first full trading week of 2009, the Dow for a fall of 4.5 per cent and the Nasdaq for a decline of 3 per cent.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge and which last week fell to its lowest level since September, leapt 8.1 per cent over the week.Technology, which had performed well of late as investors snapped up cash- rich names, came under pressure from lower revenue and margin guidance from Intel, off 6.9 per cent for the week at $14.21.In materials, Alcoa, which kicks off the fourth quarter results season on Monday, shed 9.7 per cent to $10.99 on plans for its third production cut in as many months to cope with the recession. Media stocks also came under pressure on a profit warning from Time Warner, down 4.1 per cent at $10.25.Towards the end of the week, the consumer staples sector did badly following a profit warning from Wal-Mart, which heightened concerns that the year-long recession could hurt even those groups previously regarded as relatively immune.Shares in the world’s biggest retailer were among the few to enjoy a double-digit increase last year, up 18 per cent, as investors hoped that the group could continue to find strong growth from cost-conscious consumers eking out cheaper alternatives. However, they shed 9 per cent to $51.91 this week.Wal-Mart was not the only retailer to disclose downbeat December sales figures this week. Investors were also concerned by the scale of heavy discounting over the vital festive period that prompted several retailers to lower earnings guidance.Yet there were some bright spots. Sears and Gamestop, among the few to forecast fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wall Street’s existing expectations, were up 13.4 per cent at $46.94 and 11.1 per cent at $26.43, respectively.McDonald’s – the only other Dow stock to find positive territory in 2008 – lost 5.6 per cent to $60.36, while Johnson & Johnson dipped 2.8 per cent to $59.12 after Citigroup warned the coming year “looks more challenging than we realised”.
100;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-06-17T20:54:52Z;Goldman chills Wall Street with warnings;;New York stocks fell on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs both soothed and spooked markets, with second-quarter results that handily beat expectations while its analysts argued that continuing losses and writedowns may force US banks to raise $65bn of extra capital.Goldman said profits fell 11 per cent to $2.09bn, but that was well ahead of consensus estimates as gains in commodities and prime brokerage offset losses elsewhere.The results had little impact on the broader financial sector, however. It slipped 2.9 per cent after a number of analysts, including some at Goldman, wrote downbeat notes on investment banks and cut their targets for regional banks.Analysts at Strategas Research said: “We find it difficult to envision how the majors will be able to put the earnings machine back together in the near-term and therefore it is not time to wade back into the investment banks.”The latest batch of data on housing, industrial production and inflation also weighed on sentiment.Housing starts fell 3.3 per cent to a 975,000 annual rate in May, knocking the S&P 500 homebuilding index down 1.4 per cent.New figures on industrial production also made for sober reading. Large industrials such as Boeingfell back after the Federal Reserve said production slipped 0.2 per cent in May.Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index, a key inflation measure,jumped by a higher-than-expected 1.4 per cent in May due to surging energy prices, although core inflation moderated as forecast.Financial markets have suffered in recent weeks as rising inflation has stirred fears that the Fed will start raising interest rates.However, some remain optimistic on the outlook for monetary policy and equities. David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “We continue to expect that in an environment of increased uncertainty, US equities will outperform. The hawkish noises from the Fed seem to us much more an exercise in expectations management than a warning of an imminent tightening.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,350.93, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 12,160.30. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,457.73.Financials were in focus again on Tuesday after the Goldman results. Of the leading brokerages, Goldman has stood up best to the credit crunch. So far this year its share price has lost about 16 per cent of its value compared with a 29.3 per cent loss for the S&P 500 investment banking index.Goldman shares fell 1.5 per cent to $179.44 on Tuesday while its peers for the most part dropped back. Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent to $29.24 and Lehman dropped 7.6 per cent to $25.14.Zions Bancorp was the biggest sector faller, tumbling 8.6 per cent to $33.97,. The Salt Lake City-based lender was pummelled after it said further increases in bad loans were “likely”.In the consumer discretionary sector, data showing a small increase in weekly chain store sales initially boosted retailers. Analysts attributed the gains to demand for hot weather merchandise, Father’s Day shopping and federal tax rebates.Gap shares rose 0.3 per cent to $18, while Coach added 0.1 per cent to $33.37. But disappointing results from Best Buy and poor appliance sales data for May, which hit Whirlpool, helped drag the sector down 1.3 per cent. Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $43.46 and Whirlpool dropped 3.5 per cent to $66.03.Homebuilders and industrials also came under pressure. Lennar dropped 4 per cent to $15.28 and KB Home lost 3.5 per cent to $18.34, while United Technologies gave up 0.7 per cent to $68.41 and Boeing fell 0.9 per cent to $74.38.Commodity-related stocks were among the few gainers. Energy rose 1.7 per cent as refiners bounced back and bid speculation pushed shares in Marathon Oil3.1 per cent higher to $53.07. Materials added 0.2 per cent, led by Monsanto, which gained 5 per cent to $142.69.The healthcare sector initially made ground after Elan said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug helped some patients. Elan shares added 10.7 per cent to $30, while Wyeth, Elan’s US partner, rose 4.8 per cent to $45.16.But losses for healthcare providers swamped those gains. Humana dropped 3.3 per cent to $44.87.
101;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-05-30T21:02:52Z;Wall St pares gains but ends week higher;;Wall Street stocks were mixed on Friday, but remained ahead for the week and the month, as data showing moderating inflation and a modest rally in commodity related and technology stocks balanced against concerns about the health of the US consumer.On the inflation front, a gauge of core inflation favoured by the Federal Reserve rose 0.1 per cent month on month. That is slower than the 0.2 per cent rate of the previous month.New data from the Department of Commerce on personal consumption, income and expenditures released as a package with the inflation numbers suggested the US consumer remains under pressure if not yet under water.News that consumer spending increased 0.2 per cent in April but was unchanged after adjustments for inflation hurt consumer-facing stocks.A bump in some commodity prices, however, and a handful of better-than-expected results from technology companies, more than offset those losses.By the close on Friday in New York, the S&P 500 pared earlier gains but finished the holiday-shortened week 2 per cent higher at 1,400.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped into the red in late trading, losing 0.1 per cent to 12,638 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6 per cent to 2,522.66.In the past few days, equities have recovered some of the ground they lost last week as energy prices have softened and government data have suggested the US may skirt a recession.That meek rebound pushed the S&P 500 to a 2 per cent advance in this holiday-shortened week and a monthly gain of 1 per cent – its first back-to-back set of monthly gains since October last year.The strongest sector in May was technology, up 5.4 per cent, displacing energy and materials as the leading group.Strategists argue that international exposure, tight capacity and high levels of recurring revenues make technology a robust sector in the current slowdown.That resilience was underlined by Dell, the personal-computer maker, which posted estimate-beating profits thanks to strong international sales. The results brought a number of analyst upgrades in their wake and Dell shares climbed 5.7 per cent to $23.06.Marvell Technology, the mobile phone-chip maker, also outperformed. Lower administrative expenses and improved sales helped the company beat expectations for first-quarter profits. Marvell shares soared 23.3 per cent to $17.36.Material stocks were the second-biggest gainers over the month, rising 4.5 per cent, and they made progress again on Friday.Monsanto rose 2.9 per cent to $127.40, US Steel added 1.2 per cent to $172.71 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 2.2 per cent to $115.71.Only financials lost ground over the month. Slashed earnings estimates from analysts, writedowns and fears that the sector must raise yet more capital have cut 6.4 per cent from the sector – its worst monthly performance since February.Jeffrey Layman, chief investment officer at BKD Wealth Advisors, said that the post Bear Stearns bail-out euphoria had well and truly worn off.“Back in March we averted a ‘big ugly’ and the sector rallied. But now the stocks are trading back down as investors recognise there will be no quick work-through and we are in a more difficult profit environment,” he said.Consumer discretionary stocks fell back on Friday as investors found cause for concern in the spending statistics and in revised May numbers for consumer confidence, which hit the lowest level in 28 years.Among the leading fallers were JC Penney and Coach, which dropped 3.1 per cent to $40.24 and 2.4 per cent to $36.30 respectively, while the wider sector slipped 0.4 per cent.There were bright spots. Tiffany said strong growth in the Asia-Pacific and European markets had helped boost first-quarter profits 19 per cent.The upmarket jewellery retailer said, however, that it expected no improvement in the US until later this year. Tiffany shares advanced 2.7 per cent to $49.03.
102;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-05-28T02:50:38Z;High quality can beat the credit crisis;;Luxury goods group are traditionally hit hard by economic downturns. Lehman Brothers’ analysts point to a 25 per cent cut in earnings in the previous slowdown after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US and say that the sector underperformed the market during the period despite its appeal to high-end customers.LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods group, saw its profits drop by 20 per cent in 2001. But heading into the current slowdown courtesy of the financial crisis, luxury goods companies appear upbeat.In some ways they are right to be – they have expanded out of their long-time base in the west into faster-growing countries in emerging markets and analysts’ consensus earnings estimates for this year still point to ten per cent growth in the sector. But can they really escape a global slowdown thanks to rich customers from Dubai, Moscow and Shanghai? Or will they become yet another victim of the credit crunch in the traditional fashion?Most industry executives insist it will be the former, but most analysts and experts believe the latter. Both sides have supporting evidence but the feeling persists that the luxury goods industry will not escape unscathed.“At the very top end of the market is a part of the luxury goods sector that is not very cyclical and that is full of growth from the emerging markets.” says Gerry Adolph, a senior management consultant at Booz & Company. “But the aspirational brands in the middle will be the ones most sensitive to the economic slowdown.”Argument number one for the positive view of the industry is the continued spending by the super-rich. Gerard Aquilina, head of international private banking for Barclays, says his ultra-wealthy clients have felt no effects of the credit crunch and, if anything, are more optimistic at the moment. “They look at this crisis as an opportunity. I haven’t seen a decrease in them buying luxury goods whatsoever,” he says.That is good news for the most exclusive and traditional brands at the top end of the market such as Chanel and Hermès.It was notable when Gucci reported mixed first-quarter sales recently that Bottega Veneta, its most upmarket brand, was the top performer, with a 32 per cent sales increase on a comparable basis.Argument number two for the industry is exposure to emerging markets. Regions such as the Middle East and Asia have developed into main drivers of growth for many companies. Francesco Trapani, chief executive of Bulgari, says softness in the US and some parts of Europe is being offset by the strength of Asia. All of this shows how far the balance of power has shifted in the industry and how the worst-performing luxury goods companies currently are those with the highest exposure to countries such as the US and UK.Examples abound of success in countries recently thought unable to support a big luxury goods sector – LVMH, with its stable of luxury goods from Louis Vuitton to Dom Pérignon, more than tripled its revenues in Vietnam last year while Richemont of Switzerland says it sees growth not just in China but in virtually every country in Asia.But will the emerging markets be enough, and could the slowdown hit them eventually?There seems little doubt that the rich of the Middle East and elsewhere, flush with oil and raw material cash, will continue to splurge. But it is less clear what will happen in other regions such as China if the ripple effects of the financial crisis reach them.Allegra Perry, analyst at Lehman Brothers, points out that 50-60 per cent of the luxury goods industry’s consumers remain in classic, developed markets. “The most important thing right now is geographical exposure,” she says.The naysayers have not just history to back them up but also early evidence that points to a slowdown from companies themselves – Bulgari felt slower sales growth in March, Richemont at the end of last year, while Gucci sold less in the first quarter than last year.Top-end department stores in the US, such as Neiman Marcus and Saks, reported that it was not just aspirational luxury customers cutting back on spending but the very rich ones as well.Robert Burke, a former luxury retail executive who is now head of Robert Burke Associates, a consultancy, says US consumers are definitely cutting back on spending but foreign tourists to the US are using the cheap dollar to go on shopping sprees.“Is that enough to offset the losses? In some cases yes, in many others no,” he says. “When times get tough, though, the aspirational luxury buyer is pinched out of the market first.”All experts are agreed that consumers are likely to become more discerning. And that in turn is likely to lead to a shake-out in the industry with the lower-end brands and the aspirational marques suffering the most.“Companies selling the $10,000 to $20,000 handbag are likely to be OK but those that moved downmarket to find growth – like Burberry or even Gucci – are going to be more exposed,” says Mr Adolph.Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at Credit Suisse, agrees that more accessible companies such as Coach in the US are the most likely to struggle. But he says factors other than the economic slowdown will determine how luxury goods groups perform – particularly tourism flows and the related issue of currencies.One consequence of the possible shake-out of the industry is that many expect to see a return of merger and acquisitions activity. Many in the industry still have a sour taste in their mouth from the last round of deals that peaked with the ill-timed purchase of Gucci by PPR on September 10, 2001.But LVMH, the arch-rival of PPR, in April made its first acquisition in years when it paid several hundred million euros for Hublot, the high-end watchmaker. Experts such as Mr Burke and Mr Adolph expect to see companies from outside the sector and from areas such as Asia and the Middle East becoming involved. Mr Burke says he is advising SK Networks, a South Korean conglomerate, as well as investors from Dubai. Mr Adolph underlines that many companies still owned by the founder, such as Armani, need to decide on their development and, if they sell, whether to become part of a luxury goods conglomerate or sell to an alternative buyer.As a sign of how investors see the sector going, rumours have already started up about Hermès, the French group that is one of the most expensive and best-protected in the sector.Few in the industry doubt that – acquisitions or not – “some kind of slowdown is inevitable”, as Mr Fujimori says. But the jury remains out on how hard the impact will be. As in many industries the flight to quality is likely to be apparent.Mr Burke says: “The true luxury shopper is going to be more discerning than in the past. They are going to buy fewer things and more selectively.”
103;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-05-28T02:50:38Z;Japanese consumers: Shrinking concern for labels;;Guillaume Brochard knew he was right to bet on the Japanese market when the diamond-encrusted pandas sold out in a day.The five sparkling figurines – 6cm high and sporting 15 carats of diamonds and a €19,000 ($29,963) price tag – were made exclusively for sale in Japan by Qeelin, the Franco-Chinese jeweller founded five years ago by Mr Brochard and his Hong Kong-based designer, Dennis Chan.Its baubles – mostly pendants shaped like bears, bells and lotus roots – have been a hit in Japan, where they are available at a single boutique in Tokyo’s Roppongi district. One woman bought 27 smaller and (slightly) lower-priced panda pendants “to give out to friends”, Mr Brochard says.Qeelin does not advertise and came to Japan with next to no name recognition and none of the history or sales infrastructure enjoyed by big rivals such as Cartier and Bulgari. But that is less of a handicap than it would have been a few years ago, Mr Brochard says, particularly for producers targeting the top end of the market.“There is an elite of Japanese that is distancing itself from the traditional ‘mass luxury’,” he says. “They are now more eager to embrace true luxury, which means exclusivity.”Rich Japanese, in other words, are seeking out products that will be recognised and appreciated by their rich and cultivated friends, even if no one else knows who made them. That is a big shift in what has been a notoriously label-conscious market, and marks Japan out from its up-and-coming neighbour, China. “The Chinese haven’t reached this level yet,” Mr Brochard says. “They still like brands you can recognise from 100 metres.”Back in the 1980s, Japan led the world in the so-called democratisation of luxury, as middle-class consumers splurged on designer handbags and jewellery. But “lux-aholic behaviour” has waned, say researchers at the Japan Market Resource Network, a consultancy. Although many people drew down their savings to feed brand addictions through the 1990s economic slump, others decided that the mass-produced joys of Uniqlo and Muji suited them just fine. “Today it is socially acceptable to buy off-price or from discount stores,” JMRN says.As a result, sales of high-end brands have stagnated – pricey pandas notwithstanding. Antoine Belge, analyst at HSBC, says Japan is the world’s most mature market for luxury goods, and predicts that most brands will register “low single-digit” sales growth in the country “for the foreseeable future”.Yet the stakes remain high in a country that generates some 14 per cent of sales for European luxury companies (and more for the bigger names). Weak overall growth also hides gaps between winners and losers. The migration of demand to the high and low ends of the market has benefited “accessible luxury” brands such as Coach – which now has 147 locations amid double-digit sales growth – as well as ultra-exclusive labels such as Bottega Vaneta – a brand as pricey as it is logo-light.At the same time, “brands like Polo and Prada, which both have high levels of brand awareness and market penetration, are losing momentum,” says JMRN, as buyers feel “they are not worth their premium prices”.Big luxury groups are responding to market shifts by offering limited-edition goods even as they cash in at the lower end. Some established brands are also going incognito to increase exclusivity: Kanebo, the Japanese cosmetics maker, has generated its strongest domestic sales growth with its RMK and Suqqu lines, neither of which trade under the Kanebo brand.Many foreign brands are taking the opposite tack, boosting visibility with flashy new flagship stores, some of which offer more than clothes and jewels. At Armani’s 12-story, 6,000sq metre flagship store in Ginza, customers can spend Y65,000 ($627) for a three-hour spa treatment or dine on Japanese beef with celery root flan at the Armani Ristorante. Armani sank $20m into the new space last year, its biggest-ever investment in a single store.Such investments are designed to knit brands more tightly into their customers’ social lives. They also generate new revenue streams without diluting the value of luxury groups’ core offerings – a big risk with more conventional brand expansions.Looking ahead, luxury companies will have to deal with Japan’s shifting demographics – the number of working women aged 30-44 has increased by 15 per cent since 1997 and created a new class of high-earning female consumer. The country’s low birth rate, meanwhile, means the number of young first-time buyers will shrink.In another switch, many “Japanese” luxury buyers may not be Japanese at all, as tourists from China and even Russia increasingly pick up the slack from domestic consumers. “Wealthy Chinese travel to Japan to get things they can’t get in China,” says Richard Collase, head of Chanel in Japan.Chinese signs abound in department stores and some 10,000 retailers now accept debit cards issued by Chinese banks.Luxury shops have encouraged the trend by stocking items not available outside Japan – in part to avoid piracy but also because Japan serves as a test market for the region. “Japan is a showroom for the rest of Asia,” says Mr Collase.
104;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-04-25T17:46:55Z;Watching luxury;;Is the slump in luxury goods sales finally starting? PPR reported this week that like-for-like first-quarter sales for its flagship Gucci brand were up only 2.4 per cent year on year, a sharp drop from 11 per cent for all of 2007. Prada is also delaying its planned public offering until at least the second half of the year.Much of the news, though, is still good. Hermes, LVMH and Richemont all reported double-digit sales growth year on year in the latest quarter, with developing market consumers more than compensating for slower US sales. Even US-based Coach expects to deliver earnings per share above the guidance it gave this time last year.The really rich still have money to spend, and developing world customers, many flush from high commodity prices, are spending like nobody’s business. PPR’s most expensive brand, Bottega Veneta, was its best performer: first-quarter sales grew 31 per cent year on year.Sales growth for all of the luxury companies is stronger in the developing world and in European and tourist cities where Russians, Gulf residents and the Chinese shop.It is no surprise, then, that Gucci, heavily exposed to the developed world, has not escaped unscathed. Also in danger are subsectors such as eyewear and lower-priced leather and fashion products because they rely more on aspirational customers who may be genuinely pinched.The big question mark hangs over watchmakers, who were hit hard along with their banker buyers during the 2001-2003 downturn. Timepieces may benefit in this cycle because Russian and Chinese buyers of luxury are, on the whole, men and buy more watches and jewellery than clothes and handbags. LVMH this week bought watchmaker Hublot to bump up its watch and jewellery revenue to more than the current 5 per cent of sales. But Richemont (25 per cent watches by sales) and Swatch are far better options for investors who want to bet on timepieces.Post and read comments on this Lex
105;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-04-22T19:43:24Z;Luxury handbag sales lift Coach;;Coach, the US bag and accessories brand, said demand for its “accessible luxury” products was continuing to grow in spite of the weakening US economy, and that it would continue a planned rapid expansion of its store network.Lew Frankfort, chief executive, said Coach would open another 40 stores in the coming year. He said he believed the North American market, where Coach has 287 full-price locations, could “easily” support up to 500 stores.While Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, and Tiffany, the jewellers, have reported signs of the slowdown affecting some of their most affluent clients, Coach said that sales of its bags had increased by 18 per cent during its third quarter.Sales of handbags costing more than $400 were up 22 per cent, against a 13 per cent increase in the quarter a year ago.Mr Frankfort said new stores were also continuing to perform strongly, with the stores delivering average sales in their first year of $2.3m.He attributed the continued strength in bag sales in part to aggressive introduction of new designs.“Consumers are more pessimistic …our response is to be more nimble and to compress several years of innovation into one year, and to use our factory channel to help us.”Coach said sales at stores opened at least a year had increased by 9 per cent in its third quarter.However, it ended its previous practice of breaking out the figures for its full-price and factory outlet stores, which sell reduced price goods.“Traffic in full-price continues weak ….while conversion and average ticket grows, while the factory business continues very strong,” Mr Frankfort said.Net income rose 8.3 per cent during the quarter to $162.4m, or 46 cents a share. Sales gained 19 per cent to $744.5m.The company, which has 147 locations in Japan, blamed the strengthening of the yen against the dollar during the quarter for both an increase in inventory levels and a weakening of its gross margins because of higher costs.Coach’s shares fell over 4 per cent to $31.07.
106;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-04-01T20:57:29Z;US stocks soar on UBS news;;Wall Street stocks started the second quarter with a bang on Tuesday as investors cheered news of capital raising by UBS and Lehman Brothers in hope that it could mark a turning point for the beleaguered financial sector.UBS said it would take drastic measures to restore its balance sheet after it posted $19bn in writedowns, adding that its chairman would step down.Its shares rose sharply, as did other European banks, and the sentiment lifted US markets from the open.JPMorgan rose 9.4 per cent to $47 while Goldman Sachs added 6.9 per cent to $176.86 and Citigroup, climbed 11.3 per cent to $23.84.An index of investment bank stocks climbed 9 per cent, but still remains down 20 per cent over the year to date.Investors also received a boost from Lehman, the investment bank, which raised $4bn from a sale of new shares as part of efforts to dispel persistent uncorroborated speculation that it was short of capital.Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said further significant capital fund raises by other financial institutions were likely going forward.Lehman shares were the biggest gainers on the S&P500 index, rising 17.8 per cent to $44.34 for the first time in seven sessions.The shares were followed up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage finance companies that are also seeking to raise capital. Freddie climbed 15.4 per cent to $29.22 while Fannie added 19.7 per cent to $31.50.Rebecca Engmann Darst, an analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “Investors appeared invigorated by today’s [Tuesday’s] “kitchen sink” writedowns by UBS and news of a stock offering by rumor-dunned brokerage Lehman Brothers.”“But as to the question of whether the market is “out of the woods” a look at Tuesday’s Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, [a measure of market risk] trading in further-out months suggests traders hardly banking on a permanent pullback in volatility.”News from KKR Financial and further analyst earnings downgrades for the banking sector as a whole failed to dent the ebulliant mood.The debt investment arm of the well known buyout company said on Monday night it had taken steps to appease lenders, handing over collateral, selling a controlling interest in its real estate investment trust and announcing a plan to sell an additional 20m shares.KKR Financial shares fell 8.7 per cent to $11.56.Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman lent added drama to recent events, arguing in a report that the credit market turmoil posed the most severe crisis for investment banks in 30 years.Under their worst case scenarios total revenues could drop 45 per cent compared to 2007 while longer term return on equity could decline as banks delevered and were forced by regulators to hold more capital in reserve.The benchmark S&P500 was closed 3.6 per cent higher at 1,370.18, climbing the most on the first day of a second quarter since 1938 and shrugging off what was a dismal first quarter.The Nasdaq Composite added 3.7 per cent to 2,362.75 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.2 per cent to 12,654.36.A bounce in technology and consumer discretionary stocks that were heavily sold last week on poor economic data and earnings contributed to the broad-based rally.Coach, the maker of luxury leather goods, rose 6.4 per cent to $32.09, JC Penney, the department store climbed 6.4 per cent to $40.12, and SanDisk, the maker of flash memory cards, jumped 9.8 per cent to $24.77.The latest numbers from the Institute for Supply Management survey for March, helped reinforce sentiment showing US manufacturing contracted less than expected in March.But James Knightley, an economist at ING, cautioned that beneath the headlines, ”the new orders number dropped sharply - an awful outcome - and [was] the weakest number since the last recession.”General Electric climbed for a second day, adding 3.8 per cent to $38.43 as investors bought into industrials on the news.Other data out on Tuesday showed that construction expenditures fell for a fifth consecutive month in February amid the ongoing housing recession.Housing stocks shrugged off the news for the most part. Lennar rose 13.7 per cent to $21.38 while KB Homes climbed 8.9 per cent to $26.93.Centex also rallied, 2.6 per cent to $24.86, after taking steps to deleverage including the sale of properties for about $455m.Even news that sales at US automakers fell more than expected in March couldn’t dampen the enthusiasm.Shares in GM rose 5.8 per cent to $20.15 while Ford added 4.4 per cent to $5.97.Elsewhere, bid news and rumours helped buoy indices.CSK Auto rose 25.7 per cent to $11.70 after O’Reilly Automotive, an auto-parts chain, agreed to buy the company for about $1bn, including about $500m of debt. The move will create the third-largest auto-parts retailer in the US.Expedia, the online travel services company, was among the S&P 500’s biggest gainers, climbing 10.1 per cent to $24.09 on unconfirmed bid speculation..
107;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-03-18T17:43:21Z;Luxury goods: More than threads and jewels;;So you have been dragged by a fashion-mad friend into Armani’s 12-story, 6,000 sq metre flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, but you do not need a suit or a scarf.Not to worry: the spa is just upstairs. At Y65,000 ($669), a three-hour Armani Ceremony to “treat every part of the being” will set you back less than the cashmere. When you are done, you can re-join your friend for a bite at the top-floor Armani Ristorante.Armani sank $20m into the new space last year, its biggest-ever investment in a single store. It is not the only luxury brand offering Japanese customers more than threads and jewels.If the Ristorante’s fattened Japanese beef with celery root flan is not to your liking, just head down the street to Chanel, where the French fashion house has set up an eatery with Alain Ducasse.You can follow up with drinks at B bar, Baccarat’s new nightspot – cocktails in crystal glasses at Y2,500-Y3,000 – then work off your hangover with a yoga session amid the handbags at Furla.Bulgari, Hermes, LVMH, Richemont, Coach – just about any luxury group you can name has spent big money to open flagship stores or expand sales networks in Japan in the past several years. They have been drawn by Japan’s six-year economic recovery, which has been particularly good to wealthy urbanites, their primary clientele.Yet there are reasons to question the investment spree. Overall incomes have barely budged, in spite of a sharp increase in corporate profits, and the Japanese fervour for foreign brands has waned since the go-go 1980s.Although the country generates 14 per cent of sales for European luxury companies (and more for the bigger names), it is likely to add just 0.3 of a percentage point to their overall sales growth this year, according to HSBC.“It’s difficult to admit that the era of high growth is over,” says Yves Alemani, head of Japan operations at Christofle, the French silverware maker, which will launch a new store in the posh Roppongi Hills shopping centre in May.Luxury brands, he says, “continue to look at Japan as a promising market”, when it is in fact a mature and daunting one. Heavy competition and a stagnant population ago profile do not help.For some luxury companies, expansion in Japan has been in part a real estate bet. Chanel, which bought land in Ginza to build a store five years ago when Japan’s property market was at a low ebb, says the building’s value has risen by 40 per cent. Many other brands are leasing their space, however – and suffering painful rent increases as a result.“There is no way that everyone is making money,” says Richard Collase, head of Chanel in Japan.Making money may not be the flagships’ purpose – at least not the most immediate one. Mr Collase says Japan serves as “a showroom for the rest of Asia”, where luxury sales are expanding much faster.Consumers in China still look to Japan as a fashion leader, and although brands are building more shops there, many are wary of stocking their Chinese shelves with the latest and best merchandise, for fear that it will quickly be copied.“Wealthy Chinese travel to Japan to get things they can’t get in China,” says Mr Collase.For the Japanese market, meanwhile, advertising through a stylish new flagship may be a necessary defensive response to saturation. Cheaper publicity is harder to come by, as the Japanese are less inclined than they once were to sport foot-high logos on their sweaters and handbags.They are also less susceptible to some forms of marketing favoured in the west, such as hanging clothing and jewellery on much-photographed celebrities, says Sakae Nonomura, head of product development at Kanebo, the cosmetics maker. “Japanese are much more concerned about what other members of their peer group are wearing.”Cementing brands’ hold on the right peer groups is one purpose of the spas, cafes and restaurants: they help insinuate brands into customers’ social lives. On a recent afternoon, the Armani Ristorante was filled with prosperous-looking women in their 30s and 40s – core buyers for Armani’s more upscale lines.Such women might previously have spent a leisurely afternoon shopping and sipping tea at a department store, the distribution medium that has long dominated the luxury trade. But department stores are in decline – sales have fallen every year for a decade and a half. That has generated perhaps the strongest motivation for brands to build more stand-alone stores.If nothing else, the cafes and restaurants offer brands fresh revenue streams – alternatives to the sort of chains-and-umbrellas licensing deals that have sometimes diluted their image. “If you have a coffee shop or a restaurant you can cash in every day,” says Mr Aleman.
108;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2008-03-10T20:04:09Z;The year of the designer handbag;;Hong Kong is bracing itself this week for a French battle of the handbags, as Louis Vuitton and Chanel vie for the limelight with grand openings that underline Asia’s growing importance to the fashion industry.On Wednesday, Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel’s pony-tailed designer, will attend the official launch of a moveable museum before it heads off on a world tour of fashion capitals. Housed in a 700 sq m structure designed by architect Zaha Hadid, the Mobile Art Museum – which looks more like a spaceship than a fashion gallery – brings together 20 leading artists and their interpretation of the classic Chanel handbag.Across the Hong Kong harbour on Canton road, Louis Vuitton is re-opening a store that it has overhauled and expanded. The outlet will be its second-largest worldwide, after its flagship Champs Elysées store in Paris. Louis Vuitton’s event will close on Friday night with a party for 2,500 guests held in a golden tent and hosted by Bernard Arnault, chairman of parent company LVMH, or Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.Beyond this week’s extravaganza, almost every leading fashion house has earmarked 2008 as the year of expansion in Asia, much of it focused on China. Louis Vuitton is turning its attention to second-tier Chinese cities, which will boost its mainland presence from 19 stores to 25 by year-end. “Today we see demand in every provincial city in mainland China,” says Yves Carcelle, chief executive of Louis Vuitton.The switch to second-tier cities is a telling sign of China’s emergence as a key fashion market. Thibault Villet, a former L’Oréal executive who is now Greater China president of Coach, the US maker of handbags and other accessories, says: “When I worked in cosmetics in Asia, the development of second and third-tier cities happened five to seven years ago, but it’s only just now happening for fashion. That shows that it’s really the right time and a market that is reaching a new dimension.”The company will soon inaugurate a Hong Kong store with the biggest Coach façade worldwide and a lavish interior adorned with white Italian marble floors. Meanwhile Salvatore Ferragamo, the luxury goods group, plans to celebrate its 80th anniversary with a fashion show in Shanghai later this month.The Asian growth story goes well beyond China, argue executives. Louis Vuitton’s revenues rose “more than 300 per cent” last year in Vietnam, according to Mr Carcelle, who describes the Communist country as “a new dragon”.Alain Li, regional chief executive for Richemont, the Swiss-based luxury goods group, says: “China is of course a significant part of the story but we’re really seeing the whole region as having very strong momentum and that hopefully will continue.”The thrust into Asia is not just about business. Nathan Jenden, a leading figure among the new generation of British designers, says: “The energy I get from Asia is something that I can’t find anywhere else in the world. I think that New York is definitely not as exciting as Shanghai right now …Chinese ladies are in some cases much more elegant than some of the people back home …The local designers there are also incredibly avant-garde.”The scale and number of fashion events scheduled this year also underline another leitmotiv among fashion executives – the “new sophistication” of their Asian clientele. Louis Vuitton’s Canton road store, for example, will feature a bookstore and will be the first to host an art exhibition area.“I think the fashion world is beginning to realise that Asian customers are getting more sophisticated by the day,” says Mr Jenden. “Yes, there are cultural differences. Europeans don’t pick their teeth. But it’s very important not to be jaded or patronising when in Asia.”Brenda Wang, founder of Brandxcel, a Hong Kong-based consultancy firm that advises luxury and fashion brands planning to enter the Asian market, also warns against a blanket approach to Asia. “If you try to hit three or four countries at the same time, there is a tendency to spread yourself too thin …People tend to view Asia as one country, but this is a place with different buying patterns and distribution landscapes across the key markets.”As an example, Mr Villet from Coach points to the importance of footwear in China, as well as the male focus on accessories. “Luxury in China started with men and historically-speaking they have a tradition of purchasing leather-wear accessories for themselves as well as for gifts,” he notes. “Chinese men represent a very different market that you have to study and understand.”As to how immersed they should become in Asian culture, fashion executives point to a difficult balancing act between nurturing their brand and embracing the local culture. Coach, for example, will be relying on Asian celebrities to help promote its launches but is counting on a Hollywood actress, Kate Bosworth, to lead its media advertising campaign.“We are clearly a New York brand and so we need to communicate an image in accordance with our DNA,’’ says Mr Villet. “But the right way for us to go local is when we do events, where we certainly want to be working with the local celebrities.”Similarly, fashion brands are seeing opportunities in contributing to the development of the local fashion scene. Next month Yohji Yamamoto will fly into Beijing an entire cast of models for Y’s fashion show, which will be held in a World Heritage site. But the event is also being combined with the launch of a foundation that will sponsor new Chinese designers and offer them education opportunities outside China.Growth in some Asian markets, notably India, is constrained by a lack of property in the right locations or disproportionately expensive sites. On the other hand, store leases tend to be shorter while furniture and shop-fitting costs are much cheaper. “If a location is not working as well as expected, it is financially easier to get out of,” says John Durnin, Asia chief executive for Alfred Dunhill.Another challenge for Asia’s fashion development is one shared across many other industries – a shortage of skills. Ms Wang, the consultant, says: “Finding a prime location is certainly difficult, but you may end up with the right location and inexperienced sales staff and as such, maximising sales or increasing repeat business will be limited.”Will image-conscious fashion houses join the outsourcing bandwagon by shifting production to Asia? Most insist that production there will concern specific products and remain on a small scale.Last year Louis Vuitton made its first manufacturing foray outside of Europe by establishing a shoe production venture in Pondicherry, India. About 100 people are employed in its workshop there, which is “very limited,” Mr Carcelle stresses. “We have no intention to go further.”

Nor have I spoken to him since I left graduate school in 1991, when he was my officemate. Scott was like the rest of us, except for this: he never had trouble lining up a date. I asked him for his secret. All you have to do is ask the girl,” he said. “Most people don’t ask.”This brings me to the Super Bowl, which I’m told is this weekend. I know nothing about football. In fact, I have no idea how many people are on a team but let’s say it’s about 10. That makes about 20 people on the field. And about 100,000 people in the stadium watching. That’s how most things are in life – a few people on the field while everyone else is on the sidelines watching. It’s a bit like the college dating game where we watched Scott playing the field.Most of my life I’ve sat on the sidelines. It’s hard not to. After all, how many games can you play in? I’ve played in a few. For instance, I had aspirations of being a writer but it was only in 2002 that I got my break. I had written to Jim Cramer suggesting about 10 column ideas. One was how you could buy Duke preferred stock, which was yielding 17 per cent at the time, and sell short Duke stock to lock in the yield. He replied: “Why don’t you write about these ideas.” That’s how I started writing for thestreet.com. When one of my editors left for the FT, he introduced me to Lionel Barber, then US managing editor, now editor, who asked me to write for the Wealth page. I was no longer on the sidelines.Ideas are where everything starts. Not long ago, my business partner and I were at a San Francisco airport and our flight to New York was delayed. To pass the time we started writing ideas for internet businesses. We came up with about five. That weekend, I posted the jobs at scriptlance.com and hired developers from Bangalore and Malaysia to work on each business. The cost for any one was not prohibitive. Everything was cheap to develop and at least try out. Four flopped but one was an instant success: stockpickr.com.Last week I received a nice e-mail from a reader asking advice. He had some ideas but saw roadblocks towards starting a business. He is not unique in this respect – many people start setting up roadblocks in their early childhood. Sometimes for good reasons. Roadblocks help narrow the path. And a narrow and sure path offers security. For instance, this reader worried about affording a business when he had other financial responsibilities. But today, with a little research and outsourcing, you can start almost any business – at least any data-driven or web-driven business – for next to nothing. Let’s say less than $5,000 to get reasonable prototypes for almost anything you want to do. You can even outsource content development.The reader was also worried about protecting his ideas. My solution is this: never worry about that. Let people steal your ideas. If you’re passionate about the idea, nobody will beat you. Particularly since you only need $5,000 as opposed to $10m to do just about anything. To prove my point, here’s an idea I want to do: a hedge fund based on some of the ideas in stockpickr.com (piggybacking the great investors such as Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, George Soros, among others). Another idea I like is to play around with is building various facebook applications. You can do that for almost $0.A lot of people are worried about the time it takes to create a business, particularly if you have another job. This fear of no time is an illusion. If you really look at your time commitments, particularly if you are not satisfied with your job, you probably have a good five to 10 hours a day to play with. Stop spending all day text messaging friends and start working on your ideas. Also, while a business plan is important if you need to raise funding, don’t obsess too much about it. Once you launch the model is going to change and all your prior assumptions will be wrong. So time spent on a thorough business plan is probably time wasted.I have no real stock market advice today. The market has been cheap since the first day of this year and before and it’s cheaper now. Last week I bought Coach, Nvidia, Bank of America, Brooks Automation, and the Nasdaq and Russell ETFs. I’ll look at them again in about a year. I didn’t want to sit on the sidelines anymore, particularly when I’ve been so bullish in these columns. I desperately wanted to play.
110;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Luxury goods makers feel chill of recession;;Signs that even the world’s richest consumers are falling prey to fears of recession gathered pace yesterday as two big luxury goods makers said demand from Japan and the US for Cartier watches, designer handbags and expensive jewellery was slowing.Richemont, the world’s second-largest luxury goods company, said underlying growth slowed to 10 per cent in December – against 14 per cent for the full quarter – as demand waned from consumers in two of the world’s biggest economies.The news sent shares in the maker of Cartier watches and Montblanc pens down 6.65 per cent to SFr58.25. The group narrowly missed forecasts with an 8 per cent rise in group sales to €1.67bn ($2.44bn).Coach, the largest US maker of designer handbags, also said underlying sales in its US retail stores had fallen during the second quarter and were down 1.1 per cent as consumers cut back on visits to stores. When they made a purchase they were opting for lower-priced items.The drop in same-store sales in 2007 compared with a 25.7 per cent increase in the holiday period in 2006. Coach said the drop in transaction sizes had been “unexpected”.“My own view is that we’re already in a consumer recession,” Lew Frankfort, chief executive of Coach, told Reuters. “We do need a tax stimulus package,” he added, suggesting that this week’s cut in US interest rates was not enough alone to boost spending.Tiffany, the US-based jeweller, this month also lowered its quarterly earnings forecast after achieving disappointing holiday sales.The Italian luxury goods sector has not yet reported signs of a slowdown, in spite of expectations that consumer confidence is waning. Aeffe, the holding company behind Moschino, Alberta Ferretti and other fashion brands, said this week there had been “no negative signs” in the US over the Christmas period or this month so far.Armani, which is private, said on Wednesday that 2007 had been another positive year.
111;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

Retailers stayed under pressure after a profit warning at Sears compounded concerns about the health of the US consumer.The S&P 500 closed at 1,416.25 points, up 1.1 per cent; the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 2,478.30 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4 per cent to 12,778.15.IBM’s preliminary fourth-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent and revenues climbed 10 per cent, as overseas sales received a boost from the weak US dollar. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $102.93.IBM’s results spurred a broad-based rally with strong gains in the technology sector. Intel, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, rose 5 per cent to $23.08; Hewlett-Packardalso put on 5 per cent to $39.84.“In times of high uncertainty small pieces of information can have a disproportionate impact – markets tend to overreact both on the upside and the downside,” Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said.The tech sector has had particularly heavy selling in recent weeks, causing the Nasdaq to slide about 14 per cent from its October peak, amid worries that growth forecasts were too high.Echoing these concerns, Citi Investment Research lowered its view on the software and services sector on expectations of lower second-half demand. “It is not a big surprise that one of the industry’s key purchasers of software (the financial sector) is likely to be much more judicious with its dollars in the next year or so,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist.The fourth-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week with technology companies’ profits forecast by Thomson Financial to rise 22 per cent and energy and healthcare also expected to deliver good earnings growth.A 72 per cent slump in financial company profits is expected to drag average fourth-quarter earnings into the negative for a second successive quarter, averaging an 11.3 per cent decline for the S&P 500. Citi reports on Tuesday, with earnings from JPMorgan on Tuesday and Merrill Lynch on Thursday.Investors are preparing for more losses with Citi taking as much as $24bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and cutting up to 24,000 jobs, according to a CNBC report.Citi, up 1.8 per cent at $29.06, is seeking as much as $14bn from Chinese, Kuwaiti and public market investors to ease pressure on its balance sheet, while Merrill Lynch, 2.3 per cent higher at $55.97, is looking to raise about $4bn.Retailers faced continued pressure amid fears for the health of consumer spending. Department store operator Sears said fourth-quarter earnings came in far below Wall Street expectations due to higher mark-downs and falling same-store sales.Goldman Sachs advised investors to sell the shares, which fell 5 per cent to $91.38, and downgraded several retailers. Coach, the handbag chain, fell 4.2 per cent to $25.72 and Ralph Lauren, the fashion house, lost 4.3 per cent to $52.90 after Goldman cut its rating on the stocks from “buy” to “neutral”.Consumer companies slid last week after a cautious outlook at American Express and weaker earnings guidance at Tiffany, the jeweller, led to fears about wealthy consumers, previously considered more immune to a downturn.Agribusiness continued its buoyant form after Cargill said second-quarter earnings had jumped 44 per cent. Monsanto gained 5.5 per cent to $127.25 while Archer Daniels Midland put on 3.4 per cent to $45.14.General Mills, the cereal maker, rose 0.7 per cent to $56.54 after a JPMorgan analyst upgraded the shares.Transport stocks benefited from a brokerage upgrade after Bear Stearns raised the trucking sector from “market underweight” to “market weight”. Ryder System jumped 6.4 per cent to $46 and YRC Worldwide gained 7.1 per cent to $14.86.Healthcare stocks ended five days of gains.

113;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Sears shares fall as holiday sales disappoint;;Sears Holdings, the third largest US retailer, on Monday saw its shares hit their lowest level since the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart on a disappointing holiday sales report and gloomy earnings guidance.The retailer, controlled by hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert, blamed “increased competition and the negative impact of unfavourable economic conditions” for a 3.5 per cent decline in comparable sales during November and December.It said steep discounting had reduced its gross margins 200 basis points for the nine-week holiday period.As a result it said it expects earnings of $2.59- $3.48 a share for its fourth quarter, down from $5.33 a share a year earlier, and well below analysts’ forecasts.Since the $11bn merger, Mr Lampert’s management team has struggled to improve the performance of both Sears and Kmart, after arguing initially that their falling comparable sales would eventually be offset by improved profit margins.Shares in the merged company rose to a peak of $195 in March last year, supported by speculation that Mr Lampert would either use Sears cash to deliver a transfomative deal, or sell off additional real estate assets. Its shares on Monday fell below $90 for the first time since the merger, when they were priced at about $125.Mr Lampert in November accused media and financial commentators of ignoring “the strength of our company and the progress that we have made” since the merger.He also dismissed criticisms that his team had not been reinvesting in the store network, saying it had spent more than $1bn on the stores “over the past several years”.But it has also continued to use cash to repurchase shares, saying on Monday that it had spent $513m to acquire 4.9m shares at $105 per share over the past 10 weeks. It spent $900m on share buybacks in the third quarter, paying about $131 per share.Goldman Sachs’ retail analysts on Monday issued a downgrade of Sears’ shares from “neutral” to “sell”, which was planned before the latest disappointing sales news. “We expect share loss to accelerate and margin shortfalls to intensify over the next several quarters,” Goldman said.The downgrade was part of a review of the retail sector, which saw Goldman cut its earnings guidance for 2008 by 12 per cent. It also downgraded Coach and Ralph Lauren from buy to neutral, citing what it called “growing cracks across aspirational and high end” spending.Tiffany, the jeweller, has lowered its quarterly earnings forecast after disappointing holiday sales in the US. The National Retail Federation on Monday predicted US retail sales would slow to 3.5 per cent this year, the slowest growth since 2002.
114;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2007-12-28T13:18:51Z;Luxury losses;;It has not been a merry Christmas season in the world of luxury goods. Shares in companies ranging from handbag maker Coach to jewellers Bulgari and Tiffany have sunk amid fears that a possible slowdown will cut into sales. The world luxury index, created by Deutsche Borse earlier this year to allow investors to track what was seen as a vibrantly growing sector, is down nearly 16 per cent from its peak in early June.Most companies are still reporting revenue and earnings growth, but the double-digit jumps of the past few years may be a thing of the past. Luxury goods, particularly those manufactured on a large scale by public companies, are no longer immune to worries about flagging consumer confidence. Worldwide expansion and lower-priced items aimed at the merely well-off may have made luxury companies more vulnerable to cyclical trends, particularly in the US and Japan. In the last recession, watchmakers were hit harder because they, unlike the fashion and leather houses, sold their wares through independent retailers and, as a result, inventories built up.But some companies are more recession-proof than others and their shares may have been sold off more heavily than they deserve. Companies that aim at top-end consumers – Hermès, Cartier – are likely to sail through more easily than those dependent on a wider range of customers: sales of super-jumbo yachts reportedly remain strong, while orders for boats under $1m are a lot weaker. The big conglomerates – LVMH, PPR and Richemont – also have advantages over the monobrands because they can demand lower advertising rates and grab the best locations, whether in free-standing stores or in department store concessions. Despite worsening conditions, Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo have picked advisers for initial public offerings in 2008, adding supply to an already soggy sector. The rarity value of the stocks, like the goods themselves, seems to be in decline.
115;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2007-11-29T01:56:57Z;Luxury brands fail to make ethical grade;;"Some of the world’s biggest luxury conglomerates have failed to make the grade in a ranking of ethical and environmental performance.A report released on Thursday by the WWF, the conservation group, entitled “Deeper Luxury”, gives Bulgari and Tod’s, the Italian jewellery and accessory companies, a grade F for their “environmental, social and governance performance and reputation” in 2006 of the 10 largest publicly traded luxury conglomerates.Their French, Swiss and US competitors do not fare much better. PPR, which owns Gucci Group, received a D, as did Swatch and Richmont, the Swiss watch and jewellery groups.The highest grade – a C+ – was awarded to Hermés, L’Oréal, and LVMH.There is no established methodology for assessing the industry’s performance in the ethical and environmental area. To arrive at the grades, WWF collected data from analysts Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS), which uses company reports and information to track performance, which it may follow up with a questionnaire; and Covalence, a company that tracks public perception of a company through news reports.The report’s co-author An­thony Kleanthous, a senior po­licy adviser at WWF, said most of the luxury companies did well in some areas but were weak in others, hence the low overall scores.PPR, for example, owns Puma, which is strong on em­ployment practices owing to the sweat shop scandals in the sports wear industry in the 1990s, but does little regarding carbon emissions. Tod’s poor showing was due to its failure to respond fully to EIRIS questionnaires. The company declined to comment yesterday.“Honestly, I was surprised none got more than a C+,” said Mr Kleanthous. “I think it comes down to the fact that luxury companies do not consider their products to be particularly damaging to the environment and there is a certain complacency in regards to the ex­plosive growth of new markets. They just don’t think people are going to be asking the questions. But there has been a paradigm shift and that is just not true.”According to a recent issue of the New York-based Luxury Institute’s Wealth Report, in a survey of 950 high-income American adults, “57 per cent …say they would pay higher prices for a brand that is recognised for socially responsible practices” and “70 per cent …seek out brands with superior environmental records”.“It is true this has not been a focus of PPR in the past, though that has now changed,” said Laurent Claquin, PPR’s senior vice-president for CSR, a department inaugurated only last September.Mr Claquin said the department was created because PPR’s chief executive, Francois-Henri Pinault, wanted to “signal his desire to do something serious in these areas”, not because of the WWF report.Mr Kleanthous said Richemont took steps in a similar direction last summer, releasing its first CSR report. The group declined to comment on the WWF publication.The WWF report was inspired by “a desire to look at an industry that has a heavy impact on culture and the way people think”, said Mr Kleanthous. “We are not trying to criticise these companies but to make a general point: responsible business practices can be a value driver, but they need to be systematically embedded in the DNA of a company,” he added. “Comparison can be a powerful motivation to change.”Though Tiffany, Coach, and Swatch did not return calls for comment, a spokesperson for L’Oréal said: “We welcome all reports from respected organisations in this field as they are a useful tool for progress.”The spokesperson noted that L’Oréal already published its own sustainability report and was listed on the FTSE4 good sustainability index.Hugh Morrison, a spokesman for LVMH, said, “We have invested a great deal in understanding the issues and developing strategies to be best in class – we certainly expect future surveys to show our continued progress in this field.”Everyone wants an A.Methodology (provided by WWF)All companies are used to being ranked on business performance. Such a benchmarking exercise can help individual business people better understand their relative performance, and identify areas for improvement. In recent years, more companies have begun to be ranked on their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, especially by investment analysts who provide information to asset managers and asset owners that consider these issues material to financial performance, or to the wider interests of their investors.The largest publicly-traded luxury conglomerates all regularly report their financial performance and are therefore subject to scrutiny, as in this report. The top ten publicly-traded luxury conglomerates or groups were analysed and ranked on their performance in the fields of environment, society and governance.These companies are:● Bulgari: The fast-growing Italian jeweller and luxury goods retailer, founded in Rome in 1884. Bulgari’s heritage is in jewellery, but it now also produces and licenses watches, handbags, fragrances, accessories and hotels.● Coach, Inc: The US-based leather goods company that started life in a loft in Manhattan in 1941.

Not a single luxury conglomerate appears in investment analyst Innovest’s list of the 100 most responsible corporations of 2007, despite the fact that 23 make discretionary consumer items – more than any other type of product or service. LVMH, Hermès, L’Oréal and Swatch were the only luxury conglomerates listed in the FTSE4Good index in 2006, but LVMH was expelled for supply chain issues in March 2007. Appearance on these indices indicates that a company has a conscious strategic approach to the responsibilities associated with its core activities, and is communicating its efforts to external audiences. With trillions of dollars now invested according to ethical guidelines, the lack of luxury conglomerate performance on these indices will become more financially relevant.It is in this context of limited ESG disclosure that we have prepared the ranking for this report. In the absence of data from all the companies using standardised protocols and systems of verification and audit, our ranking relies on two categories of information: first, what companies themselves report to the ethical investment community about their ESG performance; and second, what the media and non-governmental organisations have been saying about them. The data for each was compiled in 2007 for performance during 2006.For the first category, data was sourced from Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS). A non-profit, independent research organisation, EIRIS has been conducting social, environmental and ethical research on publicly listed companies since 1983. It gathers information directly from companies through questionnaires, and augments this by analysing company public documents including annual reports, websites and specific environmental, social and sustainability reports. The data is collected for 50 criteria, grouped in four areas:● environment;
● human rights;
● corporate governance; and
● stakeholder relations.Criteria include topics such as equal opportunity and environmental policies, against which companies are graded from poor to exceptional. WWF turned these into numerical scores, with each criterion given equal weight in making up the total score. (In the absence of a stakeholder process to determine the relative importance of different issues, any weighting of the criteria would be arbitrary and not credible. However, we did correct bias introduced by the unequal numbers of sub-criteria within each of the four principal areas. This ensures that each area accounted for 25% of the 50 points available for this half of the index – a maximum for each, then, of 12.5 points.)For the second category, data was sourced from Covalence, a Geneva-based research house. Covalence documents thousands of positive and negative news stories about companies in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German, then codes and synthesises them into rankings. Its 45 criteria cover working conditions and the impacts of production, products and institutions. Covalence’s search generated 512 news stories which were analysed and coded as either positive or negative. WWF weighted the result so that each company obtained a comparable score out of 50.The scores for EIRIS and Covalence were then added, to create a total maximum possible score of 100. This creates a ranking of the self-reported performance and public reputation on corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues. Each company’s score out of 100 is expressed in our ranking as a grade between A+ (best) and F (worst) according to the scale below. The results are shown in the table above."
116;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2007-10-23T21:29:12Z;Tarnished luxury goods;;The bull case for luxury goods stocks is fraying. Last week, fashion and spirits conglomerate LVMH delighted investors with strong sales across divisions and regions in its first nine months. Burberry’s share price did drop but largely owing to cost concerns – retail revenues still rose by 25 per cent year on year. Reported sales to date generally supported the assertion that the credit crunch has had limited impact on the top slice of the luxury market. Europeans and newly wealthy emerging markets shoppers were still snapping up prestige products by the handful.But now there are disturbing signs. On Tuesday, Coach shares dropped nearly 12 per cent after it warned of weak retail traffic trends in the US over the past few weeks. Research by Telsey Advisory Group suggests that the breakneck growth of the $7bn US handbag market is slowing. The slumping housing market and lower banking bonuses could crimp US and UK holiday spending. Some big brands may also be losing their exclusivity. Makers such as Louis Vuitton have thrived by convincing shoppers to upgrade to the latest pattern every season, but how long can that last?The test could come next month when big European players, PPR and Richemont, announce third-quarter sales. But even if the sector cools generally, there may be room at the very top.PPR has had success positioning its ultra exclusive Bottega Veneta brand this way. For investors, buying into the trend may get easier. Salvatore Ferragamo has picked an adviser for a planned 2008 initial public offering, and Prada is headed that way. Investors have been here before – Prada pulled a planned IPO after the 2001 terrorist attacks. While it is hard to beat LVMH on range, these super luxury brands could attract high-end customers who can walk right in during the economic tough times that keep normal noses pressed against the glass.

118;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2007-04-24T16:27:28Z;Coach takes fight directly to the counterfeiters;;Coach, the US handbags and accessories group, says it is taking a higher-profile approach than many of its competitors in fighting counterfeiting in China, a market that offers huge potential for the future.Foreign luxury goods companies all have extensive anti-counterfeiting programmes in place in China and use private investigators and lawyers who work with local authorities to combat the manufacture, sale and export of fake products, but many prefer to keep such policing operations quiet.Carole Sadler, the New York-based general counsel for Coach, said, however, that the company’s approach was to be as “vociferous and vigilant” as possible.“We want to deter people,” she said in an interview in Beijing after touring the company’s operations in China. “My goal to promote a zero-tolerance policy towards counterfeiters and show them at every level the risk they are taking.”The aim was to keep the “brand’s integrity intact” and communicate that to consumers, and also ensure that the pirates were constrained to the point that their counterfeits did not swamp real products in the market.Coach, which promotes itself as an accessible luxury brand, sells about 95 per cent of its bags, jewellery and shoes in two markets, the US and Japan, with a focus on marketing the products through its own stores.It expects to have eight stores in China by the end of the year, but it lags well behind market leader LVMH, the French luxury group, whose sales to Chinese both at home and abroad make up a much larger share of its global business.LVMH has aggressively fought piracy, both though public law suits and also more quietly, behind the scenes, in pressing the authorities for raids on counterfeiting factories.Coach is different from other luxury brands in that it manufactures extensively in China itself, something that others say they have largely avoided because of the potential stigma of the “Made in China” label on luxury goods, even for Chinese consumers.Ms Sadler says she believes this is now changing, with more luxury goods companies beginning to bring some of their manufacturing onshore as Coach has done.She said that the biggest issue for Coach in enforcing its intellectual property rights was a lack of consistency in enforcement at the local level in China.“You may get a great Public Security Bureau (police department) in one area and then find they are not looking to be taking action in another area,” he said.The reason for such inconsistencies were often not clear, she said, because of the lack of transparency in the Chinese system.With the help of the Chinese authorities, she said, Coach had seized millions of counterfeited products in thousands of raids.Ms Sadler said that seizures of counterfeit goods were divided equally between the US and China but that nearly all the fake products were manufactured in China.But she said Coach was confident that the local companies it had contracted to manufacture on its behalf could be relied on not to add extra product lines to sell on the black market.Many so-called counterfeit products in China have often turned out to be extra product runs produced by companies contracted to make goods by multinationals.
119;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2007-02-28T00:01:11Z;Luxury goods makers hit by sell-off;;The global markets sell-off hit US luxury goods makers particularly hard with shares in Coach and Tiffany falling more than 5 per cent on fears of a slowdown in Chinese demand for their products.Coach, the maker of luxury handbags and accessories, has 13 stores in Hong Kong. It is in the midst of expanding in mainland China, with five stores already open in Beijing, Shanghai and Xian, and 10 more planned over the next two years.In an indication of the demand for its products, Coach said last year that its latest store in Hong Kong was expected to do about $5m (£2.54m) worth of business in its first 12 months.Coach’s shares fell more than 13 per cent during the day before closing down almost 6 per cent at $2.92.Shares in Tiffany, the jeweller, fell 5.6 per cent to $42.52. The company’s shares gained 4.2 per cent on Monday on news that Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, had taken a 5.5 per cent stake.Tiffany opened two new stores in mainland China last autumn, adding two additional stores to the two locations it already had in Beijing and Shanghai.It operates six locations in Hong Kong and one in Macau.Last summer, Tiffany launched a Chinese website with information about its stores and products but without an online sales component.The two US luxury companies were harder hit than European competitors, with LVMH closing down 3.85 per cent, and Pinault-Printemps Redoute losing 3.75 per cent during the day in Paris.Gold futures also fell by 3 per cent in New York to $666.30 an ounce as part of a general sell-off of commodities amid concerns over falling Chinese demand.
120;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2006-07-07T19:50:13Z;Coach puts Midwest destinations on the timetable;;As Angela Ahrendts steers Burberry’s wagons towards the retail heartlands of the US Midwest, she will be following the footsteps of early brand pioneers who saw potential in the untapped aspirations of prosperous middle America.Coach, the handbag and accessory maker that describes itself as an “accessible luxury lifestyle brand”, is this month due to open its first store in Evansville, Indiana – the state’s third-largest city.Evansville is a quintessential midwest city - with a population of 300,000, it is described by its Convention and Visitors’ Bureau as a place where “residents offer a smile and hello as they pass”.Coach’s move into Evansville is part of a dramatic national expansion that has seen the company almost doubling its US store base over the past five years to 193 stores, including mid-sized cities such as Columbus, Ohio and the Overland Park suburb of Kansas City.This year Coach’s plans include new stores in Oklahoma City, Albany in upstate New York, and Omaha, Nebraska – none of them known as fashion centres.But Coach remains an “upscale” rather than a luxury brand – its bags and products are cheaper than Burberry, which currently only has about 35 stores in the US.“To be unique and exclusive you can’t be ubiquitous,” says Milton Pedraza, of the Luxury Institute. “There’s a fine line, and if you go into these smaller cities, I think you can cross that line.”Neiman Marcus, the elite department store that stocks Burberry’s handbag range, continues to focus on following the big money – this year it opened just two more stores in swanky Boca Raton, Florida, and in San Antonio, one of the most prosperous cities in Texas.However, both Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue - the upmarket department stores that are Neiman’s closest rivals – could provide Burberry with the kind of location anchors that the retailer will be looking for in cities such as Cincinnatti and Indianapolis.Burberry’s US consumers, meanwhile, remain largely unaware of the “Chav” related brand-challenges faced by Burberry in its home market in the UK.In her push into the hinterlands, Ms Ahrendts will have to decide just how far she wants to go.
121;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2006-04-25T20:47:20Z;Robust earnings have little impact on Wall Street;;Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday as rising consumer confidence and housing data dragged down leading indices in spite of robust earnings from companies such as Yum! Brands, Weatherford and Whirlpool.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 6.37 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 1,301.74, while the Nasdaq dipped 3.08 points, or 0.1 per cent to 2,330.30. The Dow Jones also finished the day 0.5 per cent, or 53.07 points, lower at 11,283.25.Data showing an increase in existing home sales in March and a rise in consumer confidence to a four-year peak stoked fears of higher interest rates and depressed the market.Sun Microsystems, the maker of computer servers, closed slightly higher after it announced a change in management after the close on Monday.Scott McNealy, chief executive, said that he would step down in favour of Jonathan Schwartz, company president. Sun soared earlier in the day on Tuesday, but pulled back to close 0.2 per cent higher at $4.99.Yum! Brands reported first quarter earnings of $170m, or 59 cents a share, up from $153m or 50 cents a share in the previous quarter, and ahead of analyst expectations.Yum!, the owner of the Taco Bell and KFC brands, said the bird flu scare did have a minor impact on earnings in China, but that it expects same-store sales there to increase again in the coming year.Yum! raised its profit forecasts for 2006 by 2 cents to $2.81, pushing its shares up 3.5 per cent to $51.34.Shares in Netflix, the online DVD rentals service jumped, gaining 1.4 per cent to $31.68 following its announcement that it had made a quarterly profit.Net income for the first quarter was $4.4m, or 7 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $8.8m the previous year.The announcement by President George W Bush that he would halt deposits to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help lower the price of crude, dragged oil stocks down.But oilfield services company Weatherford was a gainer, after announcing that first-quarter net income more than doubled from $80.6m to $203.3m, pleasantly surprising investors. Weatherford shares were up 4.6 per cent to $52.17.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell on Tuesday, despite announcing a 29 per cent increase in profit compared with the same quarter last year. Analysts expected slightly higher earnings per share than the $2.61 CME delivered and shares closed down 3.7 per cent to $475.25.Leather-goods company Coach, was also hit by investor antipathy after it reported a quarterly profit of $108.9m, a 35 per cent increase compared with the same period last year.Coach’s revenue forecasts for the coming quarter were slightly lower than analysts expected, pulling shares down 6.7 per cent to $32.86.
122;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Coach sales strategy is in the bag;;In the luxury goods business, brand image is everything. So can a company sell its products in chic retail stores and maintain a thriving business in outlet centres - the nirvana of discount shoppers - and not damage the brand?Coach, which designs and sells handbags and accessories, believes it can.For the past five quarters, its factory same-store sales - from outlets open more than a year - have outperformed those at its full-price stores. But instead of cheering those results, some investors fret that the success of the factory outlets could dilute its luxury identity.Coach handbags are positioned as “accessible luxury” and range from $138-$798, below the prices of European brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada, but above brands such as Nine West.For bargain hunters, the only opportunity to buy Coach at a discount is at a factory outlet as products at the full-price stores never go on sale.In fiscal 2005, Coach’s top-performing factory store was at Woodbury Common, an outlet centre about 50 miles from New York. It generated about $20m in retail sales. This year it is on track to do about $25m in sales, on par with Coach’s Madison Avenue flagship store.One recent drizzly morning, the walkways at the mall were mostly empty. But inside the brightly lit Coach Factory store, dozens of shoppers pored over the latest spring handbags and accessories.By midday, two hours after opening, nearly 200 people had walked through the doors and cashiers had rung up $7,000 in sales. The staff lamented it was a slow day.Lew Frankfort, Coach’s chief executive, says discount shopping is a popular pastime: more than 80 per cent of women’s apparel in the US is bought on sale or in the discount sectors.“Women in the US have been trained to expect to be able to find a bargain if they either go through the hunt or wait for a point late in the season or are willing to buy something after the season,” he said.Some analysts worry that the strength of factory store sales could undermine full-price items and, more importantly, compromise the carefully cultivated brand image.But Coach, which is known for its rigorous consumer research, says discount and full-price shoppers are, for the most part, two very different demographic groups.The full-price shopper is typically 35 and a single or newly married working woman, while her outlet counterpart is in her early- to mid-forties and is a professional mom with two children who prizes function over fad.“There is no question it is a very different mindset,” said Lori Wachs, portfolio manager and retail analyst at Delaware Investments. “The one wants fashion first and the other is a discount shopper.”According to Coach, dedicated factory store consumers spend 80 per cent of their “Coach dollars” in outlets and less than 20 per cent in full-price stores, and vice versa for full-price shoppers. So there is less than a 20 per cent cross-over in “Coach spend” and very little cannibalisation of full-price product.About 75 per cent of the merchandise in outlets is exclusive while the remaining 25 per cent is irregular or product that was at one time earmarked for full-price stores. The idea is that full-price and outlet stores never display the same assortment.Mr Frankfort believes the Coach brand has never been stronger. Moreover, he is assiduously overseeing the growth in factory store sales.“We are regulating the growth of factory so that our full-price business continues to lead,” he said. “We are allowing factory for now to grow at a somewhat faster rate than full price and we expect that to level off in 2007 or so.”

Google ended 3.6 per cent higher at $443.03.United Technologies was the among the biggest gainer on the Dow, up 3.6 per cent to $56.45, as the maker of Sikorsky helicopters reported solid earnings.Fast food group McDonald’s gained 0.4 per cent to $35.85 as profits were boosted by a strong US performance.Coach, the luxury goods group, rose 8.8 per cent on the S&P 500 to $34.89 after a sharp rise in earnings, while on Nasdaq, Vitesse SemiConductorjumped 23.4 per cent to $2.74 after well-received quarterly figures.However, Du Pont and Johnson & Johnson offered reminders of why the market is nervous about corporate earnings at the moment. DuPont, the chemical group that warned on profits earlier this month, delivered more bad news as it admitted earnings in the first quarter would also be lower. DuPont fell 0.7 per cent to $39.26.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group, slipped 3 per cent to $59.36 after an unexpected fall in revenues. J&J is trying to boost its revenues by buying Guidant, the medical devices maker, although its current proposal trails a higher offer of $27bn from smaller rival Boston Scientific.Still with mergers and acquisitions, Walt Disney firmed up 1.8 per cent to $25.99 on talk the entertainment group was close to a deal for animation studio Pixar, the maker of the Toy Story films. A $7.4bn takeover was confirmed after the market closed. Pixar slipped 1.2 per cent to $57.57.Elsewhere, shares in Lexmark surged 11.3 per cent to $51.08 in spite of a sharp fall in earnings as investors cheered restructuring at the print maker. LaBranche, the largest market-maker on the New York Stock Exchange, jumped 13.9 per cent to $11.93 after strong quarterly figures.However, McAfee, the maker of computer virus technology, slumped 17.7 per cent to $22.75 as earnings failed to meet market expectations.
124;TPR;Tapestry Inc;2005-08-24T20:41:30Z;Crude surge leaves Wall St bears in command;;The bears won a protracted game of tug-of-war on Wednesday with a late surge in oil prices helping to wipe out modest gains made earlier in the day.After a session in which oil prices oscillated almost as much as the main Wall Street indices, a barrel of crude finished 2.5 per cent up at $67.32. The price was spurred on by government statistics showing a sharper-than-expected fall in petrol reserves and concern that a tropical storm could disrupt supplies in the Gulf of Mexico.Oil erased earlier gains on Wall Street that had been sparked by a report showing July was an unexpectedly good month for new home sales. Sales gained 6.5 per cent to 1.41 million units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in contrast to analysts’ estimates for a drop in sales to 1.33 million units.At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8 per cent at 10,434.87 and the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent at 1,209.59. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,128.91.Peter Boockvar, a strategist at Miller Tabak, said investors feared the market had entered an “inflection point” as energy prices rise in the run-up to winter and the strong earnings season had delivered only modest “momentum” to stocks.“People have to believe the second earnings quarter will be just as good or better, but there is now rising concern about higher energy prices cutting into consumer spending,” he said.The directors of Applebee’s International certainly thought so. The restaurant chain cited high oil prices when it trimmed its 2005 earnings forecast, sending its price down 7 per cent to $22.37. Outback Steakhouse followed suit, dropping 2 per cent to $42.92, as did Brinker International, off 3 per cent to $42.49.Home builders managed to hold on to some of the gains delivered by the new home sales data. Centex gained 0.9 per cent to $66.13, Beazer Homes jumped 2.6 per cent to $60.98 and Pulte Homes was up 1.6 per cent at $84.84.Among the day’s other gainers was power station owner Calpine, which climbed 2.2 per cent to $2.18 after an analyst at Calyon Securities heaped praise on the company and raised its rating from “neutral” to “buy”.Myriad Genetics also rose, finishing 0.2 per cent up at $18.27 on the back of a Merrill Lynch upgrade. The bank predicted strong predictive medicine growth and welcomed a 7 per cent price increase due in early 2006.In another busy news day in the pharmaceuticals sector, shares in CV Therapeutics climbed 1.3 per cent to $27.28 after the company said regulators had approved Aceon, its coronary artery disease tablets.It was also a good session for Coach, which shot up 5.4 per cent before finishing up 4.1 per cent at $33.99. The largest US seller of luxury leather goods was rewarded by traders after raising its first-quarter earnings forecast to the tune of 29 per cent.Google edged 1.1 per cent higher to $282.57 after the company confirmed its first foray into the internet telephony market.
