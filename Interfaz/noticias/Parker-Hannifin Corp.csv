0;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2016-12-01T17:37:27Z;Parker Hannifin to buy filtration group Clarcor for $4.3bn;US industrial conglomerate’s purchase of filtration group is its largest deal ever;US industrial conglomerate Parker Hannifin on Thursday agreed to buy Clarcor for about $4.3bn, including net debt, in a move to grow its filtration business.Parker will pay $83 per share in cash for Tennessee-based Clarcor, which makes mobile, industrial and environmental filtration devices and brings in annual sales of about $1.4bn. That represents a premium of nearly 18 per cent to its closing share price on November 30.Clarcor shares, which were up 16.8 per cent to $82.30 on the news, had gained 42 per cent this year before the announcement. Shares of industrial companies have surged over the past month on expectations of higher infrastructure spending and potentially lower corporate taxes under president-elect Donald Trump. And appetite for domestic deals is also expected to remain healthy during his presidency.The deal is Parker’s largest on record and marks its biggest push into the filtration business since its $450m purchase of UK company Domnick Hunter in 2005. It also comes at a time when industrials struggling for growth are turning to acquisitions as the cost of financing remains cheap and as they have capital to deploy.Parker approached Clarcor, according to a person briefed on the negotiations, and is paying 17 times trailing and forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It will fund the deal with $1.5bn cash on hand and $3bn in debtThe Ohio-based company expects the purchase to add to its cash flow and earnings per share, excluding one-time transactional costs. Parker, which has a market value of $19bn, said it expects annual cost synergies of about $140m three years after closing.Moreover, Parker’s filtration sales, which currently total about $1.2bn will more than double to about $2.6bn once the deal is complete. That will bring filtration to about 20 per cent of the combined entity’s total sales.“The combination of Parker and Clarcor is highly complementary and offers a great opportunity to combine our strength in international markets and [original equipment manufacturing] with Clarcor’s strong US presence and high percentage of recurring sales in the after-market,” said Tom Williams, Parker chief executive.Rating agency Moody’s put Parker’s senior unsecured debt rating on review for a downgrade after the deal was announced. “The announcement to acquire Clarcor comes at a time when Parker’s credit profile continues to face pressure from end markets that remain mired in a prolonged downturn, and while its balance sheet remains in a somewhat weakened state due to prior year debt-funded share repurchases,” the agency said.The transaction, which has been approved by the board of each company, is subject to regulatory scrutiny and shareholder approval. It is expected to close by the end of September 2017. Parker Hannifin shares were up 2.7 per cent to $142.65 on Thursday.
1;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2016-12-01T12:53:38Z;Parker Hannifin agrees to buy Clarcor for $4.3bn;;Parker Hannifin, maker of industrial controls products, has agreed to buy Clarcor for about $4.3bn, including the assumption of net debt.Parker said on Thursday that it will pay $83 per share in cash for Tennessee-based Clarcor, which makes mobile, industrial and environmental filtration devices and brings in annual sales of about $1.4bn. That represents a premium of about 17.8 per cent to its closing share price on November 30.Upon completing the deal, Clarcor will be combined with Parker’s filtration group, a move that is expected to be accretive to its cash flow, earnings per share, excluding one-time costs.“The combination of Parker and Clarcor is highly complementary and offers a great opportunity to combine our strength in international markets and [original equipment manufacturer's] with Clarcor’s strong US presence and high percentage of recurring sales in the aftermarket,” Tom Williams, chief executive of Parker, said.Clarcor shares, which have gained 42 per cent so far this year, were up nearly 15 per cent in pre-market trading to $81.The transaction, which has been approved by the board of each company, is subject to regulatory scrutiny and is expected to close in the first quarter of Parker’s fiscal year 2018.
2;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2012-03-23T01:12:11Z;Manufacturing data weigh on US stocks;;Energy stocks suffered their steepest decline in more than three months as the S&P 500 retreated from the 1,400 threshold and fell for a third straight day on poor manufacturing data from China and Europe.The main market’s energy index was down 2 per cent, its worst drop since December 14, as oil prices dipped on Thursday.Coalminers were among the day’s worst performers as the industry continues to face pressure from the shale gas boom. A warmer winter also meant natural gas inventories rose above their five-year average.Consol Energy, which produced 62.6m tons of coal from 12 sites in the US last year, was the worst performing stock on the main market, down 4.5 per cent to $32.94. Alpha Natural Resources, another coalminer, fell 4 per cent to $16.03.A speech by US President Barack Obama in which he said the government would expedite construction on the Keystone XL pipeline did little to inspire confidence in the sector.Cabot Oil & Gas was the second worst performing stock on the main market, down 6.1 per cent to $31.52Overall, the benchmark US index sank 0.7 per cent to 1,392.78, its lowest point in more than a week.The S&P 500 materials sector had its worst day in more than two weeks, falling 1.6 per cent as commodity prices slid on concerns over global growth.US Steel, the integrated steel producer, was the worst performer among materials, falling 5.8 per cent to $29.47.Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was the next worst, shedding 3.7 per cent to $38.33. Allegheny Technologies, the speciality metals producer, fell 2.7 per cent to $41.58.“What you had was continued speculation on the depths of the Chinese slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the Chinese data,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “Both those factors immediately hit materials.”Creeping fears of a slowdown in the world’s second- largest economy also sent Wall Street’s “fear gauge” up to its highest point since March 9.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, rose by as much as 9.6 per ent before finishing the day up 2.9 per cent to 15.27.Insurance companies and regional banks were the worst performing equities among the S&P 500 financials index, which fell 1.4 per cent, relinquishing its position as the top performing sector for the year so far to information technology.The financials index is now up more than 19.9 per cent since the start of the year while the tech index is slightly ahead, having gained 20 per cent.Hartford Financial Services after pressure from John Paulson, the billionaire investor, caused the insurance company to consider the sale of its life assurance business.Shares in the company, which rose on Wednesday after it revised its forecast earnings above analysts’ expectations, were down 3.3 per cent to $21.30.Overall macro growth fears also caused investors to ignore the latest US economic data that showed the number of first-time unemployment claims falling to its lowest level in four years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6 per cent to 13,046.14.Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, was the third biggest loser on the blue chip-heavy index, falling 2.4 per cent to $106.44. The company’s shares are down more than 6.3 per cent on the week.McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, fell 1 per cent to $95.80 on news that Jim Skinner, chief executive, will retire at the end of June after more than seven years in the top job.The fast-food chain recorded its strongest year-on-year sales last year since 2006 and is looking to expand its worldwide presence by opening another 1,300 stores this year.Federal Express, the package delivery company, was down 3.5 per cent to $92.50 as it reported a lower profit forecast for the current quarter even though revenues surged in the three months to February.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent to 3,063.32.Zynga, the social media game developer, was a rare gainer, rising 0.3 per cent to $13.76. The game developer said on Wednesday that it would acquire New York-based smartphone application developer, OMGPOP, for $200m.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the index, fell by 0.5 per cent to below $600 at $599.34 after hitting yet another cyclical high on Thursday. Shares in the iPad and iPhone maker are up almost 48 per cent in the year to date.
3;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;3M: a Post-it note to the wise;The reason to own shares is that the company keeps on a very steady path;If it is thin, sticky, abrasive, reflective or absorptive, and it is used in a factory or an office, there is a reasonable chance that 3M makes it (along with assorted items that fit none of these descriptions). But highly diversified companies can deliver surprises, too, and sometimes nasty ones. On Tuesday, third-quarter results from the US industrial conglomerate were a bit light relative to estimates. More important, the company brought down its target for full-year organic sales volume growth (from 6-7.5 per cent to 3-4 per cent) and shaved a bit off earnings per share targets as well. Shareholders were less than pleased, sending the shares down more than 6 per cent.The softening outlook is made more difficult by the fact that recent reports from other broad-based industrial groups, such as Parker Hannifin and Eaton, do not share 3M’s gloom (though it is hard to make comparisons among companies that, for all their diversity, serve different end-markets). Still, the surprise and consternation implied by the price change seems a bit overdone. A look at the history shows that the company, in good years such as 2006 or 2007, grows volumes in the mid-to-high single-digit range. And if the global economy slows, growth quickly follows: volumes were off 2 per cent in 2008 and 10 per cent in 2009.The reason to keep owning 3M’s shares, however, is that management keeps the company on a very steady path financially, even as demand fluctuates from year to year. 3M spends steadily on research and development and spits out a steady stream of cash – since 2008 it has spent $10bn on dividends and buy-backs. Even during the horrible 2009, margins held and free cash flow did not fall alongside sales. This matters more than the top line. Post-it to self: 3M can be a low single-digit grower and that’s OK.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
4;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2011-08-02T21:02:39Z;US stocks tumble most in a year;;US stocks fell the most in a year on Tuesday, their seventh straight losing session in a row, as worries about the economy outweighed the resolution of the debt ceiling deal.The resolution of the debt ceiling deal, with the Senate’s “yes” vote and President Barack Obama’s signature, only served to unleash a wave of selling, driving the S&P 500 index down 2.6 per cent, its biggest single-day drop since August of last year. The broad index is now down 0.3 per csent for the year.“Stock market sellers had been held in check by the prospect of a debt ceiling relief rally,” said William Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “The largest effect is that it allows investors to focus more fully on the deterioration in the economic fundamentals.”Consumer discretionary and industrial groups were pacing declines, dropping 3.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent respectively.Traders were disappointed early on by earnings at Archer Daniels Midland, the food processing group, and by a poor report on consumer spending.The S&P 500 index ended the session at 1,254.05, well below its 200-day moving average of 1,284. Technical analysts said the next resistance level was 1,250, its March low.The Nasdaq Composite index was 2.8 per cent lower at 2,669.24 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.2 per cent to 11,866.62.ADM shares fell 6.2 per cent to $28.60 after it reported second-quarter earnings of 60 cents per share, missing analysts’ target of 84.8 cents.Shares in Emerson Electric, a manufacturing conglomerate, slipped 4.1 per cent to $47.06 after the company warned that orders would slow in the latter part of the year. “US and European economies have clearly slowed and entered a soft patch,” it said.Parker Hannifin, a manufacturer of mechanical equipment, fell 8.5 per cent to $70.88, its lowest for the year, after it warned that orders from the military and defence sector would be soft, and provided guidance for the year below what analysts were expecting.Retailers began their portion of the earnings reporting season on Tuesday with Coach, the high-end designer, seeing sharp falls after it was reported that personal spending slipped 0.2 per cent in June, below the 0.1 per cent growth expected by economists.“The data on personal income and spending suggests that the third quarter begins with no momentum from the consumer sector,” said Mr Delwiche.Coach shares were off 6.5 per cent to $61.03, down from their all-time highs of $67 reached in July.Retailers are the last major economic segment to report earnings. Many of those reporting later this week were down, including Nordstrom, down 5.8 per cent to $47.05, and Macy’s, off 5.6 per cent to $27.63. Tiffany, the jeweller, paced all declines in the S&P, falling 8.2 per cent to $73.38.The fear is that the non-farm payroll report on Friday, a key measure of consumers’ ability to spend, could be as poor as last week’s GDP figures and Monday’s industrial production survey.“If retailers report weak numbers or guidance, we could see another leg lower in the S&P index,” said David Rovelli, managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Genuity.The debt deal itself is, in part, adding to consternation as those who believe that US stimulus spending has played a crucial part in supporting markets fear that spending caps will make it nearly impossible to approve any additional government help.“We’ve been operating under the assumption for the last two years that equity investors should be bullish until the bill comes due, as democracies rarely choose deflation,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas. “But the bill has come due and we have to reduce our outlook.”Trading in consumer groups would be weaker if not for McGraw-Hill, the US publishing group that also owns Standard & Poor’s.Its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $44.43 after Jana Partners, a hedge fund, revealed that it had taken a stake, leading to speculation that the company may be broken up .Shares in Pfizer, the drugmaking giant, dropped 4.6 per cent to $18.14 despite it topping second-quarter earnings-per-share targets, coming in at 60 cents versus 58 cents. It said it was bracing for further declines in sales of established drugs such as Lipitor.Exchanges group NYSE Euronext was off by 4.9 per cent to $31.40. It reported earnings of 61 cents in the quarter versus forecasts of 59.5 cents, but warned that revenue capture could slow if trading volumes rebound.MetroPCS, the US wireless group, fell sharply by 37 per cent to $10.26 after it reported earnings well wide of the mark at 24 cents per share versus the 28 cents per share forecast.That result dragged down competitors as well with American Tower falling 3.8 per cent to $50.50.
5;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2011-08-02T19:13:43Z;Hargreaves Lansdown leads FTSE retreat;;Hargreaves Lansdown led the FTSE 100 sharply lower on fears that a industry reform might undermine its business model.Shares in the retail broker dropped 12.7 per cent to 506½p after the Financial Services Authority proposed banning undisclosed referral payments from fund managers.Hargreaves’ Vantage fund supermarket accounted for 70 per cent of group revenues last year, about half of which came via commissions paid by fund providers.A ban would force Hargreaves to unbundle its fee, which may erode the group’s competitive advantage over smaller rivals, analysts said.“Hitherto, Hargreaves’ revenues have not been transparent to the customer,” said Morgan Stanley. “Prohibition of rebates from fund managers would create more of a level playing field.”Nevertheless, Hargreaves said it did not expect the FSA’s proposal to affect sales or profitability – a view shared by analysts. “If this change was unique to Vantage, we would see significant flow risk as retail investors dealt with the culture shock of it changing from a lower fund charges [and] loyalty bonuses platform to a paid-for service.“But it is not unique, and it is hard to see what alternative route to investment investors could use instead,” said Citigroup.The wider market fell for a third straight day, leaving the FTSE 100 at a five-week low. The index ended 56.04 points, or 1 per cent, lower at 5,718.39 as engineers led the fallers board.IMI lost 4.9 per cent to 990½p after US valve maker Parker Hannifin missed earning expectations and cut earnings guidance.GKN fell 4.7 per cent to 217p, moving in tandem with European car parts makers after BMW shares dropped in late trading.Shire weakened by 3.5 per cent to £20.26 following a downgrade from JPMorgan Cazenove, based largely on valuation grounds.“Shire received a boost last month on unconfirmed reports of a takeover bid,” it told clients. “We believe such an approach is improbable and would therefore prefer to add to positions when bid speculation has faded.”Inmarsat lost 4.4 per cent to 507p after EADS bought one of its competitors, the mobile satellite distributor Vizada, from private equity.Defensive stocks outperformed, led by utilities after Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing agreed a £2.4bn takeover of Northumbrian Water.Severn Trent added 2.5 per cent to £14.51, United Utilities took on 1.1 per cent to 591p and Pennon gained 3 per cent to 735½p. Northumbrian closed 4.5 per cent higher at 469½p.National Grid gained 2 per cent to 602½p, helped by benign proposals from regulator Ofgem on transmission tariffs.Ahead of a trading update, Next was up 1.1 per cent to £23.62. RBS raised earnings forecasts and set a £26 share price target to reflect robust trading and a bigger share buyback fund.Fresnillo was squeezed 4.6 per cent higher at £18.13, leading the blue chip risers. Results from the tightly held Mexican silver miner matched forecasts.Centamin Egypt dived by 20.5 per cent to 109½p after the gold miner cut 2011 production guidance because it had struggled to get hold of explosives.The warning raised fears that Centamin’s relations with Egypt’s new government had broken down, though management dismissed such worries.“The problem appears to have been created by local low-level officials with the right to approve the provision of blasting materials,” said Citi. “It is possible that such officials were seeking personal economic enhancement from their position of authority and we think Centamin has done the right thing to call in central government to censure local officials.”Spirit, the pubs group that was spun off by Punch Taverns on Monday, slid 9.1 per cent to 50p after JPMorgan Cazenove put a 32p target price.It noted that only 55 per cent of the Spirit’s property was freehold compared with 90 per cent for Michells & Butlers. Yet the former was trading at a 48 per cent premium to the latter, it said.Punch was down 5.5 per cent to 12¼p and M&B was off 4.3 per cent to 257½p.Insurer Amlin slumped 16.3 per cent to 335p on a profit warning.Among small caps, Petroceltic fell 16.4 per cent to 7p after an update from the oil explorers prospect in Algeria disappointed.Bowleven dropped a further 20.7 per cent to 178½p as brokers downgraded in response to Monday‘s mixed drilling report from its site offshore Cameroon.
6;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2011-04-27T20:56:04Z;US markets cheer Fed decision;;Amazon led the gains on Wall Street after investors responded positively to its first-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets the Nasdaq Composite index hit a 10-year high after the Federal Reserve’s latest statement on monetary policy and the subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed.Shares in the world’s largest online retailer jumped 7.9 per cent to $169.63, an all-time high, after the company reported a 38 per cent jump in sales.This increase in revenues, however, was accompanies by a 33 per cent fall in net income for the quarter as new investments in data storage and distribution eclipsed the rise in sales.But investors had already braced themselves for a drop in earnings and some analysts appeared to be convinced by a letter from Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer, justifying the revenue focused strategy.This helped the S&P retail sector add 1.6 per cent and helped boost the Nasdaq Composite up 0.8 per cent to 2,869.88, a 10-year high.The S&P 500 was flat for much of the day, but jumped higher after the statements by Mr Bernanke and the Fed. The benchmark index closed up 0.6 at 1,355.66, a multi-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 per cent at 12,690.96.The Fed held rates steady at 0 to 0.25 per cent but tweaked its statement on growth, reducing its outlook from a “firmer footing” for the recovery to a “moderate” pace of growth. The central bank also said that it would end its $600bn “QE2” quantitative easing programme and Mr Bernanke suggested that the pace of stimulus might slow.Sentiment in the wider markets was also helped by data showing that US durable goods orders had jumped last month, with orders rising 2.5 per cent in March after a revised 0.7 per cent rise in February.In the previous session, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since June 2008, indicating that the markets have now recovered from sharp losses following the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa and the natural disaster in Japan.Much of the recent gains in the S&P have been driven by a strong start to the earnings season. Of the 197 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 77 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said that momentum in the markets would continue to tick higher from here over the year, but there was likely to be more volatility.Boeing’s profits in the first quarter exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock advanced 0.8 per cent to $76.12. The world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by revenue made a net profit of $586m, or 78 cents per share, up from $519m, or 70 cents per share, in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about 72 cents per share.Northrop Grummanreported a 21 per cent rise in earnings, beating estimates, while also raising its full-year guidance. Stock in the defence and aerospace group put on 0.7 per cent to $62.90.Rockwell Automation, the maker of factory automation equipment and software, saw one of the sharpest losses of the session, falling 8.7 per cent to $89.33 after reporting only a modest profit and a small increase to its 2011 earnings forecast.Elsewhere in the sector Parker Hannifin, another industrial supplier, also disappointed with its earnings and the stock declined 5.1 per cent to $93.48.Disappointing earnings reports from ConocoPhillips and National Oilwell Varco weighed on the energy sector.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a 43 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, but missed its production and refining targets, leaving the stock down 1.7 per cent at $79.83.The decline in production was due to civil unrest in Libya, a supply vessel collision with a company platform, natural field decline and the temporary shutdown of the trans-Alaska pipeline system.Elsewhere in the sector, National Oilwell fell 4.6 per cent to $76.88 after the US oilfield equipment maker reported a 4 per cent drop in quarterly profit amid restructuring charges and Libya-related writedowns.

——————————————————————————————————–In an effort to streamline its exposure to the aerospace and defense sector, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) is selling its Pacific Scientific subsidiary, three sources familiar with the situation told mergermarket.According to one of the sources, the Washington, DC-based conglomerate hired Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor for the divestiture.Danaher did not return calls for comment while Goldman Sachs declined comment on market rumors or speculation.A teaser on Pacific Scientific has been out for approximately two weeks, the second source claimed, adding that a preliminary proposal on the business is due within the next week.A limited number of parties, believed to be entirely strategic, were contacted in relation to the divestiture, said the first source. The two additional sources said financial sponsors would be interested in the Danaher division, speculating that private equity suitors may be contacted if the process widens.The second source said Pacific Scientific has EBITDA of approximately USD 130m, adding that the business could command a multiple in the ballpark of 8x EBITDA. This source characterized Pacific Scientific as a “hodge podge” of different businesses including aerospace and defense assets as well as fire safety equipment.Potential buyers for Pacific Scientific could include actuation companies such as Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Eaton (NYSE:ETN), Moog (NYSE:MOG.A), Curtiss-Wright (NYSE:CW) and Woodward Governor (NASDAQ:WGOV), said the third source.——————————————————————————————————–For more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@mergermarket.com or call EMEA: + 44 (0)20 7059 6105 Americas: +1 212 686-5277 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9730"

9;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2009-10-11T09:03:18Z;Norwegian fund steps up campaign;;"This month, the world’s second biggest pension fund launched a campaign to drive widespread corporate governance reform in the US.Norges Bank Investment Management submitted four resolutions to four US companies calling on them to appoint new independent chairmen.The fund, which manages the $400bn (£250bn, €270bn) in assets in the Norwegian state pension fund and has invested $66bn in the US, is calling for a shareholder vote on separating the role of chairman from chief executive at Harris Corporation, Parker Hannifin, Cardinal Health Inc and Clorox.It has also voted against all chairmen who are also chief executives of about 700 US companies. This is just the beginning of the campaign, it says.Noteworthy, too, is that NBIM withdrew a fifth resolution to force Sara Lee, the food group, to appoint a separate independent chairman after Sara Lee’s board agreed it would split the roles of chief executive and chairman.Sara Lee promised that when the current chief executive’s tenure ends (at an unspecified time in the future), it would amend the company bylaws to ensure that it appointed a separate and independent chairman to steer the board.Anne Kvam, NBIM’s global head of corporate governance, says this followed “very constructive dialogue” and declared herself “very happy with the outcome”.Sara Lee points out there is a gradual shift taking place with more companies separating out the roles. A spokesman highlighted Senator Charles Schumer’s legislative proposal in a “Shareholder Bill of Rights” which would, among other reforms, require separation of the chairman and chief executive roles.Ms Kvam says many corporate governance reforms in the US, for example giving shareholders a say on pay or rights to nominate directors, require legislative change.Under Mary Schapiro, the chairman of the Securities and Exchanges Commission, there have been a series of reforms boosting shareholders’ powers to influence the composition of boards.But submitting proposals on independent chairs for a vote is the one reform that shareholders can achieve without the help of regulators or legislators, she says.The question is how much traction NBIM will get with other US companies. Some corporate governance analysts say change may be on the way, but it will not be fast.However, Ms Kvam says while this is the first time NBIM has entered the debate publicly, other groups have lobbied US companies to split the roles and shareholder support for these proposals has been rising steadily.She argues the time is ripe to step up the campaign in the wake of the financial crisis, which has put accountability and leadership of boards under the microscope.The pivotal moment came last April when shareholders in Bank of America voted to strip chief executive Ken Lewis of his title of chairman in protest at Mr Lewis’ decision to buy Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis. That changed the landscape on the independence of directors, she says.Nell Minow, from the Corporate Library, is reasonably optimistic, too. She says: “If [change] is proposed by a major shareholder with the expectation that the chairman will be a genuine outsider, yes, I do think it will get a lot of support.” And it could be the beginning of broader move to separate the roles and improve the oversight of boards, she says. “NBIM can leverage a lot of shareholder frustration and a widespread sense that this is a sensible, meaningful, but not disruptive
initiative”.Recent academic research suggests that – despite the criticisms that US shareholders lack the same rights they have in other jurisdictions – the implicit threat of legal action by investors often means companies move swiftly to reform when shareholders submit proposals.Bonnie Buchanan from Seattle University and other academics say in an empirical study of US and UK shareholder proposals: “After receiving a shareholder proposal, US firms are more likely to replace CEOs and separate the CEO and chairman positions.”The study also says although shareholders in the UK have greater powers to effect change, “US [shareholder] proposals have more positive effect on firm performance than UK ones”.NBIM’s work will not be easy. It estimates that just over half the top 1,500 companies in the US combine the role of chief executive and chairman. But Ms Kvam says having an independent chairman is
“essential”.Like many international shareholder groups, it argues that all companies should ensure there is a clear division between the responsibilities of chairman and the chief executive.The chairman’s job is to set strategy and remuneration policy and hire executives, keeping shareholder interests centre stage.The job of the chief executive is to execute strategy and run the company. When companies combine the role they risk
concentrating too much power in one individual, say corporate governance experts.“The roles of chairman of the board and CEO are fundamentally different and should not be held by the same person,” said Ms Kvam."
11;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2009-10-09T08:59:37Z;Sara Lee to separate executive roles;;Sara Lee, the US food and household goods group, has bowed to pressure from one of the world’s largest pension funds and agreed to separate the role of chairman and chief executive.After talks with Norges Bank Investment Management, Sara Lee’s board said it would recruit an independent chairman when Brenda Barnes’ tenure as head of the group ends.A Sara Lee spokesman said the group had responded to NBIM’s request in the light of a slow but growing trend in the US towards splitting the role of chairman and chief executive.NBIM, which manages $300bn of Norway’s central bank assets, making it the world’s second largest retirement scheme, this week launched a campaign to persuade a series of US companies to separate the chairman from the chief executive role.NBIM is calling on Harris Corporation, Parker Hannifin, Cardinal Health Inc and Clorox to split the roles of chief executive and chairman. It has also voted against all chairmen that are also CEOs of about 700 US companies.It, like many corporate governance activists, argues that the two roles are different and should not be held by the same person. All companies should ensure there is a clear division between the responsibilities to ensure a balance of power, it says.NBIM estimates that about half of the top 1,500 companies in the US combine the role of CEO and chairman.NBIM started its campaign by submitting proposals to four US companies calling for a shareholder vote on the appointment of an independent director to chair the boards.It withdrew a similar resolution calling for a shareholder vote at Sara Lee’s annual meeting on October 29 after the food group agreed that it would recruit an independent chairman.Anne Kvam, NBIM’s global head of corporate governance, says this followed “very constructive dialogue with the board of Sara Lee and [we] are very happy with the outcome”.No leaving date has been set for Ms Barnes, who has been chairman-chief executive of Sara Lee since 2005 and is taking the group, which is best known for its frozen gateaux, cheese cake and coffee, through a five-year period of restructuring to focus on its core food and beverages business and cut costs.Last month it agreed to sell its personal care business, which includes Radox bubblebath and Brylcreem, to Unilever for €1.27bn ($1.9bn) in cash. The US group is looking at further sales of its household goods business in the next few months.The decision to sell its household business, which contributed some 17 per cent of Sara Lee’s total revenues of about $13bn, comes as the group moves ahead with its “transformation” plan initiated in 2005.
12;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2009-10-07T22:55:10Z;Norges seeks reforms in US governance;;The world’s second-biggest pension fund has started a campaign to drive corporate governance reforms in the US by submitting resolutions to four US companies to appoint new independent chairmen.Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the $400bn in assets in the Norwegian state pension fund, is calling for a shareholder vote on separating the role of chairman from chief executive at Harris Corporation, Parker Hannifin, Cardinal Health and Clorox.“The roles of chairman of the board and CEO are fundamentally different and should not be held by the same person,” said Anne Kvam, NBIM’s global head of corporate governance. “There should be a clear division of the responsibilities between these positions to ensure a balance of power and authority on the board. This is a fundamental principle of good corporate governance that we seek globally.”The proposals mark the start of a drive by Norway’s central bank fund to shake up corporate governance in the US, in which it has $66bn invested and where companies frequently combine the two roles.Ms Kvam said NBIM wanted to “step up the heat” on US companies to split the chairman and CEO roles and would submit more proposals next year.She added that it was a good time to raise the temperature of the debate following the financial crisis, which has put accountability and leadership of boards into the spotlight. “Resolutions like ours have been getting more support,” she said.The landscape changed in the US last April when Bank of America shareholders voted to strip chief executive Ken Lewis of his title of chairman in protest at his decision to buy Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis.Boards should be led by an independent chairman who can set strategy and remuneration policy, and hire executives, NBIM said. An independent chairman is “better able to oversee and give guidance” to executives, so defusing conflict and protecting the interests of shareholders.NBIM said: “In our current challenging markets, we believe an independent chairman is essential.”Ms Kvam estimated that more than half of the top 1,500 companies in the US combine the role of CEO and chairman.This is in stark contrast to much of Europe and the UK, where the combined role is much rarer.
13;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2008-10-01T20:40:32Z;Economic data add to Wall Street gloom;;Another volatile session for US stocks ended in the red as anxiety over paralysis in money markets and a Senate vote on the revised $700bn banking sector rescue package dwarfed even General Electric’s dramatic $15bn capital raising.GE led the declines on the Dow Jones Industrial Average early in the session as its credit default swaps widened. Yet the conglomerate later pared those losses to stand 5.2 per cent lower at $24.18 after it emerged that Warren Buffett would make a $3bn investment.Glum macroeconomic data underlined the parlous state of the US economy, although traders said that the prospect of a vast government intervention to stave off financial collapse took precedence over all other developments.“All these things normally the market would care about,” said Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at Voyageur Asset Management. Now, he added, “we care [only] as much as it takes to read a headline”. The S&P 500 fell as much as 2.2 per cent but later clawed back to close 0.5 per cent lower at 1,161.06, ahead of the Senate vote. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent at 10,831.07 while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.1 per cent at 2,069.40.Still, the moves were tame by recent eye-popping comparison. Stocks’ biggest rally for six years in the previous session followed their biggest sell-off for more than twenty.Industrials, down 2.6 per cent, led the market declines after a gauge of manufacturing activity – the economy’s silver lining this year – contracted further in September, falling to its lowest level since October 2001. The level is historically associated with a recession in the broader economy.Caterpillar and Honeywell lost 4.5 per cent at $56.95 and $39.68 respectively.A slew of other economic data – from job losses to mortgage applications – also hurt sentiment.Meanwhile, an oil price decline afforded the automotive sector scant comfort. Nor did news that President Bush had approved a $25bn package to help the sector. Ford sank 12.5 per cent to $4.55 after warning that US sales fell 34.6 per cent in September, to its weakest level of the year. It also said second-half profit at its European unit would be hit by falling demand and rising raw material costs.General Motors fell as much as 4.76 per cent but later recovered to stand 0.2 per cent higher at $9.47. Light vehicle sales fell 16 per cent in September.Financials and consumer staples, were the only sectors to enjoy rises of more than 1 per cent. Telecoms and utilities also inched into positive territory.Regional banks continued their recovery from Monday’s brutal sell-off. National City and Fifth Third leapt 65.1 per cent at $2.89 and 16.1 per cent at $13.82 respectively, the former helped by takeover speculation.Citigroup rose 12.1 per cent to $23.Energy stocks, which rallied in the previous session, lost 1.7 per cent as oil prices fell. Peabody Energy led the declines, down 8.8 per cent at $41.05.Airlines soared as crude-oil prices fell below $100. Delta Airlines, for example, added 14.8 per cent at $8.55.Among technology stocks, down 2.2 per cent, IBM was particularly hard hit. It fell 5.8 per cent at $110.13 on fears that the Dow component may have missed its third quarter profit targets.Elsewhere, Boston Scientific and Medtronic fell 7.6 per cent to $11.34 and inched down 0.2 per cent to $49.83 respectively after a court ruled that the pair had to pay $629m in interest to Johnson & Johnson down 2.2 per cent at $67.79. That took its total award in an 11-year patent case to $1.2bn.Ingersoll-Rand and Parker Hannifin fell 5.5 per cent to $29.46 and 3.6 per cent to $51.09 after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the two groups from “buy” to hold”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the fear gauge, inched up 0.5 per cent to 39.59, indicating extremely high levels of distress.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, rose 1.5 per cent. Earlier in the session, it fell back below the level set when the ban was introduced last month but later recovered.Wal-Martlost 0.4 per cent at $59.66 after the retailer said it would cut prices on popular toys ahead of Christmas.
14;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2008-05-19T22:11:03Z;Interest in UK is far from running out of steam;;It is more than 230 years since the British-developed steam engine kicked off the global industrial revolution – and companies such as Spirax-Sarco are still world leaders with steam control systems used across many industries.But the Cheltenham-based specialist is among a dwindling band of UK-quoted engineers – many of which have fallen prey to US takeover in the past decade.Enodis looks set to be the latest to end up in US hands, though the protracted battle for the catering equipment maker took a further twist on Monday as Manitowoc, based in Wisconsin, returned to the table to trump a previously agreed offer from Illinois Tool Works with an offer valuing the company at £1.08bn.Expro International, the oil services company, is the subject of an approach from Halliburton of the US, which could lead to an offer that gazumps an agreed £1.8bn bid including £200m of debt from a Candover-led buy-out consortium.Such deals follow a developing tradition of US groups swooping on UK rivals. In 2004, UTC bought fire protection specialist Kidde for £1.4bn and Danahar beat off US peer Illinois Tool Works to buy printing equipment maker Linx for £85.7m. A year later, filtration specialist Domnick Hunter was bought by Parker Hannifin for £250m after US rival Eaton Corporation withdrew from the ring. In 2006, crash-test dummy and sensor maker First Technology was bought by Honeywell for £290m following a tussle with Danaher.Deals have typically been at substantial premiums – a pattern that has continued, with the competing offers for Enodis pitched at more than double the level of its 52-week low of 124¼p.David Larkam, longstanding analyst of the engineering sector at Arden Partners, blames scant analyst coverage of the dwindling UK market. This, he argues, perpetuates the relatively low valuations of UK engineering companies, some of whose p/e ratios struggle to get into the double figures – making them ripe for opportunistic takeovers.Ulf Henriksson, chief executive of Invensys, one of the UK’s biggest engineering groups, says US takeovers can make sense – especially from a management point of view. While some European and UK engineering companies tend to act more as “holding companies”, US rivals can be more operationally focused, seeking synergies and quick integration of acquired companies, he says.“A major difference is on getting things done and not waiting for tomorrow – making sure things are happening – directness, with not necessarily politeness or niceness.”In return, an acquired UK company, like other European targets, can offer a springboard to global expansion for a US group.“A US company has the scale – but not necessarily expertise – on how to act globally,” Mr Henriksson says. “European companies can relate better to emerging markets – Europeans have a better start here.”So expansive have some of the Britain’s remaining independently owned engineers become that it is hard to describe the likes of Invensys, Charter, Spirax-Sarco and Weir Group as truly British, observers say.“[Many British engineering] companies are international now,” Arden’s Mr Larkam says. “The percentage of business they have in the UK is pretty small.”So does it matter, then, if the numbers of quoted UK engineers are in decline?Although the CBI has no detailed data on what proportion of UK manufacturers is domestically or foreign-owned, the UK has emerged as being relatively successful at attracting foreign investment compared with other European countries, says David Wilkinson, senior policy adviser on manufacturing at the CBI.A fall in the numbers of London-listed companies does not reflect a decline in the strength of British manufacturing and engineering, Mr Wilkinson says.“Britain has achieved manufacturing value-added growth of 31 per cent since 1990,” he says. “People talk about a decline in manufacturing, whereas manufacturing has only declined in its share in national income because of service sector growth. UK manufacturing is not in distress – it’s a growth sector.”
15;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2008-01-15T08:33:10Z;Whatman shares surge on bid interest;;Four US bidders, including General Electric, and Danaher, are vying to win control of Whatman, the laboratory equipment company, which provides DNA technology to the police.Whatman, which has appointed Goldman Sachs to run the sale process, held the second round of the auction last week. A preferred suitor could be chosen by the end of the month.Parker Hannifin, the US group which owns a life sciences unit, and Millipore, the multinational bioscience company that provides technologies and services for the discovery, development and production of therapeutic drugs, are also bidding for the UK company.The auction, which could see Whatman valued at more than £300m, comes three months after Kieran Murphy, its chief executive, announced a restructuring of the business, following the completion of a strategic review.At the same time, the three largest shareholders of Whatman – JO Hambro, Schroders and Hermes – asked the board to consider any offers for the company.Whatman confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it had received a number of approaches about an offer for the entire share capital of the company but declined to say who the talks were with. The shares had the biggest one-day rise in 8 years when they opened at 269p, up 59p or 28.6 per cent on Tuesday.Whatman on Monday forecast that its full-year revenues would match 2006’s total of £116m, at constant exchange rates. In a trading statement the company said its order book at the end of December was £16m, an increase of 44 per cent compared with 2006.Whatman also said that it had met the conditions of its share buyback, which is due to begin in March, and that the restructuring announced in September by Mr Murphy was on target to meet its operational milestones.As part of Mr Murphy’s restructuring, the company said it would buy back shares, restructure its manufacturing base and shift part of its operations to China. Other initiatives included closing at least one of its facilities, and increasing R&D investment in its core business from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in particular membrane technologies.Bob Thian, who has been chairman of Whatman since 2002, announced that he would resign from the board this May. His son-in-law, Richard Campbell-Breeden, is a banker at Goldman Sachs but has stepped aside from the process.
16;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2006-01-20T20:44:49Z;Lombard: Why UK minnows appeal to US giants;;The playbook – as the Americans would call it – for US bids for UK industrial companies is pretty well-thumbed by now, and Danaher, which on Friday trumped Honeywell’s bid for First Technology, has written a couple of its chapters.First principle of interest to investors: keep a close eye on undervalued European companies sitting on valuable technology.Honeywell, Danaher and others seem to be making a habit of bolting on companies active in complementary areas. Second principle: do not assume that the opening offer – or even the counter-bid – will be the last word.Danaher, a Washington DC-based manufacturer of industrial tools, instruments and components, has been here before. In 2004, it exercised second-mover advantage over a compatriot by stepping in with a successful counter-bid for Linx Printing Technologies, a UK manufacturer of high-speed printing equipment that had previously accepted an offer from Illinois Tool Works. Danaher’s bid was pitched at a 17 per cent premium to ITW’s.Its offer for First Technology, which makes gas sensors and crash-test dummies, is 20 per cent higher than Honeywell’s.First Technology, like Linx, had a summer marred by a profit warning and then a winter of bid talks. Its fragile financial state is one reason why this bid is unlikely to follow the pattern of last year’s takeover battle for Domnick Hunter, the UK filtration technology company.Shareholders there found themselves in the middle of a contest between Parker Hannifin and its American rival Eaton, which only finished after six price increases had added a further 16 per cent to the original offer and left Parker with the prize. But Domnick Hunter was in better shape than First Technology.While shareholders would be wise to sit tight for a possible Honeywell counter-offer, they should not expect this fight to last many rounds.Managers that disappoint their shareholders are inviting trouble. Managers that disappoint repeatedly are inviting execution.The saga at SkyePharma, the pharmaceuticals company, is turning into a case study in how not to handle a company in the admittedly choppy waters of drug development.Analysts think Flutiform, Skye- Pharma’s asthma treatment, has promise. But by failing last year to get a licensing deal for the drug and then launching a deeply discounted rights issue to self-fund the product through the next stage of trials, management sacrificed the confidence of a group of large shareholders. Their disgruntlement was whipped into dissent by the disappearance both of a formal offer and then the much-touted alternatives last week and, finally, by the management’s attempt to appoint two new executives, allegedly without consultation. Now, dubbing themselves the Requisitionists, the dissident shareholders have launched a plan to oust Ian Gowrie-Smith, chairman.Activism sometimes has a bad name. But this attempt is more than mere self-interested interference.The shareholders say they have lined up Bob Thian, an experienced pharmaceuticals executive, to replace Mr Gowrie-Smith. He would presumably move quickly to appoint a new chief executive. SkyePharma has the products. Now what it needs is an injection of experience and a transfusion of new blood.Business often depicts itself as sinking in a swamp of regulation, assailed by acronyms. Last year’s pan-European Thomson/Extel survey of investment professionals indicated marked concern – particularly on the part of UK quoted companies – about the difficulties of communicating the effect of the switch to International Financial Reporting Standards and the degree of change that the new regime was likely to inflict.But once IFRS are bedded down at British companies, the new standards – combined with European regulation to improve transparency and voluntary adoption of an operating and financial review – should provide opportunities for companies to explain themselves better.Investment relations directors who gathered at a conference organised by Real IR magazine this week said they had spent much of the past year simply educating shareholders about the changes imposed by IFRS.But in due course, the improved comparability of accounts should mean that investors and analysts come to meetings better-informed about the nuts and bolts of company performance.Rather than laboriously having to unpick historical numbers, companies should be able to spend more time explaining what they are doing and why. Of course, shareholders are unlikely to let any IR director get away with peddling flim-flam in place of hard data – but it is at least heartening to hear business talking in positive terms about what may lie on the other side of the regulatory swamp.
17;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2005-11-01T17:50:53Z;New issues: Parker Hannifin set for €400m bond;;Parker Hannifin, the US maker of industrial controls products, is on Wednesday ending the investors roadshow for its dual-tranche €400m bond issue.The company is expected to sell bonds with maturities of five and 10 years and the sizes are expected to be roughly €200m for each tranche. The investor meetings end in Paris today and price guidance could follow tomorrow.Proceeds from the sale will be used to redeem the company’s only outstanding bond in Europe, a €300m issue that matures on November 21. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are lead-managing the sale.A public holiday in many European countries on Tuesday meant activity in the secondary was fairly subdued but the market edged tighter.Long-dated telecoms bonds recovered after losing ground on Monday, when Telefónica of Spain launched a £17.7bn agreed takeover bid for O2, the UK mobile phone operator. Bonds of The two companies were little changed after weakening on Monday.Telefónica will issue several billions of euros of bonds to refinance the acquisition, in different currencies and structures in order to attract demand from a variety of investor pools.Expectations for supply of long-dated telecoms bonds hit existing issues on Monday, but on Tuesday, while the yield spread on Telecom Italia’s 2019 issue tightened 1 basis point to 133bp and the France Telecom 2033 note came in 1bp, to 108bp.Telefónica could also sell a hybrid bond, which will cost the company more in interest payments but is attractive because a large chunk of the debt will be treated as equity by the rating agencies.In the credit derivatives market, the Itraxx HiVol index of the most actively traded names tightened 0.5bp to 78.5bp while the Xover index, which covers the high-yield market, widened 1bp to 302bp.
18;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Oct 6: Oil leaves bitter taste for Cadbury;;For some time, investors have been wondering when higher oil prices would begin to hurt corporate profits. Well, we have a prime example today after Cadbury Schweppes issued a warning that it would not meet its goal for margins this year. The world’s biggest confectionery company blamed the price of oil and disruption from Hurricane Katrina, which boosted transport costs and the price of PET resin - the basic material for plastic drinking bottles. We will dissect the warning in tomorrow’s paper while Lex is also preparing its view.Hurricane Katrina was the main subject of conversation for Lloyd’s of London, which reported its interim results this morning. In the six months to the end of June, the global insurer increased its profits by 20.6 per cent, but all the attention was on its outlook for the second half of the year. Nick Prettejohn, chief executive, sounded a defiant note by predicting Lloyds will make a profit this year, but Lex reckons Mr Prettejohn has made a brave prediction. The full results announcement can be found here.There have been several new twists to running bid stories. Speculation about a takeover of the London Stock Exchange has taken another turn after it emerged that Macquarie, the Australian investment bank that is considering making an offer for the LSE, has been holding talks about joining forces with Computershare, the financial services and technology provider. However, it is far from clear that the two will even be able to agree on forming a consortium, let alone put together a bid the LSE and its shareholders will want to accept.Meanwhile, the extraordinary tit-for-tat battle for Domnick Hunter, the engineering group, may finally be over after Eaton Corp withdrew its £247.5m bid, clearing the way for Parker Hannifin, its US rival, which has offered 700p, or £251m, to finally claim its prize.National Express confirmed our story, which appeared in this morning’s paper, that it is in talks to buy Alsa, Spain’s largest bus and coach operator. We will be following up with a report on the market’s reaction to the proposed deal, and Martin Dickson is sharpening his pen to opine on the proposed deal for his Lombard column.Finally, there was some slightly better news in the retail sector today as Halfords, the retailer of car and bicycle parts, managed like-for-like sales growth of 2.6 per cent in the six months to September, while Ted Baker, the clothing retailer, pointed to demand in the United States and Asia as it reported double-digit growth in sales and profits.That’s it from me.

19;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2005-09-21T19:40:40Z;Lombard: Investment banker’s dream;;"It rarely occurs but, when it does, it is an investment banker’s dream: two big companies with deep pockets slug it out in public for your client and all you have to do is wait to see which side produces the latest higher cash offer for you to recommend.There are no indicative bids that may melt away; no need to encourage a single possible purchaser to bid against itself; and no risks from an extended period of due diligence.This is the fortunate position of Domnick Hunter and its advisers. Yesterday, Parker Hannifin, a US conglomerate that opened the bidding for the UK filtration group in early August with an agreed cash offer of 605p a share, returned with a 700p-a- share bid to seize the initiative from Eaton, which had bid 690p the previous day.The UK engineering sector is just not used to this. At yesterday’s closing price of 720p, equal to its highest level, Domnick Hunter was trading on a multiple of enterprise value to this year’s underlying forecast earnings of about 14.5 times.While the full range of conditions that make this bidding war quite so competitive would be hard to replicate, there are underlying factors that should encourage UK companies more generally.The first is the continuing re-emergence of the corporate bidder. In contrast to private equity buyers, for whom the acquisition by another house of a particular company may make little competitive difference, once a trade buyer has identified a strategic asset, not only does it want to acquire it, it wants to deny a rival that opportunity.The second is the confidence that underpins this auction. For both of the Ohio-based groups, buying Domnick Hunter would represent a strategic move to expand their business in continental Europe and the UK rather than an acquisition in their domestic market that would be dependent on cost savings for its rationale.Domnick Hunter’s advisers – and investors – are unlikely to be the last ones rubbing their hands in glee.ITV’s shares jumped on Wednesday morning before its announcement came out, because a rumour went round trading rooms that Charles Allen might be resigning and that this would leave the company more vulnerable to a takeover. The speculation was off-beam but is a reminder that the man who saw off Michael Green in the merger of Granada and Carlton is a great survivor.Henry Staunton, ITV’s outgoing finance director, and Mick Desmond, head of its broadcasting division, are not leaving because they threatened Allen’s power but the vacancies created by their departures and the new structure unveiled yesterday give him the chance to bring new talent into ITV.Much has been achieved since the merger. Cost savings worth £120m have come through and rivals look with admiration at its recent handling of its regulator.Now, though, it is vital that Allen pays attention to programming.Media luvvies are not the only ones tut-tutting about programmes such as Celebrity Wrestling. The core ITV1 channel’s audience has fallen to new lows, which means its old mass-market appeal to advertisers is under threat.After months in denial about ITV1, the group seems to be grasping the importance of growth in the core channel and the family of digital channels around it.A sharper understanding of advertisers’ changing demands and a more innovative approach to meeting them are essential. ITV’s old business model is never coming back.Allen is used to industry gossip and thrives on it. Had he taken the money of all the people betting against him over the years, he would be an even richer man.Less than a year after market conditions for Business Post’s core parcels delivery service were merely “competitive”, they have moved beyond “challenging” to “deteriorating”. The group weathered the first two well enough but yesterday said profit this year would be 10 per cent below last year’s level.In these conditions, it has lost its way and the response has been harsh. The share price lost more than one-quarter of its value to close at its lowest level for more than a year and analysts cut full-year forecasts to about £18.5m.This severity is justified. At the heart of the problem is the downturn in the high street that has meant lower volumes and cheaper delivery choices among the group’s Express business customers, about which it can do very little.An unwanted consequence of these reduced volumes is that Business Post must now share more of its margin with its franchisees to encourage them by ensuring that they still make money even though times are harder.It will not be straightforward to claw this back when conditions do get easier.The timing is particularly sad. Not long ago, the group was adding costs on the back of higher volumes. It will be no surprise that it is easier to put them in than to take them out."
20;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2005-09-21T14:01:16Z;Parker Hannifin raises bid for Domnick Hunter again;;The race to gain control of Domnick Hunter stepped up yet another gear as Parker Hannifin raised its bid for the UK filtration, separation and purification company, beating Eaton’s agreed offer.Parker Hannifin, the US engineering group, increased its bid for Domnick Hunter from 680p per share to 700p, valuing the company at about £251m ($453m).The new offer beats its Ohio-based rival, Eaton’s 690p per share bid, which was agreed on Tuesday by Domnick Hunter.Parker has now increased its bid three times to beat Eaton, which in turn has raised its offer twice.In early August, Parker bid 605p a share for Domnick Hunter but raised its offer to 650p following rumours that an unidentified third party had entered into discussions with the UK company.Two days later on August 26, Eaton emerged as the rival bidder for Domnick Hunter with a 675p per share cash offer. Consequently, Parker increased its bid to 680p a share on September 16, but was again trumped by a 690p a share offer from Eaton on September 20.Wednesday’s offer price represents a premium of about 49.3 per cent to Domnick Hunter’s record share price and a 62.5 per cent premium to its closing price on July 25, the last dealing day before it entered take-over talks.One analyst said: “Parker Hannifin’s immediate response to Eaton’s offer suggests it has a greater appetite for the company. Parker has the management on its side and the funds available to see this through.”But analysts are not ruling out a comeback offer from Eaton. Both Parker and Eaton have had offers recommended by Domnick Hunter’s board and while the US rivals may have different interests in the County Durham-based company, it could fit into either portfolio.“If the bidding does continue, it would edge up by small increases, until one company overstretches itself,” he added.Eaton said it was considering its position following Parker’s renewed bid and said a further announcement would be made in “due course”.Shares in Domnick Hunter edged up 1per cent to 715p in early morning trading.

23;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Domnick Hunter agrees raised offer from Hannifin;;The battle for Domnick Hunter stepped up a gear on Friday after the UK filtration, separation and purification company said it had agreed an improved cash offer from Parker Hannifin that beats US rival Eaton’s bid.Parker Hannifin said it had increased its offer for the UK specialist engineering group to 680p-per-share, valuing the company at £243.9m ($442m).Parker, which first bid 605p-per-share at the beginning of August, raised its initial offer to 650p on August 24. But the group saw its second bid trumped by Eaton, a diversified industrial manufacturer, which offered 675p two days later.Last week Parker Hannifin announced it would set a new deadline of September 22 for Domnick Hunter shareholders to return forms of acceptance after receiving acceptance from about 15 per.The new 680p offer price represents a premium of about 57.8 per cent to Domnick Hunter’s closing price on July 25, the last dealing day before it was revealed it was in talks with Eaton.Eaton said on Friday that it was considering its position and would make an announcement “in due course”.Domnick Hunter shares were down 14¾p, or 2 per cent, at 700p in mid morning trade. Shares in the company have climbed 84.9 per cent over the last 12 months.There has been an increased interest in UK specialist engineering companies from the US, where analysts say organic growth is beginning to stabilise.
24;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2005-09-09T09:07:17Z;Parker Hannifin extends offer acceptance period;;Parker Hannifin, Cleveland-based conglomerate, on Friday extended the time available in a forlorn attempt to persuade Domnick Hunter shareholders to accept its latest offer for the UK-based filtration, separation and purification company.The US company, which is facing defeat in its efforts to buy Domnick Hunter, said on Friday it had received acceptance from only around 15 per cent of the target’s shareholders and set a new deadline of September 22 Dominic Hunter shareholders to return forms of acceptance.Parker Hannifin last month raised its initial offer to 650p per share for Domnick Hunter, but the group saw this offer trumped by Eaton, a diversified industrial manufacturer, who made an approach that valued the UK-based company at 675p a share.There has been an increased interest in UK specialist engineering companies, especially from the US, where analysts say organic growth is beginning to stabilise.United Technology, the US company, acquired Kidde, the UK-based fire protection company, for £1.4bn last month and Cuno, a competitor of Domnick Hunter, was bought by 3M, the US group whose products include Post-it notes and Scotch tape, for $1.3bn.
25;PH;Parker-Hannifin Corp;2005-08-26T14:14:14Z;Eaton tops bid for Domnick Hunter with £242m offer;;In a sign of the growing attractiveness of UK specialist engineering groups, Eaton Corp on entered the race for Domnick Hunter, the UK filtration, separation and purification company, with a £242m (€437m) cash bid that pits it against fellow Cleveland-based conglomerate Parker Hannifin.Eaton, a diversified industrial manufacturer, is offering 675p in cash for each Domnick Hunter share. The offer represents a 56.7 per cent premium to the group’s closing price on July 25, when it emerged that an unknown group was in talks regarding a potential bid.Parker Hannifin in early August made a recommended offer for Domnick Hunter of £215.7m, or 605p a share. However, the initial bid was scuppered when an unidentified third party also made an approach, prompting Parker Hannifin to raise its offer to 650p per share.There has been an increased interest in UK niche companies in this sector especially from the US where analysts say organic growth is beginning to stabilise.“US companies have been affected by the weak dollar and are now looking at improving margins by acquiring companies with niche positions and technologies as well as established distribution networks and good balance sheets,” said Gary Murphy, a William de Broe analyst.Eaton’s bid follows United Technologies Corporation, the US-based group’s acquisition of Kidde, the fire protection company, this month for £1.4bn.Mr Murphy said “Parker Hannifin’s offer may drive other speculative bids in the sector.”Alexander Cutler, Eaton’s chief executive, said any deal would provide his company with “an excellent opportunity to build on our recent initiatives in the filtration sector. Domnick Hunter is a strong business and will add valuable scale and market leadership to our competitive position.”Mr Murphy said Eaton would look to add Domnick Hunter to its portfolio after recently purchasing Heywood group, with similar operations. But this move may mean some restructuring to avoid overlap between the two similar companies. Parker Hannifin, with no companies in this sector may find it easier to integrate Domnick Hunter into its business.Domnick Hunter earlier this month reported a fall in interim pre-tax profit, partly on the back of underperformance in its drug and food filtration unit. Pre-tax profit fell from £6.7m to £6.3m on higher turnover of £84.7mDomnick Hunter’s shares rose nearly 4 per cent to 700p, as analysts suggested that Parker Hannifin was likely to come back with an increased offer.
