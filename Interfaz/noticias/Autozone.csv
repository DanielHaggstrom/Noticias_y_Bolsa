Few would be likely to suggest that today’s stock market was a ripe hunting ground for these sorts of once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities.Kevin Martelli, a value investor based in Switzerland, has conducted a study of “multi-bagger” stocks, which he defines as those that have risen in value by more than 10 times over the past 15 years. Mr Martelli, who runs a fund called Martek Partners, acknowledges that his study is backwards-looking and an unscientific analysis that is hampered by the fact that only stock market winners are visible — while the losers that once looked like possible multi-baggers will not show up on any screen.In spite of these limitations, his analysis holds some illuminating and counterintuitive lessons for all types of investors, and challenges many of the most commonly held assumptions about what drives exceptional stock market returns over many years.One of his most fascinating case studies is AutoZone, the US car parts retailer, whose shares rose by 24 times in value from the year 2000 to 2013. This outstanding 27 per cent compounded annual return easily matches up with or beats the world’s very best performing venture capital funds — yet it has been generated by a seemingly sleepy business in a low growth sector. How did this happen and what does it teach us?The first commonly held assumption about multi-bagger stocks is that they must experience hyper-growth in sales, and eventually profits, to drive the share price gains that lead to multiple returns on an initial investment. Finding these types of companies in the public markets, it is assumed, must require backing risky companies that could with luck become the next Amazon or Alphabet.With AutoZone this was not the case. Mr Martelli counter-intuitively shows that strong sales growth is not always needed to drive exceptional stock market gains. In fact, during the period where AutoZone shares rose by 24 times in value the company’s revenues grew at a compounded annual rate of just 6 per cent. Over the same period, its store count rose 5 per cent a year and average sales per store by just 1 per cent.Another assumption made about public market multi-baggers could be that the outsized returns on investment are driven by the initial purchase price being made at an exceptionally low valuation. In the case of AutoZone, this was also not the case. In 2002, near the start of the company’s 13-year journey to a 24-times share price appreciation, it was trading on a trailing multiple of earnings of 18 times. Hardly a dotcom era valuation but not exactly screamingly cheap.Modern quantitative investors who believe that investment returns can be boiled down into simple “factors” such as “quality” or “high dividends” could conclude that AutoZone’s winning streak was down to some sort of mix of these characteristics. However, over this time, the company did not pay out dividends. It also did not screen particularly well on metrics used by “quality” ETF screens such as return on assets.The conclusion [Kevin] Martelli draws is that good capital allocation by management trumps growth when it comes to picking the best stocksOver the same investment period, two of the large capitalisation US stocks regarded at the turn of the millennium as being quantitatively and qualitatively of the highest quality, General Electric and Coca-Cola, have made a loss of 57 per cent and a gain of 62 per cent, respectively. Both shares underperformed the S&P 500 over the period.So what did AutoZone’s management do that resulted in the company trouncing the most illustrious names in American industry by such an amount while only growing sales at 6 per cent a year?The conclusion Mr Martelli draws is that good capital allocation by management trumps growth when it comes to picking the best stocks. While AutoZone’s sales only grew 6 per cent from 2000 to 2013, its earnings per share grew 22 per cent over this time. This was driven by operating margins increasing from 11 per cent to 19 per cent and the company using its substantial free cash flow to buy back 73 per cent of its outstanding shares.This, in turn, allowed the company to triple the single most important gauge of corporate management competence — return on invested capital or the amount of profit made for each dollar of capital invested by management in a business.There is no magic formula for identifying multi-baggers but investors should remember that not all growth is profitable and seemingly sleepy companies — when well managed — can deliver superhuman returns.miles.johnson@ft.com
1;AZO;Autozone;2017-09-25T21:11:42Z;Shares of US car dealers stage a rally;Signs that results are improving lures investors back into the unloved sector;Shares of US car retailers have made a comeback in September, but analysts warn that longer-term concerns over the threat of ecommerce and weak demand in the sector remain.O’Reilly Automotive rose on Monday, up 2.7 per cent to $215.15. It outperformed the broad S&P 500 index which weakened 0.2 per cent to 2,496. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also traded down 0.2 per cent at 22,296 on Monday in New York, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9 per cent to 6,370.Genuine Parts, which distributes replacement car parts, saw the biggest gains of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, rising 6 per cent to $93.22 on news that it has agreed to buy Europe-based Alliance Automotive Group for $2bn.Used car retailer CarMax and auto parts retailers AutoZone and O’Reilly are up 10.6 per cent, 10.4 per cent and 9.7 per cent, respectively, for the month.The uptick comes following signs of improved trading for the sector. Earlier this month, AutoZone and CarMax both reported quarterly results that beat analyst estimates.The moves have helped propel the auto retailing sub-index of the S&P 500 up 8.8 per cent this month. But the index remains down over 20 per cent for the year. Investors remain wary about headwinds from weak demand and the rise of e-commerce.Broader retail — from malls to grocery stores — have all felt the impact of changing consumer trends and growing online sales, with auto parts retailers failing to escape the fears of decline for bricks and mortar stores.“Near term there has been some dissipation of the concern around Amazon and ecommerce more broadly. It still lingers in the intermediate term,” said Ben Bienvenu, an analyst at Stephens Inc. “But it’s enough for some investors to step back in.”The sector’s underperformance this year has been driven by a warm winter resulting in less damage to cars — cutting the need for replacement car parts — coupled with the looming threat of e-commerce’s encroachment on retail, say analysts.Hurricane’s Harvey, Irma and Jose that have torn through vast swaths of the US, could create some short term need for repairs to cars that could boost auto retailers fortunes. But Mr Bienvenu voiced scepticism over the impact recent hurricanes would have.“[Car parts retailers] need severe weather for parts damage. But generally, that is due to poor road conditions creating wear and tear,” he said. “If a vehicle is damaged and flooded then it is more likely to be replaced than repaired. I’m not so convinced it will drive demand materially higher.”Elsewhere, the technology sector started the week on the back foot, falling 1.4 per cent, continuing its underperformance so far this month. Facebook dropped 4.5 per cent to $162.87 and Netflix traded down 4.7 per cent to $178.55. Energy companies continued their recent advance, buoyed by further rises in oil prices.

The company’s stock tumbled 18.9 per cent to $178.77 in trading in New York.The warning from O’Reilly rattled shares of other car parts retailers, with AutoZone falling 9.6 per cent to $516.83 and Advance Auto Parts dropping 11.2 per cent to $105.21.A warmer winter is one of the headwinds that car part retailers have suffered this year, as more clement weather has meant less wear and tear on vehicles and fewer accidents. However, the sharp reaction also stems from growing concern that ecommerce may begin to encroach on the more traditional bricks and mortar shops, like O’Reilly, according to analysts.“The real investor fear here is that Amazon at some point does take share and multiples have already compressed in response to that,” said Carolina Jolly, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. But she added that the threat has yet to fully materialise.Ms Jolly said that if companies such as Amazon were capturing market share then so called do-it-yourself retailers would be harder hit than “do-it-for-me” retailers. Jobs requiring professional repair, the theory goes, are less easily displaced by online retailing, unlike repairs that consumers can do once they have bought the parts.Yet the pain has been felt across the board, indicating broadly weaker demand. Shares of Monro Muffler Brake, which provides undercar repair services, is down 26 per cent so far this year.“If this was an ecommerce issue then the do-it-yourself business should underperform the do-it-for-me business,” said Ms Jolly. “But this is both segments.”Elsewhere, US stocks recovered from an early dip on Wednesday. The S&P 500 index gained 0.2 per cent to 2,432.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 21,478.17 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 6,150.86.Energy stocks continued their downward trend, with US oil prices falling more than 3 per cent amid persistent concerns about the glut of supply on global markets.West Texas Intermediate dropped 3.2 per cent to $45.57 a barrel in what would be the first daily loss since June 21, according to Bloomberg data. Brent crude, the global marker, fell 2.8 per cent to $48.22 a barrel.“Fear of a supply glut have again hit the oil market. An expected rebalancing of supply and demand is taking longer than we thought,” said Richard Turnill, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist. “We now see oil trading in a range around current levels, as the market rebalances in the second half.”
3;AZO;Autozone;2017-05-23T22:25:31Z;AutoZone shares tumble as consumers cut car purchases;Retailer says shoppers are postponing purchases due to delays in tax refunds;AutoZone, the US automotive replacement parts and accessories retailer, suffered its biggest one-day drop in more than a decade on Tuesday after it became the latest retailer to report a surprise slide in quarterly sales and profit.Shares in the $18bn company skidded 11.8 per cent to $581.40. The move is the stock’s biggest one-day drop since November 2008 and made the company the worst performer on the S&P 500 on Tuesday.AutoZone blamed a delay in tax refunds for the abrupt drop in like-for-like sales during its fiscal third quarter. For the three months to May 6, the closely followed industry metric fell 0.8 per cent, badly missing expectations for a 2.4 per cent increase.Bill Rhodes, AutoZone’s chief executive, said it was “a very challenging spring sales season”.“Our sales performance for the first five weeks of our quarter was significantly below our expectations, challenged by the well-publicised timing delays in IRS tax refunds,” he said.For the quarter, net sales came in at $2.62bn, much weaker than the $2.7bn analysts had forecast. Net income at $331.7m, or $11.44 per diluted share, also badly missed expectations of $347.7m, or $11.98 a share.A law passed in 2015, which comes into effect this year, requires the US Internal Revenue Service to scrutinise more closely tax returns that claim earned income tax credit or additional-child tax credit. This means shoppers, mainly low-to middle-income households who claim these credits, are having to wait longer than usual for their tax refunds and are postponing purchases they would normally make during this period as a result.AutoZone joins Foot Locker, which was forced to issue a surprise profit warning in April after first-quarter sales were “significantly” impacted by delays to its shoppers receiving their income tax refunds this year.Elsewhere, Sears Holdings, the struggling department operator, bought itself a little bit more breathing space after it said it had extended the maturity of some debt and struck an agreement to offload more of its pension liability.The company, which has seen its shares shed more than a third of their value over the past year amid mounting liquidity concerns, said it has repaid $100m of a $500m secured loan that was due to mature in July and extended the maturity of the outstanding amount until January 2018.In addition, the company said it has struck a deal to annuitise $515m of its pension liability with Metropolitan Life Insurance. It is not clear how much Sears is paying MetLife to take over the payment of future benefits to some 51,000 retirees.The moves come after Sears warned in March that there is “substantial doubt” over its ability to continue operating over the next year following years of huge losses and store closings.The company owed $4.2bn at the end of January, nearly double the $2.2bn reported in the prior year period — and almost five times Sears’ $854.2m market value.In a sign that investors are sceptical that Tuesday’s news will do much to ease Sears’ financial woes, shares in the company climbed as much as 8.2 per cent before giving up all those gains, with it ending the 0.9 per cent lower at the close.In the wider market, the three main indices continued to recover from last week’s dramatic sell-off. The S&P 500 rose for a fourth straight session, adding 0.2 per cent to 2,398.4 and erasing nearly all its losses during last week’s turbulent week of trading under political uncertainty enveloping the Trump administration.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 20,937.9, while the Nasdaq Composite crept up 0.1 per cent to 6,138.7.
4;AZO;Autozone;2017-05-23T12:56:55Z;AutoZone blames Uncle Sam for abrupt sales drop;;Move over weather, US retailers and restaurants have a found a new culprit for their sales woes – in the form of Uncle Sam.AutoZone, the automotive replacement parts and accessories retailer, has become the latest retailer to blame a delay in tax refunds for an unexpected slide in quarterly sales and profit.Shares in the $18bn company skidded more than 8 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after like-for-like sales abruptly turned negative during its fiscal third quarter. For the three months to May 6, the closely followed industry metric fell 0.8 per cent, badly missing expectations for a 2.4 per cent increase.Bill Rhodes, AutoZone’s chief executive said it was “a very challenging spring sales season.”“Our sales performance for the first five weeks of our quarter was significantly below our expectations, challenged by the well-publicized timing delays in IRS tax refunds,” he said.A law passed in 2015, which comes into effect this year, requires the US Internal Revenue Service to more closely scrutinise tax returns that claim earned income tax credit or additional-child tax credit.

5;AZO;Autozone;2017-04-03T20:54:49Z;US car part retailers dip on worries over Q1 earnings;Dip in oil prices drags down energy stocks, and financials also lose ground;Retailers of replacement car parts saw their stocks stall on Monday as pressure from online retailers as well as a warmer than expected winter prompted analysts to warn of weak first-quarter earnings.O’Reilly Automotive, AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts, which sell car parts to professional and “do-it-yourself” customers for repairs and upgrades to existing cars, saw their stock prices fall 4.1 per cent to $258.69, 3.1 per cent to $700.69 and 1.9 per cent to $145.50, respectively.Analysts said the shift lower was prompted by a downgrade from “buy” to “neutral” for AutoZone from Cleveland Research analyst Daryl Boehringer, centred on the company’s exposure to the do-it-yourself market, which is suffering weaker performance numbers than the professional repairs market known as “do-it-for-me”. Mr Boehringer said it was Cleveland Research’s policy not to discuss research with the press.But, like many retail industries, the trend is bigger than one company and other stocks fell in line with AutoZone. Carolina Jolly, an analyst with Gabelli, warned that the quarter is “shaping up to be weaker than expected”.That is in part because of the unexpectedly warm winter weather — good news for consumers who have not had to drive on icy roads with steamed up windows but less good for companies that rely on repairing broken parts.“With the warmer weather, batteries don’t freeze, tyres don’t skid, all that sort of stuff,” Ms Jolly said.Some of the other issues facing the industry are similar to other retail markets with the rise of e-commerce at best offering greater price transparency to consumers who head to a store in person but at worst draining sales away.“You have increasing competition both from e-commerce and between the major brick and mortar retailers,” said David Schick, lead retail analyst at Consumer Edge Research. “Amazon sells everything to everyone so it is clearly a competitor.”Ms Jolly noted that, while there had been little sign of online retailers pulling sales away, lower prices and the lessons learnt in other retail industries such as department stores was cause for concern.“It’s a worry that it might happen in the auto parts industry, even though there is no real indication of that yet,” she said.Elsewhere, the first day of trading of the second quarter of 2017 saw US stock markets fall, with the S&P 500 closing down 0.2 per cent to 2,358.8. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 20,650.2 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3 per cent to 5,894.6.A dip in oil prices in New York dragged down energy stocks. Financials were also knocked in a further sign that the so-called Trump trade is on pause after the failure of the president’s proposed healthcare reform and absence of advancement on tax legislation.The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, also fell to its lowest level in more than a month.Healthcare stocks were less badly affected than the broader market. The S&P 500 healthcare sector dipped just 0.1 per cent, with notable rises among the health insurers affected by Congress’s failure to pass changes to Obamacare.
6;AZO;Autozone;2016-03-23T18:14:18Z;Auto parts: blowing a gasket;Ageing US car fleet and Amazon-unfriendly products add up to a surprising retail success story;Over the past decade the best growth story in US retail — outside of the internet — is not do-it-yourself, luxury or fast casual dining. It is auto parts. The total market capitalisation of the four biggest public parts groups (AutoZone, O’Reilly, Advance and Genuine Parts) grew by over $50bn in that time.Annual growth in car sales has averaged about 1 per cent over the past 10 years. Growth at the big parts chains? Over 7 per cent. In fact, sluggish car sales is the first, though not the most important, driver of the chains’ success. Overall, the US car fleet is getting older, meaning more broken spark plugs and worn-out brake pads. The next driver is consolidation. Mom-and-pop distributor-retailers have given way to the big guys. This has brought purchasing power, more efficient distribution and higher margins. Free cash flow has grown at twice the rate of sales. Evercore ISI research reckons that the big chains now control 40-50 per cent of the parts market, and sees more consolidation to come. Meanwhile, bulky, fiddly, greasy and occasionally heavy bits of metal are not what one orders on Amazon.There is a financial side to the growth story: leverage. The two outstanding performers are AutoZone and O’Reilly, both of which have returned more than 600 per cent to shareholders in 10 years. And over the period both have spent a pile of money buying back shares — $5bn at O’Reilly and $11bn at AutoZone, more than total free cash flow in both cases. As such both have added debt (though neither is very indebted in absolute terms).Debt-financed stock buybacks are usually associated with bad capital allocation, financial engineering and go-go stocks that suddenly go wrong. The association is often merited but the cases of AutoZone and O’Reilly are instructive. In both, buybacks have been accompanied by steady organic sales growth and widening margins. When that is true it can make sense to optimise the capital structure by reducing the amount of equity in it. The falling share count is irrelevant. The problems arise when buybacks are used as a substitute for growth, rather than a response to it.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Wall Street economists expect first-quarter GDP to be downgraded to reflect a 0.9 per cent contraction, compared to the initial reading that reflected 0.2 per cent growth.“A much wider trade gap and substantially lower inventory building should be the largest sources of downward revision,” said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse.G7 finance ministersFinance ministers from G7 nations begin a three-day meeting in Dresden, Germany, on Wednesday to discuss the health of the global economy and finance regulation. Greece could make the agenda, as European leaders have told Athens that a deal to release more funds to the cash-strapped nation would need approval from the International Monetary Fund.UK parliamentDavid Cameron’s government sets forth its policies and proposed legislation in a speech read by the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament on Wednesday.“We expect the Queen’s Speech to provide policy guidance in areas such as fiscal consolidation, EU negotiations, Scottish devolution and other government high-priority areas,” economists at Barclays said.EarningsSix S&P 500 companies are expected to report results next week as earnings season wraps up.

The S&P 500 closed at 1,277.3, less than a quarter of a point up for the day, with financials bearing the brunt of selling, off 0.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $15.94, while the afterglow from Citigroup’s $2.5bn bond offering on Tuesday, its largest such debt issue since 2009, did not last long. Its shares fell 0.6 per cent to $28.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2 per cent to 12,418,42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,648.36, although the Nasdaq had opened sharply lower as technology stocks suffered.Ebay, the auction website, fell 3.8 per cent to $30.16 after Yahoopoached Scott Thompson from Ebay-owned PayPal as its new chief executive. Yahoo investors were unimpressed however, sending shares down 3.1 per cent to $15.78.Data storage company Netapp fell 3.1 per cent to $35.64 after a downgrade from Credit Suisse analysts, who tipped the company’s rate of market share growth to slow in 2012.Shares in Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, slumped 3.7 per cent to $97.48. The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter. However Netflix did not provide comparative figures for previous quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas climbed 7.2 per cent to $82.32 after the company raised its dividend 33 per cent to 16 cents a share and announced that it had doubled production in the Marcellus Shale during 2011. Separately, Cabot announced a two-for-one stock split.Shares of car vendor AutoNation fell 6.8 per cent to $33.26 after Edward Lampert’s ESL fund cut its stake in the company to 52.5 per cent from 56.4 per cent. Mr Lampert also reduced ESL’s stake in car parts retailer AutoZone to 12.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent, but after falling sharply at the open, shares recovered to close 2.2 per cent higher at $326.96.Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 2.2 per cent to $348.75 after Goldman Sachs analysts added the fast food restaurant to its “conviction buy” list, tipping the company for earnings growth of 35-0 per cent this year as food costs fall, boosting margins.Shares in Chipotle rose almost 60 per cent in 2011 after more than doubling in value in 2010.Ford Motors rose 1.5 per cent to $11.30 as December sales rose 10 per cent, beating most analyst estimates. General Motors saw December sales growth of 5 per cent, which gave shares a 0.5 per cent fillip to $21.15. Both companies were left in the dust by Chrysler, which saw December sales leap 37 per cent compared with the previous year.Discount website Groupon fell 2.5 per cent to $18.79, significantly below the $20 offer price for its November IPO.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 3.1 per cent to $34.70 as the Commerce Department said a decision on additional tariffs for Chinese solar-equipment would be delayed by a month to mid-February.CF Industries was up 2.7 per cent to $157.99, after Citigroup analysts recommended the nitrogen fertiliser producer.""Given the recent slowdown in fertiliser sales, we now prefer nitrogen as our top nutrient – nitrogen cannot be stored in the ground so its application tends to be steady,” Citi analysts told clients. MasterCard, off 3.3 per cent to $356.25, and Visa, off 1.8 per cent to $101.15, both fell as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its buy recommendations from both stocks.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare slid 5.4 per cent to $4.69, as investors continued to fret about long-term government funding for Medicare after Citigroup downgraded the sector on Tuesday."
9;AZO;Autozone;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20.

10;AZO;Autozone;2007-10-30T01:05:45Z;Office Depot hit by delay;;Shares in Office Depot, the US office supplies retailer, slid more than 14 per cent on Monday, after the company said it was delaying its third-quarter earnings release owing to a review by its audit committee.The retailer said the review was focused on the “timing of the recognition of certain vendor programme funds”. No date for the earnings release was set.In the US retail industry, “vendor programme funds” generally refer to payments made to a retailer by suppliers in exchange for benefits such as handling customer coupon programmes, joint advertising, or advantageous product positioning.The timing of the recognition of these allowances has been a thorny issue for US retailers and regulators, with historic examples of companies having used the monies improperly to boost quarterly sales numbers.The news of the inquiry led a number of Wall Street analysts to downgrade the stock, amid concerns the review would lead the retai­ler to revise previous earnings statements downwards.Matthew Fassler, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to clients that “while the scope and specific drivers of the issues are unclear, the presence of any investigation, combined with the involvement of the board, suggests questions about the integrity of the company’s financial statements”.Office Depot, with sales of $15.4bn, has been headed since March 2005 by Steve Odland, a former super­market executive who previously led a turnround at AutoZone, the car parts retailer.He initially presided over a period of margin expansion that led to a steady increase in the company’s share price, which had more than doubled by late 2006 to more than $40. Since then shares have steadily lost ground, hitting $17.17 on Monday after news of the audit inquiry emerged.In July the retailer blamed the housing slump and other macroeconomic factors for a sharp drop in sales growth at its more than 1,000 US stores.
