0;KMX;Carmax Inc;2018-06-22T17:49:52Z;Used car retailer CarMax revs up to record high;;CarMax shares shifted into high gear on Friday, cruising to an all-time high after the US used-car retailer reported better than expected sales and earnings.Shares of the Richmond, Virginia-based company rose to an all-time high of $81.28 on Friday after its latest quarterly report, which was released before the opening bell. Shares were up about 11.3 per cent at pixel time, and if the gains hold it will be the company’s biggest one-day percentage increase since 2014.The moves follow expectation-beating results from the used-car seller for the three months ending May 31. During that time, net sales rose 5.5 per cent to $4.79bn. Net earnings were up 12.7 per cent to $238.7m, or $1.33 a share. Analysts had been looking for $4.61bn in revenue and earnings per share of $1.24, according to Thomson Reuters.While used unit sales in comparable stores were down 2.3 per cent year-on-year, that was an improvement from the 8 per cent slide reported in the previous quarter.CarMax executives said on a call with investors that it saw a smoother path ahead this year, with acquisition costs — the amount it pays to buy the car — “trending in the right direction” and an improvement in its effort to drive more sales from its website.“Industry data indicates some signs of recovery in the used vehicle marketplace since the slowdown at the end of last year”, Bill Nash, CarMax president and chief executive said during the call.Used car companies like CarMax are closely watched as an indicator of the health of the middle-class consumer. After treading water last year, shares are up 23.6 per cent so far in 2018.
1;KMX;Carmax Inc;2017-09-25T21:11:42Z;Shares of US car dealers stage a rally;Signs that results are improving lures investors back into the unloved sector;Shares of US car retailers have made a comeback in September, but analysts warn that longer-term concerns over the threat of ecommerce and weak demand in the sector remain.O’Reilly Automotive rose on Monday, up 2.7 per cent to $215.15. It outperformed the broad S&P 500 index which weakened 0.2 per cent to 2,496. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also traded down 0.2 per cent at 22,296 on Monday in New York, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9 per cent to 6,370.Genuine Parts, which distributes replacement car parts, saw the biggest gains of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, rising 6 per cent to $93.22 on news that it has agreed to buy Europe-based Alliance Automotive Group for $2bn.Used car retailer CarMax and auto parts retailers AutoZone and O’Reilly are up 10.6 per cent, 10.4 per cent and 9.7 per cent, respectively, for the month.The uptick comes following signs of improved trading for the sector. Earlier this month, AutoZone and CarMax both reported quarterly results that beat analyst estimates.The moves have helped propel the auto retailing sub-index of the S&P 500 up 8.8 per cent this month. But the index remains down over 20 per cent for the year. Investors remain wary about headwinds from weak demand and the rise of e-commerce.Broader retail — from malls to grocery stores — have all felt the impact of changing consumer trends and growing online sales, with auto parts retailers failing to escape the fears of decline for bricks and mortar stores.“Near term there has been some dissipation of the concern around Amazon and ecommerce more broadly. It still lingers in the intermediate term,” said Ben Bienvenu, an analyst at Stephens Inc. “But it’s enough for some investors to step back in.”The sector’s underperformance this year has been driven by a warm winter resulting in less damage to cars — cutting the need for replacement car parts — coupled with the looming threat of e-commerce’s encroachment on retail, say analysts.Hurricane’s Harvey, Irma and Jose that have torn through vast swaths of the US, could create some short term need for repairs to cars that could boost auto retailers fortunes. But Mr Bienvenu voiced scepticism over the impact recent hurricanes would have.“[Car parts retailers] need severe weather for parts damage. But generally, that is due to poor road conditions creating wear and tear,” he said. “If a vehicle is damaged and flooded then it is more likely to be replaced than repaired. I’m not so convinced it will drive demand materially higher.”Elsewhere, the technology sector started the week on the back foot, falling 1.4 per cent, continuing its underperformance so far this month. Facebook dropped 4.5 per cent to $162.87 and Netflix traded down 4.7 per cent to $178.55. Energy companies continued their recent advance, buoyed by further rises in oil prices.
2;KMX;Carmax Inc;2016-06-21T20:23:27Z;Lennar shares fail to build on good news;Energy, telecoms and technology sectors help lift S&P 500;Lennar shares climbed early on Tuesday as a robust US jobs market and low interest rates helped the homebuilder log a sharper than expected rise in quarterly profits.Florida-based Lennar said its net profits climbed to $218.5m, or 95 cents a share, in the quarter to the end of May, from $183m, or 79 cents a share, in the same period in the year prior.That topped Wall Street estimates of 87 cents. Revenues rose 14.8 per cent to $2.7bn, also beating analysts’ estimates.“The homebuilding market continued its slow and steady recovery sustained by low interest rates, modest wage growth, positive consumer confidence and low unemployment levels combined with tight inventory levels,” said Stuart Miller, chief executive.The group added that deliveries rose 12 per cent on a year-on-year basis to 6,724 homes while new orders were up 10 per cent to 7,962 homes.The upbeat sentiment from Lennar comes as data have painted a mixed picture of the strength of the US economy. Indeed, job growth slowed sharply in May while capital investment has remained sluggish, factors that some economists have said could weigh on the housing market.Lennar’s shares rose as much as 3.3 per cent to $48.18, however the rally turned and they ended the day 0.9 per cent lower at $46.22. Meanwhile, KB Home, which was set to post its earnings after the closing bell in New York on Tuesday, rose by 0.6 per cent to $14.57.Elsewhere, United Continental’s shares flew higher after the group unveiled a brighter revenue outlook and a $3bn plan to cut costs and drive sales higher.United said passenger unit revenue, an important metric for airlines, will probably decline by 6.5-7.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter, compared with a previous estimate of a fall of as much as 8.5 per cent.The group also said it was making “improvements across the commercial organisation” that are expected to generate $1.5bn in value, along with cost structure improvements that may produce a $1.3bn benefit.It also plans to create $300m in value by running more reliably, which will cut costs associated with delays and cancellations.The shares jumped 3.5 per cent on Tuesday to $44.91, cutting their year-to-date loss to 21.6 per cent.CarMax, a used car retailer, skidded after posting disappointing profits and sales figures.The company said its net earnings declined by 3.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $175.4m. Earnings per share of 90 cents missed market expectations by two cents. Sales rose 2.8 per cent to $4.1bn, also missing forecasts of $4.2bn.CarMax’s shares dropped 4.9 per cent to $48.16 and have declined by 30.4 per cent over the past 12 months.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had risen 0.3 per cent to 2,088.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 0.1 per cent to 17,829.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 4,843.8.The energy, telecommunications and technology sectors posted the best performance while materials, healthcare and consumer discretionary struggled.Market strategists said that, despite the modest fluctuations on Tuesday, volatility might increase in the run-up to, or after, the referendum on Thursday by UK citizens over whether the country should part ways with the EU.
3;KMX;Carmax Inc;2014-09-23T16:29:45Z;CarMax sputters on disappointing sales;US stocks moderate after weakening European PMI data;Shares of CarMax, the largest US used auto dealer, declined on Tuesday after same-store sales nearly flatlined and earnings fell short of Wall Street forecasts.The Virginia-based car dealer reported a 0.2 per cent increase in same-store sales in the quarter, short of expectations for a 2.7 per cent gain, as subprime lenders kept financing requirements tight and a calendar shift eliminated a Saturday from the period.The results contrast with strong new cars sales figures in August, which touched a post-recession high of 17.45m units, according to figures from auto research group Ward’s Automotive.The jump, which eclipsed expectations for a rise to 16.6m, was fuelled by easier credit standards for prime borrowers and a need for consumers to replace ageing vehicles. Analysts with Citi note prime borrower credit scores climbed during the quarter and the mix of subprime loans to prime loans declined year over year.Despite caution by subprime lenders, executives told investors on a conference call that they were still “very happy with the finance environment”.“Optics of the comp unit miss will likely pressure CarMax shares today, as we believe many CarMax bears will point to the positive contribution of subprime buyers last year, which continues to wane as a percentage of customers this year,” James Albertine, an analyst with Stifel, said.The Virginia-based car dealer said profits rose 10 per cent to $154.5m, or 70 cents per share. When adjusting for settlement proceeds from a class-action lawsuit, CarMax earned 64 cents per share, short of forecasts.Net revenues increased 11 per cent from a year earlier to $3.6bn, ahead of analyst forecasts. CarMax shares fell 9 per cent to $47.80, leading the laggards on the benchmark S&P 500. Rival AutoNation declined 2 per cent to $48.95.Shares of Carnival Cruise rose as much as 5 per cent before paring gains, as both profits and sales eclipsed forecasts and the company lifted its outlook.The company reported net profits of $1.24bn, or $1.60 a share, in the three months ending August 21, up from $934m a year earlier.Carnival’s performance was boosted by gains in China as well as a near 20 per cent increase in guests travelling routes to the Caribbean. As a result, the operator expects full-year earnings per share to be between $1.84 to $1.88 per share. The company rose 0.4 per cent to $40.51.Pharmaceutical companies broadly weakened on Tuesday after the US government announced a set of rules to crack down on tax inversions.The new rules from the US Treasury would ban the use of certain assets to inflate the size of a foreign merger partner and stop US companies from paying special dividends just before an inversion in order to reduce their own size.Pfizer shares fell 0.5 per cent to $30.05, AstraZeneca declined 5 per cent to $71.13, GlaxoSmithKline dipped 1 per cent to $46.64 and AbbVie slipped 2 per cent to $57.56.Overall, US markets moderated following weakening European manufacturing PMI figures. The S&P 500 declined 0.6 per cent to 1,982.77, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.7 per cent to 17,055.87.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 4,508.69.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
4;KMX;Carmax Inc;2014-04-29T01:47:00Z;Sponsors ditch LA Clippers after race row;;Sponsors and advertisers are ending their association with one of basketball’s marquee teams after its owner was secretly recorded making racist remarks.State Farm, Virgin America, CarMax and Samsung are among the brands to have suspended or cancelled commercial relationships with the Los Angeles Clippers, which is competing in the NBA playoffs.The moves came after Donald Sterling, the Clippers’ owner, was secretly recorded by a former girlfriend criticising her for taking Instagram photographs with black people – including the former player, Earvin “Magic” Johnson – and warning her not to invite them to the team’s games.The recording was released by the TMZ website over the weekend, sending shockwaves through the sport. State Farm said it would “pause” its relationship with the Clippers. CarMax said it found “the statements attributed to the Clippers’ owner completely unacceptable”.Steve Stoute, chief executive of Translation, the advertising and brand agency that represents State Farm, told the Financial Times that companies working with the Clippers had to take action.“If brands think that by doing nothing they remain neutral, they are wrong,” he said. “By doing nothing they are enabling the problem.”The withdrawal by the sponsors has echoes of past scandals that involve sports stars: many of Tiger Woods’ commercial partners pulled out of deals with the golfer when he was embroiled in a sex scandal, for example.However, the furore surrounding the Sterling comments has the potential to have a much bigger impact because they could affect the future of a franchise which is a rising force in the sport.“There are certain things other [team] owners can do,” Mr Stoute said. “If a guy owning a team can affect the league in the same way a player can . . . the owners have the right to do something about that.”Samsung, which was the latest to pull out of advertising with the Clippers on Monday night, said: “The comments made are offensive, unacceptable and conflict with our core values as a company. As a result we have decided to suspend current advertising slated to run onsite at the LA Clippers games and also during the televised airing of the Clippers games.”The comments made are offensive, unacceptable and conflict with our core values as a companyThe NBA will announce findings from an investigation on Tuesday. The league does not have the power to force an owner to sell but it can levy fines and remove him from the day to day operations of the team.Michael Jordan, the basketball star who now owns the Charlotte Bobcats team, said he was “outraged” by Mr Sterling’s comments. “As an owner, I’m obviously disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views,” he said.Magic Johnson went further, telling ABC that Mr Sterling should be stripped of his ownership of the team. “He shouldn’t own a team any more. And he should stand up and say, ‘I don't want to own a team any more,’” Mr Johnson said.Clippers players including stars such as Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, who has a commercial deal with State Farm, staged their own protest on Sunday evening when the team played the Golden State Warriors in Oakland*. The players turned their shirts inside out during the warm-up before the game, hiding Clippers logos.This story has been amended from a previous version.——————————————-Letter in response to this article:A ‘conversation’ is quite unnecessary / From Mr Eugene D Cohen
5;KMX;Carmax Inc;2014-04-04T17:24:21Z;GrubHub surges more than 30% on debut;Established tech stocks hit by selling in momentum plays;Shares in GrubHub initially surged more than 50 per cent in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange, lifting the online food delivery site’s valuation above $3bn in a sign investor demand for profitable tech start-ups remains afire.The Chicago-based company, whose Seamless and GrubHub websites connect restaurants with consumers, rose as much as 57 per cent in early trade before settling back to close just over 30 per cent higher, at $34.03. The offering had been priced at $26 on Thursday night, more than earlier projections. GrubHub sold 4m shares in the offering, while selling stockholders offered another 3.4m for sale.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunners for Friday’s offering. The flotation follows a busy first quarter for IPOs, with the average amount raised in the period reaching a record, according to data from Dealogic.The rise stood in contrast with a difficult month for the tech sector stalwarts, including Facebook and Twitter, which have each fallen more than 10 per cent. King Digital, the maker of Candy Crush, continues to trade below its offering price.Google A class shares, which carry minimal voting rights, ended the day down 4.59 per cent to $545.25, the second day of trading after a split to create a C class of stock which carries no voting rights.Amazon fell 3.25 per cent to $322.78 and Netflix shares were down 4.9 per cent to $337.31, as momentum stocks on Nasdaq were hit hard.A week long spotlight on the business of rapid fire stock trading also knocked down the valuations of the publicly traded companies at the heart of a debate over whether US stock markets are “rigged”.Shares in US online brokers suffered some of the largest losses on Friday as ETrade fell 7.83 per cent to close at $20.43, TD Ameritrade lost 4 per cent to $30.71 and Charles Schwab declined 4.79 per cent to end at $26.06.KCG, an algorithmic trading company that also executes orders on behalf of clients, lost 6.81 per cent to $10.47. Major US stock and derivatives exchange operators including Nasdaq OMX, CBOE and ICE also fell.The scrutiny of the US trading industry was prompted by the release of Michael Lewis’ latest book, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt.Elsewhere, CarMax, the largest US used-car dealership chain, slid after the company reported fourth-quarter results shy of Wall Street forecasts.The firm said sales rose 9 per cent to $3.08bn, led by a 7 per cent advance in same-store sales, compared to expectations for $3.18bn. Profits declined 7 per cent to $99m, or 44 cents per diluted share, nearly a dime below analyst forecasts.CarMax said it would lift its share repurchase programme by $1bn. Shares dipped 4.21 per cent to $45.56.Finish Line strengthened following a broker upgrade to ‘overweight’ from ‘equal-weight’ as analysts at Morgan Stanley called the company their “top small-cap idea”.The shares rose by 1.13 per cent to $27.16 as Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said the investment bank expects strong athletic footwear sales trends to continue through 2014, with Finish Line likely to benefit from exclusive Nike offerings.“Finish Line’s last quarter showed the company can deliver even in a very poor mall traffic environment,” Mr Sole said. “A strong new product pipeline and the continuing health and wellness trend should sustain Finish Line’s premium running footwear business through 2014.”Athletic footwear sales have like “troughed” as recent data points to an acceleration, Mr Sole added.First Solar climbed as much as 6 per cent before paring its gains on Friday to just under 2 per cent, closing at $69.72, as analysts at Citi lifted their price target on the firm.Analyst Shahriar Pourreza said the company’s outlook “remains robust”, raising his target on the firm to $87 from $63.“The company has already contracted/booked 75 per cent of the earnings in 2015 and 40 per cent for 2016 so material upside remains as business mix changes and First Solar continues to diversify globally,” Mr Pourreza said.Overall, US equity markets struggled for direction after the month’s non-farm payrolls report showed payrolls expanded by 192,000 in March. The figures were marginally below Wall Street forecasts.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.25 per cent to end at 1,865.09 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.96 per cent to 16,412.71. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6 per cent to close at 4,127.73.
6;KMX;Carmax Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;CarMax: motoring on;Used auto dealer enjoys sales lift thanks to its unique one-price, no-haggle policy;Used car salesmen are universally hated, but there has been a lot of love for CarMax. Shares of the largest seller of used vehicles in the US have rallied 38 per cent during the past year, hitting a fresh high of $43 after reporting full-year earnings on Wednesday. The good feelings stem from growth: CarMax is rolling up its market with a unique model.The company aims to sell used cars without the stereotypical hard pitch. It has a one-price, no-haggle policy. It avoids rusty clunkers, focusing on cars less than six-years old. A drop in new car sales (from 16.1m in 2007 to a low of 10.4m in 2009 and back to 14.5m last year, according to Edmunds.com) during the financial crisis has crimped the supply of used cars in that range. But while the churn on new cars is unknown, these supply issues should be moving to the rear view mirror.Even though it is the largest single player in used cars, CarMax has only a 3 per cent share. It opened 10 stores last year bringing the count to 118, and it plans to add 10 to 15 stores in each of the next two years. Sales for the year ended February 28 rose about 10 per cent to nearly $11bn, while gross profit rose 6 per cent to $1.5bn. CarMax is exposed to the credit markets. About a third of its sales are financed internally, and those loans are packaged and resold as securities. The market for auto bonds is hot, with rising issuance even of subprime debt. There are nascent concerns about the potential for overheating. CarMax’s loan portfolio is predominantly prime.At 21 times analysts’ estimates for this year’s earnings, CarMax is not a bargain. Neither are its cars. The company’s average selling price on used vehicles last year was $19,351, high enough to make a slowing economy or rising unemployment a risk. Either one could put the brakes on this growth story.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Its shares were more volatile on the day but finished 1.4 per cent higher to $130.10.Roger Freeman, analyst at Barclays, said: “We believe there are opportunities for both companies to leverage both intellectual talent and a broader product set to grow their businesses on a combined basis more than either could do alone, and certainly interest rate futures and swaps appear to be a significant focus according to management.”NYSE rival Nasdaq OMX traded higher on the news, up 3.5 per cent to $26.11, while CBOE Holdings, parent company of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, rose 4 per cent to $30.68 as some analysts said it may be a potential candidate for further exchange dealmaking.CME Group, the largest US-based exchange operator by market value, fell 2.3 per cent to $51.40. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 0.6 to 1,443.69. A late rally carried stocks to a session high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 to 13,311.72. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 3,040.59. Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the tech benchmark, lost 0.9 per cent to $521.73.Overall, US equity markets were muted for much of the day as positive economic data were eclipsed by the pall cast by the stalled negotiations over preventing the fiscal cliff at the end of the year.The US economy grew faster than previously forecast in the third quarter, according to the latest figures. Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.1 per cent annual rate, revised up from an initial 2.7 per cent reported last month. Jobless claims normalised after surging in the aftermath of superstorm Sandy. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 361,000, according to the Department of Labor.In earnings news, CarMax rose sharply after the used car retailer reported third-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates. The company cited improving customer sentiment, increased availability of credit and a larger inventory for a boost in sales. Shares in CarMax gained 9 per cent to $37.97.ConAgra also rose after the company’s quarterly earnings beat estimates, helped by sales in its consumer food business. The owner of the Healthy Choice meals brand reported a 17 per cent increase in profits. Shares in ConAgra climbed 0.7 per cent to $30.16.In contrast, Bed Bath & Beyond suffered a sharp drop as the home furnishings retailer lowered its earnings forecasts for the first quarter of next year. The company’s shares slid 6.5 per cent to $56.3.Shares in Herbalife, the nutritional supplement direct seller, came under pressure for a second straight day after hedge fund manager Bill Ackman confirmed he is betting against the stock.Mr Ackman presented his arguments on Thursday on why he had a taken a short position on Herbalife shares, saying that the company had grown quickly in recent years without being able to justify the growth.Herbalife shares lost 9.8 per cent to $33.70, reaching its lowest point for the last year.Financial stocks were the best performing industry group on the S&P 500, rising 1.4 per cent. Bank of America led the risers among big Wall Street banks, its shares gaining 3 per cent to $11.52.

The index dipped from positive to negative territory late in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve cut US growth forecasts and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent to 12,109.67 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,669.19.According to Investment Company Institute, the last two week were the worst fortnight for equity outflow since May 2010, the week of the flash crash. This did not help the mood in the markets.Wall Street was hurt by a move in the dollar, which edged higher after the Bernanke press conference. This weighed on the industrial, energy and material sectors.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, although these losses were pared somewhat by L-3 Communications, which spiked 4.6 per cent to $86.21 after reports that investors were pushing the defence company to spin off some units.The S&P energy and material sectors were both down 0.4 per cent.In the materials sector, CF Industries was down 2.8 per cent to $142.25 while Allegheny fell 2.5 per cent to $59.91.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.9 per cent to $142.25 while EOG Resources lost 0.8 per cent to $101.34.But the technology sector was the worst performing in the session, led lower by Adobe Systems, the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500.The software company that makes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs for media and internet professionals gave a disappointing earnings forecast, which dragged the stock down 6.3 per cent to $30.01.These losses came despite the fact that the company reported a 54 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings.Many analysts were still upbeat about the software maker in the long term.Analysts at Citigroup said that there were “lots of small things to quibble about” but that the “big picture [was] still bright”.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Autodesk was down 1.5 per cent to $36.47 while Juniper Networks lost 2.4 per cent to $29.53.The S&P technology index was down 0.8 per cent, although losses were pared by strong gains from Jabil Circuit. The electronics contractor was up 3.2 per cent to $19.45 after reporting powerful earnings and a share buy-back.Homebuilders also saw gains after home prices as tracked by the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.8 per cent in April from the previous month, which was better than the 0.3 per cent fall that had been expected. PulteGroup was up 0.4 per cent to $7.49 while DR Horton added 1.4 per cent to $11.54.Consumer staples stocks also suffered, led by Lorillard Tobacco, which was down 1.7 per cent to $110.01.In the previous session, the US Food and Drug Administration released nine warnings on the ill-effects of smoking – combining graphic images and text – that must appear on cigarette packets as well as in advertisements no later than September 2012.The S&P consumer staples index was down, 0.7 per cent.CarMax, the used-car dealer, enjoyed the strongest gains on the S&P 500 after reporting first-quarter earnings up 25 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares were up 7 per cent to $32.66 as earnings came in at $126.3m, or 55 cents a share, which was ahead of the 47 cents expected.AeroVironment’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20.6 per cent on a jump in contract-services, leaving shares in the maker of unmanned aircraft up 19.6 per cent to $34.51.
9;KMX;Carmax Inc;2011-03-31T21:02:33Z;Wall Street down after jobless data revision;;Berkshire Hathaway shares slid after the unexpected resignation of one of its key figures while the wider markets closed out the best first quarter in over a decade, despite edging slightly lower in the session on weak economic data.Berkshire Hathaway lost ground after David Sokol, one of the leading contenders to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, resigned just weeks after the investment company agreed to purchase Lubrizol for $9bn – a business in which he held stock.Class B shares in Berkshire Hathaway were down 2.1 per cent to $83.68, one of the worst performing in the financial sector. Elsewhere, Bank of America was down 0.9 per cent to $13.33 while SunTrust Banks fell 1.2 per cent to $28.86.The S&P financial index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing of all the S&P sub-indices.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 1,325.83, following a string of lacklustre economic numbers.Figures from the Labor Department announced that 12,000 more people had claimed benefits than had initially been reported last week, weighing on sentiment. The four-week moving average of claims went up 3,000 to 394,000.However, the news was not all bad as it also reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 6,000 last week. This helped to limit losses in the session ahead of the all important official non-farm payroll number due to be released today.“The revised data show a slightly less steep drop in claims over the past few months, but the key point here is that the trend is still clearly downwards,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Other figures showed that US factory orders had fallen 0.1 per cent in February, which was more than expected, and that business activity had expanded at a slower rate in March than in the previous month.Overall, that disappointing data left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2 per cent at 12,320.79 while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,781.07.The Dow was up 6.7 per cent in the quarter, which was the best first quarter for the index since 1998.The retail sector lost ground in the session led by CarMax, which fell 7.2 per cent to $32.10 after the biggest US used-car dealer reported lower gross margins for the fourth quarter. However, the group also reported earnings up 19 per cent and double-digit gains in sales of vehicles.Elsewhere in the sector home improvement retailers lost ground, with Home Depot falling 1.4 per cent to $37.06 while Lowe’s lost 2 per cent to $26.43. Earlier in the week, Home Depot had seen gains after announcing plans to issue $2bn of debt and buy back $1bn of stock.The S&P retail sector was down 0.7 per cent, one of the worst performing in the session along with financials. Looking at the first quarter on Wall Street, equities have seen strong 5.6 per cent gains. It was the best first quarter for the S&P 500 since 1998. On average since 1998, the S&P 500 index has lost 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year, with the index losing ground in six out of the previous 13 first quarters.The markets began the year in a euphoric state, continuing the rally from early September 2010 when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The S&P 500 saw a sharp 6.8 per cent rise throughout January and the first half of February, reaching the point where many commentators started to argue equities were overbought and due a correction.Then in the middle of February, the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East and the subsequent spike in oil prices provided a catalyst for a sell off.That was compounded in March by a further retreat following the natural disaster in Japan. These worries saw markets marked down 6.4 per cent in four weeks. Since the middle of March, the index has rallied back 5.6 per cent as traders have turned their attentions towards the domestic economic recovery.“Ultimately, the markets have been predisposed to positive news and have had a tendency to shrug off negative news,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.Energy stocks dominated the quarter, with the S&P energy index up 16.8 per cent as oil prices soared. Chevron rose 17.8 per cent in the quarter to $107.49.Industrial stocks have been the next biggest winner rising 8.1 per cent. Caterpillar has put on 18.9 per cent to $111.40 over the quarter.
10;KMX;Carmax Inc;2010-12-21T21:31:37Z;US tech stocks higher on Adobe earnings;;Strong earnings and an optimistic outlook from Adobe Systems helped the technology sector rise as US stocks closed just shy of highs not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Adobe jumped 6 per cent to $30.93 after the software maker forecast earnings far above analyst expectations.The optimistic outlook marks a turnround from more cautious guidance three months ago as sales of its Creative Suite 5 product rebounded from a dip earlier in the year. The software accounts for most of Adobe’s sales.The company forecast revenue in the first quarter of between $1bn and $1.05bn, above the average analyst projection of $991.9m.Adobe also exceeded expectations in its fourth quarter, with earnings per share of 56 cents compared with the 52 cents consensus.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets raised their price target for the company but maintained its “market perform” rating.“We believe upside potential is limited as we enter the back half of the CS5 product cycle [and] uncertainty surrounding the Flash franchise remains,” they said, adding that Adobe’s move to a recurring revenue model would be good for the longer term but was likely to be disruptive in the short term.Analysts at Citigroup said they preferred other software companies.“We believe that investors are better served owning other similarly or more-cheaply valued software companies … where we have a higher degree of confidence in near- to medium-term growth prospects [and] which are not as tied to specific industry verticals, and/or that are more leveraged to a rebound in corporate capital spending in the data centre.”The S&P 500 technology index gained 0.6 per cent and the wider market continued to hover around its two-year highs.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,254.61, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.5 per cent to close at 11,533.16 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.7 per cent higher at 2,667.61.Jabil Circuit was another technology company to beat expectations and raise forecasts. The electronics manufacturing services provider’s shares surged 10.7 per cent to $19.55, the most in the S&P 500, after it said it had seen strong growth across its divisions.The company forecast second-quarter earnings of 49 to 53 cents per share compared with the average 44 cents estimate.“While the quarter was strong, the bigger story remains how Jabil is moving upmarket to attack opportunities that offer a ‘less traditional’ and higher margin profile,” said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who maintained an “outperform” rating.“We believe the multiple will continue to expand as investors get comfortable around Jabil’s business transformation that will drive sustainably higher revenues and margins going forward.”In contrast, CarMax tumbled 7.6 per cent to $33.17, the most in the S&P 500, even though the used car retailer reported better than expected earnings.Strong sales from its wholesale unit helped revenue rise 23 per cent but gross profit per vehicle was lower than some analysts had expected.Financials led the risers with the S&P 500 financials index gaining 1.6 per cent, Bank of America adding 2.9 per cent to $12.98, Wells Fargo gaining 2.4 per cent to $30.82 and AIG climbing 3.3 per cent to $55.18.Regional banks climbed even further, up 1.9 per cent, with Regions Financial rising 2.2 per cent to $6.45 and Zions Bancorp higher by 2.1 per cent to $23.02.End-of-year deal activity continued. Martek Biosciences soared 35.6 per cent to $31.67 after the baby food ingredients maker agreed to be bought by DSM, a Dutch group.DSM, which makes vitamins, is paying $1.1bn for the US company, which specialises in healthy, natural ingredients and algal technology.Massey Energy added 1.2 per cent to $52.45 after it was reported that the US coal producer had received an offer from rival Alpha Natural Resources. Shares in Alpha Natural Resources rose 2.8 per cent to $55.10.

The S&P 500 materials index was up 0.4 per cent. Barrick Gold gained 0.9 per cent to $47.22 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold added 1.8 per cent to $84.51.Other materials stocks also rose, with Alcoa up 4.7 per cent to $11.70 and Cliffs Natural ResourcesThe financial sector fell 1.6 per cent with Morgan Stanleydown by 4.3 per cent to $24.95 and Goldman Sachs losing 2.2 per cent to $148.07 after Deutsche Bank cut third-quarter earnings estimates for the banks.Life insurers suffered with Metlife losing 4.2 per cent to $39.39 and Hartford Financial Services dropping 3.6 per cent to $22.32.Technology shares suffered after some companies warned the markets of the potential for worse-than- expected results. The S&P 500 information technology index fell 0.6 per cent.Adobe led the fallers, slumping 19 per cent to $26.67 after the maker of Photoshop said fourth-
quarter revenue would miss analyst estimates. It said revenue would be between $950m and $1bn, lower than the average projection of $1.03bn.PMC Sierra, the chipmaker, also lowered its sales forecast, saying it expected a maximum of $163m compared with the consensus projection of $173.5m. Its shares fell back 6 per cent to $7.32.Ebay slid 1.6 per cent to $24.34. The group said the president of its main marketplaces unit was leaving the company for personal reasons. The owner of the online auction site failed to comfort investors by saying its third-quarter results would come in near the high end of its projections.Elsewhere in technology, the news was more positive. Microsoft announced it was raising its quarterly dividend by 23 per cent to 16 cents a share, the first rise in two years.The company announced last week that it planned to issue debt to fund dividends and share buy-backs. But the shares slipped by 2.2 per cent to $24.61 as some analysts had expected a larger rise.The New York Times fell after warning that sales were lower than expected. Shares in the newspaper owner slid 6.5 per cent to $7.45.CarMax, the biggest US used-car dealer, beat expectations in its second quarter as revenue rose. It rose 8.5 per cent to $26.16."

The group announced its 10th straight quarterly loss in the second quarter after struggling to keep up with its competitors in the smartphone market. Its shares plunged 13.2 per cent to $10.17.The stronger dollar had pushed stocks into the red before midday but a final flurry of optimism in the last 30 minutes of trading pushed the S&P 500 up 0.6 per cent to 1,102.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,328.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.5 per cent higher at 2,211.69.Volumes also hit an all-time high at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, largely because the session marked the expiration of December options and futures: a convergence known as quadruple witching. The NYSE said many investors were also settling their positions before the holiday period. “A number of positive earnings reports last night, particularly out of the technology sector, appear to be giving sentiment a boost today,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.However, he said indices did not seem ready to break above resistance levels. “With news flow generally expected to drop off dramatically for the next two holiday-shortened weeks, it appears that indices may remain trapped in their current trading channels for some time.”Over the week, the S&P was down 0.4 per cent, the Dow had lost 1.4 per cent but the Nasdaq was 1 per cent higher.Some of the biggest losses came from the financial sector after Citigroup announced plans to pay back government bail-out funds through a stock offering. However, the group ended up selling $17bn of shares at such a low price that the US government was forced to delay the partial sale of its stake.Also weighing on Citi stock this week was Terra Firma, the private equity group, which sued the bank for billions in damages, accusing it of misrepresentation during its disastrous 2007 acquisition of EMI.And Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, filed an arbitration claim against Citi, seeking damages in excess of $4bn. Over the week, Citigroup shares fell 15.2 per cent to $3.35.Stocks suffered further after the Federal Reserve highlighted on Wednesday its intention to shut down some of its liquidity facilities as the economy improves. Some analysts said the market had already begun to price in next year’s expected rate hike.While the consumer staples sector weighed on the market in early trading on Friday, a series of upbeat announcements helped lift investor confidence.Nike, the world’s largest athletic shoe maker, forecast a return to revenue growth in the next quarter, lifting its shares 1.9 per cent to $64.42.CarMax, the country’s largest used car dealer, beat estimates for the third quarter. It rose 7 per cent to $23.35. However, the company said conditions still remained tough and it had no current plans to restart expansion.

The shares rose 4.6 per cent to $50.24.Alcoa gained 2.3 per cent to $14.26.The S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent up at 1,071.66 and at its highest level since last October.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 9,829.87 and the Nasdaq Composite crept up 0.4 per cent to 2,146.30.Stocks were also boosted after the US Treasury said its $43 billion auction of new two-year notes had met with strong demand.“The market is not ready to give up yet but there is certainly more of a cautious attitude in anticipation of the FOMC meeting,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon.“We’re seeing the effects of the lower dollar increasing risk appetite in the commodity and equity markets. It’s also a busy week for IPOs, so that should continue to boost investors’ confidence.”Financial stocks led the market higher throughout most of the day as investors bet on encouraging words from the Fed on Wednesday.American International Group was heading for its highest close in a year in early trading after a government watchdog group said the insurer showed signs of stabilising. However, a late sell-off brought the shares down 5.4 per cent to close at $45.80.Citigroup rose 5 per cent to $4.65 after Singapore’s largest sovereign wealth fund halved its stake in the bank to cash in on the stock’s recent rally.Bank of America also gained 2.1 per cent to $17.61 and JPMorgan was up 4.3 per cent to $46.47.But Fifth Street Finance, which invests in small and mid-sized companies, lost 1.3 per cent to $11.02 after the company launched a public offering of 4m shares late on Monday.Following Dell’s announcement on Monday it was buying Perot Systems, its shares fell further on Tuesday.Credit Suisse downgraded the computer maker to “neutral” and recommended Hewlett-Packard and Apple. The brokerage said it had concerns that Dell’s acquisition strategy was too risky.Dell shares fell 1.8 per cent to $15.73 while HP rose 1.4 per cent to $47.01 and Apple shares gained 0.3 per cent to $184.48.Ford rose 2.6 per cent to $7.01 after Reuters reported that the group was planning to build its third manufacturing plant in China, where sales could soon outpace its existing capacity.Carmax, the used car retailer, climbed 9.7 per cent to $21.20 after the group said net income in the second quarter had risen to $103 from $14 in the previous quarter.After reporting second-quarter profit above analyst estimates, FreightCar America, the maker of railway freight carriages, rallied 17.4 per cent to $23.93.AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 6.5 percent to $8.44 after it announced plans to offer 30m shares of its common stock and $250m in convertible debt.Its shares soared more than 20 per cent last week after the group said it had raised $2.9bn in cash and loans in order to increase its number of flights from Chicago, New York, Dallas and Miami.Congara Foods, which supplies potato products to restaurants, dropped 1.5 per cent to $22 in spite of better-than-expected results for the first quarter.Macy’s gained 5.5 per cent to $18.77 after Citigroup upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”, saying that it believed that the department store would be able to increase margins.
14;KMX;Carmax Inc;2008-11-06T20:38:47Z;US car dealers;;A car dealer or two used to be found in almost any American town worth its salt, coloured banners and garish neon signs announcing its presence. Lately, though, they seem like an endangered species amid the lowest auto sales in a quarter of a century. Given that the sector makes up 18 per cent of all retail activity by value and employs more than 1m people, this is no small matter.There were about 47,000 dealerships in 1945, when there were far fewer cars on the road or people to drive them. Many brands such as Studebaker, DeSoto and Oldsmobile have since vanished and Dodge and others may not be long for this world. By the beginning of 2008, the National Automobile Dealers Association reported that the number had fallen to 20,770 and about 500 of those have since gone. Retail sales were down 31 per cent last quarter on a year ago. Add in tight credit and stingy inventory financing and it is clear why dealers are dropping like flies.The sector’s demise is being mischaracterised, though. Dealer attrition is not all that different from the replacement of mom and pop retailers with more efficient big box stores such as Wal-Mart. A quarter-century ago there were more than 10,000 dealers that sold fewer than 150 cars a year and a third as many that sold more than 750. Since then the number of small dealers has fallen by two-thirds and the number of mega-dealers has doubled.Big players are hurting too, of course. AutoNation, America’s top seller with 245 dealerships, reported a quarterly loss of $1.41bn on Thursday after a 21 per cent drop in revenue. CarMax, a pure used car dealer that has eschewed the franchise model, also had a big drop in sales and earnings. Unlike small fry, though, both have the wherewithal to survive and take advantage of the shakeout, even if auto sales take a decade to return to their housing bubble peak.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
15;KMX;Carmax Inc;2006-12-20T21:54:13Z;Wall Street lower amid investor caution;;US stocks settled a touch lower on Wednesday, as cautious investors clipped an early broad advance.Stocks opened firmer, after the latest M&A news that Ericsson planned to buy Redback Networks for $2.1bn. The data network vendor’s shares surged 21.2 per cent to $25.66.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the major stock indices earlier in the day, but had surrenedered gains to close 0.1 per cent, or 1.94 points, lower at 2,427.61.The Nasdaq remained adrift of this year’s peak of 2,468.42, established in late November and is now down 0.2 per cent this month. It has lagged the S&P 500’s 1.6 per cent rise and the 2 per cent gain made by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and this underperformance has raised a red flag among some analysts.“Nasdaq stagnation is a growing concern,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader. He noted that the index “topped out ahead of the Dow and S&P back in May [when world markets suffered a severe correction], but until there is some significant sign of weakness, I’m going to keep this concern on the back burner”.The S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent, or 2.02 points, lower at 1,423.53. Lending strength to the index at the close were the financials and industrials sectors after the telecom and information technology groups led gains earlier in the day. Energy remained the weakest sector yesterday.The Dow settled 0.1 per cent, or 0.06 points, lower at 12,463.87, and had pulled back from a new intra-day high of 12,498.47.Limiting losses in the Dow was Hewlett-Packard, up 2.3 per cent to $41.34, its highest level since 2000. HP shares were boosted when Banc of America Securities affirmed its “buy” rating.Meanwhile, General Electric was 0.4 per cent better at $38.15, down from a new 52-week high of $38.49, when JP Morgan Securities added the conglomerate to its “recommended portfolio”.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average languished. It is now down over 6 per cent from a peak of 4,891.05 made last month – another worrying sign that the market is narrowing, according to analysts.The Dow Transports, regarded as a barometer of the economy, was buffeted when FedEx lowered its guidance for the fiscal third quarter after a 9 per cent rise in fiscal second quarter earnings. Shares in the delivery shipping company slid 1.9 per cent to $111.85.Shares in CarMax rose 8.5 per cent to $52.77, after the seller of used cars reported third quarter net income of 42 cents a share, easily beating estimates of 25 cents.Shareholders in NYSE Group approved the $14.3bn purchase of Euronext, creating the first transatlantic equity and derivative exchange.Shares in NYSE were 1.1 per cent lower at $102.19, but have still more than doubled since June.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent or 72.44 points at 10,942.11.Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, believes investors are preferring to watch and wait. “A lot of investors, both retail and institutional, are waiting to see how things shape up over the next few days,” he said.“It’s one of those …markets where things are on sale, but cheap can always get cheaper.”Ashland, the chemicals and construction group, rose 4.7 per cent to $64.64 after the Irish construction company CRH said it was in talks to buy its asphalt and construction units.Consumer products group Alberto-Culver climbed 2 per cent to $47.61 after it announced it would spin off Sally Beauty Company, its supplies business.Carmax, the used-car retailer, jumped 7.6 per cent to $33.89 after it reported quarterly earnings ahead of analyst expectations.A brokerage upgrade sent Monster Worldwide 4.5 per cent higher to $43.02.

17;KMX;Carmax Inc;2006-03-03T21:04:15Z;Arne Alsin: Dull ideas can go a long way;;Investors are quick to bid up the prices of companies with exciting, breakthrough products or services. Any new invention or paradigm-altering technology generates a wave of enthusiasm from investors – and usually a rich valuation that reflects the potential good news.Until the Nasdaq peaked above 5,000 in March 2000, investors were wildly aggressive in bidding up the prices of technology and internet companies. A similar level of enthusiasm exists today in the rich market valuations given to stocks such as XM Satellite (XMSR) and Sirius Satellite (SIRI), whose technology is changing the way radio entertainment is distributedWhile the crowd is attracted to breakthrough companies with extraordinary products, companies with simple, unexciting products can get overlooked. For example, if you bought shares of Starbucks (is there a simpler product than coffee?) at the peak of tech enthusiasm in March 2000, your shares would be up more than four-fold today, against a Nasdaq decline of more than 50 per cent for the same period.If you bought shares of Whole Foods Market (WFMI), a natural foods grocer, at the Nasdaq peak in March 2000, you would be up more than six-fold. I recommended companies such as Office Depot (ODP) and JC Penney (JCP) in published writing in December 2000. They are each up more than five-fold.Here are three companies that offer simple products (I hold shares in all of them) that are currently overlooked.CarMax (KMX) Growing at 18-20 per cent per year, this business is the top US retailer of a very simple product: used cars. The CarMax customer experience is a dramatic departure from the customer experience at traditional used car dealers. CarMax sells late-model used cars at no-haggle prices, with no-haggle cash offers for trade-ins. The CarMax sales process is transparent, using none of the sales tricks and upsells that are notorious at traditional used-car dealers.Buying CarMax stock is similar to buying Home Depot stock in the early 1980s. The addressable used-car market in the US is the same size as the home improvement market (about $300bn) and it is highly fragmented, again like the home improvement retail space in the 1980s. Sales at CarMax will exceed $6bn in the fiscal year ending this month, an increase of more than 50 per cent in the last three years. By my calculations sales will grow to in excess of $13bn by 2010 and CarMax stock, currently quoted at $31, will be worth $86 by 2010.Commerce Bank (CBH) While this company has a simple product, everything else about the company is flat-out impressive. The long-term track record of Commerce cannot be matched by any other US bank. It has increased deposits at a 30 per cent annualised rate over the last 10 years through unparalleled service and attention to the customer. For example, it is open seven days a week for extended hours, and has no-fee credit cards.While the flat yield curve has depressed the bank’s earnings for the last few quarters, investors should regard this as an aberration. A return to a more typical yield curve will result in huge earnings gains for Commerce because of its large asset base.Using conservative assumptions regarding interest rates, my calculations indicate a value for Commerce stock of $97 in 2010, up from the current quote of $34. This assumes deposits grow by 25 per cent a year, a reasonable expectation given their plan for branch expansion.Overstock.com (OSTK) This is an online retailer with a very simple product. It is the online equivalent of an outlet store. It sells excess inventory for many of the world’s premier name brands. Overstock is currently overlooked because it is aggressively grabbing market share at the expense of earnings – a smart strategy. Revenue grew 60 per cent last year and will exceed $1bn annually by next year.It could grow less quickly but the first-mover advantage in this space is critical. This is a winner-take-all category. As with Ebay in the online auction market, once a company dominates the excess inventory space (as Overstock is doing), the contest is effectively over. Both buyers and sellers of excess inventory naturally migrate to the company with the most girth. That company will have the largest and broadest selection of products (making buyers happy), and will be able to move the most products at the quickest rate (making manufacturers happy).While its operating metrics are similar to Amazon’s, Overstock’s market position and earnings power are not reflected in the stock quote. My calculations indicate that this $23 stock will reach $92 by 2010.
