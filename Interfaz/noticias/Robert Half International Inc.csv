0;RHI;Robert Half International Inc;2013-09-22T16:14:57Z;How to cope with a mis-sold job;;"You have started a new job but it does not seem to be what you talked about in the interviews. What can you do about it – and do you have any recourse?Prevention is better than a cure“When you’re being interviewed, always treat the interview as a 50-50 thing,” says Andy Dallas, a director at Robert Half International, recruitment consultants. “Ask what you can expect to be doing in your first week, month and three months. Ask what a successful year looks like.”Sandra Cunningham, an executive coach at Outside In, says that many people fail to do their due diligence on new jobs: “Often people are just as liable as the company. They go in with an unrealistic sense of optimism and they don’t use their networks or speak to people who work for the company.”Having taken these steps, you will be in a stronger position if the job is not as you expected.Where should I start?The first thing is to wait. “You need to give it at least a month to bed down,” says Mr Dallas.Then think about what went wrong and what might have happened. There are numerous possibilities, says Richard Maun, author of Job Hunting 3.0: “Sometimes it’s straightforward and there’s a paper trail, but usually it’s something fuzzy that is a matter of subjective interpretation.”Alternatively, it may be out of the company’s hands. “You might get hired on Monday and the business might get taken over on Tuesday or a bank could pull financing or your boss could leave,” he says. Mr Maun adds that employers often unwittingly mis-sell their own expectations: “They might tell you they really want to change the business and then discover they’re terrified of change or that senior management doesn’t want it.”How do I discuss it with my boss?Once you have the facts, approach your line manager. “You might say, ‘This isn’t what we discussed at interview’,” says Mr Maun. “Corporate inertia means that sometimes this is all it takes. Or the boss might respond by saying, ‘Give it another six months.’” This is OK too, Mr Maun says. “It allows you to
re-contract, state your frustrations, say what you want and agree a timeframe for things to change.”What if it is not going to change?Very few misdescribed jobs are all bad and you need to look at the situation as part of your overall career. “Ask yourself if there’s an opportunity to make more of this than might be apparent at first,” says Ms Cunningham. “Can you switch around once you’re established and have proved your value?”However, if the job is never going to be something that gives you what you want, says Mr Maun, you have to make a decision. “Plenty of people will stay in a job for 20 years moaning their lives away, but you always have options. And if the job is wrong you should be looking elsewhere. As long as you’ve given it your best shot, there shouldn’t be any bad blood.”The writer is author of ‘The Careerist: Over 100 ways to get ahead at work’"
1;RHI;Robert Half International Inc;2011-08-04T22:14:17Z;Test of endurance is the new golf;;It is a hot, cloudless Sunday morning in London’s Docklands, near the business hub of Canary Wharf. Some 14,000 people are getting ready for a 1,500 metre swim in the far from sanitary Thames, followed by a 40km bike ride and a 10km run as part of the Virgin Active London Triathlon.Among them, 37-year-old Neil Owen, director of London operations for financial recruitment group Robert Half International, is preparing to run in the 12.50pm “wave” (start time) alongside his colleagues. “There are events now specifically aimed at the City,” he says. “[Another triathlon] had a City wave as the last wave of the day so those working could make the 7.30-8pm start.”Indeed, given the growing number of financial and business executives taking up the challenge, one could be forgiven for thinking the triathlon is threatening to replace golf as the executive sport of choice.“The mental skills needed to succeed in business are very similar to the mental skills needed to get through a triathlon,” explains Richard Allen, a former professional triathlete who, through Triathlon 4 Business, coaches executives. “Triathlon is the ultimate all-round sporting challenge and these kind of people need challenges to stay fulfilled in their life.”Looking surprisingly fresh for a man who’s just completed the 6.50am wave, 43-year-old Panos Kakoullis, UK audit leader at professional services firm Deloitte, notes that there are even events specifically for CEOs, such as the Ironman Arizona CEO challenge. “You pay a little bit more, go to a nice hotel, elite athletes give you coaching, your wives get VIP access,” he explains. But, he adds, “no one runs it for you”.The Ironman is the ultimate triathlon discipline: comprising a 3.8km swim, 180km cycle followed by a marathon (42.2km). Another high-profile executive who has completed more than three Ironman triathlons is Jason Gatenby, CEO of Montagu, HSBC’s former buy-out division. Gary Lubner, CEO of Belron International, the windscreen repair and replacement company, has completed 10 triathlons at Olympic distance. About 1,000 of his company’s 25,000 employees took part in the London Triathlon.Such an extreme endurance sport seems a little, well, extreme. Mr Kakoullis explains its appeal as a counterbalance to work: “It gives a lot more discipline and structure to what you do day-to-day, making you work more efficiently.”Richard Batten, the 57-year-old UK executive chairman of property company Jones Lang LaSalle, competes in triathlons worldwide in the 55-60 age group. Five years ago, he established a property industry triathlon, which this year saw 2,300 people compete – making it the fifth-largest triathlon in the UK.“I liken it to a cocktail party for the property industry fuelled on adrenalin rather than alcohol,” he says. “Even if age is not on your side you can still do it. You’ve got to give up rugby or football at some stage, but age doesn’t reduce your stamina in the same way as it does your speed.”After examining all the kit involved as executives clad in expensive neoprene sit astride the latest in carbon fibre bike, one wonders if there is a tiny element of geeks-with-gadgets to it all.“It’s not tiny at all, it’s huge,” laughs Andrew Buchanan, a 44-year-old recruiter at Robert Half International. “Just walk through the event and you’ll see grown men lovingly touching bikes. A good bike will start at £2,000 [$3,265].”Even Mr Batten, a veteran of some 50 triathlons, admits he is not immune: “Everything can be compared, from running shoes to shades . . . It can get very techy.”Mr Batten sat out the London Triathlon to take part in London’s Hyde Park Triathlon this weekend. It will again attract a multitude of business people – GE Capital alone is putting 45 teams of employees into the relay. The event is also the first trial for what will be the course in next year’s Olympic Games. Mr Batten likens it to “a golfer playing at Sandwich before the Open Championship”.
2;RHI;Robert Half International Inc;2010-12-01T16:44:40Z;‘It would be negligent to deny recruiters a loud voice’;;"Phil Sheridan is UK managing director of Robert Half

What did you do before recruiting?I trained as a chartered accountant but quickly learned it was not right for me. So I wanted to take that experience and pursue a career where I could help individuals find meaningful employment as well as assist companies in growing.
How did you get your job?I have worked for Robert Half International for 15 years, starting as a consultant placing candidates and have worked my way through the organisation. I have worked for great leaders, with great peers and have had fantastically talented people working for me. In any organisation, upward career mobility is about trust – trusting technical abilities, trusting judgment, trusting instincts and trusting ethics and morals. I’ve learned that being trustworthy on all counts will result in career success.
Do you specialise?As UK managing director, I am responsible for establishing strategy while ensuring we have a talented team in place to execute our vision. With the economy and job market constantly changing, the recruitment industry must always stay abreast of current developments.This can be challenging, yet also very exciting. Identifying high-potential people at all levels in our organisation and working with them as they develop and grow is immensely satisfying.
How loud a voice should the recruitment sector have?The recruitment sector has unique insight into what makes a great workplace and also what issues can detract from a productive and efficient organisation. Not offering our sector a loud voice would be irresponsible and negligent.

How do you view social media?Social media is changing the way the world does business across marketing, sales and business development, operations and recruitment. It facilitates the sharing of information and allows communities to interact with one another. Like many specialised service providers, the recruitment industry provides superior service, knowledge and expertise that often does not exist in-house. In addition, many of our clients are focusing on maximising growth opportunities for their business and do not have the time or resources to search social media sites for potential candidates. Recruitment consultancies are therefore able to help hiring managers in their time management by sourcing and interviewing candidates and presenting a shortlist of the best potential matches.

Your best piece of advice?Do a job that you love doing – there will always be a better chance that you will become very good at it. Surround yourself with people who want to do the job – managing them will be so much more productive. Success can come fast but it is always hard-earned. Be prepared to work hard and make sacrifices."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to close at 10,447.93, 2.9 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1.5 per cent higher at 2,233.75, rising 3.7 per cent over the five days.All of the 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were up, adding to a two-day rally that began after positive manufacturing data were released on Wednesday.The August non-farm payroll report showed the number of people employed fell less than expected. Payrolls were down 54,000 even as temporary census jobs fell by 114,000. Economists had forecast a drop of almost double, at 105,000.Private employment, viewed as a better gauge of the health of the labour market, climbed 67,000. But the unemployment rate rose from 9.5 per cent last month to 9.6 per cent.Payrolls from June and July were revised to show that 123,000 fewer jobs were lost than previously reported.But shares came down slightly from their highs after a report showed non-manufacturing activity in the US grew more slowly than expected. The ISM index fell to 51.5, compared with forecasts of 53.5.Michael Yoshikami, president and chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors said the payrolls report also showed the service sector is still suffering.“I think the softness is obviously in the service sector and I think that really does suggest that as the US is so much of a service economy, we’re going to have a high unemployment rate for a long time,” he said. “The positive surprise is that things aren’t getting worse.”He added that a rise in temporary workers showed a structural shift in how companies were prepared to hire.Shares in providers of temporary employees rose, with Robert Half International climbing 4.5 per cent to $24.03 and Kelly Services increasing by 9 per cent to $12.46.Monster Worldwide, the online recruitment service, soared 7 per cent to $12.33 on the back of hopes more people will be using its website to successfully find jobs.Financials and industrials stocks rose on hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 financials index, the sector that suffered the most in August, climbed 2.2 per cent.Goldman Sachs soared 5.4 per cent to $147.29, Morgan Stanleyclimbed 3.8 per cent to $26.66 and JPMorgan Chase rose 2.7 per cent to $39.17.Industrials rose 1.4 per cent with Caterpillar adding 2.3 per cent to $70.08 and Honeywell gaining 1.9 per cent to $42.82.Technology stocks also advanced 1.7 per cent, with Cisco, which has made two acquisitions in the past week, putting on 2.5 per cent at $21.94.Google rose 1.5 per cent to $470.30 after it was reported that it intends to create a music download service that would compete with Apple’s iTunes software. Shares in Apple also gained, rising 2.6 per cent to $258.77.Meanwhile there were some bright spots for corporate outlooks. US Airways surged 3.3 per cent to $9.97 after the airline said its passenger revenue per seat mile increased by about 15 per cent.But earnings news was more mixed as Campbell Soup Co became the latest company to beat earnings expectations because of cost-cutting but miss revenue estimates. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $36.21.In contrast, H&R Block, the US tax arranger, reported a first quarter net loss from continuing operations of 36 cents per share which was less than the 41 cents which analysts had expected. Its shares surged 5.8 per cent to $13.30.

ExxonMobil rose 1.8 per cent to $66.61, and Valero added 4 per cent to $50.10.The mining sector had some rare losers, depressed by falling copper prices.

5;RHI;Robert Half International Inc;2006-09-29T12:39:20Z;Dow and S&P 500 hit multi-year highs;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its highest level in six years on Thursday afternoon but edged off the peak to finish just short of its all-time closing high.

On Wednesday regulators in both Europe and the US agreed the proposed merger of NYSE and the Euronext exchange would not require any additional regulation.Makers of telecommunications equipment came under pressure.

It briefly pushed up to 11,728.46 in late afternoon trade – its second-highest intra-day peak ever – before pulling back. The blue chip index is still about 40 points below its record intra-day high.The S&P 500 was also up 0.2 per cent, or 2.56 points, at 1,339.15 - a fresh five-year high, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent or 6.63 points, at 2,270.02.“The Dow is nothing but a flirt,” said Ken Tower, chief market strategist at Cybertrader. “It’s enjoying the attention and prolonging the mystery.”He said the Dow was likely to reach a new high in the next few weeks but this was not necessarily a good thing. “[Reaching a new record] is a terrific milestone but it should remind people that we’re a long way into a bull market and that we’re closer to the end of the market than the beginning.”Revised data showed that gross domestic product increased 2.6 per cent in the second quarter, less than the 2.9 per cent analysts had forecast.However, stocks sensitive to slowing economic growth shrugged off the data. Recruitment group Robert Half International added 5.1 per cent to $34.39, while Monster gained 2.9 per cent to $36.29.General Motors added 2.4 per cent to $33.06 after Kirk Kerkorian, whose Tracinda investment group owns 10 per cent of GM’s stock, expressed interest in buying an additional 12m shares in the carmaker.Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia fell after ThinkEquity lowered its rating on both stocks from “buy” to “sell”, citing slow integration of their products by PC maker Dell.

6;RHI;Robert Half International Inc;2006-08-25T20:57:57Z;Wall Street lower on slowdown fears;;Wall Street finished the week lower on Friday as oil prices ticked higher again and sentiment remained depressed by weak economic data.Crude prices continued to climb during the week as diplomatic uncertainty continued surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme.Markets were also put on edge by fears of a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, which might threaten supply from offshore oil rigs. ExxonMobil rose to an all-time high, adding 1.9 per cent to $70.43, and Marathon Oil gained 5.6 per cent to $92.13.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent for the day, down 20.41 points at 11,284.05, a loss of 0.9 per cent for the week.July sales of both new and existing homes fell more than analysts had expected, reinforcing the picture of a slowdown in housing and putting equity markets on edge. Durable goods orders in the month also fell more than forecast, adding to gloom over prospects for economic growth.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said the market had made the switch from welcoming poor economic news – because it lessened the chance of rate hikes – to fearing such news because it heralded a slowdown.“We’ve gotten to the inflexion point where bad news is back to being bad news,” he said.The home sales fall was felt acutely by home improvement retailer Lowe’s, which tumbled after it reported second-quarter profits that fell short of expectations, and lowered its full-year sales guidance. Its shares dropped 9.4 per cent to $26.75, its worst week in more than three years.KB Home fell after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal probe into its stock options practices. It closed the week down 7.8 per cent at $40.94.Unsettling news in the housing sector prompted fears of an attendant slowdown in consumer spending. Electronic retailers Circuit City and Best Buy both sank, losing 12.2 per cent to $22.50 and 7 per cent to $45.57 respectively.Online auction site Ebay tumbled 7.2 per cent to $25.30, depressed further by a brokerage downgrade from Piper Jaffray. It is down over 40 per cent this year.Even discount retailer Dollar General suffered, losing 12.8 per cent to $12.28 after it lowered guidance for the coming quarter, blaming slow back-to-school sales.Mr Hogan said oil prices were finally beginning to take their toll on the consumer. “This is the first time we’re seeing a pullback in consumer prices because of higher energy prices.”The slump in durable goods orders depressed heavy industry stocks. Boeing was the heaviest drag on the Dow, slumping 4.8 per cent to $73.93. Caterpillar, maker of earth-moving and construction equipment, dropped 3.4 per cent to $65.99.The prospect of cooling economic growth also made investors nervous about the outlook for recruitment. Monster Worldwide lost 6.8 per cent to $40.07 and Robert Half International shed 7 per cent to $30.49.The S&P Human Resources index dropped 7.2 per cent during the week. It has fallen 32 per cent since May.Sandisk rose 6.3 per cent to a 10-week high of $54.61 after it was upgraded from “above average” to “buy” by Caris & Co. Earlier this week, the maker of flash-memory products introduced a new digital music player to compete with Apple’s iPod Nano.Forestry products group Weyerhaeuser leapt 4.7 per cent to $60.69 on the week after Deutsche Bank said the group was open to potential buyout bids and restructuring pressures. Shares were also boosted by news that the company would merge its fine paper unit with Canadian paper maker Domtar in a deal worth $3.3bn.A report on sales of computer servers showed that Sun Microsystems was the only company to increase share in the worldwide server business during the second quarter. The news pushed Sun up 3.6 per cent to $4.85. It has risen more than 27 per cent in the past month.
