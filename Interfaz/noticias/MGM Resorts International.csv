0;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-02-12T22:08:39Z;MGM Resorts scraps earnings guidance, CEO to step down;Industry veteran Jim Murren to also leave his role as chairman of the casino group;MGM Resorts scrapped its earnings guidance for 2020 on account of fallout from the coronavirus outbreak and also announced that chief executive Jim Murren will step down before his contract ends, ending his reign of more than a decade leading the hotel and casino group.Mr Murren also plans to resign from his position as chairman, the company revealed on Wednesday afternoon, and will continue to serve in both roles until a successor is appointed.The leadership change comes at an uncertain period for the hospitality industry. In the past couple of weeks, the sector has begun grappling with the spread, from China, of coronavirus, which has dented tourism in Asia and around the world.Casinos in Macau, the only place in Greater China where they are legal, have been closed since the government imposed a two-week shutdown on February 4 to limit the spread of the disease. Gross gaming revenues in the former Portuguese colony were about $36.5bn in 2019, a little more than three times the $12bn registered in the US state of Nevada, where Las Vegas is located.In its fourth-quarter earnings report published on Wednesday, MGM scrapped its 2020 guidance, citing “increased volatility in our business due to coronavirus as well as the market-wide weakness in Far East baccarat in Las Vegas”.Wynn Resorts said last week its baccarat volumes fell 30 per cent year-over-year in 2019.On an earnings call with analysts, Mr Murren said MGM remains confident the coronavirus outbreak will not have a long-term impact on its business. With casinos in Macau temporarily closed, MGM is incurring about $1.5m of operating expenses per day across both of its properties in the city.MGM reported fourth-quarter net income of $2bn, which included a $2.7bn gain related to the sale of Bellagio real estate, versus a loss of $23m in the same period a year earlier.Revenue rose 4 per cent to $3.2bn, matching analysts’ forecast. Adjusted earnings swung to a profit of 8 cents a share from a prior-year loss of 3 cents. Analysts were looking for adjusted earnings of 26 cents a share.Shares in MGM, which rose as much as 7 per cent in after-hours trading, were recently down 2.9 per cent.MGM said its board has formed an independent committee to run a search process for a new chief executive. The committee is working with a search firm to identify candidates.“We have a solid leadership team in place, and I am confident that they will work with my successor to continue the company’s trajectory of growth and expansion,” Mr Murren said in a statement.Mr Murren first joined MGM in 1998 and became its chairman and chief executive in 2008. During his tenure at its helm, the company pursued an expansion in Asia with the launch of two new properties in Macau, as it sought to diversify its portfolio beyond Las Vegas.In early 2019, MGM announced a plan — dubbed “MGM 2020” — to cut costs and boost annualised adjusted Ebitda by $300m by the end of 2021.MGM said in October it struck two deals, valued at about $5bn, to divest real estate assets in the US casino hub of Las Vegas. It agreed to sell Circus Circus to an affiliate of Treasure Island tycoon Phil Ruffin, while Blackstone led a deal to buy the real estate of the Bellagio and lease it back to MGM. Last month, a joint venture including Blackstone agreed to acquire the real estate assets of the MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay resorts on the Las Vegas Strip.Under Mr Murren, MGM also played a role in bringing professional sports to Las Vegas. The company co-owns T-Mobile Arena, the venue built in 2016 that became home to the National Hockey League’s Golden Knights, and is the owner of the Las Vegas Aces, a Women’s National Basketball Association franchise.Last month, the company reached a deal with the National Football League’s Raiders, who have relocated to Las Vegas from Oakland, to make MGM the team’s gaming sponsor.
1;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-01-14T16:25:12Z;MGM Resorts sells casino property in $2.5bn deal;Blackstone doubles down on Las Vegas real estate bet in joint venture;Blackstone doubled down on its bet on real estate in the US gambling capital on Tuesday, agreeing to partner with an affiliate of casino operator MGM Resorts to buy the flagship MGM Grand property on the Las Ve­gas Strip for $2.5bn.The deal comes just months after the New York-based private equity and real estate group acquired MGM Resorts’ Bellagio Hotel and Casino for $4.25bn, in a bet on the economic future of gaming — and Las Vegas in particular.“This transaction reflects our continuing strong conviction in Las Vegas,” said Jon Gray, president and chief operating officer of Blackstone.Blackstone will become an ever larger landlord in Las Vegas once completing the transaction, which includes a joint venture with MGM Growth Properties, the real estate investment trust spun off from MGM in 2016. MGM Growth Properties will contribute the Mandalay Bay casino property to the joint venture as part of the deal, giving the new enterprise from Blackstone and MGM Growth Properties ownership of nearly 10,000 rooms in Las Vegas.MGM Resorts will continue to operate the properties, which include about 3m sq ft of meeting space and approximately 300,000 sq ft of casino space across 226 acres of land.MGM Growth Properties said it would own 50.1 per cent of the joint venture, with Blackstone’s Real Estate Income Trust controlling the remaining 49.9 per cent.MGM Resorts has been under pressure from investors to sell its casino assets. When it agreed to sell the Bellagio Hotel to Blackstone in October, it also agreed to sell Circus Circus to Phil Ruffin, a business partner of US president Donald Trump. Combined with the previously announced transactions, MGM Resorts said it stood to net about $8.2bn from the sales of its casino assets.MGM Resorts will pay an initial rent of $292m a year to the Blackstone-MGM Growth joint venture to operate the two properties in Las Vegas.Shares in MGM Resorts fell 0.5 per cent in early trading on Tuesday to $33.21, while Blackstone and MGM Growth Properties stock both climbed less than 1 per cent.“These announcements represent a key milestone in executing the company’s previously communicated asset-light strategy, one that enables a best-in-class balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation to provide MGM Resorts with meaningful strategic flexibility to create continued value for our shareholders,” said Jim Murren, chairman and chief executive of MGM Resorts.The transactions comes less than a year after MGM agreed to pay $800m to survivors and the families of victims killed in a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest ever on American soil.
2;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2019-10-16T00:33:06Z;MGM Resorts divests $5bn in Las Vegas real estate;Company strikes deals with Blackstone and business partner of Donald Trump;MGM Resorts has divested real estate assets worth $5bn, striking two deals that will see iconic Las Vegas properties pass to the Blackstone Group and to Donald Trump’s business partner in the gambling capital.At the north end of the Strip, Circus Circus is to be sold for $825m to an affiliate of Treasure Island tycoon Phil Ruffin, who joined with Mr Trump to develop the Trump International, a non-casino hotel and condominium in Las Vegas.Meanwhile, Stephen Schwarzman’s Blackstone Group is leading a $4.25bn deal to acquire real estate assets of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, and lease them back to MGM for an initial rent of $245m a year. MGM will receive 5 per cent of the equity in the real estate joint venture. “As big believers in MGM Resorts and Las Vegas, we are thrilled to partner with MGM to acquire the Bellagio,” said Jon Gray, Blackstone’s president and chief operating officer.Mr Ruffin said his relationship with MGM “goes back to my friendship with Kirk Kerkorian”, the billionaire who in 1969 built The International as Las Vegas’s largest hotel. He later went on to buy a film studio and to create, in the MGM Grand, the Las Vegas mega-resort that is the centrepiece of the modern group.Earlier this month, MGM agreed to pay up to $800m to settle with survivors and family of victims killed in a 2017 mass shooting that was the deadliest on US soil. Stephen Paddock killed 58 people and injured more than 500 when he opened fire on revellers at an outdoor concert from the 32nd floor of MGM’s Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.The company announced a review of its real estate portfolio in January. Jim Murren, its chief executive, said the sales would help MGM “build a fortress balance sheet” while returning cash to shareholders. After accounting for transaction costs, the company expects to receive cash proceeds of $4.3bn from the two transactions.The resorts group tapped PJT Partners and JPMorgan to assist with the sale of the Bellagio to Blackstone, while Morgan Stanley and CBRE advised on the Circus Circus sale.
3;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2019-10-03T17:38:53Z;MGM to pay up to $800m to settle Las Vegas shooting claims;Company resolves litigation stemming from deadliest mass shooting on US soil;MGM Resorts has agreed to a settlement of up to $800m with survivors and family of victims killed in a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, the deadliest ever on American soil.On October 2, 2017 Stephen Paddock shot from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino down into a concert with more than 20,000 revellers, killing 58 people and injuring more than 500.MGM Resorts, which owns the Mandalay Bay Resort, has agreed to pay between $735m to $800m to resolve legal cases against it, depending on the number of claimants who choose to participate in the settlement. It has not admitted any liability.The settlement fund will be paid for by MGM Resorts’ insurers with a minimum of $735m. MGM Resorts has insurance coverage for $751m.“While nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,” said Robert Eglet, a lead lawyer for plaintiffs in the case.He added that the settlement “represents good corporate citizenship on their part”.The process is expected to be completed next year. Under the settlement the parties will dismiss all pending litigation.“Our goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process,” said Jim Murren, chief executive of MGM Resorts.
4;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2019-01-24T15:34:44Z;MGM board to evaluate real estate portfolio;Casino operator will seek ‘opportunities to enhance value’;MGM Resorts International said Thursday its board has formed a committee that will seek to maximise the value of the company’s real estate holdings.The committee will evaluate MGM’s real estate portfolio and “make recommendations to the full-board regarding strategy and opportunities to enhance value,” according to the casino operator.Chairman and chief executive Jim Murren said the board and management “continually explore how best to take advantage of the enormous value we have developed to-date and seek opportunities on behalf of our shareholders.”Shares rallied 2.6 per cent to $28.54 on Thursday morning.Three independent directors will serve on the committee: John Kilroy Jr., Keith Meister and Paul Salem. Mr Kilroy is the chief executive of Kilroy Realty Corp., a real estate investment trust. Mr Salem is the senior managing director emeritus of Providence Equity Partners.MGM Resorts reached a deal last week that gave Mr Meister, the founder of Corvex Management, a seat on its board. The activist hedge fund owns a stake of about 3 per cent in MGM Resorts.The Las Vegas-based company announced a cost-cutting plan in early January that is expected to increase annual profits by $300m by 2021. The “MGM 2020” plan includes savings from payroll reductions, as well as digital investments to drive revenue growth.
5;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2018-09-19T18:17:47Z;Casino stocks rise as hedge funds roll the dice on sector;;Casino stocks climbed higher on Wednesday amid media speculation of growing interest in the sector from activist hedge funds.Investors appeared to have latched on to a late-Tuesday report from the New York Post that Starboard Value, the hedge fund trying to shake things up at cyber security company Symantec and consumer goods company Newell Brands, has taken a “sizeable position” of more than $500m, in MGM Resorts International and was pushing for major changes.However, Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported this morning that Starboard Value does not own shares of MGM and had no economic exposure to the stock, but said that a representative of the fund had declined to comment.HG Vora, another hedge fund, revealed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday it had taken a stake in Caesars Entertainment. The NY Post reported last week, citing sources, that HG Vora would push for changes at the company which operates the Harrah’s and Horseshoe casino brands.HG Vora also holds a stake in MGM, as do other hedge funds including Canyon Capital, Soroban Capital Partners and Eminence Capital.MGM shares were up 3.1 per cent in afernoon trade, while Caesars Entertainment was up 0.7 per cent, Wynn Resorts added 2.6 per cent and Las Vegas Sands rose 0.8 per centShares in all four companies are down by double-digits this year amid investor concerns that revenues from Las Vegas were looking weak. Caesars had said it expected the summer could be soft owing to unusually light business from conventions and a lack of blockbuster events over the period such as the Conor McGregor/Floyd Mayweather boxing match last year.That is on top of concerns that the trade war between the US and China could hurt Chinese consumer spending and shrink revenues in Macau, which is the world’s biggest gambling centre.This story has been updated from an earlier version to reflect the conflicting media reports.
6;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2018-07-30T15:48:43Z;US sports betting/GVC: baby driver;Joint venture could make grown-up profits and bring UK and US groups together;Joint ventures, like kids, need care to turn out well. Worst practice is illustrated by the men in a UK TV dating show who raced their (dummy) babies in buggies when girlfriends were absent. Best practice may turn out to be a JV between GVC and MGM Resorts. Well-nurtured, this could make grown-up profits and bring the UK and US gambling groups together. There is plenty of scope for bad parenting, too.Online US sports betting is the opportunity. Wagering on a match result or even one player’s next pass, is permitted in the UK. The US Supreme Court gave the bulk of US states the green light earlier this year. The market could generate gross gaming revenues of some $9bn, according to Global Market Advisors.The tie-in between MGM Resorts and GVC is the most eye-catching so far. The US casino operator is already well-known, thanks to businesses such as The Bellagio in Las Vegas. GVC’s name is more likely to be met with shrugs.There is no doubt about the ambition of boss Kenneth Alexander. Without takeovers masterminded by the laconic Scot “GVC would be a footnote to the UK gambling industry”, says Peel Hunt. Instead, it is ranked second in a field squeezed by regulation. News of the JV lifted GVC shares 5 per cent, taking their total value to £6.65bn, a whisker behind Paddy Power Betfair.The collaboration will exploit GVC’s technology and UK experience to build a US sports betting business on MGM’s brand and customer data. But is that upside already in GVC’s price?MGM has about a 10th of the US casinos business. Suppose the JV claims the same share of US sports betting. This would generate about $300m in ebitda, half of it for GVC. Convert to sterling and apply a modest 10x multiple and the implicit enterprise value is £1.14bn. That is on a par with the increase in GVC’s market worth since the US reform.Numbers supply fake certainty to investors and gamblers alike. The JV could earn far more if parenting is sound and big US states adopt sports betting smoothly. Investors should await operational progress, in place of good grades, as proof the brat is prospering.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Will US sports betting be as exciting a business as operators hope? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
7;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2018-07-30T06:58:32Z;GVC forges US gambling joint venture with MGM Resorts;UK online betting group’s shares rise on deal to expand in US market;The UK betting group GVC has struck a breakthrough deal with casino group MGM Resorts International to expand in the US in an attempt to take advantage of the long-awaited liberalisation of the American gambling market.The companies are forming a 50:50 joint venture “to create a world-class sports betting and online gaming platform” in the US.Shares in GVC, the owner of Ladbrokes, jumped as much as 7 per cent at the start of trading before trimming some of those gains to stand 5.02 per cent higher at £11.50 — an all-time high.The joint venture follows a landmark US Supreme Court decision earlier this year that paved the way for the legalisation of sports betting across the country.European gambling companies have become global leaders in the sports-betting industry and have been increasing their presence in the US for several years in the hope that the market could open up.GVC and MGM said they hoped the deal would create “meaningful early mover advantages” ahead of the start of the professional American football season — although regulatory approvals are needed for the deal to go ahead.GVC would bring its expertise in online sports betting to the deal and MGM its strong presence in the US gaming market.“It’s two of the superpowers of gaming both sides of the pond getting together,” said GVC chief executive officer Kenny Alexander.The two partners, which will each contribute $100m of assets to the joint venture, have previously collaborated in New Jersey, where GVC supplies technology to MGM’s online casino and poker business.Mr Alexander said the US would become the biggest regulated betting market in the world over the next three to five years.Progress would depend on how quickly each US state updated regulations covering the industry following the Supreme Court decision.The deal “de-risked” GVC’s US strategy by providing it with an “ideal partner”, Ivor Jones, an analyst at Peel Hunt, wrote in a research note.The deal also reduced the chance that the UK company would be forced to spend more money investing across a range of different entry strategies in the US market.“GVC has signed up for a joint venture with one of the largest gambling businesses in the US on an exclusive basis,” he said in the note. “If the joint venture works, then it will de-risk access to the US sports-betting market for both parties.”Jim Murren, chief executive of MGM, said the “historic partnership” would be “positioned to become the instant leader in technology, market access, sports relationships and brands”.The joint venture would have a separate headquarters in the US, overseen by a four-person board of directors comprised equally of representatives of both companies.Isle of Man-based GVC, which recently completed a £4bn merger with UK bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral, already has three state licences in the US. It said it had a number of partnership contracts with US casinos, racecourses and gaming venues, in addition to the technology supply deal with MGM.Rivals, such as William Hill, entered the US market in 2011, acquiring three sports-betting businesses to gain market share in the Nevada sports-betting industry, while Paddy Power Betfair has an online casino in New Jersey, and acquired DRAFT, a US daily fantasy sports site.
8;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
9;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2018-07-03T08:49:14Z;Chips down for casino operators as Macau revenue disappoints;Hong Kong-listed shares slump despite 12.5% June growth in world’s largest gambling hub;Shares in Macau casino operators tumbled on Tuesday in Hong Kong, mirroring declines by their US counterparts in New York, as investors reacted to data showing slower-than-expected monthly revenue growth in the world’s largest gambling centre.Revenue from so-called games of fortune in the Chinese enclave — the only part of the country where casinos are legal — grew 12.5 per cent to 22.49bn patacas ($2.78bn) in June, according to official data, missing analysts’ expectations for growth of 18 per cent.It was the 23rd straight monthly increase for Macau gaming revenue, continuing a recovery following a downturn spurred by Beijing’s corruption crackdown under President Xi Jinping. The anti-graft campaign, combined with some broader weakness in the Chinese economy, weighed heavily on activity in the former Portuguese colony between 2014 and 2016.Accumulated gross revenue for the first six months of 2018 was up 18.9 per cent, at $18.6bn, compared with the previous corresponding period.In Hong Kong, where markets were shut on Monday for a public holiday, shares in Galaxy Entertainment fell 6.5 per cent while Melco International shed 9.7 per cent, Sands China slid 6.2 per cent and Wynn Macau lost 7.9 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed down 1.4 per cent.In New York trading on Monday, Wynn Resorts dropped 8.6 per cent while US-listed ADRs for Melco Resorts fell 11.4 per cent — the most in nearly 19 months — before closing down 10.6 per cent. MGM Resorts lost 3 per cent.Analysts at Nomura had forecast month-on-month revenue growth in June of about 20 per cent on the belief that the football World Cup and the reported removal last month of mobile payment terminals by UnionPay “have had little (if any) impact on demand so far”. They also had pegged the recent dragon boat festival in Hong Kong and the June 15 opening of Melco’s new Morpheus hotel as potential boosts for revenue.China’s efforts to curb capital flight have led to the imposition of daily withdrawal limits for UnionPay bank cards at ATMs in Macau, among other measures.Commenting on reports of UnionPay mobile payment terminals being withdrawn from casino premises, analysts at Daiwa said in a note dated June 7 that “the market has downplayed the potential implications on the sector as this latest development poses heightened risks on the major liquidity channels in Macau”.Macau also is facing a potential challenge from Japan, which is on the brink of passing regulations that could create the world’s second-largest casino market. Operators including Wynn and Melco are looking to enter Japan, where industry projections have suggested revenue could hit $15bn a year.

MGM Resorts fell 3.1 per cent.Analysts at Nomura had forecast month-on-month revenue growth in June of about 20 per cent on the belief that the World Cup and the reported removal last month of mobile payment terminals by UnionPay “have had little (if any) impact on demand so far”.

Reflecting on reports UnionPay mobile payment terminals being withdrawn from casino premises, analysts at Daiwa said in a note dated June 7 they believed “the market has downplayed the potential implications on the sector as this latest development poses heightened risks on the major liquidity channels in Macau.”
11;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2018-03-28T16:28:33Z;Art Basel Hong Kong’s most Instagram-friendly works;Curated by Alexie Glass-Kantor, the fair’s Encounters section aims for impact with large-scale works;"A slow-moving sushi belt, supersize angel wings made of sickles and brightly coloured stage curtains are just three of the large-scale projects that greet visitors to Art Basel Hong Kong this week. Courtesy of the artists Subodh Gupta (Arario Gallery), duo Isabel and Alfredo Aquilizan (Yavuz Gallery) and Ulla von Brandenburg (Pilar Corrias and Meyer Riegger) respectively, the works are part of the Encounters section, supported by MGM Resorts. This year the section fields just 12 works — but they are some of the most Instagram-ready features of the fair.In charge of the theatricals, for the fourth year, is Alexie Glass-Kantor, the intense and eloquent director of Artspace, a contemporary art institution in Sydney, who chooses and places the works among the booths across the fair’s two huge halls. “It’s a challenge. We get 60 to 80 proposals from the galleries. I like half of the artists to come from this vast Asia-Pacific region, and the works should have some sort of conceptual connection to each other,” Glass-Kantor says. Plus, she adds, “I had 24 hours to get the works in, they mustn’t obstruct sightlines or disrupt business — and they also have to be landmark works.”This year, all the works chosen hang loosely around the themes of what it is to be human, often homing in on the repetitive and banal. The sickles in the Aquilizans’ angel wings highlight the realities of agrarian societies in Asia; Gupta’s sushi belt reflects daily urban life. Another project, by the Taiwanese conceptual artist Chou Yu-Cheng (Edouard Malingue gallery), features larger-than-life crockery and chopsticks: these start the day dirty and paid workers come in to do the dishes. In an excruciating Sisyphean loop, the set starts off dirty again the next day.Glass-Kantor says the messages aren’t necessarily negative. “We live in precarious times, so it’s as much about how to find connections through rituals of social exchange.”Such thought-provoking statements trip frequently from Glass-Kantor’s lips. In a world where “curating” has become an over-used word, she seems willing to reflect on her role, its ethics and social possibilities.“Alexie’s ability to articulate her vision and to explain art to a broad range of audiences is impressive,” says Magnus Renfrew, who brought her on board in 2014, while he was director of the Hong Kong fair. Renfrew first met Glass-Kantor at Melbourne’s Gertrude Contemporary gallery, where she was a director and curator for seven years before heading up Artspace. “I contacted her the very next week,” Renfrew says.One of the peculiarities of art fairs is that even the so-called public works are for sale. Glass-Kantor says that within Asia, such demarcations are even less pronounced than they are elsewhere. “Asia is hashtag ‘it’s complicated’. Every element of cultural production is shape-shifting and accelerating, but there’s a huge amount of passion. We’re all in it together.”The section doesn’t work for everyone. At an Intelligence Squared debate held during the Hong Kong fair last year, Glass-Kantor came in for some lively criticism from art adviser Lisa Schiff. Schiff said, “You put a sculpture show out and I’m supposed to feel something. You know what I feel . . . depressed . . . Because I can’t get context at all from anything.”Glass-Kantor welcomes the feedback. “Not everyone should like everything. It’s fine, [Schiff] was asking who are these artists, dumped in the middle of Art Basel? But I include [lesser-known] artists from Taiwan or Sri Lanka, for example, to make sure we’re not just recycling familiar names. Curating happens in different ways in different contexts. You can still achieve something ambitious,” she says.Participating galleries certainly appreciate her efforts. Tim Neuger, co-founder of Neugerriemschneider, describes Encounters as “an intimate experience of large-scale work”. He is “thrilled” to bring an installation by Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo in which suspended figures made of lightweight polycarbonate are lit from within, producing silhouettes of the people who work in Pardo’s studio. Ossian Ward, head of content at Lisson Gallery, describes Encounters as a “great platform to build on [Ryan Gander’s] presence in Asia”.

Industry projections suggest that revenues in the country could hit $15bn a year, while analysts have put the value at closer to $25bn, assuming multiple resorts open across the country. Industry executives say that even if Mr Abe’s proposal is rejected or downsized, the government’s move to potentially grant a number of licences in the first wave will have a profound effect on the operators positioning themselves to enter the market.“The operators had been expecting to compete in at most two all-or-nothing beauty parades for the first licences, but could now find themselves in a more strategic chase around regional Japan,” said an executive from one Las Vegas-based company, who was confident that casinos would be lucrative both in or outside Japan’s biggest metropolitan centres.If the broader licence plan is approved, the first wave of casino-centric “integrated resorts” could appear in Nagasaki, Tomakomai, on the northern island of Hokkaido, and Fukuoka, as well as the larger metropolises of Osaka, Yokohama and Tokyo. In some cities, particularly Osaka and Tomakomai, areas of land have already been identified: the smooth passage of legislation could see the first casinos opening some time after 2022.The prospect of Japan enacting an “implementation bill” this year to establish the precise rules under which casinos can operate has already intensified promotional and lobbying activities among global operators.Descriptions of imagined resorts have been accompanied by eye-watering investment pledges. Lawrence Ho, the head of Melco Resorts & Entertainment, one of Macau’s biggest casino group, has said he would invest “whatever it takes” and offered to relocate his headquarters to Japan as part of a broader charm offensive to woo authorities.For Mr Abe, whose broader “Abenomics” economic revival programme has lost its former momentum, casinos represent a possible way to stimulate growth in regions suffering an exodus of people and wealth.Standing in the way of this, however, has been Komeito, whose recent efforts to apply the brakes to casino legislation have included arguing that a proposed ¥2,000 entrance fee was too low.One person close to Komeito politicians said: “This is a meeting that will have a lot of moving parts, and a number of issues like tax rates, entrance fees and the physical size of casino floors will be subject to horse-trading.“But probably the biggest haggle is going to be over the number of licences. The LDP is going to come in very aggressively with a proposal for either five or six licences. In the end, I think they will walk away very happy if that is bargained down to three.”

These include a vast bridge linking Macau to Hong Kong’s well-connected airport and an extension of China’s high-speed rail network to near the Macau border.Analysts say that the shift from VIP to mass-market gamblers is a political and financial necessity, after Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a nationwide crackdown on corruption and exuberance that prompted Macau’s gross gaming revenue to slide from a record high of $45bn in 2013 to $33bn last year.“Macau needs to work on reinventing itself as more mature markets like Las Vegas have done,” says James Murren, chief executive of MGM Resorts, which opened its new $3.4bn Macau casino last month. “The Chinese government has been crystal clear and for those who don’t listen it will be to their peril.”The fancy restaurants, theatrical shows and theme-park rides at these resorts are marketing tools for the casinos, which are not allowed to advertise in China, more than profit centres in themselves, say analysts.Non-gaming facilities in Macau produce just 12 per cent of total revenue, according to Morgan Stanley, compared with 65 per cent on the Las Vegas Strip, which hosts hit shows, top sporting events and major conferences.But it is Macau that generates the majority of profits for Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, which is going through a tricky transition period after founder and chief executive Steve Wynn resigned last month after sexual harassment allegations made against him.Last year, Macau accounted for 71 per cent of adjusted earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Wynn Resorts and 53 per cent at Las Vegas Sands.The shift to mass-market customers should help boost Macau profits because casinos make bigger margins from them than the VIPs. Casinos typically give these high-rollers rebates on their gambling losses and share a chunk of profits with junkets, the middlemen who bring in the Chinese VIPs and extend them credit to get around China’s capital controls.Praveen Choudhary, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says that mass-market profit margins are about 40 per cent compared with 10 per cent for the VIPs.The proportion of gaming revenue generated by mass-market gamblers has already risen from 27 per cent in 2011 to 43 per cent last year, according to analysis by debt rating agency Standard & Poor’s, partly as a result of a slump in VIP gambling after the corruption crackdown began.Clifford Kurz, an analyst at S&P, expects this shift to continue as Macau, a former Portuguese colony, continues to benefit from the growth of outbound travel in China.“In the long term, we expect the mass market to be a sustainable driver of gaming revenue growth,” he says.But Macau, which is less than one-tenth of the size of Las Vegas but has a similar population of 600,000 people, still struggles to convince tourists to stay long.Just under half of the 33m tourists who visited Macau last year were day-trippers and the average stay is just 1.2 nights, compared with four nights in Singapore, which has much more to offer beyond its two casino resorts.MGM Resorts’ chief Mr Murren says that while the pace of development in Macau has been “remarkable” — with gaming revenue five times higher than on the Las Vegas Strip — the city still has “a ways to go” if it is to become a broad-based tourism and hospitality destination.“I don’t know that Macau will have the same mix as Vegas any time soon but it can certainly be far greater than the overall mix of revenue that it has today,” he says.Additional reporting by Nicolle Liu
14;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Halliburton shares in demand after upbeat outlook;US oilfield services company is one of many enjoying the rise in commodity prices;Oilfield services group Halliburton was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 after reporting upbeat quarterly results and becoming the latest oil company to report a brightening outlook following the rise in commodity prices over the past six months.Halliburton shares climbed nearly 4 per cent to $54.98 after the company reported earnings per share, excluding one-off items, of 53 cents for the fourth quarter, up from just 4 cents in the year-ago quarter. They also topped the average of analysts’ forecast, which was 46 cents.The company was boosted in particular by a surge in revenues in North America, its largest market. They were up 89 per cent at $3.4bn, while total group revenues worldwide were up 48 per cent at $5.94bn, ahead of expectations.Like several other companies in oil and other industries, however, Halliburton was hit by a non-cash charge from writing down the value of its tax losses following the steep cut in US corporate tax rates passed at the end of last year. The company took an $882m charge for that writedown, while warning that it was still working through its analysis of how the upheaval in the tax system would affect earnings, and “this provisional amount is subject to change”.It also took a $385m charge for writedowns in the value of its business in crisis-hit Venezuela. Including those charges, Halliburton reported a loss per share of 92 cents.Jeff Miller, chief executive, said 2017 had been “a dynamic year for the oil and gas sector that marked another step on the road to recovery for our industry”, and described Halliburton as “well positioned to take advantage of opportunities presented by a growing North America market and improving international outlook”.He said he was “optimistic about what I see in 2018”, with oil and gas prices supporting increasing activity in North America, and encouraging increases in tender activity and “positive discussions” with international customers. His comments follow similarly upbeat statements from competitor Schlumberger last Friday.The advance in Halliburton shares came alongside a broader rise on Wall Street where investors appeared largely unfazed by the US government shutdown. By midday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 2,820.23, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 26,103.42, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent to 7,381.59.Meanwhile, Wynn Resorts was the second-biggest gainer on the S&P 500, with shares rising nearly 5 per cent to $188.28 after it posted upbeat fourth-quarter results.Profits jumped to $491.6m, or $4.77 a share, in the three months ended in December, from $113.8m, or $1.12 a share. That reflected a net tax benefit of $339.9m after the company revalued its US deferred tax assets and liabilities. Adjusting for one-off items, the company reported earnings of $1.40 a share, eclipsing analysts’ forecasts by 3 cents.Net revenues climbed 29 per cent from a year ago to $1.69bn, ahead of expectations, as casino revenues in Macau rose 25.3 per cent from a year ago.Wynn’s results also helped lift rival casino operators, with shares in Las Vegas Sands up more than 2 per cent to $76.23, MGM Resorts shares climbing 1 per cent to $36.75 and US depositary receipts in Melco Resorts increasing 1 per cent to $29.51.

Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts were both down 1 per cent.Gun stocks received a lift however on expectations that any efforts to revive talks on gun control will trigger a buying frenzy.Shares in Sturm Ruger are up 2.6 per cent, while American Outdoor Brands, once known as Smith & Wesson, rose 3 per cent.On the data front, the ISM manufacturing data will be out later this morning at 10am. Ahead of that release, yield on the 10-year is largely unchanged at 2.3265 per cent. The dollar is building on last week’s gain, with the DXY index up 0.4 per cent.
16;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2017-08-12T10:42:16Z;How UK beat the odds to win at online gambling;Three British bookmakers played a deft hand in $44bn global industry;"About two decades ago, an Englishwoman, Irishman and Scotsman walked into the betting industry. With a little luck, some bold bets and help from the puritanical US, they put Britain at the forefront of the rapid growth in the $44.5bn online betting industry.But one of those three, Ireland’s Breon Corcoran, who led Paddy Power Betfair for 16 years, on Monday announced he was leaving the group. The two remaining, Denise Coates, whose betting shops in Stoke-on-Trent became Bet365, and Kenny Alexander, who leads Isle of Man-based GVC Holdings, are left facing a sector in tumult.British and Irish gambling groups are being forced into mergers as they battle increasing competition from online upstarts. Previously benign UK authorities may soon bare their teeth, shutting down profitable — if questionable — revenue sources for bookmakers.Firms based in the UK have long benefited from not being as tightly regulated as elsewhere in the world. In some countries, such as China and India, bans on online gambling have pushed the practice underground, creating multibillion-dollar black markets for wagers. Other major markets, such as Germany, enforce strict restrictions.Meanwhile, the US heavyweights of the offline gambling industry have remained focused on their lucrative real estate. Sands, MGM Resorts and Wynn generate tens of billions in revenues from large casino operations focused on Nevada in the US and Macau in China.US federal bans on sports and online betting, instituted in the 1990s and 2000s, have restricted their internet activities.“Americans have a strange attitude towards the sin business of gambling,” says Ralph Topping, former chief executive of William Hill, the UK bookmaker which is also pushing into the online space.“They made it land-based only and tightly controlled. If Americans had been allowed to do [online gambling], you would be in a different world. People like Steve Wynn [the US casino and hotels magnate] with pocketfuls of cash would have made an impact. But there was that gap, and the UK guys were allowed to get on with it.”Breon Corcoran
Born in Mullingar in rural Ireland, the softly-spoken chief executive of Paddy Power Betfair is seen as a leading strategic thinker in the gambling industry. “Breon is extremely bright,” says Henry Birch, chief executive of UK casino operator Rank Group. “Cerebral is the word that gets used quite a lot.”He joined Paddy Power in 2001, moved to run Betfair in 2012 and masterminded the combination of the two last year, sparking a wave of consolidation across the UK gambling sector.Kenny Alexander
A life-long fan of Scottish football side Kilmarnock, Mr Alexander loves horseracing and is a keen poker player. He began his career as a chartered accountant at Grant Thornton, but entered the gaming industry in 2000 after joining Sportingbet.He rose through the ranks to become chief executive of GVC in 2007. Instead of battling in the highly competitive UK gambling market, he has focused on growth through acquisition and targeting underserved international markets.Denise Coates
Arguably the most successful self-made woman in UK business, she took a string of shops in Stoke owned by father Peter and transformed them into a high-tech gambling business.Though joint chief executive alongside brother John, Ms Coates is majority shareholder. “She doesn’t take a prominent part in the industry,” says Ralph Topping, former William Hill CEO. “She’s been an incredibly focused woman and done a terrific job.”British and Irish bookmakers used the proceeds of their own highly profitable betting shops to build a formidable online presence over the past two decades, extending their offerings to customers internationally.“If you take any online digital category — retail, search, social networks — they are dominated by US companies,” says Henry Birch, chief executive of UK casino operator Rank Group. “But in the UK, we have the largest online market in the world and the Americans are locked out.”But now a sector built by experienced insiders is in middle of another shake-up. On Monday, Paddy Power Betfair, the world’s largest online betting firm by market capitalisation, announced that Mr Corcoran would be stepping down as chief executive.The Irishman has been credited with foreseeing the disruption that internet betting would cause to over-the-counter bookmakers. With this insight, he led a £5bn merger last year between the two companies he had worked for throughout a 16-year career — Irish bookmaker Paddy Power and UK-based online betting firm Betfair.“Our strategy on that has been to drive down the cost of service . . . using technology to make us ever more efficient,” says Mr Corcoran. “The thesis that, as barriers for entry [for online gambling] go up the small guys will suffer, is increasingly evident.”The merger of Paddy Power and Betfair formed part of a wave of consolidation that has rippled across the online gambling industry in recent years. In 2015, GVC, the owners of Sportingbet, agreed a deal to acquire rivals Bwin.party in a £1.1bn deal, fighting off stiff competition from Gibraltar-based 888 Holdings.The move was masterminded by Mr Alexander, the GVC chief. His all-in bet on Bwin.party catapulted his company, which previously traded on London’s Aim market, into the FTSE 250 group of the UK’s largest listed companies.“If Kenny played chess, he’d be four moves in front of you,” says Mr Topping. “Most importantly, he’s not made a mistake yet.”Further dealmaking is seen as paused until after a regulatory review of the gambling sector. Among the expected changes is a clampdown on fixed-odds betting terminals — in-store machines that operate only in the UK that generate hundreds of millions in revenues.But a number of transactions are still possible. Last November, it emerged that Ladbrokes Coral held talks with GVC over a possible tie-up, and earlier this year, William Hill called off merger discussions with Canada’s Amaya, which runs the PokerStars site.The push towards consolidation is also a response to the gains being made by online-only competitors, such as the privately held group Bet365, founded by Denise Coates in 2000.Bet365 says it has more than 22m customers, making it the world’s largest online gambling company, with reports suggesting that three-quarters of its £1.5bn revenues come from international markets.American players could yet join the fray. This autumn, the US Supreme Court will hear a case that challenges the federal ban on sports betting. A number of states, including Pennsylvania, New York and California are considering proposals to legalise wagers on sports matches. A next step could be the opening of online betting markets, although industry insiders suggest this could take years.But groups such as Paddy Power Betfair have already been slowly building up their US operations, ready to take advantage of enormous pent-up demand if gambling bans are lifted. The American Gaming Association, a trade group, estimates that US punters place up to $150bn annually with illegal bookmakers with offshore accounts.Mr Corcoran says: “An ever growing number of partners or possible American partners are finding their way to our door, to talk about what might happen next in the US. We have the right to be in the frame.”One route of growth for online gaming companies has been a risky bet on “ grey markets” — untaxed or unregulated areas — which includes countries such as Turkey and Malaysia.Among the boldest to adopt this strategy has been GVC. Analysts at Citi, the bank, have estimated that 30 per cent of the group’s revenue is derived from grey markets.The figure may be far higher. According to the company’s full-year results for 2016, GVC earned €187.9m in revenues in Germany, the company’s most lucrative single territory. But the majority of GVCs revenues come from a geographic region it describes as “other”, a list of unspecified countries that accounted for €823.3m of revenues in 2016, up from €246.5m a year earlier.Five years ago, groups such as Paddy Power Betfair abandoned a number of grey markets under pressure from UK authorities. Showing signs of slowing growth, some analysts have suggested it should re-enter these unregulated spaces.Breon Corcoran, the company’s outgoing chief, says it will continue to resist these calls. “It may be a bet that works in the short term,” he says. “To be honest, one doesn’t learn an awful lot about product and technical online marketing capabilities in completely unlicensed, uncompetitive markets. You have to prove yourself against the best in the toughest markets. Ultimately, there is a question about sustainability in grey markets.”"
17;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2017-05-21T21:11:58Z;Macau casinos cash in again as China’s luxury sector rebounds;Despite recovery, gambling executives are wary of further crackdown from Beijing;Casino executives in Macau are confident that the slowdown of recent years is behind them amid a broad recovery in luxury goods demand in China.The only part of China where casinos are legal, Macau was hit hard by President Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown and austerity drive, which scared away many of the high-rollers who had helped revenues surge in previous years.Macau is the world’s largest gambling centre but revenues have declined sharply since 2014 — when China’s corruption crackdown first began to hit the enclave. The six casino operators in Macau have seen their combined market capitalisation fall 46 per cent since early 2014, wiping out $97.7bn of shareholder value.Gross gaming revenue — a key industry measure — started to grow again on an annualised basis in August after more than two years, amid reduced fears about the anti-graft campaign and the opening of a number of multibillion-dollar casino resorts.“The numbers are up, the scaffolding is down, the energy is up and we’re on the road to good times,” says Geoff Freeman, chief executive of the American Gaming Association, the lobby group for US casino groups including Macau operators Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts.Fitch, the credit rating agency, expects gross gaming revenue to grow by 12 per cent this year to $31bn, after peaking at $45bn in 2013 and falling to $28bn last year.Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein, the equity research house, says that Macau’s performance has tracked the wider luxury sector in China, which is recovering amid a perception that the toughest days of Mr Xi’s anti-graft campaign are in the past.“The anti-corruption campaign has seen a moderation in the last few months and there’s also an element of fatigue,” he says. “High net-worth individuals are sitting back and thinking that ‘If I haven’t been affected by now, then I’m probably OK’.”A surge in real estate prices and an increase in the money supply in China have also left wealthy individuals and the middlemen who provide them with credit in Macau — known as junkets — with more access to the funds they need for gambling.But executives are concerned that if the VIP sector rebounds too strongly, the Chinese government will put pressure on the Macau authorities to tighten regulation further.“The central government has made it clear to us that they don’t want to see gaming revenue shooting up,” says Francis Lui, deputy chairman of Galaxy Entertainment, another of the six casino operators in Macau. “They want diversification.”Over the last couple of years, the government of Macau, which is a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, has clamped down on the junkets and instituted a number of measures designed to discourage people using the city as a conduit to get their money out of China.Earlier this month, the Macau government proposed further restricting the use of ATM cards by Chinese consumers, in order to curb capital outflows from the mainland and reduce the risks of money laundering.Macau — and the casino operators — have been under pressure from Beijing to show that they are transforming the city into a broader-based tourist destination such as Las Vegas, rather than just a den for high stakes gamblers.This plan has been helped by the opening of a slew of large resorts over the last couple of years, including the Wynn Palace, Galaxy’s Phase Two and Melco International’s Studio City.Improvements to Macau’s poor infrastructure, such as a new ferry terminal and light rail system, will also help attract more mass market gamblers and their families when they are completed over the next year, analysts say.Macau attracted more than 30m tourists last year, most of them from mainland China and Hong Kong. The number of visitors increased by a little more than 5 per cent year on year in the first quarter this year.Paulo Martins Chan, director of the Gaming Inspection and Co-Ordination Bureau, Macau’s gambling regulator, says that the industry is “in a good balance today,” with nearly half of the casino revenues coming from mass market players rather than VIPs backed by the junkets.He says that his agency was continuing an audit of all the junket operators designed to weed out those with questionable records, leaving those that are “financially healthy and capable”.Charlie Choi, chairman of the Macau Gaming Information Association, a lobby group for junkets, says that the industry had “learnt lessons over the past two years” when several junket groups collapsed amid the slowdown because of unsustainable bad debts.“The survivors have improved their credit management and are being much more careful,” he says.
18;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2016-12-15T05:00:52Z;Vegas-style gambling comes to Washington;A $1.4bn casino resort has opened on the banks of the Potomac, offering restaurants, shows and roulette eight miles from the White House;"A wind of change is blowing through Washington, DC — and not just the political hurricane that is Donald Trump. The seat of American power is the home to the three branches of government, the National Mall, Lincoln Memorial and the White House. Drenched in history and tradition it is hardly the first place that springs to mind when thinking of Ocean’s Eleven-style glamour but on December 8 it got its first Las Vegas-style casino resort with the opening of MGM National Harbor on the banks of the Potomac River.Developed by MGM Resorts, the company behind gigantic Las Vegas properties such as Aria, the Bellagio and the MGM Grand, National Harbor is technically in Maryland, eight miles to the south of downtown Washington in Prince George’s County. But with landmarks such as the Capitol building and the Washington Monument clearly visible from the upper floors of the 24-storey building, it may as well be in the city.With 308 rooms, the hotel is smaller than comparable casinos in Las Vegas — the MGM Grand has more than 5,000, for example — but the 125,000 sq ft of casino space is similar to its cousins in Nevada. The conservatory off the lobby is packed with 150,000 fresh flowers, while the hotel tower’s sharp points recall the edges of the Washington Monument; the tower was rotated 33 degrees from its original design so it would be parallel with the National Mall. Outside, a large, golden MGM lion guards the entrance to the property while the roof fans out towards the river in a sleek, shining curve that recalls the shape of the Starship Enterprise. Historic Washington this isn’t.The resort’s opening follows several years of construction and overruns that took the final cost $400m over budget to $1.4bn. The project only became possible following a 2012 referendum in which Maryland voters approved proposals for a new casino in the state (despite the operator of a large casino in nearby West Virginia spending about $40m campaigning for a “no” vote). Four years on I find Jim Murren, MGM’s chief executive, nursing a mineral water in the lobby bar 24 hours before opening night. Getting to this point was worth the wait, he says. “Here we are on the banks of the Potomac, a few miles from our nation’s capital. Three airports are within an hour’s drive and 40m people visit this area every year.”In other words, there are plenty of potential visitors. Some will be from the Prince George’s County; others might add a night to a stay if they are visiting from out of town or overseas, he suggests. And what do they do when here?The table games — blackjack, craps, roulette and others — are only part of the story, as MGM and its rivals have realised in Las Vegas, where about 60 per cent of revenues come from non-gaming sources: restaurants, bars, nightclubs and concerts. National Harbor’s 3,000-seat arena will host Bruno Mars, Cher and Sting in the coming months, while its art programme features works by prominent local artists, such as Sam Gilliam, an abstract painter associated with the Washington Color School. One of the other artists on display is not known for his sculpture but has been in the news for winning the Nobel Prize for Literature: Bob Dylan’s “Portal” piece adorns the entrance to the casino and is his first piece on permanent public display. Dylan has sculpted for 30 years but only recently began showing his work. For this piece he welded together metal objects associated with Maryland’s fishing heritage — vices, spanners, wrenches, a boat propeller — into an iron gate that visitors will walk through on their way to the blackjack tables and roulette wheels. The times certainly are a-changin’.Las Vegas has become a culinary hotspot in recent years, and National Harbor is hoping to emulate that success. Among the resort’s seven restaurants is Marcus, created by Marcus Samuelsson, owner of the Red Rooster in Harlem, where diners can drink bourbon cocktails while funk bands lay down grooves on a dance floor next to the kitchen. Samuelsson, who cooked at Barack Obama’s first White House state dinner, tells me his cooking is inspired by global immigration (he was born in Ethiopia, raised in Sweden and now lives in the US) as well as the “great migration” — the relocation of some 6m African-Americans from the south to the Midwest and north during the 20th century. “They brought jazz and bebop with them,” he says. They brought a food heritage, too: the “yardbird” I order — fried chicken, collard greens and mashed potato — is simple enough but a revelation. “It’s a celebration of comfort food,” Samuelsson says.Other restaurants include an upscale steakhouse from television chefs the Voltaggio brothers, and Fish, overseen by José Andrés, a renowned Spanish chef who has lived in the DC area for more than 20 years. I catch up with him on the morning of the resort opening when he is clearly in high demand.“The concept [for the restaurant] was very obvious,” he says, breaking off a loud, highly animated conversation (in Spanish) with a colleague and sitting down. “I’ve been going to the eastern shore to eat amazing crab for a long time and there’s all the seafood culture that Maryland has to offer. I want to do American seafood my way. You will get a great clam chowder or you will have a great crab cake . . . I want to respect [these dishes] as much as I can.”Andrés, who trained under El Bulli’s Ferran Adrià, was supposed to open two restaurants in the region this year: Fish and another project at the Old Post Office site in downtown Washington. The building was redeveloped as a hotel this year by the president-elect himself but in the summer of 2015 Andrés decided that he couldn’t go ahead. Donald Trump had just given what would become an infamous speech in which he accused Mexican immigrants of being rapists, criminals and drug dealers. Andrés pulled out of the project; Trump sued him so Andrés countersued.“It’s the first time in my life that I’ve been sued,” he says, in disbelief. And by the new president, too, I say. How does that feel? He insists he’s not worried; his lawyers are “trying to find a settlement”.Does he think Trump should apologise for his comments about immigrants? “What makes us human and true leaders is the moment we can apologise to others,” he says. “I’m not implying that only the president-elect should be doing that. Everyone should do it.”His decision to pull out was purely a business one, he adds. “I’m an immigrant and have been in America 24 years. Unemployment is at its lowest rate in 10 to 20 years. It’s hard to hire people! So I cannot have people telling Americans that immigrants are stealing their jobs. I think we need to be more pragmatic in the stories we tell about America. People want to make more money, and rightfully so, but please don’t harm immigrants by saying they are stealing your jobs.”Jobs were a big factor in selling National Harbor to the voters of Maryland. The development created 4,000 full-time jobs — Jim Murren says the company had 40,000 applications — while 6,000 more worked on the construction. The casino industry employs more people in the US than the steel industry, he tells me, and more than work for US airlines. And yet it is still stigmatised: concerns over problem gambling mean that when US states have approved casino gaming in recent years they tend to ensure developments are kept far from city centres. It is often seen as a last resort for cash-strapped states eager for tax revenue.National Harbor challenges those assumptions — not only is it close to a city but that city happens to be Washington, DC. “If we’re right, this could be a model for future destinations,” Jim Murren says. The key is the quality of food and entertainment, he says, because MGM is “not interested” in operating slot-machine barns.People are starting to arrive for opening night and when the doors open at 11pm thousands are lined up, keen for a peek at Washington’s newest attraction. There is a month to go before the Trump circus arrives in town to take on that mantle. Vegas on the Potomac should give him a run for his money.Matthew Garrahan is the FT’s global media editorThe writer was a guest of the MGM National Harbor; double rooms cost from $334 per night"
19;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2016-12-08T21:09:09Z;Casino operators take a hit on report of Macau ATM limit;;Once again investors are betting against the house on news out of Macau.Shares in casino operators took a hit on Thursday after South China Morning Post reported that the former Portuguese colony is limiting the amount of money that people can withdraw from China UnionPay, China’s sole clearing house for bank card transactions, to 5,000 patacas — half the previous limit. The move comes amid claims that some UnionPay transactions have allowed for illicit ways of moving cash out of China.Macau, which is the only part of China where gambling is legal, has just surfaced from a 2-year long downturn and the report once again spooked investors.Indeed, a crackdown on corruption in China and slower growth saw gross gaming revenues in Macau decline from June 2014 through July this year. Gaming revenues were up a strong 14.4 per cent to 18.8bn patacas (about $2.4bn) in November.Here are some of the casino operators that took the biggest hit on Thursday:
20;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2016-11-21T18:18:04Z;Investors bet on Macau casino operators after CS upgrade;;Investors are betting on a Macau VIP comeback.Casino operators with large Macau presence saw their shares rallied on Monday after Credit Suisse issued an upgrade on a handful of companies, citing healthier junket trends and the opening of new VIP rooms as a fresh sign of recovery.Shares in Wynn Resorts climbed six per cent to $97.97 after the Swiss bank raised its rating on its Macau unit, Wynn Macau, to “neutral” from “underperform”.Meanwhile, shares in Las Vegas Sands rose 6.2 per cent to $98.05 and shares in MGM Resorts gained 2.4 per cent to $29.12 as their subsidiaries Sands China and MGM China were upgraded to “outperform from “neutral”. Melco Crown Entertainment shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $19.40, on a ratings boost as well.Analysts at Credit Suisse said consolidation among so-called junket operators is nearly done. Junket operators are middlemen who have fuelled growth in Macau’s gambling market by bringing wealthy Chinese to the region and providing them with credit lines needed to sidestep currency controls in the mainland.“As the volume is now concentrated among the top junkets, which have a much stronger balance sheet (to grow business), better internal control system (to comply with the new junket regulation) and agents network (to source players and managing fund flow), we believe this provides a solid foundation for healthy growth in 2017,” Kenneth Fong, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said.He added that some new junket operators are also opening new VIP rooms, which is another sign of recovery.Indeed, gaming revenues have increased for the past three months, after a crackdown on corruption in China and a drop in prices of natural resources weighed on the VIP segment and kicked off a downturn in mid-2014.“As the anti-corruption campaign normalises, we believe VIP revenue will gradually reflect the true underlying demand,” Mr Fong said. He thinks Macau is at the start of a recovery cycle that could last as long as two years.Unlike the US, Macau’s gambling market tends to be dominated by high-rollers dubbed the VIP market. These so-called “casino whales” spend significantly more than the mass market – which tends to be less profitable because these people spend less per person and largely tend to visit around the holidays.
21;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2016-09-05T11:49:33Z;Brazil hopes gambling will reverse its fortunes;Government eyes tax revenues to plug country’s budget deficit;The elderly man in a brown cardigan sitting outside a bar in São Paulo’s upmarket Jardins neighbourhood does not look much like a mobster. However, he is in fact one of the many operators of Brazil’s Jogo do Bicho (Animal Game) — a gambling racket run by mafia bosses and corrupt public officials worth R$12bn ($3.7bn) a year.“My job is a bit like being a therapist,” he says, explaining how to play the illegal lottery that started out as a raffle at a Rio de Janeiro zoo in 1888. Clients often turn up to tell him their dreams, which he interprets with the help of a specialised dictionary that also indicates which of the lottery’s 25 animals they should pick.You dreamt of missing your flight? It means you have regrets and should bet on the eagle. “Snakes are very common — they indicate betrayal,” he says.The popularity of Jogo do Bicho — with Brazil’s rich and poor, old and young — is proof, gaming experts say, of how successful the country’s gambling industry could be if it only were legal.After a 70-year ban, Brazil’s government is finally expected to legalise gambling as early as this year in an effort to raise tax revenues to plug the country’s budget deficit, drawing huge interest from the world’s casino operators and betting groups.“It would be one of the most significant events in gaming history if Brazil opens up to the gambling sector,” UK bookmaker William Hill said in a statement.William Hill, rival Ladbrokes, the US casino group MGM Resorts International, and Sweden’s Betsson and NetEnt all say they are interested in expanding into Brazil once the sector is regulated.“The Brazilian market has enormous potential with a population that has long enjoyed a love affair with football which is Ladbrokes’ fastest growing product,” says the bookie, while MGM highlights its interest in “large-scale integrated resorts”.Luiz Maia, a São Paulo-based lawyer who specialises in gaming, says multinational clients are already discussing local partnerships and have even signed provisional real estate contracts in preparation for the legislation’s approval.Based on the calculation that gambling markets typically account for about 1 per cent of a country’s gross domestic product, Brazil’s market could be worth R$55bn in total bets placed, according to Brazil’s Legal Gaming Institute (IJL).“Gambling has always been somewhat of a taboo here, but in the rest of the world it is an entertainment industry,” says Magno José Santos de Sousa, IJL’s president, adding that Brazil is losing R$6bn a year in taxes in the R$20bn illegal gambling market.Gambling was outlawed in 1941 alongside vagrancy as part of Brazil’s Criminal Contravention Act — rules brought in during Brazil’s industrialisation period to increase productivity. In 1946 the then president Eurico Dutra issued a decree to shut down all existing casinos — allegedly at the behest of his piously Catholic wife. Only state lotteries, as well as poker and betting on horse races, which are considered sufficiently skill-based activities, remain legal.In the 1990s bingo was reintroduced under the “Pelé Law” to fund sports activities but became a target for money launderers, leading the Supreme Court to outlaw it in 2007.Both Brazil’s lower house and senate are discussing separate legalisation bills, which include proposals to force foreign players to take on local partners and restrictions on how many casinos one company can own. Online betting may remain illegal for fear of fuelling addiction.After congress agrees on the legislation, it could get the presidential sign-off this year but more likely early next, Mr Maia says. However, Brazil’s president may try to speed up the process by first creating a gambling regulatory agency as the government scrambles to find ways to plug a budget deficit of more than 10 per cent of GDP.Foreign operators would be likely to dominate the casino industry, based in tourist hotspots such as Rio, while sports betting will be hotly contested with Brazilian companies, especially given possible interest from local media groups, analysts say.However, much will depend on the government’s cut in taxes, which IJL says should be similar to the world average of 30 per cent for physical operations and lower for online groups.Per Eriksson, chief executive of NetEnt, says: “A good level [for online] would be between 15 and 20 per cent — we can’t be there if we can’t earn any money”.For the Jogo do Bicho mafia bosses, though, even hefty taxes may come as a relief, says IJL’s Mr Santos de Sousa, quoting a 2014 study by the institute that showed one in nine clandestine operators favoured legalisation. “They have to pay bribes to the police, to public officials — it’s such a long chain of people that it’s actually cheaper to pay taxes.”
22;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2016-09-01T21:32:38Z;US casino shares rally on Macau lift;An improvement in gaming revenues send shares of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands higher;Shares of US casino companies with operations in Macau rallied on Thursday as gaming revenues in China’s gambling peninsula rose for the first time in 27 months.Gross gaming revenue in Macau climbed 1.1 per cent in August from a year ago to 18.8bn patacas (about $2.36bn), according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau. That was the first rise in revenues since May 2014 and followed a 4.5 per cent decline the previous month.The protracted slump in Macau’s gaming revenues was driven by a Chinese crackdown on corruption and weakness in the wider economy.Shares in Wynn Resorts jumped 4.3 per cent to $93.17. Shares in Las Vegas Sands climbed 7.2 per cent to $53.81, while shares in MGM Resorts International rose 3.2 per cent to $24.65. Melco Crown Entertainment shares increased 7.4 per cent to $13.94 and the Russell 3000 casinos and gambling index rose 4.5 per cent.Not everyone thought the bounce was justified.“We remain on the sidelines of the Macau gaming names [Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and Melco Crown] as estimates and valuations adjust to a ‘new normal’ of a weak Chinese economy and a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds, contributing to more muted revenue growth in Macau,” said Cameron McKnight, an analyst at Wells Fargo.The rally in casino shares came alongside softness in the wider market. Downbeat economic data showing that the US factory sector contracted for the first time in six months, along with productivity that was worse than initially estimated, dragged stocks lower in earlier trade.At the close, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,170.9 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.1 per cent to 18,419.3. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 5,227.2.Thursday also marked the arrival of an 11th sector, as real estate became a distinct sector in the Global Industry Classification Standard. Financials, the sector from which real estate has been removed, declined 0.5 per cent, while the newly launched real estate sector, slipped 0.1 per cent.Elsewhere, shares in Salesforce fell 4.4 per cent to $75.91, after the cloud services company issued a sales outlook for the current quarter that was shy of analysts’ estimates.The California-based company forecast sales in the range of $2.11bn-$2.12bn, just shy of the $2.13bn that analysts were looking for. The news accompanied better than expected second-quarter earnings and sales.Analysts also pointed to disappointing billings in the second quarter, noting that implied billings growth of 12 per cent in the third quarter would be “the slowest growth since the recession”,according to Brian Schwartz, analyst at Oppenheimer. However, he noted that the soft results were transitory and that the company was headed towards a stronger position.Meanwhile, shares in Campbell Soup fell 6.3 per cent to $56.91 after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and a full-year earnings outlook that missed analysts’ estimates.

Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500, climbing more than 6 per cent to $93.85.Wynn resorts and other casino operators rallied as the decline in gaming revenues in Macau slowed in April. Gross gaming revenue in China’s gambling peninsula slid just 9.5 per cent year-on-year to 17.3bn patacas (about $2.2bn) in April, slower than the 16.5 per cent drop recorded in March, according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau.Shares in MGM Resorts rose 2 per cent to $21.75, shares in Las Vegas Sands rose 4.4 per cent to $47.13, while Melco Crown Entertainment shares gained 3.8 per cent to $15.35.The advance came even as manufacturing expanded at a slower-than-expected pace in April. A gauge of manufacturing slipped to 50.8 in April, from 51.8 the previous month, according to the latest figures from the Institute of Supply Management. That missed economists’ estimates for a reading of 51.4.Elsewhere, the dollar inched up 0.1 against the yen, to ¥106.55 yen. The greenback had declined to its lowest level against the Japanese currency since October 2014 on Friday, after the Bank of Japan held steady on monetary policy. Last week, the US Treasury placed Japan, China and Germany on a new currency watchlist.Wall Street’s gains followed a quiet session in Asia Europe, where markets in Shanghai, Hong Kong and the UK remained closed.

28;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2015-11-01T14:55:00Z;US casinos: bet the house;A few groups have a card up their sleeves;Time to bet the house. US gambling companies nearly crapped out during the financial crisis, and were then dealt a supply glut — regional casinos had overbuilt. But a few groups have a card up their sleeves: the real estate beneath their gaming empires.On Thursday, MGM Resorts International said it would place some of its properties into a real estate investment trust. The Reit will include seven Las Vegas casinos, including Mandalay Bay and The Mirage, and three others regional casinos scattered across the country.Reits are tax-advantaged structures that pay high dividends. MGM’s move is not shocking. It had been under investor pressure to capture the value of its property. Its shares duly jumped 5 per cent on Thursday, boosting its market cap to over $12bn. MGM’s decision replicates that of another company, Penn National Gaming, who in 2013 created a separate company, Gaming and Leisure Properties, where its 19 locations were deposited.The Reit arbitrage opportunity is simple. The hospitality company sticks to managing the resort and casino and pays rent to the Reit landlord. Reits trade at cash flow multiples in the high teens as their high dividends attract income investors in a low interest rate era. The high valuation gives them access to cheap capital that they can use to acquire new properties.There is a downside. MGM will now have to make sizeable lease payments — the equivalent of interest on debt. Even before the Reit transactions, casino operators often carried enormous debt (as illustrated by the $20bn bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment — whose restructuring plan of course includes creating a Reit). The Reit unit typically takes on much of the casino’s old debt. And it is, at first, exposed to a small set of properties in a volatile industry. The Reit then faces the pressure to find new properties to buy, in order to grow its dividend.Putting aside this three card monte, a modest recovery for Las Vegas casinos is afoot. Fewer new properties have been built recently, and the capacity glut is subsiding. In MGM’s most recent quarter, revenue per room jumped a surprising 8 per cent. A strong hand always has more than one good card.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
29;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2015-10-05T13:21:21Z;Theft jeopardises casino model in Macau;Junket promoter’s loss adds to pressure from Chinese downturn and Xi’s campaign against corruption;For years, shadowy middlemen know as junkets fuelled the growth of the world’s biggest gambling centre, navigating legal restrictions and generating billions of dollars for Sheldon Adelson and Steven Wynn, the US casino tycoons, and their Chinese counterparts.But gambling promoters in Macau now face their biggest challenge after the theft of millions of dollars from Dore Entertainment, a casino promoter. The theft shook investor confidence and prompted street protests at a time when the corruption crackdown and economic slowdown in China were already hitting the territory hard.Now the government of the former Portuguese colony and the only part of China where casinos are legal is considering tougher regulations and investors have been pulling their money out of junkets as the operators warn of hard times ahead.“You’ve got junket investors who have been a little worried about their investments for a while because they’re watching the market implode,” says Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming Research in Macau. “Then along comes the Dore situation with the alleged theft and it’s giving junket investors one more reason to say, ‘I’m out’.”Hong Kong-listed Neptune, one of the biggest junket operators, warned that it could withdraw from the business because it faces “pressing concerns”, scrambling to reduce mounting losses at a time when its financial position is “extremely vulnerable”.It said that “deepening economic fears about China”, which have caused a global stock market sell-off, were “forcing a broad rethinking of our business strategy”.Other junket operators have already started looking away from Macau, launching casino projects from Vanuatu to the Cape Verde Islands.Macau’s casinos expanded at a dizzying pace in the decade before President Xi Jinping launched his fight against graft in 2013. The junkets played a vital role in helping gaming revenue hit a peak of $45bn that year, most of it generated from high-rollers playing in luxurious private rooms.While casinos in other jurisdictions typically market and extend credit to these VIP gamblers themselves, this is not possible in China because of currency controls, a ban on the promotion of betting and the fact that the collection of gambling debts is not legally enforceable.$45bnGaming revenue in Macau in 2013The junkets, run by listed companies, celebrities and individuals with underworld connections, overcome restrictions, bringing in as much as 85 per cent of the VIP business that accounts for more than half of gaming revenue.“They exist in a grey zone bounded by risk-based and hands-off Macau government regulation on the one end and questionable or illegal business methods on the other,” Gambling Compliance, a London business that advises betting companies on regulation, concluded in a report last year. “Junkets defy the spirit of Chinese and Macau government financial restrictions by running a de facto cash transfer and/or lending service.”To raise the vast amounts of cash they need to fund China’s high-rollers, the junket operators have looked to private investors as well as gamblers themselves, offering monthly interest rates of 1-2 per cent.But the Dore incident, which involved a cage manager allegedly stealing millions of dollars, has raised questions about the sustainability of the industry model.As China’s anti-corruption campaign dents revenues in the city, officials and casino operators are adapting their business modelRead more“We don’t know if or how quickly we’ll reach that tipping point where liquidity is a bigger problem than demand,” says Mr Govertsen of Union Gaming. “But liquidity represents a real risk to a further decline in the VIP business over the coming months.”Kai Tan, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong, believes the bigger problem facing the casino industry in Macau is still dropping demand as business owners facing declining profits and falling asset prices shun the baccarat tables.Gaming revenue fell by an annualised 33 per cent to $2.1bn in September, the 16th straight month of shrinkage.“We are still negative on Macau but the main reason is because of the slowing Chinese economy and we don’t see a recovery yet,” says Mr Tan.Analysts can only guess at the real extent of the liquidity pressures facing the junket operators because of their complex and opaque ownership structure and a lack of publicly available data.But no one doubts that the heat is on as Beijing continues its anti-corruption drive.“The junkets are going to be under increasing pressure,” says Jeffrey Fiedler of the International Union of Operating Engineers, a US trade union that watches the Macau casino industry closely because of the extensive involvement of US companies such as Las Vegas Sands, Wynn and MGM Resorts. “I don’t think the mainland cares as much about the gaming industry in Macau as it does about the survivability of the Communist party and the relationship of corruption to that survivability. So the mainland is being pretty tough and I have every expectation that they will continue to be.”

However, the junket operators have said “liquidity has since then stabilised”. They added that they are “cautiously optimistic on mass traffic” ahead of the important Golden Week holiday in China.Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 with shares up 23 per cent to $63.47. Shares in Las Vegas Sands advanced more than 10 per cent to $40.87, shares in Melco Crown Entertainment gained 14 per cent to $15.51 and MGM Resorts International shares climbed 6 per cent to $19.79.Nordstrom announced a special cash dividend of $4.85 a share and an additional $1bn share buyback programme after the market closed on Thursday. The news pushed shares of the luxury goods retailer 5 per cent higher to $75.08.Micron Technology shares climbed 8 per cent to $15.91 after the chipmaker reported better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and said the outlook for memory chips looked favourable in the long term.Profits fell 59 per cent from a year ago to $471m or 42 cents a share, but well ahead of analysts’ expectations for earnings of 29 cents a share. Sales declined 15 per cent to $3.6bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.Favourable supply dynamics for its memory chip along with “Micron’s technology progress, and emergence of new categories of demand with smartwatch[es] and car[s], would allow Micron to grow its revenues and earnings faster than its peer group of tech companies over the next 12 to 18 months”, Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst at Jefferies said.Shares in Gilead Sciences slid as much as 2.4 per cent to $95.99 after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and maintained their $127 price target. Valeant Pharmaceuticals shares also fell 2 per cent after Morgan Stanley analysts cut their rating on the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and lowered their target price to $200 from $284. Valeant rebounded to close 1.6 per cent higher on the day.US stocks sold off after the latest report from the labour department showed the economy created 142,000 jobs in September and downwardly revised August’s figures.By end of day, however, the main indices had pared their losses. The S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 1,951.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 16,472.37, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.7 per cent at 4,707.77.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
31;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2015-08-04T19:37:05Z;Las Vegas growth aids MGM Resorts revenues;Casino group held back by slowdown in Macau;Las Vegas is back in the limelight for MGM Resorts which once again is relying on its home turf for revenue growth.Domestic resorts helped the casino group counter a slowdown in the Chinese territory of Macau, where an anti-corruption campaign drove high-rolling punters away and sent sector revenue tumbling.MGM’s overall net second quarter income totalled $98m, 11 per cent less than the $110m it reported a year earlier, the Las Vegas-based operator said. But higher-than-expected revenue from its Las Vegas operations helped it avoid the fate of its rival Wynn Resorts, which last month reported a 72 per cent drop in second quarter net income.“These resorts are continuing to gain operating momentum while we continue to make significant progress on our development pipeline in Cotai, Maryland, and Massachusetts,” said Jim Murren, chief executive, who highlighted a series of high-profile events that MGM ran in its US resorts in recent months.MGM Resorts shares rose 9.6 per cent to $21.75 on Tuesday.MGM’s revenue fell 7.6 per cent to $2.3bn. Excluding its China operations, MGM recorded 4 per cent growth from the Las Vegas Strip, Detroit and Mississippi.MGM China’s revenue fell a third to $557m, as high-betting punters fled from Macau, the only place in China where gambling is legal, due to a large-scale corruption crackdown and the mainland’s weakening economy.Operators in Macau are learning from Las Vegas— where gaming typically accounts for less than half casino operator revenue — by expanding further into leisure and entertainment.Earlier this year, MGM came under pressure from activist investor Land & Buildings to boost its stock price by spinning off its MGM China unit and becoming a real estate investments trust.Diluted earnings per share slid to 17 cents from 22 cents in the second quarter of 2014.
32;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2015-02-18T23:50:47Z;Vice squad’s $1m win lights up Las Vegas;$300,000 restaurant bill puts CEO Shane Smith among the ranks of media high rollers;Shane Smith, the co-founder and chief executive of Vice Media, has taken his place among the high-rollers in Las Vegas after winning $1m at the Bellagio casino and spending $300,000 of his winnings on a meal for more than 30 employees and business partners.The lavish meal at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse took place during the Consumer Electronics Show. It included bottles of wine costing $15,000 each and was so expensive it merited a mention on the quarterly earnings call of MGM Resorts, the group which owns the Bellagio and other Las Vegas casino hotels.Jim Murren, MGM Resorts chief executive, told analysts on the call that he had not seen a meal with such a hefty price tag since 2007. “It tells you there is a release valve that has opened,” Mr Murren said. “That isn’t a trend, but it’s a sign people are ready to spend money again.”Despite the meal’s eye-watering price tag, Mr Smith is not the biggest spending media chief executive to play the Las Vegas tables. Kerry Packer, the late Australian billionaire, was a regular in Las Vegas and was known to bet as much as $150,000 a hand. His visits to casinos often made the difference between gaming operators reporting profits or losses in their quarterly earnings.Mr Smith’s identity as the buyer was first revealed by Bloomberg. He declined to comment on the meal.However, Vice Media is not lacking in confidence. The youth-focused company will go on a “deal spree” in 2015 and explore an initial public offering if market conditions remain favourable, Mr Smith told the FT in December.The company has strengthened its senior management team with the appointment of James Schwab, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer, as co-president, who will help oversee a $500m “war chest” for content, technology and distribution deals.“Vice will go on a deal spree in 2015,” said Mr Smith. “Our war chest is the size of the full valuation of our competition so we will see some major . . . deals happen.”Continue readingThe $500m fund came from A&E Networks, which invested $250m in Vice recently for a 10 per cent stake, valuing the company at $2.5bn. Technology Crossover Ventures, the Silicon Valley fund that has stakes in Facebook and Netflix, also invested $250m in the group.Vice, which in 2013 also took a strategic stake from 21st Century Fox, wanted to stay independent, said Mr Smith. “We would be stupid not to think about an IPO.”The company has recently been engaged in a war of words with Gawker, a rival site, which has in several stories accused Vice of underpaying its employees. Vice hit back in a blog post, accusing Gawker of “garbage, click-bait journalism” and “inaccurate and irresponsible” reporting.

34;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2015-01-15T17:15:27Z;US fantasy sports games remain a gamble;Legal alternative to sports betting is growing fast but so are the costs of attracting players;Killian Jones watched the lucrative online gaming market emerge as a UK equities analyst in the late 2000s, then decided to try it himself, ploughing his life savings into a start-up offering daily fantasy sports games, a fast growing genre of skill-based online wagering.After launching his site, PlayOn.co, in Britain and attracting customers from more than 100 countries, Mr Jones is now setting his sights on the US, where the rocky rollout of online gambling has failed to meet even low expectations over the past year because of regulatory opposition and poor consumer demand.But by pursuing daily fantasy sports, he is tapping into a niche that is both legal and highly popular with consumers. In these contests, players select fantasy “teams” of real-life athletes that compete in short-term contests and tournaments for cash prizes as high as $10m.Instant gratification, the peer-to-peer nature of the games and the tie to real world sports make the model compelling, says Mr Jones. “It’s an inherently social and viral game. That makes it much more interesting than the traditional betting product.”Most importantly, the games offer a legal alternative to traditional, prohibited forms of sports betting in the US. They have exploded in popularity as live sports such as American football attract record audiences and other forms of online peer-to-peer wagering, such as internet poker, have been chased out of the country by the Justice Department.FanDuel, the largest daily fantasy sports operator, estimates it will report $60m in net revenues for 2014, a jump from just $14.3m in the prior year. It expanded its player base year over year by a factor of seven, a result of aggressive marketing efforts to attract customers in the broader fantasy sports arena, which now comprises more than 40m players in North America.$160bn — $400bnEstimated amount illegally wagered on sports in the US each year“2014 has been a defining year for FanDuel,” which now has over 1m active users, said Nigel Eccles, FanDuel’s chief executive officer.DraftKings, the second-largest provider, does not disclose revenues, but Eilers Research, a consultancy, expects it to reap $30.7m in 2014 — compared with just $4.9m in 2013 — and to grow its user base 12 times over.Because the games pose no tangible threat of match-fixing, the major US sports leagues — which have vehemently opposed sports betting for this reason — have given daily fantasy sports their stamp of approval.It’s an inherently social and viral game. That makes it much more interesting than the traditional betting productLast month, the National Basketball Association announced a partnership with FanDuel in exchange for an equity stake, while DraftKings has struck agreements with Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. Both sites have agreements with individual National Football League teams.However, the genre operates in a regulatory grey area, and could be at risk should efforts by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and others seeking a federal online gambling ban prove successful.“No one said there is zero risk, but the conclusion seems to be that the upside is more likely and more profitable to (the sports leagues) than the downside,” said Marc Edelman, a sports law attorney.While the industry’s revenues are still relatively small, bigger names in the gambling business are beginning to take notice. In September, MGM Resorts CEO Jim Murran said his company was exploring a fantasy sports investment. Caesars and European bookmakers are also closely watching the genre’s growth.“It’s an area that interests us in terms of a clear appetite for sports betting,” said a spokesperson for William Hill.Federal prohibitions mean US sports betting is still largely an underground activity, with estimates ranging from $160bn to $400bn wagered per year through illegal bookies and offshore websites.In 2013, Americans wagered $3.6bn on sports in Nevada — the only state where straight bets are permitted — but analysts predict that by 2016, the total amount bet on daily fantasy sports games in the US will surpass that amount.The business model of daily fantasy sports is similar to that of online poker. Players pay an entry fee to join a contest, then the operator takes a percentage of the total wagered — typically eight to 10 per cent — and pays out the remainder as cash prizes.But, as with poker, expanding the customer base is imperative to continued growth, and both FanDuel and DraftKings are engaged in a costly arms race to attract new players and fend off new competitors such as Mr Jones. These efforts have included heavy television advertising and partnerships with sports leagues, which benefit from the heightened fan engagement.“While the long-term opportunity is compelling, user acquisition costs have been skyrocketing and the two major players in the market are both entirely dependent upon venture capital financing,” said Adam Krejcik of Eilers Research. “It’s unclear when either company will be able to generate a profit.”Additional reporting by Roger Blitz in London
35;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2015-01-01T18:39:22Z;US internet gambling campaign stalls;Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson leads anti-liberalisation drive;Efforts to allow internet gambling across the US have stalled, after a campaign backed by casino owners pushed back against industry efforts to allow more widespread wagering on laptops and smartphones.New Jersey, Delaware and Nevada became the first states to liberalise online betting in 2013, prompting industry executives to predict that longstanding prohibitions on the practice would soon crumble as others followed their example.“Make no mistake: internet gaming is here to stay,” said Geoff Freeman, the new president of the American Gaming Association, told Congress in December 2013, noting that a dozen more states were also considering online play.Instead, 12 months later, revenues from the three states have failed to come close to lofty expectations, and quarrelling within the industry has shelved hopes for further expansion.The momentum began to slow just three months after Mr Freeman’s declaration, when casino mogul Sheldon Adelson used his presence on the AGA board to persuade the group to withdraw its support for online betting. Mr Adelson, the billionaire chairman of Las Vegas Sands, pledged to spend “whatever it takes” to stop internet gaming.The reversal dismayed other AGA members, such as Caesars and MGM Resorts, which had been vigorously pushing for a federal framework for internet gambling.Mr Adelson and his allies then helped derail attempts to legalise online play in California and Pennsylvania, although they were unsuccessful in pushing for a provision in a Congressional spending bill to restore a blanket federal ban.The 1961 Wire Act prohibited wagering via electronic transmissions, but in late 2011 the Justice Department reversed its interpretation of the law to allow individual states to establish their own internet betting schemes.New Jersey, by far the largest market of the three to do so in 2013, registered just $111.8m in revenues over its first 12 months — well shy of the $1bn projections offered by analysts and state officials at the outset.Some attribute the poor performance to a miscalculation of consumer demand and technical glitches, while others point out that banks have been reluctant to clear online gambling transactions — a problem that has caused similar headaches for the emerging legal marijuana industry.The 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which the Justice Department used to go after offshore poker operators in 2011, has been an important obstacle.“Under [UIGEA], failing to block restricted transactions could result in liability. But there is no liability for over-blocking or refusing to honour Internet gambling-related transactions. This was a carefully considered provision designed to make it much more difficult for internet casinos to operate,” said Michael Borden, an attorney with Sidley Austin and former congressional aide who helped draft the law.Proponents of liberalisation in New Jersey point out that its problems have been strictly financial. There were no reported cases of online casinos being used for the nefarious purposes that Mr Adelson has warned about, such as money laundering by terrorists and crime syndicates, nor was there any reported gaming by underage players.“From a regulatory perspective, our systems are working very well,” said David Rebuck, director of New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement. “There have been no systematic failures that would in any way impugn the overall integrity of our operations.”Advocates of further US online expansion are now pinning their hopes on a renewed push in California to legalise online poker and an attempt by PokerStars, now owned by Amaya Gaming of Montreal, to obtain a New Jersey license after being denied in 2013 over previous run-ins with the Justice Department.Should PokerStars be approved, it will operate an online poker platform in conjunction with Resorts Casino in Atlantic City. The success or failure of the world’s largest online poker operator is likely to determine whether internet gambling makes any more headway in the US in 2015.aaron.stanley@ft.comTwitter: @astanley2772
36;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2014-08-26T17:34:08Z;Best Buy slump continues on weak sales;US retailer struggles to compete with online competitors;Best Buy continued a year-long slump on Tuesday after it reported weaker than expected sales, as it struggles to compete with online retailers and fails to ignite interest in flashier televisions that made it a retail juggernaut in the 1990s.The company said same-store sales fell 2.7 per cent in the quarter to August 2, more than Wall Street analysts had expected. Net revenues slipped 4 per cent from a year earlier to $8.9bn.Profits dipped to $146m, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter from $266m, or 77 cents, the previous year. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 31 cents per share.Hubert Joly, Best Buy chief executive, said the company was grappling with a difficult retail environment, noting overall consumer electronics sales tracked by research group NPD slid 2.5 per cent in the period.“Like other retailers and as reflected in this quarter’s performance, we continued to see a shift in consumer behaviour: consumers are increasingly researching and buying online,” he said.Brian Nagel, an analyst at Oppenheimer, echoed a note of caution, forecasting a difficult second half of the year as competitors encroach on the electronics market.Best Buy shares declined 7 per cent to $29.81, erasing some $760m from the retailer’s valuation.The company’s shares are among the 10 worst-performing on the benchmark S&P 500 this year, trailing only Mattel, Staples, Whole Foods and Coach.Mobileye jumped after at least eight investment banks initiated coverage of the Israeli technology company following its initial public offering earlier this month.A majority of the analysts who started covering the company, including those with Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Wells Fargo, recommended the stock as a “buy” on Tuesday, citing strong growth prospects as carmakers increase their use of Mobileye’s technology.The company makes software, chips and other applications that process visual data to stop cars from colliding. Its customers include BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan and Volvo.“Mobileye is at the centre of arguably the most powerful automotive megatrend in history – active safety and autonomous mobility,” Itay Michaeli, an analyst with Citi, said. “This isn’t just another regulatory-driven penetration story, but also arguably the auto industry’s ‘iPhone’ moment.”Mobileye shares advanced 8 per cent to $41.43.The US and Chinese gambling sectors were under pressure after brokerage Morgan Stanley trimmed its forecasts for Macau gaming growth, as decelerating Chinese economic activity weighs on visits to the world’s betting hub.Analysts with the bank now expect full-year gaming revenues in Macau to rise 6 per cent in 2014 from a year earlier, compared to an earlier 12 per cent forecast.The tempered forecast comes despite the bank’s belief that activity has stabilised in Macau following two straight months of declines, which Morgan Stanley attributed to the World Cup.Stronger volumes and busier floors in August, which have yet to be confirmed by Macau’s gaming bureau, would not offset other headwinds, Thomas Allen, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said.Mr Allen highlighted a change made to transit visa rules, which reduced the length of time Chinese passport-holders can spend in Macau from seven to five days, as well as a forthcoming smoking ban, for some of the expected difficulty.The visa change was “impacting both VIP and mass players’ ability to get to Macau as often as some would like”, he said.Shares of Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts slipped roughly 1 per cent to $67.85 and $199.28, respectively. Shares in Pinnacle Entertainment and MGM Resorts were relatively flat.Overall, US equities continued a two-day advance as consumer confidence climbed to a seven-year high and durable goods orders eclipsed Wall Street expectations.The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.02. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2 per cent to 17,106.70 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 4,570.64.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
37;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2014-08-01T16:46:46Z;Scientific / Bally deal offsets gaming revenue decline;;The US casino and gaming sector was in focus for investors on Friday as a deal among the makers of slot and lottery machines offset the second consecutive month of declines in Macau gaming revenues.New York-based instant lottery group Scientific Games said it would broaden its offerings with the acquisition of Bally Technologies, a Las Vegas based maker of slot machines that is several times larger by market capitalisation.The merger is valued at $5.1bn, including the refinancing of $1.8bn of Bally net debt. The deal will be financed with cash on hand and committed debt financing it has already obtained.Shares of Bally Technologies soared 29.1 per cent to $77.70 while Scientific Games rose 2,8 per cent to $8.78.The deal announcement followed disappointing gaming figures in Macau. Overall revenues fell 3.6 per cent from a year earlier to 28.4bn Macanese patacas, or $3.6bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.The news weighed on casino owners in both the US and abroad, despite analyst expectations of a rebound in activity now that the World Cup has finished.“While results were technically in line with consensus expectations, we expect a second consecutive negative [comparable] to weigh on the minds of investors who have come to expect outsized growth from the Macau market,” Steven Wieczynski, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, said.Shares of MGM Resorts slid 2.1 per cent to $26.26 and Las Vegas Sands fell 1.5 per cent to $72.72. Wynn Resorts also declined 1.5 per cent to $210.04.Boyd Gaming, which cut its full-year sales forecast following lacklustre second-quarter results, fell 11.4 per cent to $9.75.Procter & Gamble shares climbed after the company reported a 38 per cent jump in profits in the second quarter and planned to discontinue or divest as many as 100 of its household and personal care brands.The world’s largest consumer goods producer said net income jumped to $2.6bn, partly due to substantial cost cutting.Procter & Gamble said the move to trim its brand portfolio would allow it to focus on 70 to 80 “leadership” brands that account for the vast majority of sales and profits. The company’s stock advanced 3 per cent to $79.65.Shares of camera maker GoPro tumbled by more than a tenth after the company said its net loss widened nearly fourfold in the three months to the end of June, despite sales growth that outpaced Wall Street expectations.The company said its net loss increased to $19.8m, or 24 cents per share, from $5.1m a year earlier. Sales rose 38 per cent to $244.6m. Analysts on Wall Street had anticipated a GAAP loss of $10.3m.The tepid investor response on Friday follows a tremendous debut during the company’s initial public offering, when shares soared 31 per cent.Wall Street has tempered its view of the company after taking it to market, with roughly half of the brokers that follow GoPro recommending it as a ”hold”. Analysts with Citi noted sales of the company’s Hero camera fell short of expectations, “confirming our belief that the growth rate of GoPro is likely to continue to decelerate”.Shares of the company fell 15 per cent to $40.97.Overall, US equity markets slumped for a second consecutive day after regulators in Portugal suspended trading of Banco Espirito Santo. Markets had broadly stabilised earlier in the day, after a July’s non-farm payrolls report showed the jobs market expanded by 209,000.The S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 1,925.15 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.4 per cent to 16,493.37. The declines take the S&P’s pull back from a peak reached in late-July to nearly 4 per cent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.4 per cent to 4,352.64.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
38;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2014-06-03T17:05:06Z;Casinos sink on Macau spin of wheel;;US casino operators fell broadly as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, fell short of Wall Street expectations.Overall gaming revenues rose 9.3 per cent from a year earlier to 32.4bn Macanese patacas, or $4.1bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.Analysts on average had expected a rise between 13 and 15 per cent.Since the year’s start, revenues have reached roughly $20.8bn, or 16 per cent higher than the year ago level.Analysts with Citigroup said much of the weakness in the sector – the Dow Jones US Gambling Index has fallen 13 per cent over the past three months – has been due to recent reports of “crackdowns on illegal use of Union Pay Cards, transit visas and junkets running away”, which they say are overblown.“Adding to pressure, in May the Macau government announced that a full smoking ban in the mass gaming areas will be implemented,” analyst Anil Daswani said.“Again, we believe these fears are overdone as the ban will not apply to premium mass or VIP.”Citi added the addition of new rooms would likely lift overall growth in the sector in the coming years.Wynn Resorts fell 4.49 per cent to close at $208.23, Las Vegas Sands dipped 2.57 per cent to $75.44 and MGM Resorts International declined almost 3 per cent to end the day at $25.83.Dollar General stuck to its profit forecast even as consumers spend more on lower-margin items at a US discount chain that has fared well since the financial crisis.The company, which is based in Tennessee, said it was generating lower profits from its sales as shoppers buy more “lower-margin consumables” such as tobacco and candy.While Dollar General stuck to a prediction that it will make between $3.45 and $3.55 a share in the current financial year, it cautioned “the volatility of the macroeconomic environment continues to pressure the consumer”.Overall, sales climbed almost 7 per cent to $4.52bn in the quarter to May 2. Net income rose to $222m from $220m.Shares in the company advanced 3.85 per cent to close at $56.39.Hillshire Brands, the US company behind Jimmy Dean sausages, said it will start talks with both Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson Foods over the takeover bids that the companies have each made.Shares in Hillshire jumped about 9.5 per cent to close at $58.65 after Pilgrim’s Pride confirmed it had raised its offer from $45 a share to $55 a share in cash.Pilgrim’s Pride shares fell 2.24 per cent to $25.34 while Tyson declined just over 3 per cent to $42.07.Tyson Foods has an offer of $50 a share, or roughly $6.8bn, on the table.The fight for Hillshire, which itself is trying to buy rival food producer Pinnacle, comes as companies seek to wrestle pricing power from retailers, global groups seek growth in new markets and conglomerates reshuffle their brand portfolios.US carmakers advanced on Tuesday as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all topped monthly sales expectations.Any reputational damage that General Motors has incurred because of its mass recall of cars has yet to reach showrooms in the US.Sales of its vehicles rose 12.6 per cent in May from a year earlier, almost double the tally that analysts had forecast.Although the figures echo the strong performance across the industry last month, they also underline that the decision by GM chief executive Mary Barra to recall more than 10m cars in the US has not put off consumers.Ford reported a 3 per cent rise in US sales in May. Ford shares rose 0.64 per cent to $16.55 while General Motors climbed 1.12 per cent to close at $35.25.Overall, US equity markets closed slightly lower. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.04 per cent to 1,924.24 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent to 16,722.34.

39;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2014-05-02T22:00:46Z;Wynn Resorts gains on Macau gambling data;US equities little moved after strong non-farm payrolls;Wynn Resorts led a surging casino industry on Friday as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, showed a resilient Chinese business that has benefited from new infrastructure and rail connections.Gaming revenues in Macau increased 11 per cent from a year earlier to 31.1bn patacas, or $3.9bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. For the year, sales are running 18 per cent above last year’s levels. The rise was above analyst expectations for a 7 per cent advance.The figures followed better than expected quarterly earnings from Wynn, which said sales rose 14 per cent from a year earlier to $1.5bn. Profits climbed 12 per cent to $227m, or $2.22 per diluted share.Wynn said it remained on track to open its latest 1,700 room resort in Macau in the first half of 2016 and both mass market and VIP segments in Macau showed 20 per cent plus growth. Analysts on Wall Street said they expected strong growth to continue, even as new hotels open over the next few years.“May Golden Week is off to a very strong start, with record mass market crowds in Macau over the past four days,” Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said. “Even our most sceptical contacts in Macau are surprised at the crowds they’ve seen this week.”Shares of Wynn rose 7.3 per cent to $221.68, while MGM Resorts advanced 4.3 per cent to $26.49 and Las Vegas Sands increased 1.6 per cent to $80.60.Cosmetics and beauty company Estée Lauder was cheered by investors after reporting renewed momentum in several emerging markets.The company enjoyed an increase in sales in China and Latin America during the first three months of the year, helping lift overall sales 11 per cent to $2.5bn.Profits, in turn, rose by almost a fifth to $213.2m, or 54 cents a share, from $178.8m, or 45 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Shares in the company advanced 4.7 per cent to $75.62.LinkedIn slid as much as 8.3 per cent after the company said it expected full-year sales to be in a range between $2.06bn and $2.08bn, shy of Wall Street expectations.The guidance offset better than expected first-quarter results. Sales rose 46 per cent from a year earlier to $473m. LinkedIn swung to a loss of $13m, or 11 cents per share, compared with a profit of $23m in the first quarter of 2013.Adjusting for certain items, the company said it earned 38 cents per share, four cents ahead of forecasts. LinkedIn’s hiring solutions business – which accounts for more than half of sales – continued to slow.Tech companies, including Amazon and Twitter, have been hard hit for reporting slowing growth this quarter, however slight. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch point out that, with US equity markets still near records, misses are being punished more than beats are being rewarded.“The focus appears to be shifting back to fundamentals, as post-reporting performance spreads widened last week,” equity strategist Savita Subramanian said.Skechers shares dipped after it announced it was interested in purchasing the Los Angeles Clippers, the US basketball team whose owner was recorded making alleged racist remarks.The maker of trainers said on Friday it was exploring acquiring an interest in the team. The National Basketball Association commissioner, Adam Silver, said this week that he would do “everything in my power” to force Donald Sterling, the current owner, to sell.Shares in Skechers fell 4.8 per cent to $39.93.Overall, US equities were little moved after the monthly non-farm payrolls report showed weaker than expected wage growth, even as overall payrolls expanded at the greatest rate since early 2012.The S&P 500 was down 0.13 per cent at 1,881.14 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.28 per cent to 16,512.89. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite nudged down slightly to 4,123.90.
40;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2014-04-01T16:35:41Z;US casinos gain from Chinese gambling appetite;;Shares in US casinos climbed on Tuesday after figures showed gambling revenues in Macau rose by a double-digit rate for the second consecutive month, as demand from Chinese visitors remained robust.Gaming revenues increased 13 per cent from a year earlier to 35.5bn patacas, or $4.4bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.The rise was at the top end of analyst expectations for a 10 to 13 per cent advance.Sterne Agee analyst David Bain said he expected upward revisions to earnings estimates in the next several weeks based on better than expected figures for the first three months of the year.“Results were on the high-end of recent expectations and we believe, provide solace for those with macro-China concerns – something that caused disruption in the otherwise upward momentum for Macau names,” Mr Bain said.Shares in Wynn Resorts climbed 2.26 per cent to close at $227.18, MGM resorts rose 2.59 per cent to $26.53 and Melco Crown Entertainment increased 5.67 per cent to $40.84. All three companies have properties in Macau.Ford Motor led US automakers higher following better than expected monthly sales figures.The second-largest US car manufacturer reported a 3.4 per cent rise in sales in March as buyers returned to dealership showrooms as the weather eased.The Detroit-based company sold 244,167 vehicles last month, compared with 236,160 in the same month a year earlier.Ford was joined by Chrysler and Toyota in besting Wall Street estimates, as sales rose 11 per cent and 4.9 per cent from a year earlier, respectively. General Motors initially delayed its monthly report due to a computer issue, but later announced that sales in March were 4.1 per cent higher on last year.Shares in Ford rose almost 5 per cent to $16.31 while General Motors slipped 0.23 per cent to $34.34.Intuitive Surgical shares climbed after the company announced it had won regulatory approval to bring a new surgical system to the US market.The company said the Food and Drug Administration cleared its da Vinci Xi Surgical System, a new system that uses minimally invasive approaches to abdominal surgeries.“We view this as a significant positive for Intuitive Surgical, as it has the potential to both drive a replacement cycle and further increase penetration/utilisation within hospitals,” JPMorgan analyst Tycho Peterson said.Intuitive Surgical ended 12.7 per cent higher at $493.60, leading the benchmark S&P 500.Nvidia, the chipmaker, advanced following a broker upgrade to ‘market outperform’ on Tuesday as analysts at JMP Securities warmed to the company’s focus on the cloud market.“The company is successfully realigning its business model to more stable growth and gross margin opportunities, and, in our opinion, is in a position to deliver earnings upside in coming quarters,” analyst Alex Gauna said.Mr Gauna established a $26 price target on the company and said Nvidia should benefit from an increase in sales of its Tegra mobile processor for auto applications. He noted PC headwinds should also be lower than in past years.Shares in Nvidia increased just over 4 per cent to $18.65.Overall, US equities strengthened for the third consecutive day following a rise in the monthly ISM manufacturing survey. The report showed improving new orders and production activity at the country’s manufacturers.Millan Mulraine, a strategist with TD Securities, said gains in key forward looking indicators in the monthly ISM report pointed to “sustained upside momentum” in the future.“This report offers an upbeat assessment on US manufacturing sector momentum in March, and more importantly with the key forward-looking heading higher, it provides a constructive outlook on the performance of this crucial sector,” he said.The S&P 500 advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,885.52 after touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.46 per cent to close at 16,532.61. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 1.64 per cent to end the day at 4,268.04.
41;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2014-03-31T03:38:44Z;South Korea raises stakes in gamble for Chinese punters;;Jeju Island’s white beaches and volcanic landscape are a source of pride for South Koreans, but its roulette tables and slot machines have been another driver behind a surge in Chinese visits over the past five years.Last year, 1.8m Chinese visited Jeju, 120km from the southern tip of the Korean peninsula – up from 175,000 visitors in 2008, with many of them coming to try their luck in the island’s eight casinos.The gambling boom in Jeju and other parts of South Korea is gathering pace, as the government steps up efforts to attract Chinese tourists by encouraging development in the sector.It is one of a growing number of Asian nations angling for a share of the rapidly expanding Chinese gambling market. Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam are all poised to legalise casinos and take on the established hubs of Macau and Singapore.Las Vegas-based Caesars Entertainment and Hong Kong-listed Lippo won provisional approval this month for a casino resort on an island 40km from central Seoul. Plans include hotels, a convention centre and luxury shops.“Gambling is seen as a vice in Korea,” says Yang Il-woo, an analyst at Samsung Securities. “But the government wants to have more casino operators to boost the economy by increasing employment and generating tax revenue.”Progressive easing of visa requirements for Chinese visitors has contributed to annual average revenue growth for the South Korean casino sector of 7.5 per cent over the past five years to more than $2.5bn in 2013, according to analysts at Macquarie, who predict a quickening to 11 per cent over the next three years. Shares in Paradise, the biggest South Korean casino operator by sales, have risen to 11 times their level in mid-2010.South Korea’s casino revenues are still a fraction of the roughly $45bn generated in Macau last year, but Seoul and Jeju are much closer to Beijing and other big eastern cities, notes Lee Hyuk-byung, head of Paradise’s casino business. And as minimum bets rise at Macau’s crowded casinos, Chinese customers can receive VIP treatment in South Korea – Paradise offers free flights and a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce – if they pledge to bet $50,000, which would see them categorised as “premium mass” punters in Macau, he adds.Paradise will this year begin development of a casino-centred “integrated resort” close to Caesars’ proposed site near Seoul, while its main rival Grand Korea Leisure is considering a similar project either in Jeju or the southern city of Busan. Genting Singapore last month announced its plans for a huge casino resort on Jeju, with a projected development cost of $2.2bn.The government promised last month to ease strict financial requirements for casino operators, while the decision to approve Caesars’ project was made “with a goal of supporting the economy and fostering the tourism industry”, Kim Ki-hong, an official at the culture and tourism ministry, said.But beneath such supportive statements lies a deep ambivalence in government towards the casino industry. Casinos – originally reliant on Japanese custom – have operated for decades in South Korea, but the only one open to South Korean customers is Gangwon Land, an isolated mountain resort opened in 2003 that is deliberately located several hours’ drive from the nearest city.The broad ban on “open” casinos and concerns about regulation rule out investment by leading international casino groups such as MGM Resorts International, says Alan Feldman, head of government relations for the company.Korean casino industry regulations do not meet international standards in areas such as anti-money laundering and “know your customer” rules, he says, preventing MGM from operating there for fear of jeopardising its Nevada operating licence, which requires it to adhere to a strict code of conduct across the world.Additionally, the “foreigners only” law makes MGM deem it unfeasible to develop one of the vast casino complexes that it favours, and Mr Feldman sees no sign of a government volte-face in the near future. “Meanwhile, the conversations in Japan have heated up quite significantly,” he adds.Japan is widely expected to pass legislation to allow casinos this year – a prospect that has sparked excitement among operators. “We will spend whatever it takes [to invest in Japan],” Sheldon Adelson, chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, said last month.“Once the casinos open in Japan, they will take some of our customers – many Japanese and Chinese,” says Mr Lee. But the change in Japan could precipitate a windfall for Korean casinos by forcing the government to reconsider its strict regulations, he adds. “That’s the time when serious discussion about open casinos will start in Korea.”
42;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2014-02-11T11:10:07Z;Casino owners battle over online gambling;;A debate over the future of internet gambling has created a rift among US casino industry titans, pitting advocates of expansion such as Jim Murran, chief executive of MGM Resorts, against billionaire opponents Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn.The split, which erupted in an advertising battle this week, comes at a pivotal moment for the industry, following last year’s launch of online gambling in Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada. As many as 10 states – including California, Illinois and Pennsylvania – may consider similar legislation in 2014, according to the research firm Gambling Compliance.The push for expansion is coming from a new coalition led by the American Gaming Association, whose members include casino groups such as MGM and Caesars that are eager to develop the online market further.The AGA has launched an ad campaign to push back against Mr Adelson and Mr Wynn – who chair Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, respectively – and promote what it claims are the benefits of legal and regulated internet gaming.“Internet gaming is here,” said Geoff Freeman, AGA president. The choice for the industry was either to get involved or be pushed aside, he added.The prize is a US online gaming market that, if legalised and regulated, could be worth as much as $13.4bn within five years, according to H2 Gambling Capital, an industry research firm.But Mr Adelson, one of the Republican party’s largest donors, has vowed to spend “whatever it takes” to stop internet gambling.Richard McGowan, a Boston College professor who studies the industry, says Mr Adelson’s opposition is rooted in a fear that internet gambling will harm his casinos in Nevada and Pennsylvania. The billionaire argues, however, that the social costs outweigh the revenues.Mr Wynn had remained publicly agnostic until siding with Mr Adelson last week. Mr Adelson has assembled other high-profile figures such as former New York Governor George Pataki and former Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, to push his message at the state and federal levels.The group launched a six-figure ad campaign on Monday urging Congress to restore the Wire Act of 1961 – which prohibited internet gambling until a 2011 Department of Justice ruling overturned the federal blanket ban and allowed states to decide for themselves.Internet gaming is here. The choice for the industry is either to get involved or be pushed aside“The main thing is to raise public awareness that this is happening. Ninety-five per cent of people have no idea that three states have authorised [internet gambling]. If they did, they would be very frightened by the prospect,” Mr Pataki said.Mr Adelson’s group has corralled support from 16 state attorneys-general opposed to online gambling expansion. It is circulating FBI memos warning that internet casinos can be used by terrorists and criminal syndicates to launder money.Before the late 1980s, most forms of gambling had been prohibited in the US outside Nevada and New Jersey. But the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 changed that by allowing Indian tribes to operate casinos on reservations for their own benefit.Cash-strapped states subsequently authorised slot parlours and small casinos, and by the late 2000s, states were fiercely competing for gambling revenues by building larger and more elaborate casinos. In 2014, 22 states will operate commercial or racetrack casinos, while 28 states host tribal casinos.The AGA had previously been split on the question of internet gambling – primarily due to Las Vegas Sands’ presence on its board. But under Mr Freeman, who took over the group in mid-2013, it now contends that online play is the next logical outgrowth of the industry’s development.Pointing to the fact that Americans are already gambling online through offshore sites to the tune of $3bn a year, the AGA is advocating for federal legalisation and regulation to protect consumers and recapture lost revenues. It says Europe is an example of how online gambling can be regulated and operated safely.The AGA has retained its own team of heavy-hitters including political strategist Jim Messina, who helped mastermind President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election and is a part-time elections adviser to David Cameron’s Conservative party. Known for his use of data and social media-driven messaging, Mr Messina could be influential in winning over voters and legislators.Other states’ appetite to consider online gambling legislation may depend on the experience of recent converts. New Jersey reaped a meagre $8.4m in online gambling revenue after launching in late 2013.The figure was much worse than Governor Chris Christie and most analysts had expected, and industry observers and advocates will be keen to see if a parallel market of online gamers emerges or if the games cannibalise bricks-and-mortar casinos’ revenues.While Europe’s online and traditional casino markets have managed to coexist, the abundance of casinos in the US compared with Europe means that there are few international precedents to help predict who will win the high-stakes battle for the industry’s future.
43;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2013-10-31T18:12:59Z;Vegas: playing with house money;Will the dice stay hot when Bernanke leaves the table?;"After a long cold spell, the table is getting hot. In the latest reading of the Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, prices in Vegas grew by 29 per cent in a year – faster, by a solid margin, than the other 19 cities. Housing is not the only area where sin city is bucks up: so far this year payrolls have grown well faster in Vegas than in the country as a whole, after matching national growth last year and lagging behind it in 2011.This could be dismissed on the grounds that Vegas is the volatile tip of the US economic whip. Before and after the housing boom, it whizzed up faster and snapped down harder. Naturally its recovery should be faster too. There is some truth to this: momentum aside, Vegas house prices are still at 2003 levels, and payrolls are where they were in 2005. This is only slightly worse than the US in general. Furthermore, the core business of Vegas, tourism and entertainment, is enjoying a recovery that looks (of all unlikely things) slow but steady. Gambling revenues are inching up; hotel occupancy rates and room prices are, too.This week’s results from Caesars Entertainment, the casino and hotel operator with the greatest exposure to the city, tell a similar story. Its Vegas casino revenues were up 3 per cent, and hotel revenues by 5 per cent. Less bad debt expense made the Vegas properties much more profitable, too. On Thursday, MGM Resorts reported occupancy, room rates and profits inching up in Vegas, as well.The question for Vegas (and indeed for the US) is how much of this gentle recovery has to do with the availability of cheap financing, courtesy of the Federal Reserve. Take, for example, CityCenter, a $9bn, boom-era hotel-casino held in a 50-50 joint venture by MGM and Dubai World. It is barely or marginally profitable, depending on how you measure it. But it was able to secure a very favourable debt refinancing just this month. Vegas is an ever-changing spectacle that needs constant investment. Whether its run will continue after the Fed leaves the table remains uncertain.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
44;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2013-01-09T11:41:26Z;MGM China: Macau green light gives shares a boost;;"When it comes to investing in the Asian consumer, you can always try betting on betting.MGM China, a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and the daughter of casino mogul Stanley Ho, got a 7 per cent boost in its shares after announcing that it had received approval to build a second resort in Macau.Shares in the JV jumped to HK$15.86, the highest level since August 2011 when they reached a peak of just under HK$18.The company already owns the MGM Macau resort on the Macau peninsula. Its new 72,000 sq m plot is on the Cotai, an area of relcaimed land with several big name casinos and resorts often compared to the Las Vegas Strip.According to the company, the development’s budget is $2.5bn and it will create 1,600 hotel rooms, 500 gaming tables and 2,500 slot machines. The resort will be 85 per cent non-gaming, with restaurants, shops and entertainment. It will take 36 months to build.According to Bloomberg, the company will pay a land premium of 1.29bn patacas ($162m) and annual rent of 2.15m patacas. The lease will last 25 years.After a tricky mid-year period, Macau gaming revenues perked up in December. Overall gross sales for 2012 were $38bn, an increase of 13.5 per cent on the previous year but lower than growth of 42 per cent in 2011. Macau is the world’s largest gaming market and the only place in China where gambling at casinos is legal.According to a December report by rating agency Fitch:The slowdown in 2012 was largely due to the high-end, VIP baccarat segment, which accounts for about 70 per cent of gaming revenue in Macau. Credit conditions tightened in China in late 2011/early 2012, and it took some time to feed through to gaming.… The next wave of Macau supply is slowly coming into focus. The centre of gravity will continue to shift from the peninsula to Cotai, as all six concessionaires are seeking to develop multi-billion dollar properties on Cotai that are expected to come on line starting mid- to late-2015.According to Fitch, as well as MGM China, other slated projects for the Cotai area are in preparation by Sands China, Wynn Macau, Melco Crown, Galaxy Entertainment and SJM, developments that could total over $14bn.The main risk to such projects is that “Korea, Japan, and Taiwan could provide credible competition if they legalise gambling”, says Fitch, but “the broader south-east Asia market is deep enough to absorb some additional market capacity without a significant negative impact on Macau.”Related reading:

45;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2012-11-08T06:22:58Z;Permira completes Macau withdrawal;;Permira has completed its exit from Macau’s casino industry with the sale of its remaining holding in Galaxy Entertainment Group, which comes as corporate results confirm a sharp slowdown in the world’s largest gaming market by revenue.The UK private equity firm was among the first investment groups to place a big wager on the Chinese city’s gaming scene when it paid HK$6.5bn (US$830m) for a 20 per cent stake in Galaxy in 2007, the first year Macau’s annual casino revenues matched those of the Las Vegas Strip.By selling its last 5.94 per cent stake for US$875m, Permira is estimated by Reuters to have made a total profit of US$1.4bn on its original investment since it began selling down its Galaxy holdings in September 2011.Casinos in Macau, a special administrative region controlled by Beijing, are highly dependent on visitors from mainland China who contribute around two-thirds of the city’s gaming proceeds. With the Chinese economy growing at its slowest rate for three years, casinos reported either slowing growth or actual declines in third-quarter profits. The impact has been especially felt in the so-called VIP segment – high-rollers who have bankrolled much of Macau’s phenomenal growth since the government liberalised the gaming market in 2004.Melco Crown Entertainment, a joint venture between Australian billionaire James Packer and Lawrence Ho, son of Macau casino mogul Stanley Ho, on Wednesday reported a 7.4 per cent fall in net profit to $104.9m while revenue slipped 4 per cent from a year ago.MGM China, a joint venture between MGM Resorts International and Lawrence Ho’s sister Pansy, last week said revenue rose 6.1 per cent and net profit increased 8.9 per cent in the third quarter. In the same quarter last year, net profit surged 130 per cent.Sands China, the Macau subsidiary of Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, has weathered the slowdown better than most rivals because of its focus on mass market gamblers and the opening of a new property. LVS said last week that Sands China’s quarterly net profit grew 17 per cent to $327m while revenue rose 37 per cent to $1.6bn.Permira sold the latest stake before the end of the 90-day lock-up after its last sale in August in part because it received Galaxy’s consent, said Damien Brosnan of UBS, the sole underwriter of the deal. A sizeable global asset manager who was already a shareholder in Galaxy expressed interest in buying a large portion of the deal at a 5 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price of HK$28.60, he said.The 249.6m shares were sold at HK$27.17 each, at the bottom of the HK$27.17-HK$27.46 range at which they were offered, due to the sell-off in the US equities market overnight, Mr Brosnan said.Galaxy shares were down 3.9 per cent on Thursday afternoon after Permira’s stake sale was announced, but are still some 28 per cent higher than at the start of the year.Despite the recent industry slowdown casino owners remain upbeat about Macau’s prospects, with a number of new resorts expected to fuel more heated competition. MGM China and SJM Holdings both received the go-ahead for new casinos on Macau’s Cotai Strip last month, following announcements by Wynn Macau and Sands China that they were investing billions of dollars in mega-casinos.
46;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2012-05-24T12:12:57Z;Indonesian tycoon plans 111-floor tower;;An Indonesian tycoon is attempting to defy the global economic gloom with lofty plans to build a $2bn, 111-storey tower in central Jakarta later this year.Tomy Winata’s Artha Graha group, which is involved in property, banking, logistics and agriculture, said that the Signature Tower would be the highest in Jakarta and the world’s fifth tallest upon completion in five years' time.The politically well-connected businessman is hoping to tap into soaring investor interest in Indonesia, at a time when growth in other major Asian economies is slowing and the West remains in the doldrums.“We think this is the right moment for building the tower,” said Agung Prabowo, a director of Danayasa Arthatama, an Artha Graha subsidiary company focused on the property sector. “With a fast growing Indonesian economy, we expect that by the time the tower is finished, the supply of office space and rooms will meet demand.”Danayasa Arthatama reached an agreement earlier this week with MGM Resorts International, a US-listed casino and hospitality group, to manage a luxury hotel on the top 20 floors of the building which will rise 534.5m above ground level according to the architect’s plans.Mr Prabowo said that 30-40 per cent of the construction costs would be funded internally, with the group now seeking syndicated bank loans to cover the rest.Bankers said that despite Indonesia’s booming economy, with GDP growing by 6.5 per cent last year, securing this level of funding would not be easy given reduced risk appetite from banks in Europe and America.“The key question mark hanging over a mega project like this will be the financing,” said one banker in Jakarta.The giant tower will also increase the pressure on Jakarta’s deficient infrastructure, with traffic regularly grinding to a halt across this sprawling city of more than 10m people.But Anton Sitorus, head of Indonesian research for Jones Lang LaSalle, a property consultancy, said he was “quite optimistic that this project will be realised considering that market conditions are at a historic high in terms of demand, occupancy rates and potential growth”.He said that Jakarta was one of the fastest growing office rental markets in Asia, with high-end office rents in the central business district increasing by 35 per cent last year and the occupancy rate forecast to rise to 95 per cent by 2013 due to the arrival of new foreign investors and expansion by Indonesian companies.The Signature Tower will be built in the Sudirman Central Business District, a 45 hectare development controlled by Mr Winata’s business group and home to the Indonesia Stock Exchange and many banks and international companies.The Artha Graha group is also the lead developer on an ambitious, government-backed plan to build what would be the world’s longest bridge, spanning the 30km Sunda Strait that separates the main Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat
47;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2012-05-08T18:57:17Z;Las Vegas;The city where US disposable income goes to be disposed is feeling the pinch;“They wanted the good life,” says hotel and gaming magnate Steve Wynn, of his father’s generation. “Casino gambling is colourful and dramatic and theatrical . . . They shot crap and bet baseball and football and were rather cavalier about their income for solid reason. They made it themselves.” The same phenomenon is happening today, only now in China, as the newly rich storm into Macau resorts to gamble and shop for luxury goods.But what of Las Vegas, where American disposable income goes to be disposed? If Vegas is the glittery, vulgar, scantily clad canary in the country’s economic coal mine, Wynn Resorts’ recent performance in the city is worrisome. In the first quarter, the company’s gambling revenues were down nearly a fifth from the year before. While this figure is always volatile, non-casino revenues, which had averaged double-digit increases over the past four quarters, were flat. Room prices were up, but occupancy dropped 9 percentage points. This is particularly troubling because of Wynn’s position at the high end of the market.A wider view is somewhat more reassuring. At Las Vegas Sands’ operations on the Strip, occupancy fell only slightly and prices held, as they did at MGM Resorts’ Strip properties, which reported rising occupancy. Aggregate data from the city’s Convention and Visitors Authority show that in the first two months of this year, visits and convention attendance were both up a bit, while room prices rose a healthy 8 per cent.Still, business is a big step below where it was in the wild years of 2006 and 2007. Improving occupancy or pricing further will not be easy, given the city has 17,000 more hotel rooms than it did at the height of the boom (several construction projects were too far along to stop when the crisis hit). Companies that have significant Las Vegas exposure – notably MGM and Caesars Entertainment, both of which also have heavy debt burdens – had better be ready to play a long game.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Morgan Stanley gained 4.9 per cent to $19.51, while Wells Fargo rose 2.1 per cent to $34.07.SunTrust, the regional bank that failed the Fed’s stress test, added to its gains and rose 3.7 per cent to $24.49.Michael Rose, senior analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said: “For SunTrust, if you exclude what they asked for in dividends and buybacks, they would have passed.”Oil prices fell quickly after a Reuters report said the US and the UK were working on a deal to release their strategic petroleum reserves. The news triggered a rally by transportation stocks, which had dropped on Wednesday on fears of the effects of high oil prices on the sector.Gains were led by rail company CSX, which was up 8.5 per cent to $21.92.

49;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2012-03-09T09:19:17Z;Vietnam’s local gambling dilemma;;"Is Vietnam about to legalise sports gambling? Despite positive noises from the Communist government, don’t bet on it happening any time soon.The plan, which has been discussed on and off over the last few years, has resurfaced again after Vietnam’s finance minister, Vuong Dinh Hue, visited Singapore to learn about the city-state’s successful sports betting industry.Following the visit, the finance ministry said in a statement on its website on Monday that it is working on a decree to legalise sports betting in order to minimise “social evils” and generate income for the state budget. The statement has since been removed from the website without explanation, in a possible sign of the sensitivities surrounding the issue.Vu Duc Dam, the chairman of the government office, subsequently confirmed that the government was considering proposals to legalise casinos and sports betting.Vietnamese, like many Asians, are avid gamblers but the Communist leadership officially deems it a “social evil” – alongside excessive drinking and prostitution – and betting remains illegal.There have been various attempts to legalise sports betting in Vietnam in recent years, including abortive discussions with Ladbrokes, the British bookmaker, back in 2007.Proponents say legalisation would channel gaming revenue to the state rather than illegal local bookies or offshore websites such as 188Bet, which advertises in Vietnamese on hoardings at English Premier League football grounds in order to attract Vietnamese customers who are watching the games on TV.It would also reduce demand for illegal gambling and make it easier for the government to deal with social issues connected to problem gambling.But for a Communist Party that still preaches about the need to fight social evils and follow the example of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam’s exalted independence leader, legalising any form of betting for locals would sit uncomfortably alongside the moral message.In addition to legalising sports betting, there has been a growing debate about legalising casinos in Vietnam, following the success of Singapore’s two so-called integrated resorts, which are set to surpass Las Vegas in terms of gaming revenue within a couple of years of operation.Malaysia’s Genting, which operates the Resorts World Sentosa casino in Singapore, has two casinos resort proposals on the cards in Vietnam, while Las Vegas Sands, which operates Singapore’s other casino, has also said it is keen to explore opportunities in this country of nearly 90m people.But Sheldon Adelson, chairman of Las Vegas Sands, has said he will only build a casino in Vietnam if the government allows locals to gamble.American casino groups MGM Resorts International and Pinnacle Entertainment are planning to operate casinos on the Ho Tram beach strip*, a couple of hours drive from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam’s commercial capital.But like the small casinos already in existence in the northern port city of Haiphong and the central resort city of Danang, only foreigners will be allowed to gamble there.Gaming industry analysts say that Vietnam has a lot of potential but that if it is serious about developing a casino industry, it must legalise gambling for locals and set up a proper regulatory system.“The government needs to make a clear decision on its gaming policy or it likely won’t be successful,” Paul Bromberg, the Thailand-based chief executive of Spectrum OSO Asia, a business risk consultancy that specialises in the casino industry, told beyondbrics. “We are proponents of a strong gaming regulatory environment as it gives confidence to investors and patrons. If Vietnam can find the political will to move in that direction, they could have a very successful gaming industry.”With Vietnam’s economy going through an extended rough patch and the government struggling to implement a broad wish list of reforms on everything from fiscal policy to the banking sector, the highly contentious legalisation of gambling is unlikely to be a top political priority.But, with growing pressure on the state budget, gaming executives will be hoping that financial needs will trump political sensitivities.*We previously wrote that American casino groups were building casinos in Vietnam’s Ho Tam strip. In fact, the casinos are being built by other investors, MGM and Pinnacle will operate them.Related reading:

50;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2012-03-02T20:27:19Z;Casino operators vie for Asian jackpot;;The bitter feud between Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas mogul, and his former ally Kazuo Okada has cast fresh light on how casinos are looking beyond Macao and Singapore for new growth in Asia.Wynn Resorts recently seized Mr Okada’s 20 per cent stake in the company, which runs casinos in Las Vegas and Macao, after accusing the Japanese gaming tycoon of bribing regulators in the Philippines and South Korea. Mr Okada denies the allegations.While South Korea and the Philippines have small gaming markets, casino operators hope to repeat the success they have had in Macao and Singapore. After overtaking Las Vegas in 2006, Macao now generates about six times more gaming revenues than the Nevada gambling haven.Singapore has shown even more dramatic growth since legalising gambling in 2009. Its two casinos – Sheldon Adelson’s Marina Bay Sands and Genting’s Resorts World Sentosa – had combined revenues of $6bn in 2011, putting the city neck and neck with Las Vegas, which has welcomed gamblers since the 1940s. Mr Adelson was cited by Bloomberg last year as saying Singapore had transformed the way casinos viewed Asia.“Singapore for us has opened up a new market for south-east Asia that most people did not understand existed,” he said. “For the youngest person in this audience, for the rest of their life, there will never be a saturation of the potential market in this part of the world.”Export-dependent countries such as Japan and Taiwan, which have kept out casinos to avoid unsavoury social problems, are now looking at Singapore with envy. Gary Pinge, an analyst at Macquarie, says Asian regulators are paying more attention to Singapore – and not the bigger Chinese territory of Macao – as it has showed that the industry can coexist with tight government control.Mr Okada, a 69-year old billionaire who made his fortune making pachinko machines – a cross between pinball and slot machines, which are popular in Japan – is now eying the Philippines. He plans to open his first self-branded casino resort in 2014, and boasts of turning Manila Bay into a “world-class entertainment, luxury shopping and prime gaming destination” with the $2bn investment.While Wynn Resorts accuses Mr Okada of courting Filipino gaming officials with lavish overseas trips and gifts, it and rival Las Vegas Sands say they have no interest in the Philippines.Aaron Fischer, head of consumer research at Asian brokerage CLSA, says Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing are the ideal places for casinos because mainland China makes up the bulk of Asia’s gaming demand. But there is no sign of these markets opening up soon.In the meantime, Mr Fischer adds, “major listed casino operators would be more comfortable investing in the more politically stable, mature economies like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan”.Mr Okada is looking to do just that. He plans to invest $4bn in a large casino resort in South Korea, which only has state-owned casinos at the moment – a move that industry experts say will pose a threat to western operators.Mr Adelson visited the South Korean city of Busan last week to study the potential for integrated resorts. But he and most foreign operators are waiting for Seoul to relax restrictions that, for example, ban locals from all but one remote casino.Mr Fischer says Japan remains the “holy grail”. A group of 150 Japanese politicians this month resurrected an effort to push through legislation to legalise casinos, which has been previously opposed by anti-gambling legislators on social and moral grounds.But a Japanese gaming consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it would take at least 18 months to enact legislation. When they are built, however, Mr Fischer expects Japan’s first casinos to generate more than $10bn in their first two years.“As an indication of Japan’s appetite for gambling, there are 12,000 pachinko halls and 5m slot machines in the country today. That’s five out of eight slot machines in the world,” he says.Most foreign operators refuse to discuss plans for Japan, but they are engaging in furious lobbying, according to casino executives. Mr Adelson also visited Tokyo last week where he told a conference that Japan would benefit from Singapore-style casino resorts.Taiwan is also seen as a potentially lucrative market after the government passed laws for casinos to be built on three islands located in the Taiwan Strait near mainland China. But there has been little progress since the people on one of the islands vetoed plans for the first casino in a 2009 referendum.But for now, the emerging market that has attracted a lot of interest from foreign casino operators is Vietnam. Stanley Ho, the ailing Hong Kong tycoon who was at the centre of a public feud over his vast gaming empire last year, has run casinos there for about two decades.Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International has also agreed to manage a property that is being built at a new beach resort 130km south-east of Ho Chi Minh City. Las Vegas Sands also plans a similar project in Ho Chi Minh City but has not released a timetable.See Lex
51;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2012-02-20T19:49:25Z;Wynn Resorts: Chinese roulette?;A row between the founders of the casino group is dwarfed by fears over China;This isn’t baccarat. It’s mud-wrestling. Steve Wynn, chairman of Wynn Resorts, and Kazuo Okada, boss of Universal Entertainment, were once friends. They have made piles of money together opening casinos in Las Vegas and Macao. Mr Okada owns (or perhaps owned) a fifth of Wynn Resorts shares. But because of a disagreement over Mr Okada’s plans to build a gambling resort in the Philippines, thereby becoming a regional competitor, accusations of misconduct are flying back and forth. The Wynn Resorts board has voted to redeem Mr Okada’s stake at 30 per cent below the current share price, over a 10-year period.If Mr Okada can be forced to accept these terms, Wynn Resorts shareholders will be delighted. They become the beneficiaries of a very cheap share buy-back. But there will be a long legal wrangle, or a pricier settlement, before the last mud is slung. Wynn’s management has, at least, successfully set the terms of the dispute. The fight is, for now, about whether Mr Okada must accept a discount, not whether he can demand a premium. Well played.But should the conflict make smaller investors in Wynn Resorts nervous? If the prospect of bare knuckled business practices makes any of them jumpy, it is curious that they put their money to work in the casino industry. And if they are inclined to think about risks, they should think about business fundamentals first.Wynn is a very well-run company that has outperformed rivals Las Vegas Sands and MGM by 80 per cent and 120 per cent respectively over five years. But it is a concentrated play on China, which was the source of almost four-fifths of profit in the last quarter. That dependence will rise as it has another mega-hotel planned in Macao. A Chinese slowdown will turn the fuss over Mr Okada into a distant – even pleasant – memory.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
52;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-12-28T19:02:32Z;Online gambling shares get US boost;;Shares in European online gambling companies rose strongly on Wednesday, following a US Department of Justice statement which analysts said could open the way for a relaxation of US gambling law.The DoJ took the industry by surprise just before Christmas when it announced that its ban on online gambling now applied only to sports betting, paving the way for states to legalise other forms of gambling, such as poker, casino and lotteries.Operators which had begun positioning themselves for a relaxation in US law saw their shares jump. 888 Holdings, which has a commercial relationship with Caesars Entertainment, rose 9 per cent. Bwin.party, the London-listed online gambling group, which signed joint venture deals in October with two Las Vegas operators, Boyd Gaming and MGM Resorts, rose 23 per cent.The DoJ’s reinterpretation of the 1961 Wire Act, which for 50 years has stood as the bedrock of its aversion to gambling online, came in response to requests from Illinois and New York on whether they could use the internet to sell lottery tickets in their states.“Because the proposed New York and Illinois lottery proposals do not involve wagering on sporting events or contests, the Wire Act does not, in our view, prohibit them,” said Virginia Seitz, assistant attorney general, in a memorandum published on December 23.The DoJ has in recent years pursued a number of operators for illegal online gambling activity. This year it has charged executives of Full Tilt, PokerStars and Absolute Poker with bank fraud and money laundering.Ivor Jones, European-based leisure analyst at Numis, said the timing of publication was designed to conceal an embarrassing U-turn by the DoJ, which has long adhered to a strict interpretation of the Wire Act.“This is a major change in the position of the US DoJ. At the very least it clears the way for state-level online poker legislation,” Mr Jones said.“Potentially it opens the way for gambling services to be provided from offshore and this may encourage the US Congress to legislate before the floodgates open.”However, Mark Strawn of Morgan Stanley cautioned that the memorandum did not explicitly legalise online gambling, nor did it supersede the 2007 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA).But he added that the ruling could accelerate legalisation on intrastate online gambling, with a clutch of states either having passed laws on online poker, or poised to do so. That could in turn pave the way for interstate online gambling.Mr Strawn identified MGM Resorts and Caesars as the companies best positioned to capitalise from the opening up of the US market, which was effectively closed off when Congress passed the UIGEA.Caesars owns the World Series of Poker and retains plans for a listing, buoyed by the prospects of a legalised US online market.The early beneficiaries are likely to be the software suppliers of state lotteries, according to Warwick Bartlett of Global Betting and Gaming Consultants, such as Lottomatica, GTech and Playtech.In the summer, Playtech announced a licensing agreement with the California Online Poker Association, a coalition of Indian tribal governments and card rooms.Mr Bartlett estimated the existing US lottery market to be worth $55bn in sales, with a potential $10bn to be generated online.“This is an important game changer,” said Mr Bartlett. “Internet companies have had a tough 2011 and with the prospect of a relaxation to current law in the US 2012 looks like being a better year.”
53;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-11-15T20:05:40Z;Caesars Entertainment revives offering plan;;Caesars Entertainment, the debt-laden casino group, has revived plans for an initial public offering a year after pulling a planned listing because of concerns about market volatility.The owner of Las Vegas casinos including Caesars Palace, the Flamingo and Planet Hollywood pointed to positive trends in the business and leisure travel market in a regulatory filing. It added that the possible legalisation of online gambling in the US could open up a lucrative new market.The renewed IPO push comes amid a flurry of other deals, with Groupon, the daily deals operator, completing a listing and Zynga, the online social gaming group, due to float this month. As many as nine companies are seeking to complete listings in November.Caesars was taken private at the peak of the bull market in 2006 by Apollo Global Management and TPG, the private equity investors, in a highly leveraged $17bn deal. The company has close to $20bn of debt, according to Tuesday’s regulatory filing.But since its purchase, Caesars – formerly known as Harrah’s – has struggled to restructure its debt amid the global recession and an economic downturn that has wreaked havoc in Las Vegas, its biggest market.The company was further weakened by its lack of presence in the booming Macau gaming market. Caesars failed to secure a gaming licence in Macau and could only watch as rival companies, such as Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, capitalised on a market which has grown larger than Las Vegas.In Caesars home Las Vegas market, the opening of MGM Resorts’ $9bn CityCenter project increased room capacity in the city at the worst possible time, which has depressed room rates for rival operators. Several high-profile casino developments have also stalled, such as the billion dollar Echelon and Fontainebleau projects, while the city leads the US in mortgage foreclosures and unemployment.However, there are signs of a rebound in visitor numbers to Las Vegas, which attracts a large share of US convention trade. Furthermore, Caesars, owner of the World Series of Poker, would be a prime beneficiary if lobbying efforts succeed at reforming US online gambling laws.Caesars said in the filing it was “better positioned than our competitors” to take advantage of “new opportunities” in the gaming industry. “We are the only US land-based casino company that owns an online gaming business,” it said.Caesars said it planned to raise $50m in the IPO, far less than the $530m it hoped to raise in its scrapped IPO from last November.
54;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Bwin.party signs Las Vegas deals;;Bwin.party, the London-listed online gambling group, has positioned itself for possible legalisation of internet poker in the US by signing joint venture deals with two Las Vegas-based casinos.Boyd Gaming and MGM Resorts simultaneously issued press releases on Monday saying they would set up web platforms with the UK-listed operator.Boyd said it would take a 10 per cent stake in a new company offering Bwin.party’s online poker brands, such as PartyPoker and World Poker Tour, to US players. It is understood that MGM will also take a stake in the company but that Bwin.party would have the majority stake.All three companies will have board representation.Boyd has also signed a 15-year agreement to use Bwin.party’s technology to establish its own online poker brand in the US, provided Congress passes legislation approving the activity.MGM is thought to have signed a similar technology deal with Bwin.party.Bwin.party, which was created by the merger in March of Austrian-based sportsbook operator Bwin and online poker specialist PartyGaming, will issue a statement to the London Stock Exchange today.Jim Ryan, co-chief executive of Bwin.party, said while there was “significant momentum” behind US legislation, there was no way of predicting how soon it would happen.But he added that the joint venture deals did allow Bwin.party to apply for a gaming licence from the Nevada Gaming Commission, which can take up to 18 months to complete.Mr Ryan said: “We are positioning ourselves for when poker regulates.”The announcements will be a welcome distraction for Bwin.party, which suffered a setback last week after the ministers of 15 of the 16 German Lander made only limited concessions to their restrictive online gambling laws. Bwin.party makes about a quarter of its net gaming revenues from the German market.PartyGaming stock was in demand in 2005 when it operated in the US market, but it was forced out the following year when a legal clampdown on online gambling operators led to the exodus of European operators.Keith Smith, president and chief executive of Boyd Gaming, said: “We see online poker as a compelling future growth opportunity for our company, and this agreement would position Boyd Gaming to quickly become a leader in the online poker market in the United States.”
55;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Wynn Macau hotel win allays US fears;;Wynn Macau, the casino company led by billionaire Steve Wynn, reached an agreement with government authorities for a land concession in the Chinese territory that will enable it to build 1,500 rooms on a 51-acre site.The agreement with the government in Macao, which includes permits to build a five-star hotel with gaming areas and convention facilities, allays concerns that the long delay on the project had to do with ­Beijing’s desire to limit opportunities for US companies in the territory.The company said it would pay $193m for the use of the land and that it would have five years to complete the project. Philip Tulk, an analyst with RBS, said that because the Wynn request to lease land in Cotai, the strip away from the crowded main peninsula of Macao, where Wynn already has a casino, dated back to 2004, the delay had prompted questions about the company’s growth prospects.“We had heard that the Macao government had decided that American companies had had enough bites of the apple,” Mr Tulk said. “This makes the project tangible.”In addition to Wynn Macau, Sheldon Adelson’s Sands China has a significant presence in Macao.A local subsidiary of MGM Resorts of the US and SJM Holdings, controlled by the family of billionaire Stanley Ho, are still awaiting the final go-ahead for their land concessions on Cotai.Analysts said it was a positive sign that the Macao government was willing to agree to land concessions with terms that stretch beyond the casino license. In Wynn Macau’s case, its license to operate a casino runs until 2022.Mr Tulk said that because the company was likely to invest $2.5bn in the new project it seemed very likely that its license to operate casinos would be extended, otherwise “you couldn’t make enough money to justify a $2.5bn investment.”Macao has seen runaway growth in monthly gaming revenues. Revenues rose in August to $3.1bn, a jump of 57 per cent compared with last August.Analysts say the former Portuguese colony, which took in $23.5bn in gaming revenues last year, is on course to earn revenues this year that will surpass those of Las Vegas by five times.Mr Tulk said that Wynn plans to build a resort with 1,500 hotel rooms and 450 to 500 gaming tables. Wynn is expected to easily fund the building expenses.
56;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-06-21T12:24:48Z;Vietnam: gambling on gambling;;"While Europe and America have been fretting about casino banking, Southeast Asia appears to be banking on casinos.Following the highly profitable legalisation of casinos in Singapore, which will see the city-state rival Las Vegas as the world’s second biggest gambling market after Macao next year, other Southeast Asian nations are moving down a similar path.There are currently only 199 licensed gambling venues serving the four billion people who inhabit South and Central Asia, compared to around 1,600 casinos in North American and 1,200 in Europe, according to Asian Coast Development, which is building Vietnam’s first large-scale casino resorts.In a recent note to clients, analysts at Citi argued that with Asia so under-served, proposed new casino resorts in Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam will “generate renewed interest in the space.”Citi wrote:While these markets will likely remain smaller than Singapore and even Malaysia, we sense they could provide better growth prospects over time, albeit with added country risk/limited liquidity.From Singaporeans playing illegal football pools through a telephone broker in Malaysia to Vietnamese gambling over cards at a pool hall, there is clearly strong demand for gambling in much of Southeast Asia.But regional governments long resisted calls from US and other casino companies to allow them to open up, arguing that legalising gambling would cause social problems.Vietnam has allowed a number of small casinos to operate in recent years, so long as they serve only foreigners and keep a relatively low profile. But the casino market is set to be transformed by Asian Coast Development, a Canadian developer backed by Harbinger Capital, a US hedge fund, which is building two large casino resorts on the beachfront Ho Tram strip, 80 miles southeast of Ho Chi Minh City.One will be managed by NYSE-listed MGM Resorts International (MGM:NYQ), which owns some of Las Vegas’ most well-known casinos, while the other will be run by Pinnacle Entertainment (PNK:NYQ), another NYSE-listed group with casinos in Nevada, Louisiana, Indiana and Missouri. Last month, Pinnacle agreed to buy a 26 percent stake in Asian Coast Development for $95m.The MGM Grand casino, which will is scheduled to start a phased opening from 2013, will eventually have 90 gambling tables and 1,000 slot machines.It will dwarf existing outfits such as the Silver Shores International Resort in Danang, which euphemistically calls its small gambling centre an “adult entertainment centre with financial rewards” rather than a casino, much in the same way that Singapore prefers to call its casinos “integrated resorts”.The Vietnamese government, which frequently campaigns against “social evils” such as illegal gambling, prostitution and alcoholism, remains nervous about opening the field for more casinos.But foreign investors sense the winds may be changing. Earlier this year, Michael Leven, chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands, which built the large Marina Bay Sands casino in Singapore, came to Vietnam to talk to the government about opportunities here.Genting (GENTING:KLS), the Malaysian gaming group that built the other casino in Singapore, Resorts World Sentosa, is planning to build a casino resort in central Quang Nam province in a joint venture with VinaCapital, one of the longest-running foreign investment firms in Vietnam.With Vietnam battling inflation and low confidence in its banking system, the government may be increasingly tempted to gamble on allowing more casinos.Related Reading:

57;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-05-27T11:42:48Z;MGM China set to raise $1.5bn in IPO;;"Strike while the iron is hot, that seems to be the mantra for EM companies looking to IPO these days. On Friday, MGM China announced pricing for its planned Hong Kong listing and said it aimed to raise as much as $1.5bn.That would make it the fourth largest global gaming IPO on record. The casino and gaming company – the result of a joint venture between MGM Resorts and Pansy Ho, daughter of Hong Kong tycoon Stanley Ho – looks to be cashing in its chips while investor appetite for exposure to the Chinese market remains high. In a statement on Friday, MGM China said it has priced its shares at HK$15.34.The IPO, set to start trading on June 3, will boost the Hong Kong Exchange’s new listing volumes to US$18.9bn so far this year. That’s a whopping 215 per cent year-on-year increase, according to data provider Dealogic. The announcement from MGM China comes as a number of foreign luxury goods companies eye the Hong Kong exchange for primary and secondary listings.Coach recently launched a secondary listing in Hong Kong, and the latest from the rumour mill is that Burberry, the British luxury goods company, plans to list later this year. Prada, the Italian luxury fashion house, is also expected to launch an IPO on the Hong Kong exchange this year.MGM China’s main source of revenue comes from a massive hotel and casino complex on the gambling island of Macau. Total gaming revenues on the island grew by 45 per cent in the first quarter of this year, fuelled by a growing number of Chinese high rollers travelling to the gambling hub. That’s following a 58 per cent increase in revenues in 2010, as the FT’s Rahul Jacob and Robert Cookson report from Hong Kong.If you believe that casinos and gaming make a strong investment then Macau offers a compelling bet – it is overtaking Las Vegas as the mecca for casino operators. Jacob and Cookson quote CLSA, a brokerage firm, which reckons gaming revenues will reach $32bn this year, compared to a measley $6.5bn in Las Vegas.But because growth in Macau’s gaming sector comes from China, tighter monetary policy on the mainland seems bound to curb demand. Revenue growth also looks set to ease as Beijing and Macau implement policies to help wean the territory off its dependence on casinos, including capping growth and limiting the total number of gaming tables at 5,500 until 2013.While investors – like MGM with its IPO – might be tempted to pile in before it’s too late, they might also want to keep a cool head with this one.Related reading:

58;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-05-26T16:00:04Z;Macao: all bets are on;;The Chinese woman in the red fleece tracksuit slowly curls back a corner of one of the two playing cards lying face down in front of her. It is the five of hearts. At her table, shared with a dealer and three Chinese men, not a word is spoken. The only drinks in sight are tea and water.The woman breaks the back of her second card on the green felt. The six of hearts. This is a lousy hand for baccarat. The dealer sweeps up the chips the woman wagered, and she hops to the next table, looking for better luck.The minimum bet at this table in Macao’s City of Dreams casino is HK$2,000 ($257). While a big step up from two-cent slot machines, the stakes – and the privacy – are comparatively low. Casinos in Macao, the former Portuguese colony on China’s south-east coast, also have invitation-only, VIP baccarat rooms where HK$2m wagers are commonplace.To appeal to high rollers, the Encore Tower at the Wynn Macau resort opened last year with four 7,000 sq ft “villa” suites, each joined to its own gaming salon. Past the front door, framed by loops of tennis ball-sized Swarovski crystals, a spokeswoman tells the Financial Times that riding the lift to a top-floor VIP gaming area could jeopardise client anonymity.In such exclusive confines, cash is little seen and even the gaming chips are different. Unlike the round chips bought with cash from a dealer or cage in the public area, rectangular VIP chips are in essence loans provided directly by the casino or through appointed middlemen, with the gambler settling losses after the visit. “Why carry cash if you can get credit anywhere?” says a senior Macao casino executive.The gaming companies have been playing a similar game, borrowing heavily to build huge casino hotels while counting on the winnings to pay the debt. More than $11bn has been spent over the past five years on casino hotel construction in Macao, a city of just half a million people.The global financial crisis highlighted the stakes. Construction on some projects ground to a halt. Las Vegas Sands, the US operator with the biggest bet on Macao, saw its share price drop 99 per cent, while Sheldon Adelson, its controlling shareholder, tumbled from his perch as number three on Forbes magazine’s list of the richest Americans. But the downturn was short. Last year, gambling revenues for Macao were up by more than half from 2009 to 188.3bn patacas ($23.5bn) – more than the combined take of all the casinos in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, according to PwC.VIP betting and credit have been behind Macao’s swift rebound. Betting turnover began to recover after China prodded state banks to pump up lending as part of a Rmb4,000bn ($616bn) stimulus programme in 2009. This flood of liquidity arrested a slowing of the mainland economy and revived confidence.Macao casinos ramped up lending, too. Outstanding credit to gamblers and middlemen quadrupled in less than three years to about $1.1bn by late 2010, according to UBS, the Swiss bank.Such figures underplay the volumes involved. Macao government revenue figures imply, based on statistical win rates, that last year high rollers made almost $600bn in total wagers on baccarat, the only game played at VIP tables. Industry insiders say that 90 per cent of VIP betting is done on credit, putting last year’s volume on a par with total world purchases using Visa credit cards between October and December.The casinos, though, have been cautious with direct lending to gamblers. They have nothing comparable to the electronic database services in the US, which help judge the creditworthiness of a new customer. Gaming debts cannot be legally enforced in mainland China, and outbound fund transfers are restricted. Moreover, Macao’s 40 per cent gross tax on casino takings makes no allowance for unpaid VIP credits.Given those odds, a senior gaming executive says his credit lines are largely restricted to gamblers with established track records and Hong Kong private banking accounts. Instead, most VIP credit is through middlemen. Their role in identifying potential high rollers outside Macao is critical, as gambling advertising is prohibited in mainland China, the source of up to 90 per cent of the city’s VIP players.Melco Crown Entertainment, the New York-listed owner of the City of Dreams complex, has ties to 72 so-called gaming promoters, the highest tier of middlemen who usually hold exclusive rights over certain VIP tables. Each operator in turn has a network of agents in different cities. Asia Entertainment & Resources, a New York-listed promoter with VIP rooms in three Macao casinos, has about 1,500 agents.However, given their penchant for privacy, luring big fish is not easy. “You need to be familiar with the people in a particular city to make connections,” says Hoffman Ma, deputy chairman of Success Universe Group, a gaming company that made headlines by buying Michael Jackson’s white rhinestone glove at auction for $350,000 to use as a casino promotional tool. Ma says non-gaming affiliates in Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing and Shenzhen help identify prospects.“China is so big you can’t know everyone,” he says.On the mainland especially, promoters tread discreetly. “Gambler recruiters do not tell target customers their real intention in the beginning,” CLSA, an Asian brokerage, said in a recent report. “Usually the recruiter would tell the targeted individual that he is running a travel agency based on Macao. If the friend-making process is successful, a friend-accompanied free trip to Macao will be proposed.”Gaming promoters receive allocations of rooms, ferry tickets, show seats and meals for their clients from the casinos and, in turn, take a cut from the volume bet or lost on credit.The key step in preparing for a trip is assessing the prospect’s assets. “It is very costly to identify customers,” says Samuel Tsang, whose family helped pioneer the VIP business in Macao in the mid-1980s. “You must know their backgrounds to know what their repayment ability is.”To fund a month’s lending to gamblers, Macao’s middlemen require at least $6.5bn in working capital, based on calculations by CLSA. They get that via credit from the casinos as well as their own equity and debt financing. The brokerage reports that some operators are paying interest of 1.5-3 per cent a month to investors.The workings of credit settlement between middle-men and gamblers are necessarily murky given Chinese law. Success Universe’s Ma says gamblers often put down cash, stock or property deeds as collateral before a trip. And if the collateral fails to cover the debt afterwards? Nicholas Niglio, chief operating officer for Neptune Group, one of the biggest gaming promoters, says obliquely: “The key is ‘face’ and knowing your customer.”Until several years ago, there was no legal framework for gaming credit, even in Macao. Organised gangs, known as triads, helped fill the vacuum in lending and moving money securely across borders. When Macao went into recession in the late 1990s after a property bust, the triads clashed violently for position in the VIP market.In 1999, as China prepared to resume authority over Macao from Portugal, Beijing cracked down on gang warfare and backed the opening of the casino market to new competitors to widen the city’s appeal to families and conventioneers who might stay longer and spend more outside the casinos than the Hong Kong day-trippers who then dominated visitor flows.Macao’s tourist trade has blossomed since the old casino monopoly ended, with the city’s visitor count rising from 10.3m in 2001 to 25m last year. New shopping arcades, theatres, sporting events, trade shows and extra hotel rooms have had a minor financial impact given the unexpected surge in VIP betting, that was responsible for almost three-quarters of casino revenues last year.This is driving change. The Plaza, the Las Vegas Sands-operated casino linked to the Four Seasons Hotel Macao, has set up a new premium slots area behind a privacy screen on its main gaming floor and converted a restaurant into a high-stakes table games area. Another area has been sectioned off for two new VIP salons.In the connected Paiza Mansions building, big gamblers are provided with complimentary suites of up to 8,000 sq ft. The “basic” two-bedroom model includes a hair salon room, two massage rooms, a fitness centre, a sauna, a 12-seat dining table, a piano, a laundry room, a full kitchen, an extra-large safe and a karaoke lounge, which Jacqueline Wu, the building’s spokeswoman, says “is quite important for the mainland Chinese”. To transport such guests, the company uses a fleet of more than 71 limos, including a Maybach, a Bentley and a Rolls-Royce Phantom, as well as several private jets.For a big gambler travelling with family, such luxuries or the presence of certain shops and restaurants can sway the choice of casino hotel, says Neptune’s Niglio. More important are the rebates high rollers have come to expect on their betting volumes. At Wynn Macau, for example, they get back 0.9 per cent of what they wager, according to CLSA.The loyalties of the middlemen have also been influenced by rising commission levels and higher credit lines as Macao’s old monopoly morphed into a battle between six casino operators. Initially, US-based operators hesitated to engage with junket promoters, because of worries that the previous era’s criminal legacy might jeopardise their standing with US regulators. But as Macao instituted a licensing system and a credit law, they began wooing the middlemen to tap their lucrative flows of high rollers.Few see the build-up of credit risk as a serious danger to the casinos, given allowances made for bad debt. “The absolute level of exposure is still healthy,” UBS concluded in one report, while noting more recently that MGM Resorts, one of the US-based operators, had been indirectly hit by a $16m credit default.“There’s basically no repayment problem,” says a senior Macao casino executive, but he admits concern that some casinos have stopped asking high rollers to deposit a cheque when opening a credit line. This leads gamblers to demand the same from other casinos. “Why are you not giving me face?” quotes the executive.Defaults have already had an impact on some Hong Kong companies that invested in gaming promoters. Amax Holdings recorded HK$2.3bn in losses on unrecovered loans to its agents last year. Dore Holdings, a rival, noted: “Most of the junkets in Macao have encountered liquidity problems due to difficulties in debt collection.”This could become a wider problem if the VIP betting flow slows. Outside Macao, concerns linger over how junket agents do business and with whom. MGM Resorts is selling its casino in New Jersey to meet an ultimatum from regulators there, who are disturbed by the family links of the company’s Macao joint venture partner.Chinese media reports on corruption cases continue to cite examples of officials embezzling public funds to gamble here. In March, the US urged Macao again to strengthen oversight of junket operators and cross-border currency movements to fight money laundering.Should the veil of privacy slip, options will remain for cautious Chinese high rollers, including the fleet of cruise ships that sail nightly from Hong Kong into international waters. “A boat is a more private location,” says Ma of Success Universe, which owns one of the gambling ships. “There are people that can’t be seen in a casino.”
59;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
60;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-05-19T17:35:55Z;China’s high rollers fuel Macao boom;;Pansy Ho could not have picked a better time to sell a stake worth up to $1.5bn in MGM China, her joint venture with MGM Resorts in the booming casino town of Macao.Gaming revenues in the former Portuguese colony – the only place gambling is legal in China – are breaking records, driving share prices of Hong Kong-listed Macao casino groups to unprecedented highs.Investors appear to have cast aside any doubts about the sustainability of Macao’s growth, or the way the casinos rely on opaque junkets to bring wealthy Chinese mainlanders to the gambling tables – their main source of revenues.MGM China, which is set to go public on the Hong Kong stock exchange next month, this week lined up $190m of investments from four cornerstone investors including John Paulson, the legendary hedge fund manager who owns a 9 per cent stake in MGM Resorts.Dealmakers arranging MGM China’s initial public offering said on Thursday that they had already received more demand from institutional investors than the number of shares on offer, with the order book continuing to grow rapidly.The timing of the IPO has been exquisite. On Tuesday, SJM Holdings, the company founded by Hong Kong billionaire Stanley Ho, Pansy’s father, reported that net income for the first quarter had risen 85 per cent to HK$1.4bn ($180m).Gaming revenues for Macao grew by 45 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, even off strong comparisons in 2010, when revenues jumped 58 per cent.Aaron Fischer, an analyst at brokerage CLSA, expects Macao gaming revenues to rise to $32bn this year, compared with just $6.5bn on Las Vegas’ strip.Credit Suisse analyst Gabriel Chan says in a research note that as China tightens liquidity and increases the reserve ratios for its banks, “the liquidity flood into Macao should slow eventually”.“These [huge] growth numbers make some people think something unusual is going on,” says Mr Fischer. “We believe it’s real. In simple terms, Chinese people have more money now and they love gambling.”But the industry’s very success has brought its own concerns. Beijing and Macao’s local government want to diversify away from the territory’s huge dependence on casinos by capping the number of gaming tables at 5,500 until 2013 and thereafter limiting growth to 3-5 per cent a year.But this has only fuelled demand at a time of tight supply of gaming tables and hotel rooms. Luxury hotel rates for Macao are as high as $242 on average, compared with $169 for Las Vegas, according to CLSA.Macao’s government also wants to reduce the territory’s dependence on high rollers from China. Even so, the VIP market grew by 48 per cent in the first quarter, much faster than the mass market.On Sunday, Galaxy Entertainment Group, another of the six licensed gaming groups in Macao, opened a 2,200-room hotel and casino. The huge complex is designed to allow Galaxy to improve the mix of its business by attracting more non-VIP business. Galaxy even has a swimming pool that generates waves up to 1.5 metres high, and has hauled in 350 tonnes of sand to create an artificial beach.Francis Lui, Galaxy vice-chairman, believes this will enable Macao to increase its visitor nights from a very low average of just 1.5 today – the vast majority of travellers are day-trippers.“Our aspiration is to merge Phuket with Macao. We have a beach as good as Phuket’s,” he said, referring to the Thai coastal resort.For the foreseeable future, however, Macao’s gaming business remains overly reliant on junket operators who extend vast amounts of credit to bring in mainland Chinese high rollers. VIPs account for more than 75 per cent of Macao’s gaming business.With gambling debts unenforceable in courts in mainland China, the trade publication Inside Asian Gaming describes casino operators’ dependence on the VIP business as “the elephant in the Macao gaming room”.If China suffers a macroeconomic shock, some junket operators might default. The provision of liquidity and working capital for junket operators is “very opaque”, analysts say.Steve Wynn, the casino mogul who reshaped Las Vegas in the 1980s and built Wynn Resorts, presided over the group’s first AGM in Macao this week. When asked about Macao’s dependence on business from junket operators, he said: “You know the joke: ‘How do you walk on water? You’ve got to know where the rocks are.’ Well, we know where the rocks are.”
61;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-04-14T13:49:52Z;Boost for Brazil’s ‘golden arches’;;"Arcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee, sold $1.25bn worth of shares in a US initial public offering and the most successful Latin American flotation since the financial crisis.Arcos Dorados– or “Golden Arches” – generates 5.1 per cent of McDonald’s sales worldwide. It operates primarily in Brazil and Argentina, and is the largest of any Latin American fast-food chain.In its offering, it sold more shares than expected, 73.5m, at $17 a share, above its projected range of $13 to $15. It was the first Latin America-based group to sell shares above its range since mid-2007. Investors, primarily US hedge funds, flocked to the company as an entry point for the emerging consumer class in Brazil. The shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.Woods Staton, chief executive, who has been working with McDonald’s in Latin America since 1982, took the company on a three-week global roadshow in the lead-up to the IPO. He also purchased about 2m shares in the offering.The sale continues a surge in US public offerings, which enjoyed the best first quarter since 2008, a nearly 200 per cent gain over the first quarter last year. US investors added $2.8bn in assets to mutual funds invested in non-US companies in the week ending April 6, according to the Investment Company Institute, the best flow since December. The sale was managed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Itaú BBA and Citigroup.ZipCar, the web-based hourly car rental group, also priced an IPO on Wednesday after the market close, raising $170m in a sale of 9.5m shares – more than initially offered – at $18 a share. That was above the projected range of $14 to $16 a share. The sale was managed by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.Demand for growth companies, especially in technology and consumer services, has been strong in the US this year, in addition to demand for large established groups such as Arcos Dorados and previously successful IPOs such as Kinder Morgan, HCA and Nielsen. Demand Media, the web content creation group, sold shares above its range in January, though they have since declined. Qihoo 360, a Chinese internet company, which sold shares in the US in March, saw a 134 per cent jump in price in the first day of trading.Also on Wednesday, MGM Resorts International, the casino group, said a 20 per cent stake in its Macau casino joint venture would be sold via an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. MGM will have 51 per cent stake; the proceeds will go to its partner, Pansy Ho, the real estate developer, who will retain a 29 per cent stake.MGM, by boosting its stake to 51 per cent from its previous 50-50 arrangement with Ms Ho, will have management control of the group, called MGM China Holdings Limited, and allow it to include the fast-growing resort’s results in its own financial reports.Ms Ho is in a dispute with her father, Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong tycoon, over ownership of his casino groups. MGM was forced to abandon its hotels in New Jersey because the state’s gambling commission found Ms Ho to be an “unsuitable” business partner because of her father, who is accused of having ties to organised crime. Mr Ho has denied any such ties."
62;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-03-31T18:34:41Z;Sands China in regulatory probe;;Sands China, the Macao casino group controlled by Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson, has revealed it is being probed by Hong Kong’s securities watchdog for alleged breaches of regulations.The news comes a month after the company’s New York-listed parent, Las Vegas Sands, disclosed that US federal and state authorities were investigating its compliance with laws that prohibit bribing foreign officials.Shares in Sands China slid 5.7 per cent to HK$17.36 in Hong Kong on Thursday.In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, the company said it had been asked by the Securities and Futures Commission to produce “certain documents” but declined to provide any details.People familiar with the matter said the SFC investigation was launched several months ago, independently of the US investigations.Lawyers and analysts on Thursday speculated that the SFC probe might be connected to a wrongful termination lawsuit filed in the US last year by Steven Jacobs, the former chief executive of Sands China.Mr Jacobs alleged in a Nevada court filing that he was fired “without cause” last year, after resisting “repeated and outrageous demands” by Mr Adelson to “use improper ‘leverage’ against senior government officials of Macao”.Mr Jacobs also alleged he was asked to “refrain from disclosing truthful and material information” to the Sands China board, “so that it could decide if such information relating to material financial events, corporate governance, and corporate independence should be disclosed …to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange”.The SFC regulates all companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and has been taking a harder line against companies that provide false or misleading information to the public.Mr Adelson has said Mr Jacobs’ accusations are baseless.Speaking about the US probe at a conference this week in Las Vegas, Mr Adelson said: “When the smoke clears, I am absolutely, not 100 per cent, but 1,000 per cent positive that there won’t be any fire below it. We’re going to be found absolutely clean.”Analysts said the SFC investigation would only add to the uncertainty surrounding Sands China and its parent Las Vegas Sands.Aaron Fischer, of CLSA, said: “There could be a negative earnings impact in the short term because some players might feel less comfortable gambling at the Sands properties.“But we don’t think over the long term there will be any serious impact like losing a licence.”Sands China is one of six casino groups licensed to operate in Macao, a former Portuguese colony that is now the world’s biggest gaming market.Competitors include MGM Resorts International and Wynn Macau, a unit of Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts.Besides Macao, Las Vegas Sands operates in the highly regulated markets of Nevada, Singapore and Pennsylvania.
63;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-03-13T16:19:49Z;The unconventional gambler;MGM Resorts chief James Murren confounds expectations;"Deep within the marble halls of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, past the whirring slot machines and the fine art gallery with its works by Renoir, Picasso and Degas, James Murren, is reflecting on one of his more unusual visits to the gym.The chief executive of MGM Resorts, the biggest casino group in the US, is an early riser and works out every morning. “Sometimes when we have big shot celebrities, we close the gym which can upset the other guests,” he says. “But I walked in one morning and there were all these guys in there wearing suits. And the president of the United States is there on a treadmill.” Barack Obama was in town for a campaign event and Mr Murren would later introduce the president on stage at Aria, one of the company’s 11 casino hotels.We are sitting in his office at the Bellagio, which is notable for its walls of Jerusalem limestone and two antique slot machines, including one from the Prohibition era that dispensed mints instead of cash. His predecessor, Terry Lanni, used to have a Renoir from the company’s art collection hanging over his desk but with Las Vegas in the middle of a new age of austerity, it is gone. “It was sold,” Mr Murren sighs. In its place is a more modest work by Richard Diebenkorn and pictures of the chief executive’s wife, Heather, and their two teenage sons.While this might seem slightly at odds with the ostentatious image for which Las Vegas is more commonly known, it says a lot about the contrasts inherent in Mr Murren. A Republican, he admires Mr Obama – “he’s very, very smart” – and campaigned for Harry Reid, the Democrat Senate majority leader who represents Nevada, in last year’s midterm elections. He was raised in a Roman Catholic family in Connecticut, studied art history and urban planning at a liberal arts college, and now heads a casino group in the gambling capital of the US.He has attempted to shift Las Vegas from its gaudy past by building City Center, a shimmering complex of hotels, casinos, shops and apartments notable for stunning buildings designed by leading architects including Daniel Libeskind and Lord Foster. “It’s our responsibility to do something different here,” he says.Mr Murren looks younger than his 49 years. He often frowns slightly when speaking, as if he is contemplating something very serious, but brightens when he talks about his wife and mentions her constantly throughout our interview.He says she is one of two great influences in his life, the other being Kirk Kerkorian, MGM Resorts’ largest shareholder. Like Mr Murren, Heather Murren used to be a Wall Street analyst. He was at Deutsche Bank; she was a rising star at Merrill Lynch. She continued to work for the bank when he joined MGM Resorts as chief financial officer in 1998, and the family moved to Las Vegas, but she stopped in 2002 to support his career. More recently, she served on the board of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which scrutinised the causes of the 2008 market meltdown.Mr Murren says her support was invaluable during a period in 2009, which he refers to as “the dark time”, when the company came close to collapse. The cost of completing City Center, which was the biggest commercial real estate development in the US while it was being constructed, had risen to $8.5bn and banks that would have normally been happy to lend took flight amid the credit crunch. The company’s financial advisers told Mr Murren to pull the plug on the development, or as he puts it, “cut off the limb to save the patient”. But 10,000 construction jobs were at risk, while 165,000 people had applied for another 10,000 jobs that were due to be created once City Center opened. So he persisted. “If City Center had filed for bankruptcy, there was a high probability that MGM would have followed it within 12 months,” he says.As the saga dragged on, the pressure took its toll and he found it difficult to sleep. To maintain his sanity he took walks in the desert with his two dogs. One day he had an experience that was a “perfect metaphor for my life at the time”. He was hiking when he stopped to give the dogs some water. “One knocked the bottle out of my hand and I bent down to pick it up and there’s a big rattlesnake looking right at me. I remember thinking: ‘OK, I’m screwed.’ You’re supposed to freeze and not do anything but I ran my ass off.”It was a narrow escape and the company would have one too. It needed bank support to fund a cash commitment towards the project but was struggling to secure it. “We had rented fencing to close the site. Tele­vision news crews were circling ready to film the largest bankruptcy in the US.” At the 11th hour, the project was saved and City Center opened amid great fanfare last year.The casino industry has undergone many changes in the past decade, particularly the growth of Macau. MGM Resorts owns half a casino there, but Mr Murren acknowledges it was slower than it should have been to respond to a gaming market that is now three times the size of Las Vegas. “There’s a great opportunity there . . . we’re not maximising it but we’re doing better.”He has repositioned the company and is pushing into China, where it will have at least 20 non-gaming hotels in the next seven years.But saving City Center has been his biggest achievement. Mr Murren credits Mr Reid for helping to persuade the banks to support the project. “He understood what was at stake for the state, in terms of the jobs that would have been lost.” Mr Murren’s backing for the veteran senator caused him to take some flak from Republican friends, yet he is unrepentant: Mr Reid, he says, understands the role MGM Resorts plays in Nevada – it is the state’s largest employer.Mr Murren’s pragmatic approach to politics echoes the fact that he has become a strong advocate for the state, especially as it struggles in the downturn. Unemployment is among the highest in the US while the public healthcare and education services are “sadly deficient”, particularly in comparison with his “first class” state schooling in Connecticut.The personal experience of his family has also focused his attention on healthcare. In 1990, his father died aged 59 after suffering from melanoma. One of the doctors treating him was Mr Murren’s older brother, John. “He became one of the top lung cancer oncologists in the country and was running the cancer clinic at Yale. We started talking about what we could do [in Nevada],” he says.John had his own battle with cancer but was given the all-clear. “My wife quit her job at Merrill Lynch and with my brother we started recruiting doctors and scientists from the best universities.” Thanks to private donations – including support from Mr Kerkorian – the Nevada Cancer Institute opened in September 2005.“My brother was here when we opened,” he says. “He was sick on his birthday, which was on Halloween, but we thought he had a cold. On Thanksgiving day he was rushed to hospital. He died that December.”Recounting the story, Mr Murren pauses, his eyes redden and the conversation stops. The silence is broken when his mobile phone rings – it is his teenage son, calling to talk about homework. His demeanour changes as if a cloud has lifted, and a smile returns to his face."

Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure control equipment, was up 4.1 per cent to $58.84 while Schlumberger was up 2.3 per cent to $92.22. The S&P oilfield services sector added 2.1 per cent.The wider energy sector also gained as energy prices ticked up on news that China’s trade surplus had fallen to its lowest level in nine months, indicating strong domestic demand.EOG Resources, a natural gas company, was up 1.6 per cent to $104.90 while Denbury Resources, an oil and gas company, added 5.4 per cent to $22.52. The S&P energy index was up 2.1 per cent.Materials stocks saw strong gains as metal prices also rose. Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was up 4.9 per cent to $56.14 while Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, added 5.9 per cent to $92.67. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.This helped the S&P 500 close 0.2 per cent higher to 1,332.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,268.19 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,817.18.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was up 6.7 per cent to $46.35 on rumours that it was in talks with Starbucks over a potential partnership. Starbucks was up 0.8 per cent to $33.60.In more concrete deal news, EchoStar, one of the largest satellite television companies in the US, agreed to buy Hughes Communications, a broadband satellite services provider, for about $2bn including assumed debt.Hughes Communications lost 3.7 per cent to $59.47 while EchoStar was up 3.2 per cent to $30.84.Elsewhere Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, the US private equity group, said it was buying Emergency Medical Services at a sharp discount to its current share price. Shares in Emergency Medical Services were down 11 per cent to $62.92 following an offer that, at $64 a share, was a 9.4 per cent discount to Friday’s closing price.The offer price, however, is still 19 per cent above the share price in early December, before EMS said it was looking at strategic alternatives.This string of mergers and acquisition news follows on from heavy deal activity in the previous week. Last Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn while Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn. NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced last week that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.Retail stocks lost ground in the session after JPMorgan Chase cut its recommendation on Walmart Stores from “overweight” to “neutral”. The world’s largest retailer by sales was down 1.6 per cent to $54.80.That weighed on related stocks. Macy’s was down 3.1 per cent to $23.87 while Sears fell 2.1 per cent to $89.29. The S&P consumer services index was 0.5 per cent lower.Equities across the S&P 500 index fell slightly after President Barack Obama announced $1,100bn in deficit reductions over a 10-year period in his 2012 budget.Netflix, the video rental and streaming service, was up 7.1 per cent to $247.55 after strong data from Nielsen, the media measurement group.MGM Resorts International was down 3 per cent to $15.07 after reporting lower fourth-quarter earnings at most of its Las Vegas resorts and declining casino revenue.Seahawk Drilling was down 41.1 per cent to $4.65 after announcing late on Friday that it was filing for bankruptcy protection.The company said it would sell its fleet of offshore drilling rigs to Hercules Offshore for $105m. Hercules was up 18 per cent to $4.27.Investors continued to react negatively to news that Nokia had entered into a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft. Nokia, which fell 14 per cent on Friday, was down 6 per cent to $8.84 while Microsoft was down 0.1 per cent to $27.23.
65;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-02-04T21:48:47Z;Wall St shrugs off weak jobs data;;Wall Street edged higher led by tech stocks as investors shrugged off weak January employment data.The S&P technology index was up 1.1 per cent to 472.98 headed by JDS Uniphase after the company posted forecast-beating second-quarter earnings.The maker of communications equipment for telecom and cable companies was up 29.9 per cent to $22.75 after reporting revenues up 38 per cent and earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations.Related technology stocks were lifted by the news. F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 4.6 per cent to $123.64 while Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment gained 4.1 per cent to $40.06.But the key event concerning the markets was the January non-farm payroll figures, which showed that only 36,000 new jobs had been created last month. Economists had expected 136,000.Traders were left unsure which way to turn for much of the day, however, after the data also showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level since April 2009. Unemployment was expected to rise slightly, but instead fell to 9 per cent from 9.4 per cent. This was partly caused by a fall in the size of the labour force, however. Many commentators were quick to point out that the headline 36,000 figure was not as bad as it seemed as the adverse weather conditions during the sampling week would have skewed the data.Ira Jersey, a US interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse, said: “The results were not as bad as they seemed. At best, the results were expected and at worse they were a little below consensus,” Mr Jersey said.Equities were in negative territory for much of the day, but rallied in late trade as investors finally concluded that the data was an aberration. “We discounted today’s headline employment figure because of the poor weather during the sampling week,” said Bob Baur chief global economist at Principal Global Investors.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,310.87, helping the index gain 1.9 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to close at 12,092.15, the first time the index has ended a week above 12,000 since June 13, 2008. The index was up 1.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent in the session to 2,769.30, a rise of 2.6 per cent over the past five days.Also preventing the markets from losing ground over the employment numbers on Friday was the fact that the whole week had seen promising economic data. The ADP employment survey on Wednesday estimated that 187,000 non-farm private jobs were added in January. Figures from the Labor Department on Thursday showed job increases last month, and other reports showed strong manufacturing and service sector growth in the US economy.In other earnings news Las Vegas Sands posted disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares in casino stocks lower. The global casino group saw profit and revenue jump in the quarter, helped by growth in its Macao and Singapore operations, but investors had hoped for greater revenues and so the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $46.03.This weighed on related stocks. Wynn Resorts, another US casino operator, was down 1.1 per cent to $118.06 while MGM Resorts was 2.2 per cent lower at $14.81.Elsewhere, Power One, which makes power converters, were down 21.2 per cent to $9.26 after giving a weak first-quarter revenue outlook. This came despite the company posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Coinstar, the vending machine and DVD rental kiosk operator, was down 11.9 per cent to $38.96 after saying that its first-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street’s expectations.The week on Wall Street began with a rebound following the sharp 1.8 per cent losses seen at the end of the previous week.This was helped on Monday by near record quarterly profits from Exxon-Mobil and news on Tuesday that Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, reported a threefold rise in quarterly profits. ExxonMobil was up 3.2 per cent to $83.28 over the week while Pfizer added 5.9 per cent to $19.30.Strong economic data also lifted sentiment. Solid data on consumer spending, manufacturing and employment gave investors cause to be hopeful about the pace of the US recovery.After healthy gains on Monday and Tuesday, however, Wall Street stalled.The S&P kept just above the 1,300 mark while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just above 12,000.
66;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2011-01-24T19:41:05Z;Ho keeps Macao casinos stake in the family;;Stanley Ho, the billionaire chairman of Macao’s biggest casino operator SJM, has handed over his shareholding to family members in order to ensure a smooth transition of control of his gaming empire.Mr Ho’s 31.65 per cent stake in STDM, the controlling shareholder of SJM, will be roughly split between Chan un-Chan, Mr Ho’s third wife, and his second wife’s five children – Pansy Ho, Daisy Ho, Maisy Ho, Josie Ho and Lawrence Ho.A company statement said 89-year-old Mr Ho no longer had an “attributable interest in shares of the company”.Mr Ho, who retains a nominal 100 shares in STDM, has been in frail health since he suffered a head injury in 2009.“There was a concern among shareholders that there would be a bun fight [for control of the company], but that seems less likely, given these actions,” said Philip Tulk, an analyst with RBS.SJM’s shares, which hit a 52-week high last week of HK$15.04, closed down 4 per cent at HK$13.80.Aaron Fischer, an analyst at CLSA, said he was “not surprised” by the announcement.“He is simply passing on his shares to his family members,” Mr Fischer said.Analysts said they did not expect the move to have any effect on the management of SJM.Last month, Angela Leong, Mr Ho’s fourth wife, was appointed managing director of SJM, which followed the transfer of 7 per cent of SJM to Ms Leong in December.“The conventional wisdom is that Angela Leong will be leading the company,” Mr Tulk said.While Mr Ho’s decades-long monopoly of the casino industry in Macao ended in 2002, SJM still controls about a third of the market in the former Portuguese colony, which has outstripped Las Vegas in annual revenues.Gaming revenues increased by almost 60 per cent in 2010, as wealthy Chinese flocked from the mainland to the tiny territory. Wynn Resorts and Sheldon Adelson’s Sands China are major competitors to SJM’s businesses.Melco Crown Entertainment, a joint venture between Lawrence Ho’s company and Australian billionaire James Packer, and MGM Resorts International’s MGM Macau, a joint venture with Pansy Ho, also have significant shares of the gaming market in Macao.
67;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2010-12-28T17:41:23Z;Deutsche Bank takes gamble on casino;;The launch party for a spectacular casino on Las Vegas’s celebrated strip would normally be a moment for its proud owners to turn out in numbers. But things might be different when the Cosmopolitan, a 3,000-room hotel and gambling resort, marks its opening this month with a huge New Year’s eve concert.The owner of the Cosmopolitan is Deutsche Bank. It is not just that Josef Ackermann, Deutsche’s chief executive, might understandably be wary of presenting photographers with the open goal of snapping one of the world’s best-known investment bankers at the roulette tables. Nor is it about whether the 62-year-old Swiss is into Coldplay or Jay Z, the headline acts.Rather the Cosmopolitan is an investment that the German bank is a little shy of talking about: a property loan gone bad that led it into an unplanned $4bn gamble on the future of the Las Vegas casino industry. After the original developer defaulted on its loans from the bank in 2008, Deutsche decided to finish the casino itself.For the bank, the diversion into gambling is an unwelcome risk at a time when scarce capital needs to be used for many other purposes.For the US casino industry the opening of a new casino comes at a precarious time, with Las Vegas dubbed the ground zero of the economic crisis by some observers.It is only a year since MGM Resorts opened the $8.5bn City Center resort development next door to the Cosmopolitan – but spending in America’s gambling hub has been rocked by the economic downturn.Casino operators on the famed gaming strip have sacked thousands of workers to cut costs and slashed prices of hotel rooms to lure weary US consumers back to the tables.Other pricey casino developments have fallen victim to the global financial crash: Boyd Gaming said in a regulatory filing that it was unlikely to resume construction on its $4.8bn Echelon casino project, which is close to the Cosmopolitan, for three to five years.The nearby Fontainebleau Las Vegas was also abandoned half-finished and has been snapped up out of bankruptcy by Carl Icahn, the activist investor, in a cut-price deal worth $156m.Deutsche’s own unlikely journey towards casino ownership began in 2004 when it lent Ian Bruce Eichner, the Cosmopolitan’s original developer, $60m to build a high-rise casino and condominium complex.At the time, the casino industry was booming – as was Las Vegas. The city was, for most of the decade, the fastest growing in the US. Workers flooded in from across the country, lured by jobs in the service sector and a red-hot real estate market.But when the economy crashed, Las Vegas fell harder than anywhere else. The city is the mortgage foreclosure capital of the US, while Nevada has an unemployment rate of 14.2 per cent, more than four points above the national average. By 2008, Deutsche had increased its loans to the Cosmopolitan development to about $760m. The bank required more equity but Mr Eichner defaulted, prompting the bank to foreclose.Talks failed on passing the uncompleted complex to another developer and Deutsche has given few details of why it took on construction and ownership itself – although it might have been motivated partly by a desire to avoid a high-profile writedown and by the hope that a sale price would be better later.“As a financial investor in the project we are convinced that the executive management team will build an outstanding business and serve our shareholders the best they can,” the bank says today.So far it has put almost $4bn into the project, the bank has told gaming regulators in Nevada.In a series of provisions since the first quarter of 2009, Deutsche has already booked almost €700m ($921m) of writedowns – not much different from what it would have cost had it walked away at the time of foreclosure.In February, Stefan Krause, the bank’s chief financial officer, told analysts that Deutsche assigned a carrying value of “above €2bn” to the Cosmopolitan project.“This asset is now very well valued and fairly valued within our book and has a lot of upside potential,” Mr Krause said.Subsequently, in the second quarter of 2010, Deutsche booked a further impairment of €124m. The US-registered company that the bank set up to own the hotel listed the value of its land and construction at more than $2.7bn in September, according to a US regulatory filing.Deutsche has pinned its hopes on the fact that the casino – which bills itself as giving guests “just the right amount of wrong” – will be enough of a draw to allow it to pull out of its investment at a profit later.But it faces an uphill struggle, given the supply glut Las Vegas is grappling with: visitors to the city have thousands of rooms to choose from, many at knock-down prices.Still, Deutsche is putting a brave face on it. As Mr Krause said this year: “Let’s not forget this . . . will be the last new hotel casino resort for a while in Las Vegas . . . the last and newest one is the one that always will have the most guests coming.”
68;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2010-12-09T19:50:14Z;Russia’s VTB Bank to issue renminbi bond;;Russia’s second-biggest bank will become the first emerging market issuer outside China of “dim sum” bonds denominated in renminbi, in a sign of the growing Chinese presence in financial markets.VTB Bank plans to issue Rmb1bn in three-year bonds, expected to yield about 3.125 per cent, according to people familiar with the situation.Only a few foreign companies, including McDonald’s in August and Caterpillar last month, have issued “dim sum” bonds, which are issued in Hong Kong, where the offshore market is developing.The recent issues follow the opening up of regulations by the Chinese authorities earlier this year.“China is the future. More and more companies and banks recognise the importance of China. It is the fastest-growing economy in the world and a lot of companies want to do business there, which means they need the currency,” said Nigel Rendell, senior emerging market strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Separately, Galaxy Entertainment Group, a casino operator listed in Hong Kong, was able to sell bonds at yields lower than in Shanghai and below those on gaming debt in the US because of strong demand, another sign of the Hong Kong market’s potential.Galaxy, which is building a 2,200-room complex in Macau with the world’s largest rooftop wave pool, sold Rmb1.38bn of three-year bonds on Thursday priced to yield 4.625 per cent.Since February, it has become possible for any company in the world to tap the “dim sum” market. But issuers still need to gain approval from Beijing to move the proceeds from Hong Kong to the mainland.Some banks have been issuing these “dim sum” bonds since 2007. There have been about 20 so far, as issuance was initially restricted to Chinese financial institutions.The trend reflects the growing “internationalisation” of the renminbi, while also providing many foreign companies operating in China with an enhanced funding base. Beijing has liberalised the use of the renminbi in Hong Kong as part of a much bigger plan to boost the international role of the currency and reduce China’s reliance on the US dollar.The Galaxy bonds were the first speculative-grade corporate debt offered in Hong Kong’s renminbi market, according to Standard & Poor’s.They yield 58 basis points less than similar maturing investment grade bonds in Shanghai, and less than half the dollar debt of MGM Resorts International.VTB saw strong demand from Asian investors, fund managers and banks, with the deal heavily subscribed. HSBC and VTB Capital are managing the issuance.Bankers said the deal by the Russian bank should help foster closer financial co-operation between China and Russia.The McDonald’s and Caterpillar bonds also experienced strong demand.Both of the companies need the Chinese currency to fund their expansion in the country.

Intel said fourth-quarter sales could be below expectations.Analysts noted that its development of a new chip product, known as Sandy Bridge, could hinder future margin improvement.Linear Technology, which builds components for Apple’s iPad, missed its quarterly earnings target and said next quarter’s earnings could also miss. The shares lost 3.9 per cent to $30.15.However, the technology sector was broadly higher thanks to Intel’s steady consumer sales. Cisco was up 2.5 per cent to $23.18, and Hewlett-Packard added 2.1 per cent to $42.21.JPMorgan Chase topped estimates by reducing its credit loss write-offs, but income in its investment banking division declined.

But the fact they are preparing to go is a very good sign. It shows that Dubai is back as far as many investors are concerned. The restructuring has paved the way for this deal.”HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered have been hired to manage the sale after securing agreement among almost all of the creditors for a restructuring proposal on $23.5bn of debts to the government-owned Dubai World conglomerate.The deal would represent a sharp turnround for Dubai after the announcement in November that the emirate would defer payment on debts held by Dubai World.Dubai is now refocusing efforts on resolving other elements of its $109bn debt mountain, including parts of the $12bn owed by Dubai Holding, a conglomerate owned by the ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.The government last approached international markets in October through a $6.5bn programme. The state-backed utility in April launched a successful bond but had to pay a premium on the $1bn issue.Investor confidence may continue to rise on the belief that support will come from Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, which last year loaned Dubai $20bn to stave off fears of default.This month the group said the formal agreement to restructure the debt, which includes $10bn owed to the government of the UAE, means it is “well-positioned to close restructuring over the coming weeks”.In May, Dubai World reached a deal with seven leading creditor banks representing 60 per cent by value of $14.4bn owed by the conglomerate’s holding company. This offers to pay back the principal over five to eight years on sub-commercial interest rates.Dubai World’s assets include DP World, the ports operator, of which it owns 80 per cent; Inchcape Shipping Services; the Jebel Ali Free Zone; Dubai Maritime City and Drydocks World. Other assets include US retailer Barneys and MGM Resorts.At the heart of the restructuring proposals is a split of Nakheel, the property developer behind some of Dubai’s most ambitious schemes, from the conglomerate. Among its assets are the Atlantis Hotel in Dubai.Additional reporting by Robin Wigglesworth in Abu Dhabi"
71;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2010-08-25T21:10:20Z;Dubai World plans $19bn asset sale;;Dubai World has told lenders it could raise up to $19.4bn from selling its assets, in a bid to repay $14.4bn of the holding company’s debt, the terms of which it is looking to restructure, according to people close to the situation.In late July, the company set out its debt restructuring plan, including a time frame over which it would consider selling assets to raise funds to repay lenders. Since then it has been holding a series of roadshows to explain the plan in detail to creditors.Dubai World set out in its restructuring plan to lenders that it could raise up to $7.6bn over the next five years from the stakes in companies such as Atlantis Hotel in Dubai and US retailer Barney’s as well as in MGM Resorts, some of which are held by its investment arm Istithmar.It could also raise $11.8bn by selling core, “strategic assets” such as DP World, the Jebel Ali Free Zone, Dubai Maritime City and Dry Docks World over the next eight years. A midpoint of $17.6bn has been suggested as a sensible estimate of what lenders could expect, one of the people said.If forced to sell assets at current prices Dubai World would only be able to raise a maximum of $10.4bn, according to the restructuring proposal presented to lenders, the people said.A sale of assets from Istithmar could generate a maximum of $4.5bn during the five year period, but only up to $2bn in a shorter period of time, one of the people said.A co-ordinating committee of creditors holding about 60 per cent of its debts – including banks such as HSBC, Lloyds, RBS and Standard Chartered – have agreed to back the plan.It is offering lenders a 20 basis point consent fee if they sign up to the plan by September 9, a payment that could range from a minimum of $150,000 to $800,000, said one of the people.According to the restructuring proposal, Dubai World’s total debts are $39.9bn – of which about $14.4bn is being restructured – and does not include $11bn of non-recourse debt attached to the assets of Istithmar, the investment company.Dubai World in May announced that it had agreed in principle with its main lenders on terms to extend the $14.4bn debt in tranches of $4.4bn over five years and $10bn over eight years.It is offering lenders a choice of options to restructure their debt, including an increase in the interest paid on the debt and government repayment guarantees.Aidan Birkett, the chief restructuring officer for Dubai World, is expected to remain in the role until the end of the year, according to the sources.
72;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
73;MGM;MGM Resorts International;2005-04-18T11:17:38Z;Singapore bets on casinos to lift economy;;Singapore said on Monday it would build two casino resorts, worth a combined S$5bn (US$3bn), in a controversial move to increase tourism and create jobs.The two casinos, which will be located on the recreation island of Sentosa and a new central property development Marina Bay, will be completed by 2009 and are expected to add S$1.5bn a year to the economy, the government said.The casinos would form the centrepiece of what are expected to be Singapore’s biggest entertainment, hotel and retail complexes and spearhead efforts to double the number of visitors to 17m in 10 years, reversing Singapore’s declining share of Asia’s tourism market.The casino would help create new jobs for unskilled workers as assembly-line manufacturing moves from Singapore to China, said Dominique Dwor-Frecaut, regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. The “integrated resorts” are also expected to boost the ailing construction sector.The prospect of large profits has already attracted 19 of the world’s leading gaming operators to submit initial proposals to build the new resorts. The government said it would award licences for resort development by the end of this year.MGM-Mirage, Las Vegas Sands, Harrah’s Entertainment and Wynn Resorts are seen as the favourites to gain the casino licences since all four are seeking partnerships with state-owned CapitaLand and Keppel Land or other local property developers.But some analysts are sceptical that the casinos will deliver promised economic gains because of doubts they will attract many foreign gamblers.The risk is that Singapore could remain a secondary gambling destination in Asia behind Macao, which has become the centre of Asia’s gaming industry since opening to foreign operators in 2002.“Singapore’s proposed casino would by itself struggle to attract a critical mass of foreign clientele, thus undermining the economic logic of this project,” said a recent report by Morgan Stanley in Singapore.Another worry is a government proposal to charge Singaporeans a S$100 a day entry fee to the casinos to curb the growth of gambling among the local population.But this threatens to reduce significantly casino revenues since Asia’s gaming industry is “highly fragmented and casinos have to rely to a large extent on local clientele”, said Morgan Stanley.In contrast, Merrill Lynch predicted that Singapore’s casinos will attract gamblers from neighbouring countries and capture 60 per cent of the US$735m that Singaporeans spend on gambling abroad.
