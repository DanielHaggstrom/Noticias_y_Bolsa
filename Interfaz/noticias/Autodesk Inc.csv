0;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2018-06-17T09:00:25Z;The digital future is female — but not in a good way;Gorgeous, subservient fembots are on the march;"Last week I got a glimpse of the very near future that I did not like at all.It was London Tech Week, an event blurbed as a “festival of tech and innovation” that lured thousands of people to an exhausting slew of conferences, dinners and parties across the city.First, I went to a talk on Monday at Trainline, an online rail booking company I am partial to because it has a website that is remarkably easy to use and a boss named Clare Gilmartin who was the first chief executive I ever came across who had taken on the job when six months pregnant.The event was billed as a chance to hear “the real reason there aren’t enough women in tech”. I expected the usual gripes about the dearth of female science students, too few female role models and too many female-unfriendly tech companies.What I did not expect was the news that some things are getting worse. Women had just 12 per cent of the programming and software development jobs held by IT and telecoms professionals in the UK last year, down from 15 per cent in 2007, said Amali de Alwis, head of an outfit trying to get more women into tech jobs. In the US, the share of women in computing jobs slid from 36 per cent in 1991 to around 25 per cent in 2016.It is not entirely clear why this is so, but those numbers were on my mind the next day when I went to CogX, a tech fest devoted to artificial intelligence and other advancing technologies.That is where I came across Ava, a “digital human” who takes the idea of the virtual assistant or chatbot to a new and unsettling level.Unlike Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, who can bark at you from a speaker but are otherwise faceless nobodies, Ava looks and more or less talks like a person on your computer screen. She has just been rolled out by Autodesk, a US design software company, where she is the face of customer support for the thousands of architects and engineers who use the firm’s products worldwide.She has sisters on the way. This year, the Daimler car company and NatWest bank said they were working with the same company behind Ava (New Zealand’s Soul Machines) to deliver their own lifelike digital female helpers. All are polite, helpful and in Ava’s case, strikingly gorgeous. In other words, they are precisely the sort of bots one might expect from a tech industry dominated by men.At CogX, however, I discovered the person who had ushered Ava into the world at Autodesk was a 30-year-old woman named Rachael Rekart, director of machine assistance.She told me nine of the 13 people on her team were also women and one of the first things she did when she took on the job of delivering Ava in 2016 was to make her a female too. (An earlier version was a digital man called Otto.)Ms Rekart had heard all the arguments about servile female bots perpetuating dodgy stereotypes in an industry where women are already marginalised. She knew about the survey this year showing only 8 per cent of Americans could name a single female tech leader, and a quarter of those that could named Siri or Alexa.Yet for her, the new breed of artificially intelligent women such as Ava embody female empowerment.“This is the next new revolution in technology,” she said. “They can think faster than us and learn faster than us. Why should they be male?”Ava can solve 2,300 cases a day compared with a human’s paltry 25, and she can do each one in under five minutes while the human workforce takes an average of 1.5 days. She is so good that Autodesk’s human customer support staff are using her to help speed up their own work. And she is, by the way, non-white even though research suggested the company’s typically white male customers would have preferred a Caucasian.I can see all this but I still find the looming army of digital female aides depressing. As Ms Rekart says, research shows people find female voices more “helpful and collaborative”. So Ava and her subservient ilk may well be the face of much of our artificially intelligent future. But if I had a daughter, that is not the sort of future I would ever want to see her joining.pilita.clark@ft.com

1;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2018-05-25T00:28:23Z;Autodesk: celestial being;Software company’s high valuation rests on a smooth transition to the cloud;Praise the cloud. Autodesk, a US software company which used to make profits and now does not, has seen its market value triple in just over two years to $30bn. A venerable computer-aided design company, Autodesk had been profitable for 30 years until 2016. Then it stopped making money, revenues fell, too — and it was rewarded with a jump in valuation.First-quarter results show more losses. Revenues are now back to growth — up 18 per cent year-on-year to $531m — though hardly great shakes for the sector and still lower than they were in 2015. The shares dipped on a slightly disappointing outlook, but put that in context: since Autodesk started making losses, its enterprise value has gone from five to 15 times sales.The reason is “The Transition”, a phrase uttered a dozen times on the conference call. The switch in business model from licensed software to subscriptions sold and delivered via the cloud has helped Microsoft regain its poise as one of the world’s most valuable technology companies and allowed Adobe Systems’ market value to rise 400 per cent in four years.Yet Autodesk is perhaps more remarkable. Neither Adobe nor Microsoft saw steep revenue declines. Investors in Autodesk, backed by positive analyst ratings, have placed a lot of faith in the idea that customers will, over time, pay more for subscriptions than licences.There are specific secular trends that help: manufacturing and construction industries are turning to design software. Autodesk was also vulnerable to piracy, given the high price of its software. Once it moves to subscriptions, that should be eliminated.Subscription growth, though, is decent rather than spectacular at 16 per cent year-on-year. Anyone who wants firm reassurance should look to the annualised recurring revenue number. ARR for subscriptions doubled to $1.4bn in the quarter. The pace had better continue. A sky-high valuation rests on faultless transition to the cloud.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

But by updating its 1960s manufacturing kit ThingMaker, scheduled for release in the autumn, it has hit on a use for 3D printing that may make the technology approachable and stimulate a generation of young makers.The retro-styled ThingMaker looks like an Easy-Bake Oven — a clever piece of design encapsulating sci-fi and home life.The ThingMaker is being sold as a home device for printing plastic toys, with action figures and jewellery the first items that can be made by snapping the parts together. With an app from Autodesk, whose software is used widely in industrial design, users will be able to download templates, or design their own.To increase the chances that more designs will be available in future and the ThingMaker won’t end up gathering dust, Mattel and Autodesk have used open technologies that make it possible to print objects created by other software, or send designs to other printers.Success will depend on whether the technology of 3D printing has been tamed. Besides making the design software intuitive, that will mean creating a reliable 3D printer that can consistently produce high-quality parts.Some of the questions on Mattel’s FAQ page certainly sound daunting and suggest that patient parental assistance will be required. They include: “Why are the printed parts droopy in some places?”But if Mattel is right and a $300 kit is reliable enough for home use, then it might catch a rising wave of interest in the technology — if not among children themselves, then among parents looking for toys that promise to stimulate a higher level of creativity.

None had complications after surgery and all three have thrived, says a study published in April in the journal Science Translational Medicine.The number of life-saving applications of 3D printing in healthcare is growing rapidly.According to recent estimates from Transparency Market Research, the market for 3D printing in medical applications across the globe stood at $354.5m in 2012 and could reach $965.5m by 2019.The most common applications currently involve the creation of implants used in surgery on the face and jaw, particularly when reconstruction is needed due to congenital conditions or trauma, and in cardiac and orthopaedic procedures, says Kevin McAlea, chief operating officer in the healthcare products division of 3D Systems, a printer maker.Surgeons also use 3D-printed models of patients’ organs to prepare for complex surgeries, he says. This gives them a better understanding of what they will encounter in theatre and time to refine their approach ahead of surgery, leading to “enhanced surgeon confidence, surgical time savings and improved accuracy and outcomes”.The technique can also shorten implant surgery waiting times, says Shane Fox, a business development specialist at Within Technologies, a UK arm of US design software company Autodesk.Using 3D printers to create implants in-house, rather than ordering them from external manufacturers, means biomedical engineers can create surgery-ready implants in two to four weeks instead of two to three months. These implants are also patient-specific.Mr Fox says: “Medical implants [from manufacturers] traditionally come in set sizes and are then cut down to fit the patient. Now, we can CT scan areas of the patient’s body and use 3D printing to create an implant that replicates the exact shape needed.”But the most common materials that are produced by 3D printers are still titanium, ceramic and medical-grade polymers, not living human cells. Many experts think that could change, with live human cells becoming the “ink” in 3D printers in a process referred to as “ bioprinting”.In May, French cosmetics company L’Oréal announced a research tie-up with San Diego-based bioprinting start-up Organovo focused on 3D printing human skin for cosmetics testing. Though not a medical application, it is easy to see how 3D-produced skin could help burns victims, for example.The prospect of a 3D-printed kidney, liver or heart remains years off, as creating entire organs will involve work that, for the most part, is impossible today. But the good news is that 3D printing, even in its current form, has the potential to help millions.JawboneIn late 2014, a 23-year-old Syrian man was admitted to Ramban hospital in Haifa, northern Israel, in a critical condition. Caught up in his country’s civil war, a bullet had destroyed his lower jaw. A titanium jawbone was 3D printed by Ramban’s technicians and implanted by professor Adi Rachmiel, director of the hospital’s department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, assisted by Dr Yoav Leiser, who had training in Germany on patient specific implants. A day after surgery, the hospital says, the patient was eating and speaking again.FaceTwo-year-old Violet Pietrok, of Salem, Oregon, was born with frontonasal dysplasia, a rare facial deformity in which the bones that normally fuse to form the foetal face fail to connect, leaving her with a large gap in the centre of her face. Her parents’ search to get help for their daughter took them to Boston Children’s Hospital, where plastic surgeon Dr John Meara used 3D-printed models of Violet’s skull based on magnetic resonance imaging scans, to formulate and test a treatment plan. Six weeks after surgery, Violet was ready to return home to Oregon.HeartCalifornian toddler Esther Perez was born with a ventricular septal defect, a life-threatening congenital heart condition. In most cases, surgeons do not know how to proceed until they have opened the child’s chest in the operating room. In Esther’s case, cardiac surgeon Dr Richard Kim used a 3D-printed model of her heart to plan in advance, “which meant Esther spent less time in surgery and received less anaesthesia, making the procedure safer”, he says. The successful surgery allowed Esther to avoid further multiple operations, a hospital statement said.SkullIn 2014, a 22-year-old Dutch woman was given a new 3D-printed skull in an operation at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. She had a condition in which the skull’s bone thickens, leading to headaches, vision loss, reduced motor co-ordination and death. Brain surgeon Dr Bon Verweij, who performed the operation, says 3D printing means “patients often have better brain function [post-surgery], compared with [older] methods”. Three months after the operation the patient had regained her sight and was back at work.SpineFor the first time, a patient with a degenerative spine condition has been treated using a 3D printed titanium cervical implant. The surgery on the 66-year-old German woman was carried out by Uwe Spetzger, professor of neurosurgery at the Klinikum Karlsruhe, using an implant by German 3D medical implants company EIT Emerging Implant Technologies. The implant does away with the need for additional bone-graft treatment. The patient was able to go home three days after surgery and “is doing very well”, Prof Spetzger says.

Carbon3D is the fund’s first announced investment, which has seen more than 600 companies apply.“The 3D printing industry needs to deliver on its promise to drive the next industrial revolution and [the fund] enables us to identify and support new technologies and teams that will fundamentally change how products are manufactured,” said Carl Bass, chief executive at Autodesk.Although 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, has been around since the 1980s, it is only in recent years that advances in the technology have helped it play a bigger role in both industry and consumer markets. Companies ranging from Boeing, General Electric and Siemens are already using 3D printing methods to make end products.The global products and services market for 3D printing rose 35.2 per cent from 2013 to $4.1bn in 2014, according to a report published this week by Wohlers Associates, a 3D printing consultancy.However, wider adoption of the technology has been limited by the time it takes to print, the cost of the machines and the quality of the materials.From a red puddle of liquid plastic, a three-dimensional sphere of connected hexagons and pentagons begins to rise, taking only six minutes to be lifted by mechanical arm into its final geometric form.Continue readingCarbon3D, which is backed by technology investment groups Sequoia Capital and Silver Lake Kraftwerk, claims its technique can print objects in a matter of minutes, compared with hours in conventional 3D printing.Rather than printing objects layer by layer such as current 3D printing, Carbon3D’s technology works by harnessing light and oxygen to grow objects from a pool of resin. Different shapes can be created by balancing the interaction of light, to solidify the resin, and oxygen, to prevent the resin from solidifying.Joseph DeSimone, chief executive and co-founder of Carbon3D, said: “By working at the intersection of hardware, software and molecular science, we are aiming to fundamentally address the issues that have held 3D printing back from becoming a manufacturing process.” The group plans to launch its first 3D printer and a range of materials in the next year.“It certainly appears that they have the ability to make parts very quickly with the printer,” said Pete Basiliere, an analyst at consultancy Gartner.However, he cautioned about comparing speeds to other 3D printers. “Some of the slowest technologies may not have the same capabilities as Carbon 3D — but they are purposely designed to process other materials than polymer.”Carbon3D was founded in 2013 by researchers at the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State University and has raised more than $41m in funding.Letter in response to this report:Let’s gallop lightly over to additive manufacturing / From Antoon Houvenaghel
5;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2015-04-09T10:55:01Z;Rise of the 3D printing machines;‘Terminator’ technology threatens manufacturing pioneers;From a red puddle of liquid plastic, a three-dimensional sphere of connected hexagons and pentagons begins to rise, taking only six minutes to be lifted by mechanical arm into its final geometric form.It is a phenomenon known as “continuous liquid interface production”, and has been developed by Carbon3D — a Silicon Valley start-up backed by technology investment group Sequoia Capital. But while it was inspired by a scene from the science fiction film Terminator 2, when the T-1000 android rises from a small pool of metallic liquid, the new technique is very much a reality — and set to shake up the 3D printing industry by making the process of forming plastic objects up to 100 times faster.Since 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, was pioneered in the 1980s, it has been widely expected to revolutionise the manufacturing of complex components, from medical implants to jet engine parts. But growing competition from start-ups, such as Carbon3D, and household names such as HP, is now putting pressure on the tech companies that developed the fledgling industry.Two of the largest 3D printing companies, US-based 3D Systems and Israel’s Stratasys, are already finding that investors are questioning their continued dominance. 3D Systems shares have fallen 71 per cent, from a high of $96 at the start of 2014 to $28 today. Similarly, Stratasys’s Nasdaq-traded shares are down 61 per cent over the same period, from a high of $136 to $56.“There’s a possibility that you look at the current crop of public 3D printing companies and they will be like the computer companies of the 1980s — brands that are footnotes in computer history,” warns Carl Bass, chief executive officer at Autodesk, the US-listed software company.“It’s not obvious that being first to market really means you lead forever.”Both 3D Systems and Stratasys, as well as their smaller rivals ExOne, Arcam and Voxeljet, have endured a tough 15 months, in which their revenue growth has failed to live up to the hype.Pieter Busscher, manager of the RobecoSAM Smart Materials fund, says they failed to live up to their stock market valuations. “Essentially, what we saw up until 2014 was a bit of a bubble in the works. Multiples at the end of 2013 were anywhere between 60-100 times earnings.”Slower than expected revenue growth also coincided with a need to spend more to sustain their competitive positions, notes Scott Schmitz, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.Over the past three quarters, organic revenue growth at 3D Systems has been between 7-12 per cent, well below guidance of 30 per cent. Stratasys achieved a better organic growth rate of 31 per cent in 2014.However, it unveiled an accelerated investment plan that is likely to keep operating margins in the 10-14 per cent range for the next couple of years, compared with its own long-term guidance of 18-23 per cent, Mr Schmitz points out.Nevertheless, these margins and growth rates have still been enough to attract the attention of conventional printing groups. Hewlett-Packard has revealed plans to enter the sector in 2016, with a 3D printer that it claims will be faster and cheaper than existing machines.Pete Basiliere, an analyst at consultancy Gartner, believes HP is not the only household name eyeing up the space. “By the end of 2016 we’ll see at least three of the big printer makers in the market with their own branded 3D printer,” he predicts.But with at least a year until these rival products appear, competitors have time to respond, Mr Schmitz says. “HP needs to develop new go-to-market channels as 3D printers target a different audience than PCs and office printers.”3D Systems and Stratasys have so far tried to maintain their competitive position by buying up other companies, making about 60 acquisitions between them in the past five years — including providers of 3D printing materials, hardware and software. In 2013, Stratasys bought MakerBot, a New York start-up that produces cheap, easy-to-use 3D printers, for about $403m, although it has since booked a $100m impairment charge following disappointing performance.Both companies require the use of their own materials with their printers, but Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, suggests that in future there will be separate specialists selling printers, software and materials.He points to Germany’s SLM Solutions, which focuses on making metal printers and partners with various materials companies. It increased its unit orders by 138 per cent in 2014, and its revenue by 56 per cent. Conversely, software provider Autodesk is adopting an open approach by teaming up with materials and printer companies.Terry Wohlers of Wohlers Associates, a 3D printing consultancy, agrees that it will become increasingly difficult for companies to compete with products that are “closed and locked to prevent third-party products and solutions”.However, the big incumbents will be reluctant to open up their business models while they can achieve such high profit margins on materials sales. In 2014, 3D Systems achieved a margin of 73 per cent on materials, compared with 36 per cent for its printers.And demand for 3D printing materials is only going to rise. Gartner expects worldwide shipments of 3D printers to reach 217,350 units in 2015, and then take off to 2.3m by 2018.Conventional 3D printing is under threat — and the enemy is a technique that has been inspired by Hollywood science fiction, writes Tanya Powley.Technology company Carbon3D is pioneering a manufacturing technique that pulls a three-dimensional object out of liquid resin — similar to the way the T-1000 cyborg emerges from a pool of liquid metal in the Terminator 2 film.While conventional 3D printing builds up an object layer by layer, “continuous liquid interface production”, known as Clip, works by projecting light and the object image through an oxygen-permeable window into a reservoir of UV curable resin.Areas of resin that are exposed to oxygen do not harden, but those that are not exposed solidify to form the object shape. A build platform lifts the object continuously as its “grows” out of the resin pool.Different shapes can therefore be created by balancing the interaction of light, to solidify the resin, and oxygen, to prevent the resin from solidifying.Joseph DeSimone, chief executive officer and co-founder of Carbon3D, says the technology offers game-changing manufacturing speeds — between 25 and 100 times faster than conventional 3D printing — as well as higher quality products.“We brought our expertise in chemistry and physics to an industry that relies on mechanical processes,” says Mr DeSimone, who has spent the past two years working on the technology.Carbon3D plans to launch a 3D printer in the next 12 months, which will be targeted at businesses rather than the consumer market.If the technology proves commercially successful, it could rapidly increase the use of 3D printing in manufacturing, which has so far been held back by slow speeds, product quality and the cost of machines and materials.Back to the top of the page
6;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2014-10-31T17:05:34Z;Welding with Autodesk CEO Carl Bass;The software guru, a prominent figure in the ‘maker movement’, is used to working with bright sparks;The secret to welding is using your ears. A good weld has a consistent crackle, like frying bacon. If you don’t hear that sound, the welding gun is too far away from the metal.I’m standing over a welding table alongside Carl Bass, chief executive of Autodesk. The company is known for producing sleek engineering software, such as AutoCAD. But the task in front of us is a simple one in engineering terms: to build a low, square coffee table out of steel, with a bamboo top. But to those of us used to wielding a pen rather than a welding gun, it seems intimidating indeed.For Bass, 57, it is the sort of project he might toss off in a morning. He’s been building things most of his life, starting in college when he needed furniture for his dormitory room. He eventually dropped out and worked as a carpenter. “I was actually travelling across the country and I ran out of gas, and money, and this guy gave me gas and a job as a carpenter, building houses,” he recalls.Five years later he went back to university, earned a mathematics degree and started a software company that was acquired by Autodesk. But the maker bug stayed with him. Today he has become a prominent figure in the “maker movement” – the tech-influenced, do-it-yourself craze that has gained traction as the internet and 3D printing have given “makers” access to tools and information previously unreachable. “I like the maker movement because the craft is evolving,” he says. “There is a new kind of manufacturing – people are going to combine what they do on computers and what they do with making things.”Bass sees the maker movement as a useful counterpoint to the rest of Silicon Valley. He points to people launching more hardware start-ups. “Personally I’m thrilled that we’ve gone away from everyone making social networking apps to people actually making interesting things.”After sketching out a model for our table on Bass’s computer, we head back to the welding room. We are in the Autodesk workshop in San Francisco, and various employees and “artists in residence” are busy with water jets or computer-controlled cutting machines as we pass through.We begin by cutting the steel to the right length and then laying out the parts on the welding table. “Welding is a little easier than woodworking,” Bass assures me, explaining that metal can be more forgiving than wood. “You can fill in the gaps, you can melt some things. It’s just like a glue gun.”A glue gun that sends out very, very powerful bursts of electricity – creating enough UV light to sunburn your skin. We need to protect ourselves. “The first thing is, you’ve gotta get dressed up,” Bass says with a grin as he hands me a large leather jacket and a pair of gloves. We turn up the darkness settings on our welding helmets. “When this thing goes off, it’s going to be really bright,” he says.Personally I’m thrilled that we’ve gone away from everyone making social networking apps to people actually making interesting thingsWe practise on a piece of scrap metal, with Bass giving a demo. I pull my helmet down and everything goes dim. All I can see is the bright green light of the welding arc. Bass makes it seem easy. We lift our helmets and there it is: a plump, even strip of melted steel has been deposited on the piece of scrap.Now it’s my turn. I grasp the welding gun in my gloved hands, pull my helmet down and push the on button. In an instant, everything goes darker and suddenly the welding arc is crackling loudly and a green light is shining at the end of the welding gun. I’m so startled that I let go. Then I open up my helmet to inspect a rather wimpy blot of melted steel. “Do it again,” Bass says encouragingly. He suggests I use my left hand as a brace for my right. “You want to be as steady as you can.”After a few more practice tries, it’s time to turn to the actual table. We begin by clamping four steel pieces on to our worktable, tapping and aligning them to a perfect square. Metal moves when heated, so we tack the pieces with two dots of metal before applying a full weld.As we fall into a routine, Bass explains his rule: “If it stops sounding like frying bacon, it’s because you’ve probably got it a little far away,” he says. To a neophyte, it’s not only the sounds of welding that are surprising, but also the smells: the workshop is permeated with the odour of burning hair. I’m assured that this is what ozone smells like – ozone is released by the welding arc – but it’s hard to shake the sensation that I might be on fire.After the welding is finished it’s time to grind down the welds so that we have a smooth, square frame. This is a moment of truth: the grinding process will show which welds were solid and which were not.We put on noise-blocking headphones. The grinder screeches as it touches the metal and a fountain of sparks flies across the room. Bass moves the blade in a slow, polishing movement. The previously lumpy joints become smooth and luminous, the steel surprisingly beautiful.Bass’s maker bent has influenced the direction of Autodesk since he took the helm in 2006. The company has expanded its products and services that are accessible to the layperson and has moved into areas such as 3D printing. It has even, to Bass’s great delight, acquired Instructables, a popular “how to” website for makers.But I wonder what room there is for craft, for “making”, in an increasingly digitised world. Is the process being cannibalised by robots and software? Bass says that he is “split on robots”, because of their impact on jobs, but that making overall has been evolving, benefiting from the new tools at makers’ disposal. “There used to be a real looking-down on things that were done by hand,” he says. That’s not the case any more, as makers can make stuff that is really complicated and of high quality.How about what we did this morning – couldn’t that have been done better by a machine?“You can find an industrial welding robot, sure,” he says. “It would weld perfectly but it only does exactly what you tell it to do. You and I can look at our table and say, this joint wasn’t quite right, or the surface, and we could adjust.” On the other hand, he says, if you wanted to make 10,000 tables, then you might prefer a robot.But even if robots were every bit as crafty as humans, Bass believes people would still want to make things. “Much of making today isn’t required. We could go buy a table if we wanted to. But it’s incredibly interesting that people still have this desire to make stuff,” he says. “Whether it’s cooking or sewing or welding or woodwork. It runs pretty deep. It’s almost one of the things that defines humans, this desire to make stuff.”Leslie Hook is the FT’s Lex writer in San FranciscoPhotographs: Justin Kaneps
7;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2014-06-30T22:29:09Z;Salesforce.com at the crossroads;;Salesforce.com, the company that did more than any other to invent the software-as-a-service industry, is reaching a turning point.After years of rapid growth, it has a pressing need for the more evolved infrastructure, processes and rounded management team of the large company it has become. And with growth starting to slow, it is coming closer to a seminal moment: when investors will start expecting it to report real profits, and not just on a pro-forma basis. The appointment of a new chief financial officer on Monday is the latest sign that is preparing for the changes.Mark Hawkins, CFO of Autodesk for the last five years, made it clear that he thinks changes will be needed as Salesforce looks beyond the $5bn in revenues expected for this year. As a veteran of Dell and Hewlett-Packard at a time when those companies went through significant growth, he made much of his experience during an interview on Monday.“I am not new to scaling,” he said. “What works at $500m doesn’t work at $5bn – and what works at $5bn doesn’t work at $10bn.”Mr Hawkins, 55, replaces Graham Smith, 54, who announced his retirement earlier this year. It’s a smooth transition, but hard to escape the conclusion that this is the latest step in assembling a management team with more big-company experience to back up CEO Marc Benioff.Keith Block, a former head of Oracle in North America, was brought in last year to head sales. As one person familiar with Salesforce’s internal workings puts it: when a company gets to be this size, the CEO can no longer double as its salesman-in-chief – something that Mr Benioff has done admirably in his company’s first 15 years.Harder to handicap is what Mr Hawkins’ arrival means for the company’s financial strategy.Salesforce has thrived on the “jam tomorrow rather than jam today” principle: that it could deliver bottom-line profits at any time but there’s more value to be had from investing for rapid growth. Mr Hawkins wasn’t giving anything away on Monday, pledging “continuity” with the existing approach.“It’s difficult to grow fast and expand margins,” said Mr Smith, while claiming that the company has a “clear line of sight to [revenues of] $10bn” based on the markets it is already in.Some investors, however, have started to ask when this will translate into profits. And according to a person familiar with the board’s thinking, this is also a question that has been on the minds of the company’s directors.Lower stock-based compensation expenses in the coming years will help, said Mr Smith. But with acquisitions expected to play a big part in its continued expansion, he also warned that amortisation costs from deals could delay the move into profit under formal US accounting rules.“I would certainly be hopeful that by the time we get to $10bn we’ll be GAAP profitable,” he concluded.Whether investors will be prepared to wait that long is starting to loom as one of the big questions facing the company.
8;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2014-03-07T17:28:58Z;What’s all the excitement about IPOs?;PetsAtHome is gearing up to float;"What are you going to do with your Vodafone cash?It’s a question that’s likely to be asked in living rooms and boardrooms alike after the mobile phone giant returned over £50bn to its shareholders as part of an agreement to sell its stake in US mobile operator Verizon Wireless.I didn’t own Vodafone shares but I have the same dilemma courtesy of a holding in a much smaller business – niche Birmingham software specialist Delcam. I can hardly complain – I had owned the shares for a good seven years and the price paid by US group Autodesk represented a near-sixfold gain.There was no share or loan note alternative, so I am left with cash representing 16 per cent of my non-Isa portfolio. I don’t think I have ever been so liquid. The first thing I have to do is set aside 28 per cent for capital gains tax, since the shares were held outside an Isa courtesy of the old rule on Aim shares. Tax is of course a fact of investment life, but I do resent paying a flat rate that takes no account of the time the shares were held – having lived with varying rates of capital gains tax over the years, I am convinced that some differential between “short” and “long” term gains is the way forward.So I am looking for new investments. But after years of stellar gains for smaller companies– they have been the top performers since the market reached its low five years ago – value is getting harder to find.Could the considerable pipeline of initial public offerings bring forth something attractive? We’ve just had AO, this month will see biotech outfit Circassia start trading in London, and following that we may well see DFS, McColl, Pets At Home, Polly Pipe, Poundland, Saga and Zoopla queueing up to list their shares.But how many of these will satisfy my fairly demanding criteria? I am still conditioned to buying on juicy dividend yields and single figure price-earnings ratios. The answer is probably: not many.Use the FT’s Stock Screener to narrow down your choice of more than 34,000 global shares, using fundamental measuresMany of these businesses are being brought to market by private equity groups, who may well have built them up during their period of ownership by providing extra resources, applying expertise, incentivising management and reducing costs. However, such groups are not charities. They will be out to maximise their profit by selling shares into a buoyant market for the highest price they can get.They are also experts in the use of debt. I read, for example, that KKR – the owner of Pets At Home (who took over from previous private equity owner Bridgepoint) is set to “make £160m from unwinding a ‘toxic’ form of high interest debt originally used to buy the business four years ago”. If anything, Pets At Home – and perhaps Saga – are the only IPOs which I will look more closely at. PetsAtHome is an excellent 300-store business in a growth sector and its shares are being offered to retail investors as well as institutions. But I already have an indirect interest in the sector through my holding in the well-managed and highly rated agricultural services business Wynnstay, which operates 21 Just For Pets stores.The flotation of online electrical goods retailer AO confirmed my fears that the IPO market is frothy. It was clear from the start this company was shooting for an Asos-style rating, and the shares duly shot up on the first day of trading. Definitely not one for me! We can expect more of this; private equity owners will be “giving away” to new investors as little as they can get away with, and weeks of horse-trading lie ahead for brokers and institutional investors as launch prices are haggled over.To be fair, the recently-listed Merlin Entertainments has moved ahead nicely since its (private-equity backed) flotation, while Direct Line Insurance has also ticked up nicely since being listed as an independent business. On the junior market, Conviviality Retail has also done well. This shows that IPOs are not automatically a bad investment. But at the end of the day, I still doubt whether the coming procession of new listings is going to make much of a dent in my cash pile.John Lee is an active private investor and the author of “How To Make A Million – Slowly”.

Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2014-03-03T21:43:21Z;Darden digests the winter blues;;Shares in restaurant operator Darden slid after the company said fiscal third-quarter profits would miss expectations as consumers chose to eat at home amid the chilly winter that has gripped the US.Sales at most of the company’s restaurants fell in the December to February period, including an 8.8 per cent dip at Red Lobster and 5.4 per cent drop at Olive Garden.The company forecast quarterly earnings of 82 cents per share, including 6 cents in costs related to its plans to split off the Red Lobster chain.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of 93 cents a share.“We are working diligently to complete the separation and to implement the other elements of our comprehensive plan to address changing industry dynamics,” chief executive Clarence Otis said.The announcement follows continued jockeying by activist investor fund Starboard Value, which owns 5.5 per cent of the restaurant group.Last week, Starboard filed a preliminary solicitation statement with US securities regulators in an attempt to force the company to hold a special shareholder meeting.The fund, which opposes Darden’s plans to split Red Lobster, is attempting to pass a non-binding resolution to keep the Darden Board from approving any transaction involving a Red Lobster separation ahead of the 2014 annual meeting.“We reiterate our hold rating and recommend zero new-money purchases on expected weakness today, given our ongoing conviction that there is very little activist-related value creation opportunity,” Stifel analyst Christopher Innes said.Darden was the worst-performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500 as its shares slid 5.3 per cent to $48.33.Shares in Autodesk fell 1.5 per cent to $51.67 as analysts at Citigroup downgraded the company to sell from neutral.Analyst Walter Pritchard said that the company, which has followed Adobe’s decision to shift to a subscription model where companies and consumers pay a monthly fee to access its software, had not seen a significant uptake by users.Citi estimates it will take the rental products 15 months to equal the one-time payment Autodesk had previously earned when customers paid upfront. The monthly charges may also alienate some clients, Citi said.“When considering that the desktop rental customer would see substantial increase in total cost of ownership versus either upgrade or maintenance subscription, we believe the overwhelming majority of customers would bypass subscription,” Mr Pritchard said.Car rental operator Hertz Global fell 2.7 per cent to $27.25 after it disclosed that it would need to revise previous financial statements.Hertz, which has recently implemented new financial disclosure systems, said it found adjustments to past reports that would force revisions.The changes are not expected to have a material impact on Hertz’s reported financial or liquidity positions.The company also said it would be unable to file its annual report with US securities regulators on time and had requested an extension.US carmakers broadly declined on Monday as February sales figures showed a difficult trading month.While sales accelerated at the end of the month, several executives stressed the impact severe weather had at the start of 2014.General Motors said sales fell 1 per cent from a year earlier, compared to Wall Street expectations for a 7.7 per cent dip.Ford sales dipped a steeper than forecast 6 per cent during the period. Ford vice-president John Felice said deliveries “surged in the final week, providing us momentum after a slow start to the month”.Ford shares fell 1.2 per cent to $15.20 while GM nudged up to $36.21.Overall, US equity markets followed their European peers lower as geopolitical conflict in Ukraine more than offset better than expected economic reports in the world’s largest economy.The S&P 500 was down 0.74 per cent to 1,845.73 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.94 per cent to 16,168.03. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.72 per cent to 4,277.30.
11;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2013-05-14T04:02:02Z;Hardware startups get hardcore at Haxlr8r;;This week seems to be maker week in Silicon Valley. In the run-up to Saturday’s Maker Faire in San Mateo are a string of events and conferences for hardware startups and the folk building them.Kickstarting the week, Haxlr8r – a hardware-hacker accelerator programme that takes ten startups to Shenzhen for three months – held its demo day at the Autodesk Gallery in downtown San Francisco on Monday afternoon. Ten startups pitched their ideas, fresh from the factory floor in China, to a group of early stage investors.“Manufacturing is changing,” said Cyril Ebersweiler, Haxlr8r’s founder, in his introduction. “It’s not about outsourcing anymore to another country – it’s about leveraging the knowledge base and integrating the ecosystems which are completely worldwide. Everything you see today started from zero. The only benefit that a startup has is time so getting onto the market as quickly as possible with a product that can sell is critical.”Being based in Shenzhen helps with rapid prototyping, added Zach Hoeken Smith, programme director at the group and a co-founder of Makerbot. “You can find small runs and factory prototypes, and work through all the problems that would take you weeks over email,” he said. “This just gives you crazy fast iteration… You should not wait until you launch your Kickstarter and raise a million bucks before you talk to your manufacturer.”But despite the presence of traditional investors, almost every company presenting was or soon planned to list its connected device on Kickstarter, too, to cover the costs of the first run or test demand. Clyde, a “smart” lamp, has already raised $11,300 on its first day, after being selected as a staff pick by the crowdfunding site.Clyde’s makers, Fabule, were among the standouts from a largely impressive group of startups, considering few were little more than an idea just 15 weeks ago. By providing downloadable “personality modules” – such as being “scared of the dark”, or lighting up when the sun goes down – Fabule’s Amanda Williams said that she wanted to create an object that was “not just smart but expressive and delightful”. It’s a nice contrast to the more staid, robotic spins on the smart home.I was also impressed by Helios Biking, a pair of handlebars embedded with Bluetooth and bright, programmable LEDs. The $199 kit, which will launch on Kickstarter on Saturday, is controlled with an iPhone app and can change colour according to cycling speed or to aid navigation by indicating where and when you should turn. It also comes with an inbuilt GPS and GSM connection that can broadcast its location to the app if the bike is stolen.“We’re changing the way you interact with your bike,” said founder Kenny Gibbs, who hoped to raise $500,000 to work on a completely integrated smart bike for launch next year.Finally – and perhaps inevitably – comes Vibease: a “smart vibrator”. The sex toy connects to an Android phone via Bluetooth which syncs its movements to an audio “fantasy”.The San Francisco- and Singapore-based company hopes to create the “iTunes for erotica” by offering an array of 99 cent downloads.“Hardware alone is not enough,” said founder Dema Tio.
12;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2013-02-27T13:00:49Z;Leap Motion announces pricing, launch date;;Leap Motion has announced a ship date and retail price for its eagerly anticipated motion controller for PCs and Macs.The sensor, the size of a pack of chewing gum, is shipping later than planned and at a higher price. It ships on May 13, when the previous launch date had been “early 2013”. It will cost $80 – $10 more than the previous pre-order price.“We think it’s a steal, very affordable, it’s the price of an expensive mouse,” said Andy Miller, chief operating officer, in an FT interview.The launch delay was mainly due to co-ordinating the efforts of Leap Motion’s developer community rather than any technical problems with the device, he added.The company announced it would be launched with an app store called Airspace, which would feature dozens of apps optimised for the device.Out of the box, users would plug the Leap Motion Controller into a USB port, receive an on-screen tutorial and download software to enable use of gestures for computing such as scrolling in a browser and manipulating objects..Airspace apps at launch will include a number of games such as Disney’s Wreck-it Ralph:Sugar Rush Speedway, Double Fine’s Dischord music-based game and ZeptoLab’s Cut the Rope. There will be 3D design apps and tools from Autodesk and Corel, as well as more general apps such as The Weather Channel and the Clear to-do app.The apps will follow common gestures developed for the controller, with some featuring special actions – a punching action in the Wreck-It Ralph racing game gives a boost to the car being driven, for example.Leap Motion said the controller would begin shipping to more than 100 countries where consumers had pre-ordered the device on May 13 and would go on sale at Best Buy stores in the US on May 19, in an exclusive retail deal. For now, the only other place the device can be obtained will be on Leap Motion’s website.The San Francisco-based company, which claims its technology is over a hundred times more precise and sensitive than rivals’ offerings, announced a $30m funding round and a deal with Asus in January.The Taiwanese PC maker is to include the controller in the box with new high-end notebooks and premium All-in-One PCs introduced worldwide later this year.Leap Motion’s technology can track movements to within a hundredth of a millimetre, without noticeable lag. The bar has a 150-degree field of view, and tracks individual hands and all 10 fingers at 290 frames per second, allowing very detailed manipulations and the 3D-effect of moving forwards and backwards or at an angle in a computer screen.
13;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2012-08-20T15:37:50Z;OnLive to shed staff in restructuring;;OnLive, the provider of a revolutionary service for streaming and playing console-quality games over the internet, has announced a restructuring of the company that avoids bankruptcy but has led to the laying off of about half its 200-strong workforce.Privately held OnLive has been the leading exponent of “cloud gaming”, proving wrong those who doubted its technology – with video games from leading publishers playable in high quality without noticeable lag over its network. The two-year-old service has an active base of more than 1.5m subscribers, according to the company.The Silicon Valley group gave no reason for the restructuring, other than that its board was “faced with difficult financial decisions”. It used an “assignment for the benefit of creditors”, or ABC, a legal manoeuvre sometimes utilised by insolvent companies as an alternative to bankruptcy proceedings.OnLive has kept confidential its level of funding and critics have questioned whether a start-up could afford the infrastructure costs for servicing a broad range of devices from televisions to tablets, phones and computers, as its platform has rapidly expanded.In a statement on Sunday, OnLive admitted it was “rare among start-ups” in trying to do this.“Only a few major corporations have ever developed and deployed products and services across such a broad spectrum,” it said.OnLive’s main rival, Gaikai, was bought by Sony for $380m last month. OnLive’s last big round of funding was announced in September 2009, involving AT&T Media Holdings and Lauder Partners alongside previous investors Warner Bros, Autodesk and Maverick Capital.Under the ABC, OnLive said Lauder Partners became the first investor in a newly formed company that had acquired all of OnLive’s assets on Friday. As a result, the service was expected to continue without disruption, with customers unaffected, although OnLive shareholders have been wiped out by the transaction.Among the shareholders wiped out in the restructure was HTC, the Taiwanese smartphone company. Last year, HTC had invested $40m in OnLive to expand its access to mobile gaming technology. At the time, the investment was seen as a promising sign of OnLive’s ability to achieve its goal of providing games for a range of platforms, not just desk-bound PCs.OnLive said big announcements of new products and services were still planned.Almost half of OnLive’s staff have been offered jobs with the new company, whose founder Steve Perlman is understood to be still at the helm. OnLive said more would be offered jobs once additional funding was secured.Additional reporting by Sarah Mishkin in Taipei
14;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2012-07-18T18:09:54Z;An education in tech reunions;Will experience pay off for the ex-AOL team that has re-formed for a new venture?;"The three letters AOL have become for many a shorthand for hubris. At the height of the dotcom boom, the company that got America online bought Time Warner’s venerable magazine and movie studio brands for stock. Soon after, it was unravelling in a spectacular clash of cultures.“In certain respects, this is AOL Time Warner done right,” says Miles Gilburne, as the professorial venture capitalist embarks on an animated explanation of ePals, his online education company.Mr Gilburne should know. After selling a company called NaviSoft to AOL in 1994, he became the group’s head of corporate development, leading its acquisitions of CompuServe and Netscape. He sat on the boards of AOL and AOL Time Warner, before stepping down in 2006 after the departure of Steve Case, AOL’s founder.AOL has since been spun off by Time Warner, and few senior members of its founding generation are left. But at ePals, Mr Gilburne has brought many of the old team back together for what has become a test case of how a team can apply the lessons learnt from the rise and fall of an earlier venture.“Everybody who’s sitting at the table understands how to build disruptive start-up companies,” Mr Gilburne says. “You need business experience to do what we’re trying to do [around] the world, and you need to have people who like each other.”Ed Fish, ePals’ president, once ran AOL’s subscription services and products such as AOL Instant Messenger. Eduardo Hauser, who leads ePals’ media division, started AOL’s Latin American operations. Other executives worked in AOL’s business affairs unit, led its internet services technology platform, and ran operations for its flagship America Online service.The fast-changing nature of the technology sector, with its proliferation of start-ups and constant dealmaking, has allowed a number of former business teams to benefit from being reincarnated in a new venture (see below).“You develop a common frame of reference so you don’t have to start fresh every time,” explains Carl Bass, the chief executive of software company Autodesk, who has found himself working alongside former teammates from Ithaca Software, which Autodesk bought in 1993.Sean Knapp, who left Google in 2007 to set up an online video company called Ooyala with two of his colleagues, notes that, with start-ups, “your early investors are backing the team and their ability to navigate a huge amount of adversity and uncertainty”.At ePals, the AOL reunion extends to the company’s investor register, which is studded with familiar names. Mr Case and his wife Jean were early backers. Ted Leonsis, once AOL’s vice-chairman, William Raduchel, a former AOL chief technology officer, and Yossi Vardi, the Israeli internet entrepreneur who sold ICQ to AOL, are also investors.Jimdo
Co-founders Christian Springub, Fridtjof Detzner and Matthias Henze previously worked together at NorthClick, a German-based web design service, before setting up Jimdo, a website-building tool that has been used to build more than 6m sites. “Our prior friendship allowed us to step on the gas from day one and fully concentrate on building the business,” says Mr Springub. “Our chemistry gave us confidence in each other.”Ooyala
Co-founders, brothers Bismarck and Belsasar Lepe and friend Sean Knapp, left Google to start Ooyala, an online video company, in 2007. “Knowing each other and having similar values helps us avoid arguing over mundane topics for weeks on end,” says Bismarck Lepe.Autodesk
Carl Bass, chief executive of software company Autodesk, joined with its acquisition of Ithaca Software in 1993, which he founded. He says working with colleagues who also joined from Ithaca helped him with the transition to a larger company. “It was great to have a core group of people who had that shared experience so we could go through this adjustment together.”“Miles has built a management team and board that understands the disruptive potential that technology can play in an existing market,” Mr Case says when asked what the shared AOL experience brings to ePals.Mr Gilburne also brought in Thomas Middelhoff to chair ePals Europe. The former chief executive of media group Bertelsmann turned an early $50m investment in AOL into a stake worth billions of dollars before the two groups split after the Time Warner deal and Mr Middelhoff fell out with Bertelsmann’s controlling family. Mr Middelhoff says the shared history of those involved in ePals “means we have a whole lot of business experience together, a lot of trust and even, at the end, friendship”.EPals describes itself as “the safe social learning network”. At its most basic, it is a network for digital penpals; a way to connect a classroom in Washington to one in San Francisco, Moscow or Shanghai. Layered on top of the network that now connects more than 27m students in 700,000 classrooms across 200 countries, however, are content and products aimed at encouraging collaborative learning, rather than just idle chat.As veterans of AOL’s anything-goes message board era, one lesson ePals’ founders learnt from the team’s previous incarnation was the importance of allaying parental concerns about what might happen on an unscreened forum. As a result, everything is monitored and schools can apply their own policies to the platform – a critical provision for markets such as China, which are suspicious of unchecked online networks.The new ePals business model is a broader mix of revenue streams than AOL had, bringing in subscriptions, licensing, sponsorship and e-commerce. Customers include the New York City department of education and the International Baccalaureate; sponsors include National Geographic and the Smithsonian; and third party developers can offer their applications over ePals’ platform.The business is a fraction of the size of traditional suppliers to the education market such as McGraw-Hill, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt or Pearson, which owns the Financial Times. Cormark Securities estimates that revenues will grow from under $3m in 2011 to $17.5m in 2013, and ePals has told investors it should pass $100m in sales by 2015.In contrast to AOL, the ePals team is aiming from the start at a global audience.It has struck a joint venture in China with Jiren Liu, founder, chairman and chief executive of Neusoft Corporation, a large Chinese technology company with education interests through its IT training institutes. “Before, education was very much country-oriented,” he says. “We can localise their platform, their business model and their content.”About 40 per cent of ePals’ users are now outside the US.The AOL veterans involved with ePals see similarities between the two companies. “We were here at the birth of the PC; we were here at the birth of the internet; and now we’re watching this reverberation go through media,” Mr Leonsis says.“This is maybe the second time in my life I’m saying this will be something big,” adds Mr Middelhoff.They may yet be proven wrong. As Mr Gilburne notes calmly: “I had to learn about failure early on in business. If you were not failing you were not trying. The nice thing about doing this so many times is we fail not infrequently, and we may fail with this. This is as difficult as anything I’ve ever done.”Additional reporting by Vinjeru Mkandawire"
15;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2012-06-14T15:54:28Z;Programmed for personalisation;;3D printing is among a spectrum of technologies being developed as a way of making it easier and more cost efficient to create parts and products in a “personalised” way. Key to this are software techniques aimed at helping designers create shapes of parts in three dimensions on computer screens and then transfer the instructions for making them to production machines.Software of this type is made by companies such as Dassault Systèmes of France or Autodesk of the US. Increasingly, such businesses are trying to simplify the process of using their software so that it can be applied to the task of making items in small batches – or perhaps one unique part – rather than long production runs. Such software is being used to make products on this basis in a range of industries from aerospace engines to jewellery.Laser scanning systems – made by companies such as Faro Technologies of the US – can be used to measure the dimensions of items that need to be replicated or modified. Such items could be anything from products or parts made by competitors – in “reverse engineering” – to parts of the human body. The information can then be converted into computer codes and sent to a production machine for turning into a solid object.Profiles of the leading players in the sectorAn example of where such processes are useful in personalising manufacturing is hearing aids. Here the manufacturer uses laser scanning to formulate a digital description of a person’s inner ear, with the information then used to create a shape that will fit the individual’s unique physiological features.A third area of technology where developments are moving quickly is conventional machine tools – “subtractive” manufacturing systems – that have been used to make parts normally on the basis of large production batches.Increasingly, the programs used to run such machines are being designed so that the tools can be used to create items in small batches rather than large ones, so as to allow for “personalised” forms of production. ProtoLabs is a US group that uses such conventional machine tools – made by Haas, another US business – to make parts and products in this way.

But the benchmark US index eventually closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,236.92.“Its very frustrating. We’re trying to shift back to a US-centric analysis, but this Fitch report has brought the eurozone back into focus,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.6 per cent to 11,905.97, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.7 per cent to 2,639.61.Elsewhere on Wednesday, companies along the hard drive supply chain were given a boost, after Western Digital Corp, the single largest manufacturer, said it had reached a deal with Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK to buy “heads” – a crucial component in hard drives, which Western Digital has had trouble manufacturing since it closed factories due to flooding in Thailand last month.Western Digital shares closed up 7.1 per cent to $26.82, also boosted by a report that the European Commission will clear the company’s bid to acquire Hitachi’s hard drive unit.“This is a big deal as heads were the biggest challenge to restarting production,” said Jayson Noland, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird, “but it’s impossible to quantify the impact until we get details on the deal from Western,” he cautioned.Quarterly results from Dell were more sobering for the sector, with revenue from sales of personal computers, still the single largest source of demand for hard drives, falling 4 per cent year-on-year.Dell shares were off 3.2 per cent to $15.13, although some analysts were encouraged by signs of strong growth in storage and enterprise services.“The company seems to be executing its plan to transform into higher value and higher margin areas,” said Jeffrey Fidacaro at Susquehanna.Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology surged 23.4 per cent to $6.74, after a jury dismissed claims that the company had colluded with Korean firm Hynix Semiconductor to fix the prices of computer memory chips.The case had been brought by Rambus, a tech innovation company, which had been seeking more than $4bn in damages.The market capitalisation of Rambus, which relies on aggressive litigation to protect its patent rights, collapsed, falling more than 60 per cent to $7.11.“Following two key legal losses, which we believed were the cornerstone to our investment thesis in Rambus, we are now recommending investors exit positions,” Jeff Schreiner, an analyst at Capstone investments, told clients as he dropped coverage of Rambus after the decision.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit, as the discount of WTI crude oil to Brent crude shrunk to its lowest in more than six months.Western Refining Inc fell 13.5 per cent to $13.42, and CVR Energy tumbled 16.3 per cent to $18.38. Both companies are almost exclusively dependent on WTI, which has sold at a steep discount to Brent for most of the year, as transport constraints created a supply glut at the WTI terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma.News that Canadian firm Enbridge will allow WTI crude to flow to the Gulf Coast from Cushing through a newly acquired pipeline next year erased much of that discount.Even refiners with a small exposure to WTI were significantly affected.Shares in Tesoro fell 6.9 per cent to $25.00. WTI only accounts for 20 per cent of Tesoro’s crude, but Citigroup had expected that output to produce 60 per cent of 2012 earnings because of the lower input costs.The share prices of refiners with as little as 15 per cent exposure to WTI crude, such as Valero Energy, have seen strong correlation with the Brent-WTI spread this year, at least until August, when they were caught up in the wider market sell off. Valero fell 9.3 per cent to $22.56 on Wednesday.Abercrombie & Fitch plunged 13.6 per cent to $48.10, after third-quarter results badly disappointed analysts. Earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.Autodesk rose 4.5 per cent to $35.58, after the design software maker reported third-quarter profit of 44 cents a share, exceeding analyst estimates, despite worries about that business would cut back on spending given global growth concerns.

I then imported the photos into the program on my PC. They were uploaded to Autodesk’s servers, where the magic of stitching them together and creating a contoured 3D object took place.The finished article arrived back in the program, allowing me to manipulate it, see it from every angle and even upload my tour around it as a YouTube movie.There were problems though. It seemed my technique was off or I hadn’t taken enough photos – there were large gaps in the object and I found it hard to use a manual option to stitch photos together.I also failed to import my object into 123D Make, perhaps because this runs only on Macs at the moment and Catch is just for Windows. I was unable to print as well – 3D printers are still relatively large and expensive. They work by spraying powdered metal, rubber, plastic and other materials in layers thousands of an inch thick and melting them, building up objects slowly over many hours.The best option for consumers currently is to take or send their creations to outside printers and, while Autodesk’s software is fun to play with, it still needs some remodelling itself before it deserves any design prizes for utility.

Now other ways to look at the world in the round are being explored by software that turns camera phone pictures into 3D models, allowing solid replicas to be created by advanced printers, and a smartphone accessory that captures 360° video.Autodesk 123D CatchImagine taking smartphone photos of a statue you like or of an expensive candelabra, then going home to make an exact replica of what you recorded in similar materials.That is the promise of new free software from Autodesk, released on Monday, that can create three-dimensional models from photos and ready them for printing as solid objects.To try out 123D Catch, I set a small statue on a table and circled it to take a photograph from every angle before importing the photos to the program on my PC. They were uploaded to Autodesk’s servers, where the magic of stitching together a contoured 3D object took place. Back in the program, I could view it from every angle on screen and upload my tour around it on to YouTube.However, my technique was off or I hadn’t taken enough photos as there were missing sections of the statue. I also failed to import my object into the accompanying 123D Make program that makes it ready to “print” in 3D – perhaps because, strangely, it runs only on Macs at the moment and Catch is just for Windows. Most 3D printers are still big and expensive as they work by spraying powdered metal, rubber, plastic and other materials in ultra-thin layers and melting them in order to build up an object over many hours. I would have to take my “statue” to a specialist 3D printer to ever see it in real life.While Autodesk’s software is fun to play with, it still needs some remodelling itself before it deserves any design prizes for utility.Kogeto Dot panoramic video accessoryThree-dimensional models of entire buildings can be created with Autodesk’s photo-fed software, but for another way of capturing the world around you, I have been trying Kogeto’s Dot, the world’s smallest panoramic video camera accessory.The problem
I’m shifting from my personal Yahoo account and my workplace Lotus Notes to a Gmail account – is there an easy way to transfer all my contacts in one go?The answer
First, with your Contacts window open in Lotus Notes, select File and Export Contacts. In the dialogue box that appears, choose .csv as the file type for the exported contacts. In Yahoo Contacts, select Actions and Export All and choose Yahoo CSV as the file format.Next, in Gmail, go to Contacts and choose Import Contacts at the bottom of the left-hand column. Select the first file from the dialogue box that opens and click on Import. Repeat for the second file. Check a few sample contacts to see if anything has been omitted in the import – you may have to update some manually.Available in Apple Stores and online at Kogeto.com for $79, it works with only the iPhone 4 and 4S so far.It works a bit like Google’s Street View cameras, except with video rather than photos and there is no ability to pan up and down within what is recorded, restricting you to a narrower field of view.After fixing the Dot over the camera lens of the iPhone with a plastic clip, I downloaded the Looker app, which controls the video camera functions, and pressed record. The iPhone must be held horizontal and face down, so no onscreen monitoring is possible, but keeping it level records a steady 360-degree view.You can swipe around the full circumference of the action as the video is played back onscreen.There is certainly a “wow” factor to this in-the-round video – you can also upload and share the experience – but Kogeto needs to work on ironing out the bugs and crashes I encountered and on improving image quality and processing times if it hopes to win a following.HP 2311gt 3D monitorHewlett-Packard proudly unveiled its Photon Engine this week, which allows 3D images to be displayed on surfaces as big as buildings, but of more interest to ordinary consumers is a $1,600 3D version of its TouchSmart 620, an all-in-one reclining computer.To upgrade a regular PC, there is also a new value-priced 3D monitor. For $300, the 2311gt offers a 23in backlit LED display and comes with two pairs of 3D glasses – which seem positively old-fashioned after trying Autodesk and Dot’s latest experiences."

It also said it would reinvest any early repayments from mortgage securities back into debt issued by mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae, to reduce household mortgage rates.“I don’t know if I want to use the word desperate, but it feels like the Federal Reserve is out of bullets,” said Scott O’Neill, portfolio manager of MarketSmith.The S&P closed down 2.9 per cent at 1,166.72, its lowest level in a week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.5 per cent to 11,124.84 and the Nasdaq was off 2 per cent at 2,538.19.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 4.9 per cent after Moody’s downgraded its credit ratings for Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, arguing the government would be less likely to rescue the big lenders if they face failure, following banking reforms.BofA shares fell 7.5 per cent to $6.38, Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $25.52 and Wells Fargo dropped 3.9 per cent to $23.71.Wall Street’s worries were compounded by concerns about falling demand from Asia for raw materials. A broad swath of material, industrials and transport stocks fell after Alpha Natural Resources warned it would ship less coal than expected this year due to falling demand.ANR dropped 17.2 per cent to $22.30, a two-year low, after it said it would ship between 102.5m and 109.5m tonnes of coal this year, down from a previous estimate of between 104m and 112m tonnes.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 12.8 per cent to $61.55 in sympathy. Joy Global, which manufactures coal mining equipment, fell 7.2 per cent to $72.29. Transport groups CSX Corporation and Norfolk Southern, which transport coal to ports for export, both fell. CSX was down 8.1 per cent to $18.59, and Norfolk was down 8.3 per cent to $61.93.That pushed the Dow Transport Index, which analysts watch closely as a forward indicator of demand for goods and materials, down 3 per cent by lunch. But the index ended down 5.6 per cent for the day, after a further slump following the FOMC announcement.Software developers rallied strongly, however, as investors reacted to better than expected quarterly results posted by Oracle.Hardware sales declined, but software sales were up for the San Francisco-based company. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, software sales grew more than 50 per cent year-on-year, confounding fears that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt demand. Oracle also predicted revenues would grow 4 to 8 per cent in the current quarter. Its shares closed up 4 per cent to $29.49.“What we’re seeing is a relief rally,” said Richard Davis, software analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “People were scared out of their wits about what these results might be, given the weak macro data.”Adobe shares were up 1 per cent at $24.89, as it was caught up in the software relief rally despite posting quarterly earnings that were below expectations.Shantanu Narayen, chief executive, said the company could still deliver 10 per cent revenue growth for the year, based on a strong fourth quarter.But Steven Ashley at Baird pointed out “guidance assumes normal fourth-quarter economic activity, which might raise eyebrows with some investors”.A key differentiator among software companies may be the level of exposure to businesses, which have stronger balance sheets than consumers.With 55 per cent of Adobe revenues coming from creative professionals, Mr Ashley said this could be a problem. He expects Adobe to deliver 7 per cent growth in revenue from sales to creative professionals this fiscal year.Hewlett-Packard jumped 8.7 per cent to $23.98 on reports it may replace Léo Apotheker, chief executive.Microsoft shares were down 3.7 per cent to $26.35 after the company announced a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend late on Tuesday. Microsoft will increase quarterly dividends by 4 cents to 20 cents.At close to 3 per cent, Microsoft’s dividend is one of the highest among tech companies on the S&P 500, but the company is under pressure to compensate investors for a stagnant share price.Shares in Range Resources, an independent oil and gas explorer, were up 4.7 per cent to $67.96 on buy-out speculation.
20;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2011-09-07T18:35:22Z;Yahoo left behind as world moves on;;Yahoo’s revenue and share price remain roughly where ousted chief executive Carol Bartz found them when she took the helm in January 2009, but the landscape in which the pioneering US internet company operates has changed dramatically.As a result, Yahoo now has a much smaller share of the much larger amount of time spent online by all internet users, who are spending more of their time – and sending more advertising dollars – with the likes of Facebook and Google.The total US display online ad market is set to grow by a quarter to $12.3bn this year from 2010, according to research group eMarketer, with Yahoo’s slice of that falling from 14.4 per cent to 13.1 per cent.Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock told the Financial Times on Wednesday that he was convinced the company could grow its top line again, given its strong brand recognition and still-enormous audience.“You look at that set of assets and you say you can build from these if we aggressively set out to do that”, he told the FT.Shareholders and Yahoo employees speaking privately a day after Ms Bartz announced via e-mail that she had been fired “over the phone”, said that she had completed the first half of a complex turnround job but not the second.“Carol’s general decisive nature was good for Yahoo in the short term, but it didn’t work out well in the longer term,” one longtime mid-level employee said.Taking over from founder Jerry Yang, a beloved figure but poor manager, Ms Bartz greatly simplifed a command structure that had allowed many mid-level executives enormous freedom but assigned little responsibility.She shed employees and doubled profit margins, though her abrasive style put off some who should have been crucial allies, including in Jack Ma, head of Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce company in which Yahoo has a 43 per cent stake.Yahoo had two significant rounds of job cuts under Ms Bartz as she tried to refocus the company on core strengths and pitch advertisers on premium packages.As for the second part of her task – finding a way for Yahoo to grow again – Ms Bartz floundered, employees and advisers said.Ms Bartz has a background at big companies that sold to other businesses, including Autodesk and Sun Microsystems. So when she joined Yahoo, she had little feel for the consumer market or even for the broader internet, three people who worked with her complained.That could be why she agreed to spend $100m on a vague advertising campaign that promoted the Yahoo brand instead of touting its specific offerings, including news, finance and sports web pages, video entertainment and e-mail and other services.Ms Bartz did not fulfill pledges to make Yahoo significantly more “social” and to keep its users around for far longer during each visit. Yahoo’s e-mail and other core offerings are languising behind the competition.“A lot of people are happy to see a change here”, another executive said, though he faulted the board for dismissing Ms Bartz before having a successor lined up.Yahoo named Tim Morse, chief financial officer, as interim chief executive as it seeks a permanent replacement.“We have talented teams and tremendous resources behind them and intend to return the company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation,” Mr Bostock said in a press release issued late on Tuesday. “We are committed to exploring and evaluating possibilities and opportunities that will put Yahoo on a trajectory for growth and innovation and deliver value to shareholders.”Yahoo shareholder Eric Jackson was among those who cheered the move, which sent shares up 5 per cent on Wednesday. “It is a big positive in my mind. It sends a message that the board is going to be very open minded to creating value”, he said.Ms Bartz was initially greeted warmly by Yahoo shareholders after the previous leadership failed to consummate an acquisition by Microsoft, which was willing to pay a large premium to bolster its search-engine competition with Google.But she came under fire before her first year was up after negotiating a more limited alliance with Microsoft. In that deal, Yahoo tapped Microsoft to produce the automated part of its search results, saving development money but splitting ad revenue.The complex arrangement has failed to generate as much search advertising revenue as executives had predicted. In the meantime, Yahoo has shown nowhere near the growth in user time spent on its site as Facebook and Twitter, so that display ads have also failed to match prediction.Insiders suggested a turnround or even a sale would be easier if Yahoo first sheds its Asian assets, as is more likely now.“Given continued share losses in both display and search over the past few years, we are not surprised by this announcement”, Barclays wrote to investors on Wednesday. “However, we note that this transition is likely to prolong Yahoo’s turnround in an internet environment that is rapidly changing.”
21;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2011-09-07T13:11:39Z;Investors cheer Bartz exit from Yahoo;;Investors cheered the departure of Carol Bartz as chief executive of Yahoo with boost to the share price to more than $13 each on Wednesday morning.The stock rose from a closing price on $12.91 on Tuesday to $13.36 by mid-morning Wednesday in New York trading. The shares were under $13 when Ms Bartz joined the company in January 2009, and have largely remained far below the price offered in a takeover bid from Microsoft the year before.The Microsoft offer for $31 a share valued Yahoo equity at about $44bn against a current market capitalisation of about $16.8bn.Msl Bartz was summarily dismissed as Yahoo chief executive after less than three years atop one of the world’s most-visited internet sites amid continuing investor complaints about its sagging stock price, low growth and difficulty with Asian investments.In a terse e-mail to employees sent late on Tuesday, Ms Bartz said that she had been ousted “over the phone” in a conversation with Roy Bostock, Yahoo chairman, and that she wished remaining employees luck.Yahoo said in a subsequent press release that the board had named Tim Morse, chief financial officer, as interim chief executive as it seeks a permanent replacement.“We have talented teams and tremendous resources behind them and intend to return the company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation,” Mr Bostock said. “We are committed to exploring and evaluating possibilities and opportunities that will put Yahoo on a trajectory for growth and innovation and deliver value to shareholders.”Ms Bartz, formerly the chief executive of design software maker Autodesk, was initially greeted warmly by Yahoo shareholders after the previous leadership failed to consummate an acquisition by Microsoft, which was willing to pay a large premium to bolster its search-engine competition with Google.But Ms Bartz came under fire before her first year was up after negotiating a more limited alliance with Microsoft. In that deal, Yahoo tapped Microsoft to produce the automated part of its search results, saving development money but splitting ad revenue.The complex arrangement has failed to generate as much advertising revenue as executives had predicted. In the meantime, Yahoo has shown nowhere near the growth in user time spent on its site as more innovative and younger companies, such as Facebook and Twitter.That has kept display advertising revenue, where Yahoo had long been the top player in North America, hobbled as well. Researcher firm eMarketer predicted in June that Facebook would pass Yahoo in that category this year.Yahoo had at least two major rounds of job cuts under Ms Bartz as she tried to refocus the company on core strengths and pitch advertisers on premium packages.The final strike against Ms Bartz may have been her handling of two of Yahoo’s most valuable remaining possessions, minority investments in Yahoo Japan and in Alibaba Group.Under shareholder pressure, Ms Bartz has said Yahoo is exploring ways to monetise the stake in Softbank’s Japanese Yahoo network without the tax penalty that would come with an outright sale.But though those talks continue in private, a fight with Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma has played out in an embarrassingly public way.Alibaba, which is the largest e-commerce company in China, turned over control of its online payments unit to a group run by Mr Ma without establishing terms for the group to compensate Alibaba. Yahoo has a board seat at Alibaba but said it was informed belatedly of the sale, raising questions about whether it could be squeezed out of more Alibiba value.After months of heated negotiations, Alibaba agreed in July to keep 37.5 per cent of Alipay or receive a payment of between $2bn and $6bn if the payment business goes public, plus royalties.
22;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2011-08-22T21:08:59Z;Wall Street buoyed by QE3 speculation;;US stocks ended the day almost flat after falling bank stocks put paid to an early rally, which had been driven by hopes of a further round of monetary stimulus.Bank of America suffered its fourth largest single-day loss of the year, at one point coming within touching distance of its year low of $6.31, as it struggled to manage bad news.Layla Peruzzi, equity derivatives head at Jefferies, said that “the market is forcing [Bank of America] into a capital raise” and predicted that the Charlotte-based lender would have to raise up to $50 billion through disposals or by issuing new shares.Separately the bank’s card unit agreed to pay $5 million and suspend arbitrations of consumer debt collections in California for two years, to settle a lawsuit brought by the state.The company’s plan to raise capital through disposals took a blow when Zhang Jianguo, president of China Construction Bank, said Bank of America had agreed to retain at least half its 10 per cent holding in CCB.Bank of America was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, its shares closing down 7.9 per cent at $6.42, as financials in the S&P 500 lost 1.3 per cent, more than any other sector.On Monday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said residential mortgage delinquencies during the second quarter rose by 0.1 of a percentage point to 12.9 per cent, after falling at the beginning of the year from last year.The KBW index of bank stocks hit a year low of 35.04 before closing down 1.1 per cent at 35.10.But regional banks rallied slightly. Regions Financial was up 0.5 per cent at $3.88, and bank stocks appeared to be trading on news rather than economics.Goldman Sachs lost 4.7 per cent in late trading to close at $106.51, after Reuters reported chief executive Lloyd Blankfein had hired high profile corporate defence lawyer Reid Weingarten, as the Justice Department continues to investigate the bank.“Mr Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department’s inquiry into certain matters raised in the [senate permanent subcommittee on investigations] report hired counsel at the outset,” Goldman Sachs told the Financial Times.The S&P 500 had been up as much as 2 per cent in early trade as investors looked to the Fed to signal another round of quantitative easing after four weeks of sustained losses.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke will speak on Friday in Jackson Hole. “The market is expecting another round of asset purchases and it will come,” said Matthias Jasper, head of equities at WGZ Bank AG.But the S&P 500 again closed near its year low of 1,101.54, up just 0.02 per cent on the day at 1,123.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent at 1,084.50.Hewlett-Packard gained 3.6 per cent to close at $24.45, reversing some of Friday’s big losses, helping the Nasdaq close up 0.2 per cent at 2,345.38.Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, warned investors against relying on Mr Bernanke to prop up stock prices.“The higher markets rise this week on QE3 anticipation, the more vulnerable they may become should the street not get what it wants,” he said.With Brent crude easing, after rebel forces entered Tripoli, the SIG Oil Exploration and Production index fell 2.4 per cent to 400.79.“A lower oil price pressures the economics of upstream oil development,” said Hsulin Peng, senior analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. But if cheaper oil stimulates the global economy, “increased demand could offset price declines”.While Brent fell, West Texas Intermediate rose. That hurt refiners with strong access to WTI crude on fears that the rising price of inputs, coupled with weak demand for finished oil products, would erode margins.Marathon Petroleum was down 6.9 per cent to $32.58 as the stock’s newness and its dependence on WTI crude weighed on the share price.But Mark Gilman, refineries analyst at Benchmark, said: “The prices of finished oil products are quite properly tracking the price of Brent crude. US investors shouldn’t fixate on the price of WTI.”While investors were trading on sentiment, there was more bad news from the real economy.The Chicago Fed National Activity Index for July registered -0.06, the fourth successive month that the index has been negative.JPMorgan reduced its target price for FedEx 10 per cent to $105 and cut its 2012 earnings per share forecast for the company from $6.60 to $6.Performance at the business mail delivery service is watched as a gauge of overall economic strength. FedEx was down 0.2 per cent at $73.00.
23;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US stocks fall on Bernanke’s outlook;;Industrial transportations stocks climbed after FedEx reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and gave a positive outlook for the year, but the wider markets fell into negative territory after Ben Bernanke gave a cautious assessment of the US economy in a news conference.The package delivery group, considered a bellwether for the wider economy as it transports goods for such a wide range of industries, reported a 33 per cent jump in earnings, sending shares up 2.6 per cent to $91.44.The company gave a stronger-than-expected full-year earnings outlook.This caused a sigh of relief for investors as, due to a run of weak economic data in the US, many had been worried that forecasts would be sluggish.The outlook was “better than feared”, said analysts at Jefferies.Rival package delivery company UPS added 0.7 per cent to $71.11 on the news while Expeditors International of Washington put on 0.4 per cent to $48.45.But in the wider markets the S&P 500 index closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,287.14, breaking a four-session winning streak. The index dipped from positive to negative territory late in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve cut US growth forecasts and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent to 12,109.67 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,669.19.According to Investment Company Institute, the last two week were the worst fortnight for equity outflow since May 2010, the week of the flash crash. This did not help the mood in the markets.Wall Street was hurt by a move in the dollar, which edged higher after the Bernanke press conference. This weighed on the industrial, energy and material sectors.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, although these losses were pared somewhat by L-3 Communications, which spiked 4.6 per cent to $86.21 after reports that investors were pushing the defence company to spin off some units.The S&P energy and material sectors were both down 0.4 per cent.In the materials sector, CF Industries was down 2.8 per cent to $142.25 while Allegheny fell 2.5 per cent to $59.91.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.9 per cent to $142.25 while EOG Resources lost 0.8 per cent to $101.34.But the technology sector was the worst performing in the session, led lower by Adobe Systems, the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500.The software company that makes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs for media and internet professionals gave a disappointing earnings forecast, which dragged the stock down 6.3 per cent to $30.01.These losses came despite the fact that the company reported a 54 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings.Many analysts were still upbeat about the software maker in the long term.Analysts at Citigroup said that there were “lots of small things to quibble about” but that the “big picture [was] still bright”.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Autodesk was down 1.5 per cent to $36.47 while Juniper Networks lost 2.4 per cent to $29.53.The S&P technology index was down 0.8 per cent, although losses were pared by strong gains from Jabil Circuit. The electronics contractor was up 3.2 per cent to $19.45 after reporting powerful earnings and a share buy-back.Homebuilders also saw gains after home prices as tracked by the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.8 per cent in April from the previous month, which was better than the 0.3 per cent fall that had been expected. PulteGroup was up 0.4 per cent to $7.49 while DR Horton added 1.4 per cent to $11.54.Consumer staples stocks also suffered, led by Lorillard Tobacco, which was down 1.7 per cent to $110.01.In the previous session, the US Food and Drug Administration released nine warnings on the ill-effects of smoking – combining graphic images and text – that must appear on cigarette packets as well as in advertisements no later than September 2012.The S&P consumer staples index was down, 0.7 per cent.CarMax, the used-car dealer, enjoyed the strongest gains on the S&P 500 after reporting first-quarter earnings up 25 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares were up 7 per cent to $32.66 as earnings came in at $126.3m, or 55 cents a share, which was ahead of the 47 cents expected.AeroVironment’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20.6 per cent on a jump in contract-services, leaving shares in the maker of unmanned aircraft up 19.6 per cent to $34.51.
24;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2011-03-23T20:29:39Z;Tech groups to count quake sales loss;;IT hardware and software companies will in the next few weeks unveil the estimated hit to revenues of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which came as local sales teams were preparing for the most important push of the year.The first indication of the impact on tech companies that sell to Japanese companies or government agencies came late on Tuesday, as US software company Adobe slashed its forecast of overall revenue growth for its current quarter by nearly half to reflect the effects of the disaster in Japan.According to analysts, sales to Japan have a disproportionately large effect on tech companies in the current quarter, given the timing of the country’s fiscal year, which closes at the end of March.The effect on local sales is a further blow alongside the supply-chain problems caused by the disruption to component suppliers affected by the disaster.Buyers of IT hardware and software tend to spend more heavily at the close of their fiscal year, as they use up the remains of their IT budgets for the year rather than lose them. The expected loss of this so-called “budget flush” was one reason listed by Adobe for its caution about the outlook in the coming weeks.The US company, which makes desktop programs for creative professionals as well as the Acrobat document software, said it expected to lose $50m in sales, or a third of what it had expected from Japan this quarter. That would leave it with revenues of $995m at the midpoint of its forecast range, sharply cutting its overall growth rate from an expected 10 per cent for the quarter.Adobe executives said it was too early to tell whether the lost sales would be recovered in coming months or whether the effect of the downturn would be longer lasting.Overall, software companies that rely on sales to businesses and government customers generate 5 per cent of their sales from Japan, according to analysts at Barclays Capital, though for some, such as Adobe and Autodesk, the figure is 10 per cent or higher.Japan also consumes about 15 per cent of the world’s semiconductors, Morgan Stanley analysts said, while tech research firm IDC had earlier forecast that the country would account for about 12 per cent of the $12.5bn global server market this quarter.With buyers distracted by the need to deal with the crisis, earlier indications suggested a dent to server sales this quarter, though the real extent of the disaster would not become apparent until the following quarter, said Jed Scaramella, an analyst at IDC.
25;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2011-03-15T11:23:06Z;Carlyle buys The Foundry;;Carlyle, the US private equity group, has agreed to take control of a London-based company whose software helped to create special effects in films such as Avatar, The Twilight Saga and Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland.The Foundry, which was set up by Simon Robinson and Bruno Nicoletti in 1996, offers post production software services to Hollywood clients and multinationals such as Sony and Warner Bros.Carlyle is buying a majority stake from Advent Venture Partners and other shareholders for an undisclosed sum. The US private equity group already owns a number of assets in related sectors including The Mill, a digital visual effects company.It is the third time that The Foundry, which competes with larger companies such as Autodesk of the US and is estimated to be worth more than £75m, has changed hands in the past four years.The founders originally sold the business in 2007 to Digital Domain, a Los Angeles-based special effects company. But in 2009 Bill Collis, chief executive, and the company’s co-founders initiated a management buy-out backed by Advent, which took a majority stake.The Foundry, which employs move than 100 staff in its offices in London and Los Angeles, in 2009 reported pre-tax profits of £624,117 on sales of £6.8m but has grown rapidly since Advent tooks over. Revenues in 2010 hit £14.9m thanks in part to the success of its Nuke compositor software, which layers different images over each other to create one shot.Mr Collis said that the acquisition by Carlyle would help The Foundry widen its product portfolio and enter new markets. The Foundry is looking to expand further into the US, and tap into the large movie hubs of China and India. The company is also eyeing a move into adjacent sectors such as television commercials and possibly games.As well as Carlyle, a number of other private equity and trade buyers are also understood to have looked at The Foundry.Film companies are increasingly outsourcing to low-cost centres such as India and using software to create special effects, spurred on by a drive to reduce costs and the push to create ever more dynamic blockbusters. Even period dramas now use post production software to help remove unwanted objects such as buildings.Mr Collis, who will remain chief executive following the acquisition, is well known in the industry for designing the computer programming behind the sequence in The Matrix movie where Neo, played by Keanu Reaves, dodges bullets in slow motion.Mr Robinson, chief scientist, and Mr Nicoletti, chief technology officer, will stay in their current roles following the deal. The founders and management will continue to retain a significant minority stake.Arma Partners acted as financial adviser to The Foundry’s shareholders. Carlyle was advised by Travers Smith.
26;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Fired, re-hired – and now chief executive;;"Autodesk chief executive Carl Bass is wandering through the software company’s gallery, an airy space overlooking the San Francisco Bay Bridge that features products designed using Autodesk’s computer programs.Mr Bass dreamed up the gallery two years ago, wanting to build a “museum to show off work by the customer”.Today, it houses an eclectic assortment of consumer products, and architectural models, a trophy case of high-end industrial design. To his right is a three-metre tall dinosaur built of Lego; to his left, one of two prototypes for the all-electric Tesla Model S sedan. Outside the window, cranes are assembling the new eastern span of the Bay Bridge, which Autodesk software also designed.“Everything around you is designed and engineered,” says Mr Bass, a designer himself who has risen through the ranks to run this $9bn (by market capitalisation) company. Although he doesn’t say it outright, his point is hard to miss – just about everything manufactured is designed and engineered, at least in part, by Autodesk software.Autodesk offers a catalogue of more than 40 programs that allow architects, designers, engineers and digital artists to turn their wildest imaginings into realities, from Zaha Hadid’s futuristic architecture to the aliens in James Cameron’s Avatar movie.The company’s flagship product, AutoCad (computer assisted design), has been the industry standard at architectural firms for a generation. Another program, Maya, is the de facto tool for computer animation, and is used extensively throughout the film industry. Autodesk itself has won five Academy Awards for technical achievement.Like many a chief executive, Mr Bass towers above his employees. His tall frame is softened by an easy smile and unpretentious demeanor. He wears a poplin work shirt and black Levi jeans.His eyes are ringed with dark circles and his hair receding, but he is cheerful and speaks without the deliberate message management of many of his peers.This laid-back demeanour hasn’t always sat comfortably with Autodesk’s sometimes rigid corporate culture. Mr Bass joined the company in 1993, when it bought Ithaca Software, which he had founded.At the time, he tended to wear Birkenstock sandals to work. Carol Bartz, who is today chief executive of Yahoo but was then CEO at Autodesk, insisted Mr Bass wear a suit.“I had never worked in a large company,” says Mr Bass, explaining the tensions. “Small companies are like a tiny hammer, you can move it really quickly, but it only makes a little dent. Bigger companies are more like a sledge hammer – harder to move, but you can make a real impact.”Shortly after he joined, he challenged Ms Bartz on the timing of a major product launch at a meeting of senior executives. The public showdown did not sit well with Ms Bartz, and marked the start of a contentious relationship between the two. In 1995 their polar personalities led Ms Bartz to fire Mr Bass.“The universal truth in that story is that for people who come from entrepreneurial companies and into big companies, there’s a misunderstanding from both sides,” he says. “The bigger company doesn’t understand what it takes to be successful, and the smaller company thinks the bigger company is lethargic.”He was re-hired a few months later, after other senior employees insisted he be reinstated. From there, he rose through the ranks, and in 1999 Mr Bass left Autodesk to head Buzzsaw, a spin-off company. Two years later, Autodesk re-acquired Buzzsaw and Mr Bass was hired by Autodesk for the third time.Buzzsaw was an appropriate name for the spin-off. After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in maths, Mr Bass spent a few years learning to use his hands. He did odd jobs, building boats and furniture.Today, Mr Bass continues his woodworking in a large workshop in West Berkeley, the left-wing enclave across the Bay from San Francisco. Employees say that he often fires off e-mails at 10pm from his workshop with complaints about a feature in one of Autodesk’s programs he is using.Mr Bass took over as chief executive in 2006, when Ms Bartz became chairman. During his tenure at Autodesk, he has helped build the company’s subscriptions and services business, which now accounts for $800m of its $2bn or so in annual revenue. He has also helped introduce the company’s software to new markets, such as the film industry, and to diversify its revenue stream.“What we want to do is find the customers who are doing the most interesting stuff, and help them do it better,” says Mr Bass. “That’s the stuff that they’re doing today that others in the industry will want in a few years.”This approach led Autodesk to work closely with James Cameron, the Avatar director whose company, Lightstorm, has pioneered a new breed of 3-D film-making and animation.On the day I met him, Mr Bass was just off a flight from Los Angeles, where he had spent the day with Mr Cameron, working on the sequel to Avatar. “We were talking about the tools he used on his last movie, what worked and what didn’t work, and what they need to make it better the next time,” he says.As Mr Bass relates this story, he strolls past an unusual artefact in the Autodesk museum. It is a bench carved from a single piece of granite. Inspired by African designs, it was drawn on a computer, then built as a model with a 3-D printer. The model was sent to the DingLi Stone Carving company in China’s Fujian province, where master masons crafted it from a solid piece of granite and polished it to a shine.The artist was Mr Bass. He designed it in his West Berkeley studio, using, of course, Autodesk software.●My big break?
I never really think about big breaks. I’ve just done the things that I like and think are important to do.

●Person who made a difference?
No one mentor but I’ve tried to learn from everyone – people at work and people in the community. Corporations don’t have a monopoly on people with intelligence, creativity, courage or passion. And you often learn as much from someone’s weaknesses or shortcomings as you do from their strengths.

●Would you rather have done something else?
A star in the National Basketball Association or musician, except I don’t have the talent for either.

●Best career advice to others?
Do what you really love doing."

Carol Bartz, 62Nationality: AmericanCompany: YahooSector: Online mediaLocation: USThree-year TSR: 29%It is not often you find a top-flight corporate leader whose roots are deep in rural life, but Carol Bartz is one. “I’m really proud of my Midwestern roots,” she says of her childhood on a Wisconsin farm.Brought up by her grandparents after her mother died when she was eight, Bartz recalls her grandmother taught her the importance of hard work. “Animals had to be fed. No excuses. You just got on and did it. I expect people to try their best.”She has been chief executive of Yahoo for 18 months, succeeding founder Jerry Yang after a stellar career at Autodesk, where she was chairwoman, president and chief executive. During her 14-year tenure, revenues increased from $285m to $1.5bn.Her career has been built on a BSc in computer science from the University of Wisconsin, with roles at 3M and Digital Equipment Corporation before she joined Sun Microsystems, working her way up to executive vice-president of worldwide field operations. She also advised on George Bush’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, setting the US government’s high-tech agenda.Her role at an internet group has placed her every move and word under scrutiny: a clip of her use of the F-word in an interview has been viewed more than 220,000 times on YouTube. “I don’t regularly use salty language,” she says, “but [I will] if I get really impassioned about something, and I am passionate about Yahoo … But I think it attracts a lot more news than if I was a guy.”There are volumes of blogs, tweets and Flip videos about Bartz. “We live in a world where any individual can be a journalist,” she says. “The world needs to learn to distinguish between unverified opinion and real journalism. Ninety per cent of what’s out there simply isn’t true.”Bartz has made bold moves in her time at the top, partnering Microsoft to power the back office of Yahoo’s search capability while “concentrating on what we do well – developing content and communication products”, she says. “I don’t care how a user comes to us, whether by e-mail or Yahoo Finance, we control the experience.” Yahoo reaches 83 per cent of the US online community and covers “all demographics”, she says.Bartz is confident she has set a sustainable direction for Yahoo. “We’ve got a great strategy. We’re right on track, but I always said it would take two years to get some things done. We aren’t there yet. You can’t have a baby in a month. But I have the confidence and patience to carry out the plan.”
28;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2010-08-31T00:56:51Z;Autodesk brings flagship software to Apple;;Autodesk, the computer-assisted design company, is bringing its flagship product software to Apple’s computers after a 16-year absence, giving another boost to the Silicon Valley device maker’s prospects for business sales.Autodesk’s $4,000 AutoCAD has been available only on computers running Microsoft’s Windows since the mid-1990s.However, fans of Apple’s Mac had to install Windows and other software first before they could use AutoCAD.Autodesk’s move comes as Apple is making headway with sales inside corporations with both the Mac and iPad.Macs made up less than 4 per cent of the world PC market in June, according to IDC. But Needham & Co analyst Charles Wolf said last week that the number of Macs shipped to companies grew by 50 per cent in the last quarter, more than triple the growth rate for PCs.The increase is even more pronounced in the largest businesses, where Mac sales doubled from a year earlier.The shift to run directly on Apple is part of Autodesk’s strategy to end its dependence on Windows in recognition that more large companies are welcoming a greater variety of devices and software, Amar Hanspal, Autodesk senior vice-president, told the Financial Times.Autodesk will also introduce a free application for the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch that allows users to view AutoCAD designs and make minor modifications, he said.Autodesk is also looking at other tablet-shaped computers that rival the iPad.“The tablet is becoming an interesting form factor. There are multiple operating systems people are looking at,” Mr Hanspal said.That makes Google’s Android a potential candidate. And a less functional AutoCAD will also be available through any web browser.The full AutoCAD will reach the Mac OS X, the current version of Apple’s operating system for the Mac, by the end of October, Mr Hanspal said. The company plans to market the software at the same price as its Windows version.AutoCAD has more than 10m users, many of whom had asked for a version to be available on the Mac, he said.While Autodesk has already put many less-intensive programs for creating entertainment on the Mac and iPad, more than a third of Autodesk’s $473m in revenue in the last quarter came from the engineering-oriented AutoCAD.
29;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2010-06-16T00:02:32Z;Design technologies: Flying off the digital drawing board;;Launching an athlete-endorsed sports shoe on the US market used to be a long process. Designs on paper would be sent to Asia, a local manufacturer would create a mock-up and ship it back to the US for the athlete to endorse. Changes to the design would then be sent back and forth and it might be months before the shoe would appear on store shelves.Digital technology has changed all that. A shoe would now be designed on a screen and a physical mock-up would be created using a three-dimensional printer, painted up in the appropriate colours and couriered to the athlete for approval.“That’s now a two-week process,” says Joan Lockhart, vice-president of marketing at SensAble Technologies, which develops 3D touch-enabled technology for the design of consumer, medical and industrial products.“Athletic footwear is a fashion industry where there used to be two seasons a year. Now there are seven – and that’s an incredibly rapid pace of design enhancement.”The way “rapid prototype 3D printers” work is by building a physical object one layer at a time using data fed to them by a computer. While they may take several hours to print out a full object in three dimensions, this is far less than is needed to construct most physical prototypes.“Designing and developing products with 3D technology makes a difference to companies.“It allows new levels of consumer interaction to be established, enabling earlier feedback, reducing product risks and speeding development cycles,” says Peter Bambridge of Dassault Systèmes’ consumer and retail business in the northern Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea) region.“If a picture is worth a thousand words, a 3D model is worth a million.”However, accelerating the speed of execution is not the only way 3D and other digital tools are changing the way products are designed and manufactured. Computerisation also radically cuts the waste generated during the design-to-production cycle.“If you think about a physical prototype, it’s scrap, and companies throw it away at the end of the process,” says Michael Bloor, North American chief operating officer for ESI, which provides digital simulation software for prototyping and manufacturing processes. “Simulating the manufacturing processes for components, parts and products reduces scrap.”When this principle is applied to buildings, the reduction in waste becomes significant. The construction industry, which has been known for over-use of materials, is now able to assess more accurately what will be needed for each project.Many more of the parts of a building can be pre-fabricated offsite, which also cuts waste, and by making laser scans of the existing site, companies can recycle more of the demolished materials.“You can get a better understanding of the amounts of materials that are required for construction,” says Richard Scott-Smith, an engineer and design tools manager at Atkins, the engineering design services provider. “Fewer errors are made and so there’s less need for rework in both the design and construction.”In addition, computer-based modelling gives architects a clearer picture of how to design buildings that consume less energy, since they can simulate the impact of natural light and heat on the building at different times of day and in different seasons.This helps architects make greater use of natural light and introduce elements such as natural shading, which reduces the need for air-conditioning.For example, Autodesk, the 2D and 3D design, engineering and entertainment software company, makes Ecotect analysis software, which helps architects simulate a building’s performance in the context of its environment, including calculating the amount of daylight present when the sun is at different positions throughout the day.“It allows you to produce a conceptual model that provides instant feedback as to the thermal performance of that building,” says Pete Baxter, Autodesk senior director for Northern Europe.“If you increase thermal overhangs and natural shading [in the virtual design], it gives you feedback on the resulting comfort level in the building.”While helping to limit environmental damage and reduce consumption of resources, IT tools are also affecting the bottom line, cutting costs from the process of producing and refining new products and allowing companies to reduce wasted materials.For HTC, a Swedish industrial floor maintenance equipment manufacturer, the savings associated with using technology in the design process were considerable.A single physical prototype for HTC’s machines costs $500,000 to make, and at one time the company needed to produce up to five of them for every new product being developed.Using digital prototyping technology from Autodesk, HTC has been able to build products based on a single physical prototype. “And that prototype was so close to the original requirement that they could sell it,” says Mr Baxter. “So there’s massive cost and time savings.”Meanwhile, digital design supports the increasingly global nature of complex engineering assets such as chemical plants and power stations, allowing real-time engineering data to be shared between all the contractors working on the project.“Those organisations have their own disciplines and geographies,” says Mat Truche-Gordon, senior vice-president of business strategy at Aveva, the engineering software group.“So it’s crucial for the primary contractor to be able to organise the information between the multiple disciplines and the multiple contractors during that design phase.”In the engineering industry, lasergrammetry – surveying by 3D laser scanner – allows a virtual “walk through” of every aspect of a plant to be conducted remotely. The system captures visual details of an object such as a pump and links them to information about its specifications, sources of spare parts and maintenance procedures, as well as its real-time performance and service history.Yet, if a piece of industrial infrastructure is a complex ecosystem, so is the human body. The challenge for the healthcare industry is designing products that fit inside a human body. Now, using body scans and digital design technology, medical device manufacturers can customise implants such as hip replacements to individual patients.“In the past, if you needed a hip implant, you could pick from small, medium or large,” says Ms Lockhart. “Now we’re making patient-specific implants.”In the consumer products sector, companies armed with digital technology can make greater use of feedback from customers in the design of their goods.The ability to experience designs before they are manufactured through visualisation software and rapid prototyping 3D printers means physical objects can be refined, enhanced and tested in focus groups at a far earlier stage in the process.Digital design technology brings together visualisation, simulation and analysis, says Autodesk’s Mr Baxter. “That allows the design team to make informed decisions at the conceptual stage and continually refine the design through all stages of the process.”This leads to more accurate designs and products that can respond more closely to the demands of the market.As with the example of the sports shoes, this has important implications for consumer products manufacturers, for whom innovation, time to market and ability to respond swiftly to changing consumer demand are critical.However, Olof Schybergson, founder and chief executive of Fjord, a digital design agency, sounds a note of caution. The sheer speed at which technology allows designs to become reality, he argues, can lead to companies spending insufficient time thinking through a new product.“Analytical tools are not the answer to everything,” he says. “They could help you build a better functioning building, but it might have been a bad idea to put a building in that area in the first place.”In their haste to get new products to market, the ability to create new forms with complex structures using new materials can lead manufacturers to sidestep the processes not based on technology.“This can lead to the wrong design being marketed,” says Mike Paton, an expert in technology and innovation at PA Consulting Group. “The tools must be used as part of a concurrent development and evaluation process.”Yet, if the speed of design now possible means that companies need to do more research before rushing into the development of new products, digital technology also creates a level playing field, allowing smaller companies to innovate as rapidly as larger ones.“Today, the ability of a company to push back the boundaries is based on the processing power of the computer on their desk,” says Mr Baxter.“Cloud computing makes access to processing power easier, and that means all companies can do many hundreds of iterations of a design to optimise the product,” he says.With processing power in their hands, far greater numbers of companies will be able to enter the design market.For established players that can only mean one thing – the emergence of a far more competitive business landscape.

Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, lost 4.5 per cent to $58.67.General Electric’s shares lost 5.8 per cent to $16.26. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries filed a US antitrust lawsuit against GE over patents related to wind turbines.Leading banks also slipped. The US Senate, in a party-line vote, sent the financial reform package to a final vote. Citigroup was down 4.7 per cent to $3.63 and Bank of America lost 6.3 per cent to $15.28.Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at UBS, said investors would be watching banking shares as credit risk indicators to determine whether conditions had bottomed out.“Markets have become increasingly concerned about the sufficiency of measures taken to defend the euro as well as the impact of proposed austerity plans,” said Mr Golub.Harman International, an audio equipment maker that receives nearly three-quarters of its revenues in Europe, slipped another 3.7 per cent to $30.56.Net income for Autodesk, the design software maker, jumped 11 per cent in its first quarter over the same period last year, beating analyst expectations.But the group, which said it sold more software overseas, also warned those gains could be fleeting. Shares fell back 6.9 per cent to $28.28.“[Our] enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by the devaluation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy,” said Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive.VeriSign, an internet software provider, lost 1.5 per cent to $27.56 after agreeing to sell its security unit to Symantec for $1.3bn. Symantec fell back 5.6 per cent to $14.76.Advance Auto Parts shares were 6.9 per cent higher at $48.99 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $55, citing an economic backdrop in which more drivers would be servicing their own cars, as well as the group’s ability to provide “customer service focus, direct sourcing and price optimisation”.Sears said its earnings fell 39 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year, which the retailer attributed to declining margins in appliances and other big-ticket items. Its shares plummeted 11 per cent to $88.70.Drugstore chain Walgreens lost 6 per cent to $32.71, after analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded it from “outperform” to “neutral”.Ross Stores was 1.1 per cent higher, to $52.28, after it reported higher-than-
expected profits and record sales margins.MasterCard, the payment network, was also among the few gainers. It advanced
1.5 per cent to $205.50 after said Heartland Payment Systems would pay it $41.4m in claims related to security breaches. Visa, however, was 0.2 per cent lower at $72.82."
31;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-11-18T21:34:16Z;Wall Street slumps after disappointing data;;"A rally among bond insurers was not enough to lift Wall Street out of the red on Wednesday after the release of disappointing housing figures.The recovery of the housing market in the US was shown to be more fragile than previously thought when data revealed that the number of new houses built last month had fallen for the first time since April.The technology sector also led the market lower after Autodesk, the world’s biggest maker of design software, forecast fourth-quarter profits below estimates. The group said its recovery could be hindered by continued job losses, sending its shares down 10.4 per cent to $24.20.However, the financial sector was buoyed by Ambac Financial, which eased market concerns over its balance sheet.The second-largest US bond insurer said the statutory capital of its main unit was well above a regulatory minimum at the end of the third quarter.Last week, the group said it might have to seek bankruptcy protection if it could not solve its liquidity problems, sending its shares down more than
30 per cent.But Ambac shares soared 44.3 per cent to $1.01 on Wednesday and MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, jumped 10.1 per cent to $3.82.After brief gains in the morning, the S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,109.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 10,426.31 and the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent to 2,193.14.Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage, said: “The housing starts [data] was not expected to be that weak, but there is a lot of complacency in the market and that is being interpreted through implied volatility, which is nearing year-to-date lows.”The Vix, an index that gauges market volatility and investor anxiety, surged over the 80 points level in November last year but has fallen steadily since. The index dropped a further 3.4 per cent to 21.64 on Wednesday.The market was also torn between a series of deals, which helped to lift sentiment, and continued pessimism in the consumer discretionary sector.Hershey and Ferrero International said they might enter the bidding for Cadbury, the British confectionery group that is the subject of a hostile bid from Kraft Foods. Hershey fell 2 per cent to $37.63 and Kraft 1.4 per cent to $27.26.American Express also announced that it had bought Revolution Money, an internet-based payment platform, for $300m.The company was set up in 2007 by Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL. American Express shares edged 0.5 per cent higher to $41.57.Shares in Delta Air Lines dropped 1.8 per cent to $7.76 after the airline and its partners offered a $1bn aid package to Japan Airlines, which is facing possible bankruptcy.The deal is intended to lure Asia’s biggest carrier out of a potential alliance with American Airlines.Shares in AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 3.7 per cent to $5.77.But discount retailers weighed on the market.Shares in Target, the second-largest discounter in the US, slipped 1.5 per cent to $47.87 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral” from “buy”. The company’s shares lost more than 3 per cent on Tuesday after the retailer gave a cautious outlook for the upcoming holiday season.BJ’s Wholesale Club reported lower sales from its third quarter than had been expected, pushing its shares down 2 per cent to $35.63.The retailer remains popular with shoppers seeking to save money by buying in bulk. But BJ’s and its rivals are facing tough comparisons given that last year’s sales were boosted by high petrol prices and food price inflation.But the retailer Perry Ellis International reported third-quarter profit above expectations due to its aggressive cost-cutting. Its shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.99 as it raised forecasts for next year.Chico’s, the women’s casual clothing chain, also beat estimates for the third quarter, sending its shares up 8.8 per cent to $14.67.General Growth Properties, the bankrupt shopping mall owner, surged 36.3 per cent to $5.82 after reports that rival Simon Property Group was considering buying assets of the company.Simon also gained after the announcement, rising 4.7 per cent to $75.58."

However, after gaining strongly on Thursday, materials led Friday’s selling.Alcoa, the aluminium company, lost 3.2 per cent to $13.27 while Freeportthe gold and copper miner, fell 3.7 per cent to $63.65.This saw the S&P close 0.9 per cent down at 1,004.09. It lost 0.6 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.8 per cent to 9,321.40, a weekly drop of 0.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,985.52, finishing the week 0.7 per cent lower.“We have had a string of better-than-expected data but over the past two days it has been very disappointing,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “And we think the market will continue to be dictated by the direction of future economic data.”The falls in consumer stocks dragged two leading clothing retailers lower, even after they both raised full-year forecasts following their quarterly results.JC Penney lost ground in spite of making a narrower loss than expected. Its higher profit forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations and the stock declined 6.2 per cent to $31.29.Nordstrom also fell as its new forecast could not counteract slightly lower profit than expected.The shares gave up 6.4 per cent to $27.87. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “People have assumed that the recovery will be consumer led. We have known for many months that that won’t be the case, but it is only just sinking in.”But Abercrombie & Fitch, which has suffered recently as cheaper competitors have eaten into its share of the teenage fashion market, bounced 3.9 per cent to $34.25. Its quarterly loss did not deter investors, who focused on some encouraging sales trends.Boeing slid further than the rest of the industrial sector after the company encountered fresh problems with its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.Boeing said it had stopped work on two parts of the fuselage but denied this would further delay the launch, which is already two years behind schedule. The shares fell 3.8 per cent to $44.87.Elsewhere, struggling DVD rental chain Blockbuster was one of the day’s heaviest fallers after it made a worse loss than expected on weak sales.The results forced
management to cut the full-year forecast and the shares shed 16.3 per cent to 72 cents.Autodesk the graphic design company, beat analysts’ estimates on slightly stronger revenues than expected, which were particularly strong in Asia-Pacific and emerging countries. Its shares rose 4.9 per cent to $25.38."
33;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-05-27T23:51:56Z;Yahoo and Microsoft ease off over tie-up;;Yahoo is no longer in serious talks with Microsoft over a deal to combine their search efforts, Carol Bartz, Yahoo’s chief executive, said on Wednesday.But she acknowledged that negotiations between the two companies were continuing “a little bit”.The internet group’s head said a deal could still be struck if Yahoo got access to the right data from a Microsoft-led combination and “if there’s a boatload of money”. She added that Yahoo’s 20 per cent share of the search market was enough to be significant for the overall experience at the company’s pages, which are the most visited on the web.In her most expansive public comments since becoming chief in January, Ms Bartz ranked the most valuable assets at Yahoo as its front page, the search functionality and such category-leading sites as Yahoo’s news and sports pages.Ms Bartz – speaking at an annual conference in Carlsbad, California, hosted by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp – said her top priorities included adding more social activity throughout Yahoo, for example by expanding Yahoo Answers to finance and sports. “Social will be, frankly, a main part of all our areas,” she said.A second goal is allowing users to customise the main Yahoo landing page. “My big dream is, I don’t ever want to see Britney Spears on my front page, because I don’t care,” Ms Bartz said, adding that the ability would come in the autumn.The former chief of software design company Autodesk, Ms Bartz also gave a colourful account of her hiring at Yahoo, a long-term courtship that she said began at a Cisco Systems board meeting in November, when Yahoo founder and chief executive Jerry Yang asked her to apply.“I said ‘I’m not even remotely the right person’,” she recalled. But she agreed to come to Mr Yang’s house, asked him to draw the company’s organisation chart, and was appalled at the result.”Ms Bartz said Yahoo did not plan to make additional lay-offs, would make strides in video, and wanted to make site registration and ad purchases easier. “The best way to change perception is to do a good job and then talk about it,” she said.
34;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-05-22T20:37:46Z;US stocks sell off ahead of long weekend;;"US stocks ended a week of modest gains on Friday after optimism from home improvement retailer Lowe’s on Monday triggered a rally which fears over the
US credit rating failed to extinguish.Reassuring words from Moody’s on Friday helped calm fears of an imminent downgrade for US sovereign debt as the ratings agency said it was “comfortable” with the triple A rating.But equities suffered a late sell-off to take the markets to a fourth consecutive session of losses as investors repositioned themselves ahead of a three-day weekend.The market was also hampered by the failure of BankUnited, Florida’s largest bank, and the largest US bank to fail this year.But the falls came in spite of several pieces of pieces of positive earnings news.Sears, the largest US department store chain, jumped 10.4 per cent to $55.40 after reporting a surprise profit and far exceeding analysts’ expectations.The company cut costs faster than Wall Street had thought and increased its profit margins.It also said it had been able to extend a credit agreement to increase the amount that it can access to $4.1bn.Gap, the clothing company, beat its own forecasts by a single cent after also successfully cutting costs.It saw slower declines at its Old Navy line, although there was weakness from the more upmarket Banana Republic brand. Its shares rose 2.6 per cent to $16.39.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all fell 0.2 per cent. The S&P finished at 887, the Dow at 8,277.32 and the Nasdaq at 1,692.01 That left them in line for weekly advances of between 0.6 and 1.5 per cent.Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab, said a quiet day with low volumes had seen equities drift ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. “There has got to be a reason for the market to go higher, especially after a 30 per cent rally, and I don’t see any reason for that today,” he said.Brett Hryb, senior portfolio manager at MFC Global added: “Nobody wants to be particularly long or short going into a long weekend.”Campbell Soup was another household consumer name to report its results after the market closed on Thursday, beating predictions with its profit, which was boosted by higher prices. Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $27.35.Meanwhile, Autodesk, the engineering software company whose chief executive Carol Bartz left to take over at Yahoo this year, reported higher profit than expected but said it would make more job cuts as the recession continues to bite. Its shares climbed 9.9 per cent to $20.70.Johnson & Johnson ended 0.4 per cent lower at $54.77 after announcing that it would spend nearly $1bn on acquiring its smaller rival Cougar, which develops cancer drugs. Cougar jumped 15.8 per cent to $42.82.General Motors had a turbulent day. Its shares rose in early pre-market trade on optimism over the price that it could get for Opel, its European business, after China’s Beijing Automotive Industry Corp entered the bidding for the company.They then fell back shortly before the bell after the Washington Post reported that the government could force the company into bankruptcy as early as next week. Later reports denied that the government had any such plans, however, quoting unnamed sources.This sent the shares up sharply in early trade but they then slumped again as bondholders rejected the company’s latest restructuring proposals and the Canadian Auto Workers said it was very likely GM would file for bankruptcy.Its shares closed down 25.5 per cent at $1.43, having earlier hit $2.24.Friday’s falls capped two weeks during which stocks have struggled for momentum, falling 2.3 per cent, amid suggestions the rally that began in March may have stalled."
35;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-02-27T00:29:03Z;Yahoo finance chief departs in reshuffle;;Yahoo, the internet company beset by a raft of executive departures, on Thursday announced a new management structure under Carol Bartz, its recently appointed chief executive.The much-anticipated news came as Yahoo also revealed Blake Jorgensen, its chief financial officer, would be the latest member of top management to leave.Ms Bartz, who took over from Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang six weeks ago, took a similar approach of clearing out executives and reorganising at her previous company – software maker Autodesk. However, there had already been a heavy bleeding of executive talent from Yahoo under Mr Yang.In her first entry on the corporate blog, Ms Bartz explained the need for change: “There’s …plenty that has bogged this company down. For starters, you would be amazed at how complicated some things are here,” she said.“So today I’m rolling out a new management structure that I believe will make Yahoo a lot faster on its feet.”Yahoo’s “notorious silos” were gone, she said, without giving details. A Yahoo spokesperson later explained the company’s Tech and Products groups were being combined in a single Products division run by Ari Balogh, chief technology officer. Yahoo would also be organised under two regions – North America and International, compared to four in the past.Yahoo has often been criticised for slowness in its execution and taking decisions. Allen Weiner, analyst at the Gartner research firm, said the changes should mean a more efficient operation.“There will be people in mobile and product development who report directly to Carol whose butts will be on the line. The level of accountability is going to be significant,” Mr Weiner said.In a separate regulatory filing, Yahoo said Mr Jorgensen would be leaving the company and a search for a chief financial officer had been initiated.Mr Jorgensen joined Yahoo from Thomas Weisel Partners in June 2007 and was close to Sue Decker, Yahoo’s president.Ms Decker had been the top internal candidate for the chief executive job, but the company announced at the time of Ms Bartz’s appointment that she would be leaving Yahoo.Yahoo shares rose 50 cents or 4 per cent to close at $12.98 in New York on news of the reorganisation.www.ft.com/techblog
36;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-02-25T23:55:46Z;Intel wants smarter stimulus tools;;Intel, the world’s biggest chip maker, is warning that companies taking advantage of government stimulus packages to build future infrastructure and transportation projects are relying on tools of the past that waste energy and cost more.Speaking at the Cleantech Forum in San Francisco, Sean Maloney, Intel executive vice president, urged the adoption of 3D simulation software to improve design and implementation.“Unless we move now, a lot of that [stimulus] money is going to get spent using techniques that were more appropriate to the 1980s and 1990s than now,” he said.“[Government] money would be spent far more efficiently with the maximum use of simulation and a coincidental benefit is energy reduction.”Mr Maloney, who also sits on the board of 3D computer-aided design software maker Autodesk, said 80 per cent of architects and engineers were not aware how computing performance had increased enough for them to trade in their 2D software packages for 3D ones that would work on cheaper, faster machines.He gave a number of examples in traditional manufacturing, construction and transportation industries – 3D modelling replacing physical prototypes of vehicles, designing buildings in 3D that revealed greater energy savings and computing power being brought to bear on building and running a new high-speed train network in China.On the energy theme, he urged the government to mandate instantaneous feedback on fuel consumption, citing the display in a Toyota Prius which shows fuel consumption and power sources being used. He also showed a software widget that could be brought up on a TV screen showing energy use within a home.Mr Maloney joked Intel was demonstrating “enlightened self-interest” in lobbying for smart technologies – it would ultimately help it sell more of its microprocessors.The US Congress has passed a $787bn stimulus package and other governments are also boosting spending on infrastructure to revive their economies. Technology companies like Intel are hoping some of the funds will trickle down to their businesses.
37;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-02-23T23:48:07Z;Yahoo executive departs ahead of shake-up;;Yahoo has suffered the loss of a top executive ahead of an expected management reorganisation under Carol Bartz, its new chief executive.Hearst Corporation, the media company, said on Monday it had hired Neeraj Khemlani, 38, head of Yahoo’s news and information division.Mr Khemlani will take up the post of vice-president and special assistant to the chief executive for digital media on March 23.Ms Bartz, 60, who was appointed Yahoo’s chief executive last month, is on the verge of announcing a management shake-up, according to reports, although Mr Khemlani’s departure is thought to be unrelated to her plans.When she took over from Jerry Yang, Yahoo co-founder, six weeks ago, the former chief executive of the software company Autodesk said she would not need much time to get to know the company.“I see the company as one with enormous assets that frankly could use a little management,” she said.According to an internal memo, published by the All Things Digital blog on Friday, Ms Bartz said this week would be a “biggie”, prompting speculation about a reorganisation of the internet company.Yahoo said the company did not comment on rumours or speculation.However, a person close to Yahoo said it was logical that a new chief executive would want to restructure the company. No final decisions had been made and the situation was fluid, the person said.The Bloomberg news service reported on Monday that Ms Bartz had commissioned searches for several high-level executives amid a management shuffle, citing a ­person familiar with the matter.Mr Khemlani’s departure may have prompted a rethink of Yahoo’s news and information division, where he was in charge of the news, technology, weather and education services as well as the editorial programming for finance.He also directed original content programming and oversaw content deals with big media companies.Hearst said in a statement he would be responsible for promoting and co-ordinating “digital content transformation” across the corporation, which includes 16 daily and 49 weekly newspapers, nearly 200 magazines and 29 television stations.Yahoo had suffered an exodus of top executives under Mr Yang as it lost market share in the search business to Google and was distracted by a bid from Microsoft for the company.“Yahoo has been battered in the last year …More than anything, let’s give this company some friggin’ breathing room,” said Ms Bartz on her appointment.
38;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Carol Bartz, Yahoo’s $20m-plus woman;;"Whatever you think about Jerry Yang, he was at least cheap. During his 18 months or so as Yahoo CEO he earned approximately $1.50. In fact, if you consider what’s happened to his 4 per cent stake in the company, his wealth actually decreased by around $750m.So what is there to make of Carol Bartz’s much more lucrative package?According to a filing on Thursday, the new boss will get a $1m annual salary and a target bonus of $2m, rising to $4m if she excels. On top of that is an $8m restricted stock award and another $10m to compensate her for various benefits she loses by giving up her job at Autodesk (this is not the kind of payment that corporate governance purists look too kindly on, but a reality of the CEO job market nonetheless.)She will also get options over another 5m shares. Some of those will only be exercisable if Yahoo’s stock price rises a lot from here. But with the stock currently in the dumps, she could stand to make a killing. For instance, if Yahoo gets back even to where it was before Microsoft made its takeover bid last year – a level that at the time was considered to be depressed – she could net another $37m.Will she be worth it?Certainly, the deal bears comparison with the one handed to another executive brought in to save a Valley icon: Mark Hurd at Hewlett-Packard. His package included $8.7m of restricted stock (plus options that are now showing a profit of $6m) for giving up his job at NCR; a “relocation bonus” of $2.75m for moving from the Midwest to sunny California; annual salary and target bonus of $4.2m; and options over a further 700,000 shares.Noone has been heard complaining lately that Mr Hurd is overpaid.And look at it this way: Terry Semel made nearly $72m in 2006, making him the highest-paid executive in the S&P 500 and drawing angry protests from shareholders. The largesse shown by Yahoo’s board to its new CEO certainly sounds more reasonable than that.It’s all down to Ms Bartz. Revive Yahoo, and she will be seen as value for money. Failure, though, would make her seem a very high-priced luxury."
39;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-01-14T09:42:27Z;Yahoo’s new chief;;"Indifference is not the most auspicious start. On Tuesday the market pushed shares of Yahoo down 1 per cent on the news that Carol Bartz will be filling the chief executive’s chair. Given that its shares are already at a third of the group’s late 2007 peak, the reaction was the investment equivalent of a Gallic shrug.The reason is that after two months of searching for a successor to Jerry Yang – who returned to lead the company he founded only to commit a $28bn faux pas by failing to sell up to Microsoft last year – Yahoo is making a safe but uninspired choice. The 60-year-old Ms Bartz, who has a background in sales, was regarded as a capable operator while running the commercial software company Autodesk. A selection of directorships at other high-profile technology companies also indicates that she is a Silicon Valley fixture.Familiarity with Yahoo’s top table also suggests continuity. Ms Bartz sits on the Intel board along with Yahoo’s president, Sue Decker, and will know Mr Yang from Cisco meetings. Like Yahoo’s share price, expectations for 2009 earnings have also plummeted in the past year, indicating that more of the same is insufficient. Yahoo is structurally disadvantaged in internet search compared with its competitor Google (while Microsoft arguably has better technology). Yahoo’s display advertising business needs both restructuring and a clear vision for its future.Still, the potential for visionary leadership to make a difference at a struggling company should not be overstated. AOL, the internet millstone around Time Warner’s neck, has defeated a succession of different executives. Mr Yang’s biggest failure at Yahoo was an inability to make decisions, set targets and hold people’s feet to the fire. If Microsoft intends to return to cherry-pick the best of Yahoo’s assets, an ability to bash what’s left into shape is exactly what Yahoo needs.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

40;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-01-14T00:35:22Z;Wall St lukewarm as Yahoo hails new chief;;Yahoo appointed software veteran Carol Bartz as its new chief executive on Tuesday, an appointment viewed by Wall Street as safe but unspectacular.Ms Bartz, 60, takes up the position immediately. She was previously executive chairwoman of Autodesk, a design software company that she led as chief executive for 14 years, and is a board member of Intel and Cisco Systems.Reports of her appointment sent Yahoo shares 1 per cent lower by the close in New York at $12.10.The software company also announced that Sue Decker, its president and the chief internal candidate for the job, would resign after a transitional period to pursue other challenges.Roy Bostock, Yahoo chairman, said Ms Bartz would lead Yahoo into its next era of growth.“She is the exact combination of seasoned technology executive and savvy leader that the board was looking for,” he said. “She is admired in the Valley as well as on Wall Street for her deep management expertise, strong customer orientation, excellent people skills, and firm understanding of the challenges facing our industry.”Wall Street analysts were more circumspect. “We think she would be a solid choice as Yahoo’s new chief executive, but we are concerned about her apparent lack of professional experience with internet companies and online advertising,” said Scott Kessler, analyst at S&P’s equity research.Mark Mahaney, Citigroup internet analyst, said she had been a highly effective chief at Autodesk, helping it to grow into a $4bn (£2.7bn) company. He said she would bring organisational skills and “substantial technology industry experience”, but added that she lacked media industry experience.That was something that the previous outsider to be appointed chief executive – Terry Semel – possessed in abundance, but Yahoo is seen to have fallen behind operationally during his tenure as it lost market share in the search arena to Google.Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s co-founder, replaced Mr Sempel as chief executive in 2007. Ms Bartz will take over with the company facing low single-digit growth in internet advertising in 2009 and its rival Microsoft still interested in picking up its search business after it walked away from a full takeover bid last year.
41;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2009-01-09T22:29:43Z;Yahoo closer to new CEO;;Yahoo has moved a little closer to naming its new chief executive, with at least two of the three candidates on the shortlist being women, according to reports.People close to the situation had been guiding us to expect an announcement around the end of January on who will succeed Jerry Yang, but they now say it may come just ahead of Yahoo’s fourth-quarter results, scheduled for January 27.Bloomberg reported today that Carol Bartz, (pictured) former chief executive of the design software company Autodesk, was one candidate, along with Sue Decker, Yahoo president, and another executive, whose identity has yet to emerge.Arun Sarin, former Vodafone chief, withdrew from the running last month.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, told us at CES this week that the current management transition represented a good opportunity for a search deal to be struck with Yahoo.
42;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2008-09-17T21:47:06Z;Oracle earnings stress sector’s dollar woes;;When Oracle, the world’s second biggest software company, reports its latest earnings on Thursday, it will highlight an inconvenient truth for the US technology industry: the big lift the sector has had in recent years from the weakening US dollar is over, at least for now.In its fiscal year to the end of May, roughly a quarter of Oracle’s reported revenue growth came from foreign currency translation effects, as the falling dollar increased the value of its overseas sales. Given their strong position in large parts of the global technology market, many other US tech companies have seen similar lifts from their big overseas positions.Currency adjustments have contributed nearly half of the revenue growth at software makers Symantec and Autodesk in the first half of this year, according to an analysis by Citigroup.A bounce in the dollar since July, particularly against the euro, has put at least a temporary end to that benefit, just as tech companies are bracing for a downturn in demand due to the weakening economy.Adobe, another big software concern, said this week that, in its most recent quarter, foreign currency adjustments had actually depressed its reported revenue slightly compared with the preceding three months, the first time for several years currencies have not provided a tailwind.Since Wall Street generally looks at year-to-year growth rates rather than quarter-to-quarter, the full impact of the stronger dollar, if it holds, will not be felt until next year. However, the dollar bounce will also have an immediate impact in at least two ways.For fast-growing companies whose growth is judged on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the currency tailwind of recent quarters will turn into an immediate headwind. That is still the case with Google, at least when it comes to the “whisper number” that Wall Street uses each quarter to assess the company’s earnings, said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst at Collins Stewart.“It is significant for Google,” Mr Aggarwal added. “It is a trend reversal, after 10 quarters of positive impact.” Foreign currency earnings have helped to support Google’s growth rate as it has hit the inevitable slowdown that comes with reaching massive size.Revenue growth in the second quarter fell to 43 per cent from 63 per cent a year before, but would have slumped to 36 per cent had it not been for a weaker dollar.A second immediate effect will come as Wall Street analysts start to revise their earnings forecasts for next year to reflect the new exchange rates.
43;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2008-06-25T03:43:09Z;Mentor stumbles in Flomerics bid;;Mentor Graphics, the US electronic design specialist listed on Nasdaq, has reported a fall in the level of acceptances for its hostile bid for Flomerics.At the second closing date on Tuesday it had received acceptances for a further 2.19 per cent of the shares in the Aim-listed engineering software company. On the first closing date on June 9 it had acceptances for 2.44 per cent of the shares.Earlier this month, Flomerics identified a potential rival bidder in Autodesk, another design software group listed on Nasdaq. Autodesk, which has a market capitalisation of about $9.3bn (£4.7bn) and annual sales of $2.2bn, has been in preliminary discussions with Flomerics for several weeks.The closing date for Mentor’s bid, which values Flomerics at £25.5m, is July 2. The group is offering 104p in cash plus the final dividend of 1.6p. It started building a stake in early March, buying a 20.1 per cent holding from Pricap, the largest shareholder, at 50½p a share.Flomerics shares closed unchanged at 105½p.● Meanwhile, Mentor is facing a bid from Cadence Design Systems, a bigger Nasdaq-listed rival. Last week Cadence, which has a market capitalisation of $2.7bn, offered $16 a share in cash for Mentor, a 30 per cent premium that valued the target at $1.6bn.Flomerics said Cadence’s unsolicited proposal valued Mentor at about 1.8 times historic revenues, and had been dismissed by Mentor as “insufficient to support a transaction”.The board said shareholders should reject the Mentor approach for the same reason, as its offer valued it at 1.2 times historic revenues.Mentor said that it deserved a healthy premium as it was profitable and had a good track record.In contrast, Flomerics was making losses on turnover from continuing operations of £14.6m. Mentor also pointed out that, before it appeared on the scene, Flomerics was worth just £11.6m.
44;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2008-06-06T18:05:21Z;Flomerics holds talks with new suitor;;Flomerics, the Aim-listed engineering software company facing a hostile bid from Mentor Graphics of the US, has identified a rival potential bidder in Autodesk.The company has been in preliminary discussions for four weeks with Autodesk, a design software group listed on Nasdaq. It has a market capitalisation of $9.3bn (£4.7bn) and annual sales of $2.2bn.The news added 5½p to shares in Flomerics, which closed yesterday at 112½p.Mentor, also a Nasdaq-listed electronic design specialist, is offering 104p in cash plus the final dividend of 1.6p. The company is much smaller than Autodesk, with a market capitalisation of about $1.1bn.The first closing date for its bid is on Monday. Mentor said its offer remained the only one available. “It is in cash and offers good value. Shareholders should not be distracted by the unconfirmed possibility of other bidders who may or may not table a rival offer.”Mentor’s bid values the equity in Flomerics at £25.5m. It started building a stake in early March, buying a 20.1 per cent holding from Pricap, the largest shareholder, at 50½p a share. It now has just under 30 per cent.Flomerics, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary as an independent company, has consistently urged shareholders to reject the offer.
45;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2008-04-07T20:53:08Z;Productivity gain from starting the weekend early;;"At half past three every Friday afternoon at Zehnder Communications, the words of Homer Simpson ring out over the PA system: “I would kill everyone in the room for a drop of sweet beer.” Then the beer gets cracked open (with soft drinks for abstemious types).For the past 12 years, staff at the New Orleans advertising agency have enjoyed “Free Beer Fridays”.“We wanted to do something regularly that would make this a great place to work,” explains Jeff Zehnder, chief executive. “It’s a cool-down period, a chance to get to know each other and talk over the week.”At the Montreal offices of design software business Autodesk, there’s a similar policy: Friday afternoons are all about beer and chips. “You can stop work at 4pm,” the company says, to sample “different kinds of speciality locally brewed beers, wines and a variety of potato chips. We do sometimes watch clients’ films, but mainly it’s just a good chance to unwind, relax and catch up with each other. It’s very well appreciated.”Others go further. “Summer hours” are a long-established institution in the US. Typically, from May to October, staff are allowed to arrive at work earlier in the mornings and then leave at lunchtime on Fridays. According to HR consulting firm Hewitt Associates, 10-12 per cent of large American employers offer staff this option. In the UK, PepsiCo offers it to staff at its Reading headquarters.Although allowing an early end to the week may seem like a nice thing to do, there are good reasons why this might be the best use of a Friday afternoon. The thing is, even if employers don’t give staff a winding down period, they’re likely to be doing it anyway.Research by UK-based Employment Law Advisory Services suggested that British businesses were losing £50m a year from employees skipping off on Friday afternoons. The firm found that bogus meetings, over-running lunches and doctor’s appointments were the top three excuses. And these findings are bolstered by research from the Automobile Association, the motor breakdown service, which suggests that the Friday afternoon rush hour in fact starts at noon.“It’s an endemic global phenomenon,” says Peter Mooney, ELAS head of consultancy. “It’s amazing how often you can send an e-mail or make a phone call and not get any response until Monday morning. More and more workers are seeing Friday afternoon as an unofficial holiday.”Sebastian Bailey, a director at the Mind Gym learning and development consultancy, says that, in many companies, even if staff are present their minds may be elsewhere. “Staff tend to wind down on Fridays if there aren’t pressing deadlines…People take their foot off the gas. Cyber-slacking with sites like Facebook is particularly prevalent.” Indeed, so well known is this phenomenon that it is enshrined in the language: “A Friday afternoon car” refers to a sub-standard vehicle, presumed to have been built after lunch on a Friday; and Friday is also sometimes known as ‘POETS’ day (piss off early, tomorrow’s Saturday).So, the thinking goes, as a business you may as well get the credit for something that your staff are probably going to do anyway. And besides, those who provide relaxed get-togethers give their staff an opportunity to bond, get to know people they don’t work with in their immediate environment and talk over the week’s issues. Perhaps companies that let staff wind down on a Friday afternoon will be more productive than those that keep them working up to the final bell.“By letting people go a little earlier or have beer and pizza on Friday afternoons, you create goodwill, engagement and loyalty,” says Mr Bailey, adding that the payback often comes in the form of greater effort at other times. Mr Zehnder puts it slightly more pithily: “If you work here, you bust your ass all week. By Friday afternoon, you’re brain dead.”"
46;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2008-02-27T21:46:46Z;Wall St stocks seesaw in volatile trading;;US stocks gyrated between positive and negative territory on Wednesday when traders weighed poor economic data and a plan to allow government-chartered mortgage lenders to buy more loans.The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said it would remove the cap on the value of mortgages they could buy, which could boost liquidity in the industry.The plan sparked a rally in financial stocks and homebuilders but fears about the health of the economy damped earlier enthusiasm.Quincy Krosby, chief in-vestment strategist at The Hartford, said: “Mortgages are at the heart of the credit problem.

49;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2005-01-24T21:47:05Z;Overview: Stocks unsteady as oil heads to $50;;"World stocks made an unsteady start to what promises to be another testing week for the markets, with investor concerns heightened on by the sight of US oil prices heading back up towards $50 per barrel.Nymex crude oil futures were higher after a weekend snowstorm in the US north-east and a blast of Arctic air increased demand for heating fuels.Worries about the potential for sabotage of Iraq's oil infrastructure before Sunday's planned elections also underpinned the price.Nymex March crude rose 62 cents to an early $49.15 per barrel before settling at $48.81, having risen to a seven-week high of $49.24 overnight.Tom Levinson at ING Financial Markets said that although the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had signalled on Friday that it was likely to cut quotas at this weekend's meeting, he still expected crude oil prices to drift lower throughout 2005.Mr Levinson expects supply to outpace global demand by the second quarter of the year by at least 1m barrels per day, sending WTI crude down to just above $40 per barrel from $48.81 at present. ""This would help contribute to lower headline inflation globally and provide grateful assistance to activity in a number of regions,"" he said.Wall Street made heavy weather of morning trade as the strong oil price boosted energy stocks but dragged on much of the rest of the market. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a substantial fall of 1.3 per cent, held back by a sharp drop in Autodesk after Banc of America cut its rating on the software and services group, citing expectations for slower sales growth.The Dow had closed at a 10-week low on Friday while the Nasdaq hit an 11-week trough, having registered losses in each of the past three weeks. It is the first time since 1982, the year that the 1980s bull market began, that the Dow and Nasdaq both fell in each of the first three weeks of a year.Nomura International insisted yesterday that Wall Street's hesitant start to the year had not dented its upbeat stance. Indeed, said strategist Anais Faraj, the market's current torpor was understandable in the face of Sunday's Iraqi election and Opec meeting, and the following week's meeting of the Group of Seven big economies.""This is in addition to the ebb and flow of earnings news as America's fourth-quarter reporting season reaches a climax,"" said Mr Faraj. ""Nor should we forget the [Federal Open Market Committee's] policy announcement on February 2 and the inevitable angst as to whether the measured language will persist.""Yet underpinning all this uncertainty is clear evidence of strong cyclical fundamentals and a healthy earnings outlook,"" he said.The UBS Index of US Investor Optimism dropped slightly this month. Investors had concerns about the economy and their personal investments. UBS said a 3-point fall to its current 76 reflected a fall in the measure's personal dimension. This estimates investors' confidence in their ability to attain investment targets and maintain income.Europe was held back by a pessimistic outlook from German chipmaker Infineon and as rising raw material costs for steelmakers revived worries about the outlook for corporate profits in the run-up to a new corporate reporting season. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dipped 0.01 per cent to 1,047.6.Tokyo turned higher, snapping a four-session losing streak, helped by a strong showing in the banks on hopes that reform in the sector would increase profits."
50;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2004-08-10T19:11:37Z;Carol Bartz of Autodesk;;"Carol Bartz beams with pride at the thought of the large numbers of customers using Autodesk software around the world – even if some of them are more welcome than others.“We have 6m users of all our various products in more than 160 countries – that’s legal users, there are 20m-30m pilfered products out there – but none the less that gives us more than 1bn drawings in our file format,” says Ms Bartz.“So what I like to say is, if God didn’t make it, our customers did.”Piracy may be unavoidable when you make AutoCad, the world’s best-known design and drafting software package, but for Ms Bartz, ubiquity is proof that the company is part of the real world, helping people design and engineer real things, and that is how she wants it to stay.Autodesk is the world’s 6th largest PC software company and, of the top 10, the oldest, bar Microsoft. But you might not have guessed that in the late 1990s when the valley’s dotcom parvenus were getting all the headlines, and venerable IT companies such as Autodesk, operating in a sector as unfashionable as computer-aided design software, seemed to fall off Wall Street’s radar.Being CEO of such a company was not easy in those days, but wasn’t it lucky that the company stuck to its knitting throughout that period? “At the time, we didn’t feel lucky,” says Ms Bartz. “I would wake up at night, thinking that we had slid into irrelevance. I honestly had that feeling – how did I miss all this?”Now, in today’s changed environment, she believes it is Autodesk’s turn to benefit. “A few years ago we were all talking about the information economy, we forgot that that is based on the manufactured and constructed economies,” she says. “So it’s nice that that is back in vogue. The good news for us – and, I think, for our customers – is that everybody now is looking for productivity and profits,” she says.It’s not that the misplaced euphoria of the late-1990s had no beneficial consequences. One of the foundations of the internet – and an enduring legacy of the dotcom era – is a global network based on cheap telecommunications, and this, says Ms Bartz, has created the environment in which customers can change their processes on a global basis.She defines product lifecycle management (PLM), one of the newer three-letter acronyms in industrial IT, as “keeping information digital and marrying it with cheap telecommunications.”That means using the network to exchange complex design and engineering data between suppliers and manufacturers, and managing it on a global basis. “There’s a level of interest and excitement around this,” says Ms Bartz, “because it’s real stuff that makes the world work.”Although PLM is simple in outline, it has so far failed to take the world by storm. This is due partly to general economic conditions, she says, but she also blames other vendors for approaching PLM heavy-handedly, offering three to four-year projects that do not appeal to companies looking for quick returns.“It’s like picking apples,” she says. “Some of these companies have started by putting a scaffold round the tree and missing out on three years of apples growing and falling down, before they can start picking them. I’m saying, you know what, we can pick some fruit from the ground and let’s use that little picker thing for the low-hanging fruit.”Autodesk’s approach to PLM, which is based on Microsoft’s .Net web services platform, is much more modular, she says. Customers can be using it effectively in a month, while rival products start by trying to address the “big pain points.”For PLM to work, however, designs have to be three-dimensional, because then they carry more information with them about what is being designed, which makes them more useful for engineering and manufacturing. Yet AutoCad, Autodesk’s biggest single product, is a 2D tool.Ms Bartz is at pains to point out that Autodesk is no longer the one-trick pony that it was a decade ago, when 95-100 per cent of revenues came from AutoCad. It now represents just 30-40 per cent of the business, as revenues from 3D animation, mapping and other newer businesses have grown, exploting the company’s expertise at “throwing bits around the screen,” as Ms Bartz puts it. But she admits that Autodesk’s historic association with 2D can cause difficulties when seeking to expand in 3D. “It’s like a comedy actress who decides she wants to play drama, but people say: ‘Gee, aren’t you into comedy?’”Nevertheless, Ms Bartz says Autodesk is outshipping its biggest competitor in the market for selling 3D Cad software to mid-range companies, the US company’s heartland. She sees many companies using a combination of 2D and 3D for a long time, partly because not everything has to be modelled in 3D. “Only 10 per cent of our customers have moved to 3D, and there’s a reason for that,” she says. “It has been very expensive and difficult to use.” But 3D is “right on our radar screen,” she says, “and simply moving our customer base over is enough business for us for a long time.”Besides, she points, out, the 2D market is not saturated: “Seventy per cent of our revenue every quarter is a new [Cad] seat, and that’s a combination of 2D and 3D seats,” she says.With new engineers graduating each year, the market in developing countries, and the replacement of companies’ old, in-house 2D systems with standard products, were keeping the market growing.Although PLM has taken longer to pique customers’ interest than many observers predicted, it is at last making headway, and raising the possibility of turf battles between the “pure-play” companies such as Autodesk and the big enterprise software vendors, such as SAP and Oracle.All have their own interpretation of PLM, but Ms Bartz rejects the notion of “one big vendor in the sky” doing everything for customers as a fantasy. “Customers we talk to are very, very fussy about how their design data is handled,” she says.On the other hand, customers do not want to buy their software in “a whole bunch of little chunks like it might have been in the late 1990s,” she says.“I think there will be naturally larger pieces of what customers ask the vendors to do. Design and PLM – design, manage and collaborate – is the bigger chunk that they are asking us to do, to handle this information beyond the desktop for them.”BIOGRAPHYEducation: holds an honours degree in computer science from the University of Wisconsin.

51;ADSK;Autodesk Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
