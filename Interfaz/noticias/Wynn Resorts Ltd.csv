Maybe a $7.1bn takeover of Australian billionaire James Packer’s Crown Resorts was too much to handle.News of Las Vegas-based Wynn’s A$10bn ($7.1bn) bid for the Aussie casino empire leaked early on Tuesday in Sydney. Crown confirmed the story in The Australian Financial Review saying that the two parties were in early talks.Wynn’s offer, comprising half cash and half Wynn stock, would have valued Crown at A$14.75 a share, a premium of 26 per cent over the stock’s closing price on Monday. Crown shares jumped 20 per cent on Tuesday to close at A$14.05.But just as gamblers were waking up in Vegas on Tuesday morning, Wynn called the whole thing off, apparently miffed by the premature disclosure.DD readers might be getting a sense of déjà vu. A potential tie-up between insurance brokers Aon and Willis Towers Watson met a similar fate last month after news emerged that Aon was considering buying its rival. The industry’s number two player was forced to admit it was considering a deal with Willis then changed its mind less than 24 hours later.Analysts might be pleased the Wynn/Crown deal didn’t get too far. Steve Wynn, the billionaire behind the casino brand, is mired in a sexual misconduct investigation in the US that could result in the company being stripped of its gaming licence in Massachusetts, where it plans to launch a $2.6bn hotel and casino near Boston in June, called the Encore Boston Harbor.He resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wynn in February last year following the allegations against him.“There’s too much going on,” said Eunice Lee, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong.The offer probably looked sweeter to Crown shareholders. The Crown business initially flourished and expanded to the US, Macau and elsewhere, but after 19 employees were arrested in China in 2016 and later convicted of “gambling-related crimes”, Packer retreated to Australia and sold most of the group’s overseas assets.Several major casino operators around the world are rolling the dice. Caesars Entertainment, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, has held talks about a potential merger with Tilman Fertitta’s Golden Nugget casino chain as well as other suitors.The takeover, if agreed by Crown shareholders, would’ve marked the end of an era for the Packer dynasty, which has played a central role in Australian business for almost a century. But as the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships.The record-breaking $100bn of orders that flooded Saudi Aramco’s landmark bond sale on Tuesday has left many observers asking how financial markets professionals have been able to move on so quickly from last year’s killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.But elsewhere in the debt markets, Jefferies and Credit Suisse have found out the hard way that there are limits to what investors consider ethical to buy.The two Wall Street banks have got their fingers burnt underwriting the leveraged buyout of a controversial Israeli cyber security company, which is being sued by a Saudi dissident who claims its software was used to spy on Khashoggi.Israel’s NSO Group has said that the suit is “completely unfounded”, denying its software was used to track Khashoggi. It also insists that the company is “committed to the ethical and responsible use of our technology”.The rush of headlines around NSO have meant Jefferies and Credit Suisse have struggled to find buyers for the $510m debt deal, with the two investment banks now set to lose money on the deal backing UK private equity firm Novalpina Capital’s acquisition of the Israeli group.Novalpina’s founder Stephen Peel, a former senior partner at private equity heavyweight TPG, set up the company with the express aim of investing in geographies and sectors where more traditional sponsors fear to tread. The company’s 2018 takeover of Baltic gaming group Olympic Entertainment is a good example.The NSO deal has attracted a lot of heat. Amnesty International wrote an open letter to Novalpina in February raising concerns that NSO’s software was being used to target people “solely as a result of their criticism of governments”.Peel stepped down from the board of international human rights group Global Witness the same day. He then wrote a letter in response to Amnesty last month that outlined the private equity group’s due diligence into NSO, which he said found no evidence to “substantiate the misuse allegations”.Read the full story from DD’s Rob Smith here.Risk factor sections in most initial public offering prospectuses aren’t the most exciting reading. Companies — and their lawyers — pack in every thing that could possibly go wrong to protect against any future legal claim.But the reading may be more interesting when Uber makes its documents public for its upcoming stock market flotation, expected to be one of the biggest in US corporate history.The car-booking company’s history of legal battles and regulatory entanglements casts a long shadow, reports the FT’s Shannon Bond.Securities lawyers and corporate governance experts say investors should prepare for lengthy disclosures about lawsuits and government investigations, including any issues dating back to its hard-charging co-founder and former chief executive, Travis Kalanick.The company has been pushing to clean up its trail of rule-breaking and aggressive tactics for the past 18 months under Mr Kalanick’s successor, Dara Khosrowshahi.But at the top of the mind for prospective shareholders will be the risks at the heart of Uber’s business model. It relies on a workforce that the company doesn’t consider employees — and therefore doesn’t have to meet regulations about pay and benefits.That’s kept labour costs down for Uber and its peers in the gig economy, but has also sparked a backlash from workers and scrutiny from regulators.“I can’t think of a bigger risk to them than the idea that these people will become employees,” said John Coffee, a Columbia University securities law expert.The Carlyle Group has hired Leigh Farris as a managing director and global head of corporate communications. Farris was previously a managing director and chief executive of communications at Goldman Sachs.SoftBank has hired industry veterans to oversee its $5bn Latin America-focused technology fund, according to Bloomberg. Paulo Passoni, a former managing director at the hedge fund Third Point, will join SoftBank’s Shu Nyatta as an investment partner for the SoftBank Innovation Fund. André Maciel, the former head of JPMorgan’s investment-banking advisory business in Brazil, will run the fund’s office in the country as a managing director.Private equity advisory firm Campbell Lutyens has hired Charlie Yan as a principal in its Hong Kong office. Yan, who will primarily focus on China, was previously a managing director at Fosun International.Emerging market investor Actis has hired Susan Wilkins as chief financial officer. Wilkins previously held the same title at Lekela Power, a renewable energy platform operating in Africa.Orrick has hired Stephen Thau as a partner in the law firm’s Washington office. Thau was previously a partner at Morrison Foerster where he focused on life sciences and tech companies.Passing on profit There used to be a time when investors would look at a key metric to determine whether a company was worth putting money into — profitability. Yet it’s the one thing the herd of unicorns galloping toward public markets seem to be missing. The FT’s John Thornhill says investors should take stock of the venture capital-backed behemoths rushing to market. (FT)China makes a splash across the Pacific As the US-China trade war simmers, there may be another geopolitical clash brewing between the two nations over the Pacific islands. China is making its presence felt in the region, which the US considers strategically vital, raising concerns that Beijing has military designs on the territory. (FT)Bayer’s killer headache When Bayer acquired Monsanto — producer of the world’s best-selling weedkiller — last year, it probably didn’t anticipate how toxic it would be for its share price. The German company insists the glyphosate-based product is safe while lawyers argue that outside studies of the weedkiller’s safety were tainted by Monsanto’s influence.

1;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2019-04-10T00:53:13Z;Crown Resorts drops 11% after Wynn ends takeover talks;The Australian gambling and resorts company had confirmed the $7.1bn bid on Tuesday;Shares in Australian casino operator Crown Resorts tumbled on Wednesday, after Wynn Resorts said it had terminated discussions on a takeover deal. Crown shares were down as much as 11 per cent in morning trading in Sydney on Wednesday. “Following the premature disclosure of preliminary discussions, Wynn Resorts has terminated all discussions with Crown Resorts concerning any transaction,” Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts said in a statement on Tuesday. Wynn shares fell 3.9 per cent in response. Crown stocks had jumped 20 per cent on Tuesday to close at A$14.05 as details of the deal emerged. The Australian gambling and resorts company said on Tuesday that it had received a A$10bn ($7.1bn) bid from Wynn, valuing Crown at A$14.75 a share, a premium of 26 per cent over Monday’s closing price.Early leaks of the talks from Australian press came as the two sides were still negotiating sensitive issues, according to a person briefed on the situation. Wynn initially confirmed the talks in a statement before announcing it had terminated talks.
2;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2019-04-09T15:39:02Z;Wynn withdraws $7.1bn takeover bid for Crown Resorts;US gaming company ends talks less than 24 hours after Australian group said it had received bid;Wynn Resorts, the Las Vegas gaming giant created by billionaire Steve Wynn, has abruptly terminated talks to buy Australia’s Crown Resorts, less than 24 hours after Crown disclosed it had received a A$10bn ($7.1bn) bid.A takeover, if agreed by Crown shareholders, would have marked the end of an era for the Packer dynasty, which has played a central role in Australian business for almost a century.But the early leak of the talks, which emerged in the Australian press, came as the two sides were still trying to negotiate a series of sensitive issues, said a person briefed on the situation.“Following the premature disclosure of preliminary discussions, Wynn Resorts has terminated all discussions with Crown Resorts concerning any transaction,” Wynn said in a statement on Tuesday.The talks came as both casino operators face leadership challenges. James Packer, Crown’s former executive chairman, stepped down from the company’s board last year citing mental health issues.Steve Wynn resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wynn in February last year after sexual harassment allegations against him.A combination would have faced serious challenges to complete, since the sexual misconduct investigation in the US could result in Wynn being stripped of its gaming licence in Massachusetts — a key market where Wynn is planning this year to open a $2.6bn hotel and casino called the Encore Boston Harbor. The Massachusetts probe suggested that executives at Wynn actively concealed the allegations against Mr Wynn.Wynn’s offer, comprising half cash and half Wynn stock, would have valued Crown at A$14.75 a share. Crown shares jumped 20 per cent on Tuesday to close at A$14.05 before the talks were called off.Some analysts said the proposed deal, which represented a premium of 26 per cent over Crown shares’ closing price on Monday, was hard to justify.“They have an ongoing sexual misconduct investigation in the US and they don’t know how much the fine from the Massachusetts Gaming Commission could be for this . . . There is too much going on,” said Eunice Lee, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong.A number of major casino operators around the world are exploring combinations as their businesses face numerous challenges. For example, Caesars Entertainment, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, has held talks about a potential merger with Tilman Fertitta’s Golden Nugget casino chain as well as other suitorsThe Packers’ gaming business initially flourished and expanded to the US, Macau and elsewhere. However, after 19 Crown employees were arrested in China in 2016 and later convicted of “gambling-related crimes”, Mr Packer retreated to Australia and sold most of the group’s overseas assets.After Mr Packer resigned from Crown’s board in March last year, he also quit all his Australian directorships, including Consolidated Press Holdings, the private investment vehicle through which he holds his near-50 per cent stake in Crown.Crown is building a A$2.2bn casino on Sydney’s waterfront that is targeted at high- roller VIP gamblers, primarily from China. Critics have warned about the competition it faces from the existing Star casino as well as from rival projects in other Asian countries including Japan.

4;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2019-04-02T17:33:51Z;Wynn executives said to have concealed harassment claims;Massachusetts regulators consider whether to strip company of its casino license;Executives at Wynn Resorts actively concealed sexual harassment allegations against Steve Wynn, the billionaire behind Las Vegas casinos including the Mirage and the Bellagio, according to a state investigation into whether the company should be stripped of its gaming licence in Massachusetts.The investigation into one of the highest-profile corporate cases of the #MeToo era will determine the US company’s ability to operate a $2.6bn hotel and casino near Boston called the Encore Boston Harbor, which is due to open this June.The report found that three executives knew of a settlement of sexual harassment allegations against Mr Wynn at the time the company applied for a licence to operate the resort but failed to inform the Massachusetts Gaming Commission. All three executives have since left the company.Mr Wynn declined to co-operate in the 200-page report by the commission’s Investigations and Enforcement Bureau. The billionaire casino tycoon last year resigned as chairman and chief executive of the company he founded, and as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, after allegations from dozens of women came to light. Mr Wynn, 77, said at the time: “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.”The corporate failures revealed in this investigation are significant, repetitive, and reflective of the company’s historical governance practicesMatt Maddox, who stepped up from president to chief executive when Mr Wynn resigned, told a commission hearing on Tuesday that “many of us [had been] in denial” at the time The Wall Street Journal revealed the allegations against Mr Wynn but he was now “deeply remorseful” after discovering how many victims were involved.In the wake of the sweeping allegations, regulators in Massachusetts and Nevada opened investigations into the conduct of Mr Wynn, his top executives and his board, raising concerns that the company’s gaming licenses could be in jeopardy.Tuesday’s hearing follows the Nevada Gaming Commission’s decision in February to impose a record $20m fine on the Las Vegas-based company, with one commissioner citing a “failure of corporate culture”. The Nevada body decided against stripping the company of its gaming licence, however.In his remarks to the Massachusetts commissioners, Mr Maddox said the allegations had thrown the company into turmoil. “Many” large private equity groups had contacted him seeking to break the company up, he said, and activist investors had been circling.Since the allegations emerged, investigators noted, high-ranking executives who knew of the allegations against Mr Wynn had resigned or been removed and the company had overhauled its board with the addition of an outside chairman and four women directors.“The significant changes in leadership, policies, structure, and internal controls at the company do not erase the fact that the corporate failures revealed in this investigation are significant, repetitive, and reflective of the company’s historical governance practices,” the investigators’ report observed.“Inaction and failures” on the part of former executives “appear to have contributed to a culture where employees were reluctant to report allegations against Mr Wynn to management”, they added, inviting the commission “to evaluate the entirety of the company’s response” to the allegations in making its decision on Wynn’s licence.Shares in Wynn Resorts rose 4.4 per cent in New York on Tuesday. The Nasdaq-traded stock has dropped nearly 24 per cent in the past year.Mr Wynn had helped transform Las Vegas into a centre of gambling tourism, building large luxury resorts in the Nevada city, starting with The Mirage in 1989. He later set his sights on Macau, the only part of China where gambling is legal, helping mould it into a gambling destination.Amid the regulatory scrutiny, Wynn Resorts has pushed on with building the Encore Boston Harbor, located on Mystic River in Massachusetts. One of the state’s largest private real estate developments, it is expected to employ about 5,000 people.
5;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-11-07T22:42:06Z;Wynn Resorts CEO sees post-Golden Week ‘slowdown’ in Macau, shares fall;Shares fell 13% in extended trade despite upbeat third-quarter revenues;Strength in Macau helped casino operator Wynn Resorts post upbeat third-quarter revenues but that was outweighed by the company’s warning of a slowdown in its biggest market since Golden Week in October.Revenues rose more than 10 per cent from a year ago to $1.71bn in the three months ended in September. That topped estimates for $1.66bn, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.Operating revenues at Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau — both properties in the former Portuguese colony and the only Chinese territory where casino gambling is legal — rose 39.1 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively. Revenues at its Las Vegas operations slid 14.1 per cent to $398.9m.However, on the company’s earnings call, chief executive Matthew Maddox said while China’s national Golden Week holiday proved strong, “what we’ve seen post-Golden Week has been a slowdown”. He noted that since Golden Week it has been “quite choppy” midweek and weekends have been “sporadic” and said “what we’ve seen more recently is murky”.Investors soured on the stock following his comments. Wynn shares, which had initially traded up 3 per cent after the results, reversed course and were down nearly 13 per cent.The Las Vegas-based company said third-quarter net income rose to $219.8m or $1.44 a share, up from $105.97m or 78 cents a share in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for one time items, earnings of $1.68 a share missed expectations by a penny.Wynn shares had declined more than 32 per cent year-to-date as of Wednesday’s close.
6;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-09-19T18:17:47Z;Casino stocks rise as hedge funds roll the dice on sector;;Casino stocks climbed higher on Wednesday amid media speculation of growing interest in the sector from activist hedge funds.Investors appeared to have latched on to a late-Tuesday report from the New York Post that Starboard Value, the hedge fund trying to shake things up at cyber security company Symantec and consumer goods company Newell Brands, has taken a “sizeable position” of more than $500m, in MGM Resorts International and was pushing for major changes.However, Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported this morning that Starboard Value does not own shares of MGM and had no economic exposure to the stock, but said that a representative of the fund had declined to comment.HG Vora, another hedge fund, revealed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday it had taken a stake in Caesars Entertainment. The NY Post reported last week, citing sources, that HG Vora would push for changes at the company which operates the Harrah’s and Horseshoe casino brands.HG Vora also holds a stake in MGM, as do other hedge funds including Canyon Capital, Soroban Capital Partners and Eminence Capital.MGM shares were up 3.1 per cent in afernoon trade, while Caesars Entertainment was up 0.7 per cent, Wynn Resorts added 2.6 per cent and Las Vegas Sands rose 0.8 per centShares in all four companies are down by double-digits this year amid investor concerns that revenues from Las Vegas were looking weak. Caesars had said it expected the summer could be soft owing to unusually light business from conventions and a lack of blockbuster events over the period such as the Conor McGregor/Floyd Mayweather boxing match last year.That is on top of concerns that the trade war between the US and China could hurt Chinese consumer spending and shrink revenues in Macau, which is the world’s biggest gambling centre.This story has been updated from an earlier version to reflect the conflicting media reports.
7;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-07-03T08:49:14Z;Chips down for casino operators as Macau revenue disappoints;Hong Kong-listed shares slump despite 12.5% June growth in world’s largest gambling hub;Shares in Macau casino operators tumbled on Tuesday in Hong Kong, mirroring declines by their US counterparts in New York, as investors reacted to data showing slower-than-expected monthly revenue growth in the world’s largest gambling centre.Revenue from so-called games of fortune in the Chinese enclave — the only part of the country where casinos are legal — grew 12.5 per cent to 22.49bn patacas ($2.78bn) in June, according to official data, missing analysts’ expectations for growth of 18 per cent.It was the 23rd straight monthly increase for Macau gaming revenue, continuing a recovery following a downturn spurred by Beijing’s corruption crackdown under President Xi Jinping. The anti-graft campaign, combined with some broader weakness in the Chinese economy, weighed heavily on activity in the former Portuguese colony between 2014 and 2016.Accumulated gross revenue for the first six months of 2018 was up 18.9 per cent, at $18.6bn, compared with the previous corresponding period.In Hong Kong, where markets were shut on Monday for a public holiday, shares in Galaxy Entertainment fell 6.5 per cent while Melco International shed 9.7 per cent, Sands China slid 6.2 per cent and Wynn Macau lost 7.9 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed down 1.4 per cent.In New York trading on Monday, Wynn Resorts dropped 8.6 per cent while US-listed ADRs for Melco Resorts fell 11.4 per cent — the most in nearly 19 months — before closing down 10.6 per cent. MGM Resorts lost 3 per cent.Analysts at Nomura had forecast month-on-month revenue growth in June of about 20 per cent on the belief that the football World Cup and the reported removal last month of mobile payment terminals by UnionPay “have had little (if any) impact on demand so far”. They also had pegged the recent dragon boat festival in Hong Kong and the June 15 opening of Melco’s new Morpheus hotel as potential boosts for revenue.China’s efforts to curb capital flight have led to the imposition of daily withdrawal limits for UnionPay bank cards at ATMs in Macau, among other measures.Commenting on reports of UnionPay mobile payment terminals being withdrawn from casino premises, analysts at Daiwa said in a note dated June 7 that “the market has downplayed the potential implications on the sector as this latest development poses heightened risks on the major liquidity channels in Macau”.Macau also is facing a potential challenge from Japan, which is on the brink of passing regulations that could create the world’s second-largest casino market. Operators including Wynn and Melco are looking to enter Japan, where industry projections have suggested revenue could hit $15bn a year.
8;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-07-02T18:39:55Z;Chips down for US casinos as Macau revenue disappoints;;US casino stocks took a tumble after data showed slower-than-expected monthly revenue growth in Macau, the world’s largest gambling centre.Revenue from so-called games of fortune in the Chinese enclave, which is the only part of the country where casinos are legal, grew 12.5 per cent to 22.49bn Macanese patacas ($2.78bn) in June, but coming in short of analysts’ expectations for growth of 18 per cent.Still, gaming revenues rose last month for the 23rd month in a row, continuing the recovery after Beijing’s 2014 corruption crackdown weighed heavily on activity in the former Portuguese colony.Accumulated gross revenue for the first six months of 2018 was up 18.9 per cent to $18.6bn compared to the previous corresponding period.Shares in Wynn Resorts were down 8.6 per cent in mid-afternoon trading, with the drop exacerbated by Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s decision to cut its price target on the stock to $180 from $205.US-listed ADRs for Melco Resorts were down 11.4 per cent - the most in nearly 19 months. MGM Resorts fell 3.1 per cent.Analysts at Nomura had forecast month-on-month revenue growth in June of about 20 per cent on the belief that the World Cup and the reported removal last month of mobile payment terminals by UnionPay “have had little (if any) impact on demand so far”. The recent dragon boat festival and June 15 opening of Melco’s new hotel, named Morpheus, may have also given revenues a boost, they surmised in a June 19 report.China’s efforts to curb capital flight in recent years led to the imposition of daily withdrawal limits for UnionPay bank cards at ATMs in Macau among other measures. Reflecting on reports UnionPay mobile payment terminals being withdrawn from casino premises, analysts at Daiwa said in a note dated June 7 they believed “the market has downplayed the potential implications on the sector as this latest development poses heightened risks on the major liquidity channels in Macau.”
9;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
10;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-06-01T15:42:38Z;Casino stocks fall as Macau gaming revenue disappoints;;Shares of US-listed casinos that operate in Macau fell on Friday after the world’s largest gambling hub reported lower-than-expected revenues last month.Shares in Melco Resorts & Entertainment fell 2.42 per cent, Wynn Resorts shares dropped 1.72 per cent, and Las Vegas Sands shares dipped 0.71 per cent at around 11:15am in New York.Macau on Friday said gaming revenues rose 12.1 per cent to 25.5bn patacas ($3.2bn) in May, well below the 16 to 20 per cent growth analysts had expected.The disappointing revenue still marked 22 consecutive months of growth after Beijing’s anti-corruption crackdown in 2014 spooked high rollers from mainland China, and dealt a blow to the island’s gaming revenue for more than two years.Macau in recent years has been challenged by its neighbours like Singapore, the Philippines and Japan, which is working on easing gambling regulations after legalising casinos in 2016. Operators like Wynn and Melco, which already has a casino in Manila, are looking to enter Japan.
11;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-05-14T21:19:34Z;Wynn announces more board changes amid battle with largest shareholder;;"Elaine Wynn has just scored a point in her battle to shake up the boardroom at casino operator Wynn Resorts.

Wynn Resorts on Monday said that incumbent John Hagenbuch — the board member whom Ms Wynn has been seeking to oust — has decided not to stand for re-election at the annual shareholder meeting this week.Ms Wynn, the company’s largest shareholder, had launched a campaign to withhold a vote for Mr Hagenbuch, citing close ties to Wynn Resorts’ former chief executive and her ex-husband Steve Wynn. Mr Wynn stepped down earlier this year following sexual harassment allegations, which he denied.“Over the past three months, the Board has done a remarkable job maintaining stability at Wynn and managing through a tumultuous time that could easily have caused much deeper disruption to the company’s business,” Mr Hagenbuch said. “There is still more work to be done, and I do not want my candidacy to detract from the important progress we have made throughout the organisation, including the ongoing refreshment process this Board has initiated.”The company said that another board member, Robert Miller, had also handed in his resignation. With the latest departures, Wynn has lost five incumbent board members since the start of the year.

The decision is expected to open the door for states to allow betting on college and professional sports.GVC Holdings, which owns the high street betting shop Ladbrokes Coral in the UK as well as online gambling sites Bwin, Sportingbet, PartyPoker and Foxy Bingo, jumped 5.2 per cent.Paddy Power Betfair, another UK bookmaker that has designs on the vast US market, ripped 10.6 per cent higher.Among US gambling stocks, Churchill Downs, which owns five racetracks and six casinos, was up 3.9 per cent at $289.75Las Vegas-centric operators were the main outlier, however, given that the ruling is expected to break the city’s hold on sports betting.

Ms Wynn has alleged Mr Hagenbuch has close ties to Mr Wynn.Ms Wynn has been pressing Wynn Resorts to create a board comprising mostly new directors and improve its corporate governance. She also sued the company in a Nevada court to compel Wynn Resorts to produce all of the shareholder list materials she requested and delay its annual shareholders meeting.Wynn has thus far appointed three independent female directors and agreed to provide Ms Wynn with the lists she has requested.“The Board acted quickly and decisively to do what is right for the Company and its shareholders,” Wynn said in its letter to shareholders. The company added:Her solicitation does not offer anything new or constructive, and is potentially disruptive both to the business and to the Board’s sweeping initiatives. The Board has effected meaningful change and is continuing to do so in an orderly way that preserves reasonable continuity and facilitates smooth operation of the business
14;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-05-02T15:46:01Z;Elaine Wynn steps up battle with Wynn Resorts;;Elaine Wynn, the largest shareholder of Wynn Resorts, has escalated her battle with the company’s board, filing a complaint against the casino operator in Nevada state court.Ms Wynn‘s complaint asks the court to compel Wynn Resorts to produce all of the shareholder list materials including the name, contact information and number of shares held by each beneficial owner of common stock who has not objected to having his or her name disclosed — the so-called NOBO list — according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Ms Wynn is also seeking to temporarily stay the company’s shareholder meeting currently slated for May 16.In response Wynn said it would provide Ms Wynn with the lists she has requested but said delaying the shareholder meeting is “unwarranted”. The company said in an emailed statement:Elaine Wynn once again has chosen to litigate rather than communicate, despite the company’s public offers to meet with her to discuss the current state of the business. This time, she has asked a court to delay the Wynn Resorts Annual Meeting, which has long been scheduled for May 16. We believe a delay is unwarranted and not in the best interests of shareholders.She is also demanding we provide additional materials that go far beyond what is required under Nevada law. As a sign of our good faith, the Company will provide her with the shareholder (NOBO and DTC) lists she now seeks.The back-and-forth continued later on Wednesday as Ms Wynn said she is “astounded” by the company’s letter to shareholders and added that she “had no choice but to sue” after repeatedly being denied information that “she is clearly entitled to”.Ms Wynn added: “In my view, the delay in sending me the shareholder lists has disadvantaged all shareholders, as the Company continues to pursue policies that seem to advance the interests of an entrenched board over shareholders. This behaviour is not emblematic of a ‘New Wynn.’ Instead, it shows that very little has changed at Wynn Resorts.”The move comes after Ms Wynn has pushed for an overhaul of the board. Thus far the casino operator has appointed three independent female directors to its board as part of a strategic change in the aftermath of Steve Wynn’s departure. In a brief letter last week the company noted the additions and said it “is working in an orderly fashion to refresh its composition” and intends to “continue its work”.Ms Wynn has previously suggested declassifying the board, making it so that each board member has to stand for election every year, and asked that the board vote to increase its size so that newly elected directors would constitute a majority of the board.Earlier this week, Ms Wynn asked shareholders to withhold a vote against John Hagenbuch at the annual shareholder meeting next week, citing close ties to former chairman and chief executive Mr Wynn.Mr Wynn resigned from his position as chief executive of Wynn Resorts earlier this year amid sexual harassment allegations and sold off the rest of his stake in the company that he founded. Ms Wynn settled a long-running legal battle with her ex-husband last month.Wynn Resort shares, which are up 13 per cent year-to-date, were down 0.6 per cent at pixel time.

That was a larger increase than the 22.2 per cent rise seen in March and ahead of analysts’ expectations.That triggered a jump in shares of casino operators.MGM Resorts, which last week lowered its revenue outlook for the year, was an exception, with shares falling 1.2 per cent to $31.02.Gaming revenue in the former Portuguese colony has increased for 21 consecutive months, after a Chinese anti-graft campaign triggered a more than two-year slump in business. Despite the recovery however, revenues remain shy of their 2014 highs.

Wynn Resorts attributed the loss to a $436.4m litigation settlement expense related to Steve Wynn and his departure from the company.Casino revenues for Wynn Macau climbed 10.5 per cent year on year to $539m as VIP turnover rose, while casino revenues at Wynn Palace jumped 50.7 per cent year on year to $568.5m.Wynn Macau shares were off 3.6 per cent against a 0.9 per cent fall for the Hang Seng index.
17;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-04-24T20:48:44Z;Wynn posts upbeat adjusted profits on Macau gains;;Casino operator Wynn Resorts posted better-than-expected adjusted earnings in the first quarter following gains at its Macau properties.The Las Vegas-based company said it swung to a loss of $204.3m, or $1.99 a share, — which it largely attributed to a $436.4m litigation settlement expense related to Steve Wynn and his departure from the company — from a profit of $100.8m, or 99 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.Adjusting for one-time costs, the company reported earnings of $2.30 a share, handily topping estimates for $1.98 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Mr Wynn resigned as chairman and chief executive in February following allegations of sexual harassment. In the wake of the allegations, Elaine Wynn, Mr Wynn’s ex-wife and the company’s biggest shareholder, has been campaigning for change to its board. Wynn Resorts this month appointed three independent female directors to its board.Wynn on Tuesday said its revenues rose 20.5 per cent from a year ago to $1.72bn, just shy of analyst estimates for $1.75bn. Operating revenues from Wynn Macau were up nearly 12 per cent to $618.2m, while casino revenues were up 10.5 per cent, reflecting strength in the VIP segment. Revenues at Wynn Palace on the Cotai strip in Macau were up 47 per cent to $665.8m.The stabilisation of the Macau gaming market has helped bolster results for casino operators after a Chinese anti-graft campaign saw revenues fall for more than two years in the former Portuguese colony, the only part of China where gambling is legal.Meanwhile, revenues from its Las Vegas operations were up 3 per cent year-on-year to $431.5m.Wynn shares, which are up nearly 13 per cent year-to-date, were down 0.8 per cent in after-hours trade.

Wynn Resorts’ board had launched an internal investigation led by a third-party law firm into the company’s awareness and its response to the allegations against its former head.Elaine Wynn, Mr Wynn’s ex-wife and the company’s largest shareholder, called on the board to restructure its board and reform its governance structure in a filing with the SEC on Tuesday. Ms Wynn urged the board to reopen the window during which shareholders can nominate directors at the annual meeting and pushed for the majority of the board to be comprised of new directors with the aim of “fully restoring its reputation and in transforming it into a corporate governance leader”.Wynn Resorts also said it settled six years of litigation with Japanese gaming group Universal Entertainment for $2.4bn.Wynn shares, which are up 14 per cent year-to-date, were little changed in after-hours trade.
19;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-04-16T22:15:11Z;Wynn Resorts’ Steve Wynn, ex-wife settle legal battle;;Casino magnate Steve Wynn and his ex-wife Elaine have reached an agreement ending a long-running legal battle over shares of Mr Wynn’s Wynn Resorts.The settlement was announced on Monday after the close of trading in New York. It will resolve Ms Wynn’s claims that Mr Wynn violated their shareholders’ agreement.Ms Wynn has also ended claims against Wynn Resorts and its general counsel, Kim Sinatra, in connection with the allegations against Mr Wynn, and they in turn released claims against Ms Wynn, the statement said.Wynn Resorts and Ms Sinatra did not make any payment under the agreement, the statement said. No further details were given.A representative for Mr Wynn said in a statement that he “has resolved all outstanding legal issues with his former wife, Elaine Pascal Wynn. Mr Wynn expressed gratification that he was able to put all of the personal unpleasantness of the last few years between he and Ms Wynn behind him.”According to Thomson Reuters data, Ms Wynn is currently the largest single shareholder of Wynn Resorts, with a 9.26 per cent stake as of the latest filing on March 14.The settlement comes in connection with a 2012 lawsuit filed by Ms Wynn over her stake in the company. As the litigation played out, Mr Wynn came under fire for allegations that he had engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment while running the company.Mr Wynn has since resigned from his position as chief executive of Wynn Resorts and recently sold off the rest of his stake in the company that he founded.
20;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-03-23T03:59:05Z;Embattled Wynn Resorts founder sells out for $2.14bn, Galaxy buys in;;The embattled casino boss Steve Wynn is selling all his shares in the company he founded after reports of sexual harassment allegations emerged earlier this year.The former chief executive’s remaining 8 million shares will be bought by two existing investors for $175 a share, Wynn Resorts said in a statement. That came after Mr Wynn sold 4.1 million shares for $180 on the open market, implying a total gain for Mr Wynn of $2.14bn. Wynn Resorts, which owns casinos in Macau and Las Vegas, also said that Hong Kong-listed Macau casino operator Galaxy Entertainment would pay $927.5m for 5.3 million shares in the company. Mr Wynn stepped down as head of his gaming empire in February after The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Mr Wynn had engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct. Mr Wynn has denied the allegations.

Mr Wynn resigned as chairman and chief executive last month, following a report by the Wall Street Journal that he had engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct towards staff at his resorts. In one case he was alleged to have paid a $7.5m settlement to a manicurist at the Wynn Las Vegas who alleged that he forced her to have sex with him. Mr Wynn has denied the allegations.Mr Okada and Mr Wynn were long-time business associates and Mr Okada helped fund the creation of Wynn Resorts after Mr Wynn lost Mirage Resorts to a hostile takeover by MGM Grand. Through Universal, Mr Okada held a 20 per cent stake in Wynn.Wynn forced Mr Okada to give up the shares in 2012 in exchange for a redemption note of $1.94bn, a 30 per cent discount to their market value at the time, and voted him off the board. Wynn accused the Japanese mogul of making “secret plans” to compete with its Macau casinos and of bribing gaming officials in the Philippines, a charge he denies.Last year, Mr Okada was pushed out of his own business empire.Wynn said it would pay Universal and its subsidiary Aruze USA the $1.94bn principal amount of the note plus an additional $464m to settle allegations surrounding the interest rate on the note on March 31. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr Okada is not a party to the settlement between Wynn and Universal. A lawsuit from Wynn alleging Mr Okada breached his fiduciary duty is set to go to trial in Las Vegas next month.
22;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-03-02T05:00:50Z;Macau bets on luring Chinese mass market punters;Shift from VIP gamblers is a political and financial necessity, say analysts;Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts are stalwarts of the US gambling industry but their profits — and their prospects— depend on tempting new Chinese punters like Li Yunlong into their glitzy, multibillion dollar Macau venues.The 28-year-old project manager, who works at a baby milk company in China’s northernmost Heilongjiang province, has travelled 3,000 kilometres south to try his luck in the only part of China where casinos are legal.“I want to experience gambling,” says the novice, who is planning to bet $100-$200 at the casino tables. “But I don’t know how to play any of the games.”A jump in mass-market visitors like Mr Li helped push gross gaming revenue to $6.3bn in the first two months of the year, up 20 per cent on the same period in 2017, according to official data released this week.Under pressure from the Chinese government to reduce their reliance on credit-fuelled high-rollers, Macau’s six casino operators — Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, US rival MGM Resorts International and three local players — have invested more than $20bn over the past five years in sprawling new resorts designed to attract a wider range of customers from across the world’s most populous country.Their mission to lure more Chinese gamblers from beyond their traditional base in neighbouring Guangdong province will be supported by a raft of infrastructure developments this year. These include a vast bridge linking Macau to Hong Kong’s well-connected airport and an extension of China’s high-speed rail network to near the Macau border.Analysts say that the shift from VIP to mass-market gamblers is a political and financial necessity, after Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a nationwide crackdown on corruption and exuberance that prompted Macau’s gross gaming revenue to slide from a record high of $45bn in 2013 to $33bn last year.“Macau needs to work on reinventing itself as more mature markets like Las Vegas have done,” says James Murren, chief executive of MGM Resorts, which opened its new $3.4bn Macau casino last month. “The Chinese government has been crystal clear and for those who don’t listen it will be to their peril.”The fancy restaurants, theatrical shows and theme-park rides at these resorts are marketing tools for the casinos, which are not allowed to advertise in China, more than profit centres in themselves, say analysts.Non-gaming facilities in Macau produce just 12 per cent of total revenue, according to Morgan Stanley, compared with 65 per cent on the Las Vegas Strip, which hosts hit shows, top sporting events and major conferences.But it is Macau that generates the majority of profits for Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, which is going through a tricky transition period after founder and chief executive Steve Wynn resigned last month after sexual harassment allegations made against him.Last year, Macau accounted for 71 per cent of adjusted earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Wynn Resorts and 53 per cent at Las Vegas Sands.The shift to mass-market customers should help boost Macau profits because casinos make bigger margins from them than the VIPs. Casinos typically give these high-rollers rebates on their gambling losses and share a chunk of profits with junkets, the middlemen who bring in the Chinese VIPs and extend them credit to get around China’s capital controls.Praveen Choudhary, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says that mass-market profit margins are about 40 per cent compared with 10 per cent for the VIPs.The proportion of gaming revenue generated by mass-market gamblers has already risen from 27 per cent in 2011 to 43 per cent last year, according to analysis by debt rating agency Standard & Poor’s, partly as a result of a slump in VIP gambling after the corruption crackdown began.Clifford Kurz, an analyst at S&P, expects this shift to continue as Macau, a former Portuguese colony, continues to benefit from the growth of outbound travel in China.“In the long term, we expect the mass market to be a sustainable driver of gaming revenue growth,” he says.But Macau, which is less than one-tenth of the size of Las Vegas but has a similar population of 600,000 people, still struggles to convince tourists to stay long.Just under half of the 33m tourists who visited Macau last year were day-trippers and the average stay is just 1.2 nights, compared with four nights in Singapore, which has much more to offer beyond its two casino resorts.MGM Resorts’ chief Mr Murren says that while the pace of development in Macau has been “remarkable” — with gaming revenue five times higher than on the Las Vegas Strip — the city still has “a ways to go” if it is to become a broad-based tourism and hospitality destination.“I don’t know that Macau will have the same mix as Vegas any time soon but it can certainly be far greater than the overall mix of revenue that it has today,” he says.Additional reporting by Nicolle Liu

In a statement, the board said the goal of the “expanded and comprehensive review” was to “ensur[e] the company employs best practices to maintain a safe and respectful workplace for all employees.” The casino company has been under pressure following a report by the Wall Street Journal that Mr Wynn had engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct toward staff at his resorts. In one case he was alleged to have paid a $7.5m settlement to a manicurist at the Wynn Las Vegas who alleged that he forced her to have sex with him. Mr Wynn has denied the allegations. Mr Wynn resigned as chairman and chief executive last week, and has also stepped down from his role as finance chair of the Republican National Committee. The board cited his departure from the company when it announced the termination of the O’Melveny & Myers investigation, saying it “no longer requires the services” of the firm. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts, where Mr Wynn is building a casino, are investigating his conduct, while the government in Macau, which he helped turn into a gambling boomtown, has said it is “concerned” by the allegations against him. The Wynn Resorts board has been criticized by proxy advisory firms including Institutional Shareholder Services for poor corporate governance practices. On Monday, it also announced that it would add additional directors “to strengthen the composition, skills and experience of the board.”

The company said on Wednesday Matthew Maddox had replaced Mr Wynn as chief executive of Wynn Resorts and the Macau unit.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Mr Wynn had engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct.

25;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-02-07T18:50:18Z;Steve Wynn resigns as head of Wynn Resorts;Casino mogul cites ‘avalanche of negative publicity’ in wake of sexual misconduct claims;Steve Wynn, the casino tycoon who helped transform Las Vegas and Macau into booming gambling centres, has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him.Mr Wynn’s decision to step down is a blow to his eponymous company and raises questions about its future direction, while underlining how tarnished his legacy has become. “In the last couple of weeks, I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity,” the 76-year-old said in a statement late on Tuesday.“As I have reflected upon the environment this has created — one in which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts — I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current role.”Hong Kong-listed Wynn Macau said in an exchange announcement that it has appointed Allan Zeman as non-executive chairman, effective immediately. Mr Zeman previously served as an independent director at the group. He is best known for developing Hong Kong’s Lan Kwai Fong bar area, and previously served as chairman of Hong Kong’s Ocean Park amusement park.Steve Wynn is the company and without him it will slowly evolve into a different entityOn Wednesday, a Massachusetts pension fund that holds shares in Wynn Resorts filed a lawsuit against the company’s board and Mr Wynn for breaching their fiduciary duties. The complaint filed on behalf of the Norfolk County Retirement System seeks unspecified financial damages and accuses the board of “knowingly turned a blind eye to allegations of patently egregious misconduct by Mr Wynn involving the company”, CNBC reported.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Mr Wynn had engaged in a pattern of sexual misconduct. In one case he was alleged to have paid a $7.5m settlement to a manicurist at the Wynn Las Vegas who alleged that he had forced her to have sex with him. Mr Wynn has denied the allegations. “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” he said in a statement in response to the report. A combative billionaire who liked to be at the front line of his businesses, Mr Wynn gave up a place at Yale Law School in the 1960s to take over his family’s bingo halls before moving to Las Vegas to invest in his first casino. He was instrumental in transforming the Nevada city into a mass tourism destination by building large, luxury casino resorts, starting with The Mirage in 1989 and followed by Treasure Island and the Bellagio. Mr Wynn later invested in Macau, the only part of China where casinos are legal, where he and fellow US casino mogul Sheldon Adelson helped expand the former Portuguese colony into a boomtown with gross gaming revenue of $33bn last year — five times that of the Las Vegas Strip. Gaming regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts, where Mr Wynn is building a casino, have opened investigations into his conduct, while the Macau government has said it is “concerned” by the allegations against him. An on-and-off friend and rival of US President Donald Trump, Mr Wynn quit as finance chair of the Republican National Committee following the WSJ report. Analysts said his resignation from Wynn Resorts would be damaging to the company he built in his own image. Join the the author of the Everyday Sexism project in a live discussion with the FT’s Isabel Berwick on February 28 in London“Steve Wynn is the company and without him it will slowly evolve into a different entity,” said Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong. “While there is likely to be some attempt to downplay Mr Wynn’s day-to-day involvement in the company’s operations, the fact is that he is more involved in the day-to-day than most other CEOs.” Mr Umansky said the company might suffer some market share losses, particularly in the US, with the brand tainted by the sexual harassment allegations. But the bigger challenge is to the company’s operations and future plans, given uncertainty over how the new management team will fare and what will happen to the 21 per cent stake in Wynn Resorts owned by Mr Wynn and his ex-wife. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said Mr Wynn’s resignation was the “first step” toward mitigating concerns that the company’s gaming licences might be jeopardised by the allegations against him. But they added that “many uncertainties remain” about Wynn Resorts’ future ownership structure.Wynn Resorts said in its 2016 annual report that its competitiveness was dependent “to a large degree on the efforts, skills and reputation” of Mr Wynn, and that were he to depart it “could significantly harm our business”. Wynn Resorts has named Matt Maddox, the company’s president, as chief executive, and Boone Wayson as non-executive chairman. Both appointments are effective immediately. Mr Maddox has worked for Mr Wynn for most of his career, while Mr Wayson’s relationship with the casino magnate dates back to the 1980s when he ran a subsidiary of Mr Wynn’s Mirage Resorts. Additional reporting by Shannon Bond in New York and Hudson Lockett in Hong KongAllan Zeman, the entertainment mogul who helped develop Hong Kong’s famed Lan Kwai Fong nightlife district, has replaced Steve Wynn as chairman of Wynn Macau.Wynn Resorts’ Hong Kong-listed, Macau-focused subsidiary is a crucial part of the overall business, generating 71 per cent of adjusted earnings at the parent group last year.A naturalised Chinese citizen who is close to Mr Wynn, Mr Zeman was previously vice-chairman of Wynn Macau and has been a director of the company since its inception.Mr Zeman, who is based in Hong Kong, told the Financial Times that the management reshuffle “doesn’t change much” because he has been on the ground for many years, while Mr Wynn was based in Las Vegas.“We’ve got a very strong team in Macau and the numbers have been very good,” he said.Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong, said Mr Zeman’s appointment was “positive” for the company, describing him as “well-connected both commercially and politically”.Mr Zeman said that he had spoken to Mr Wynn on Wednesday and knew how difficult it was for him resign. “It’s quite emotional,” he said. “It’s your life work and you’re stepping away from it.”He takes the helm alongside Matt Maddox, who has been appointed chief executive of Wynn Macau and Wynn Resorts, at a sensitive time in Macau.Wynn and the other five casino operators in the former Portuguese territory will have to submit fresh bids for the licences between 2020 and 2022 but the Macau government has said little about the process.Mr Zeman said that Wynn was keen to know more about the criteria for re-bidding and added that it was in a similar position to the other operators, despite the storm surrounding Mr Wynn.“In general, Wynn has been an integral part of the growth of Macau, we employ a lot of people in Macau and provide a great service,” he said.

Mr Wynn has denied the allegations. “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” he said in a statement in response to the report.Mr Wynn, along with Sands Corporation founder Sheldon Adelson, was instrumental in transforming Macau, the only part of China where casinos are legal, from an area associated with prostitution, triads and money laundering into a glitzy gaming centre featuring luxury hotels offering world-class entertainment and restaurants.The Chinese territory generated 71 per cent of the adjusted earnings at parent company Wynn Resorts last year.But late last month, doubts were raised over Mr Wynn’s ability to keep doing business in Macau when the local gambling regulators said they had concerns over the claims made against him in the US.Best known locally for turning the Lan Kwai Fong street of Hong Kong’s central island into a raucous nightlife district in the 1980s, Wynn Macau’s new non-executive chairman Mr Zeman was previously an independent non-executive director of Wynn Macau.The entertainment tycoon, who renounced his Canadian citizenship to become Chinese in 2008, is known for his emphasis on pursuing strong relationships with key people in the Beijing government.The Beijing administration keeps a close eye on Macau, wanting to support its gaming-led economy but wary that its freely traded currency has made the casinos’ VIP rooms a magnet for wealthy mainland Chinese who want to illicitly move money abroad under the cover of high-stakes gambling.Wynn Macau said on Wednesday that:Mr. Stephen A.

He went on to call Mr Wynn “a philanthropist and a beloved leader and visionary”.The board has appointed the company’s president Matt Maddox as chief executive and Mr Wayson as non-executive chairman of the board of directors in place of Mr Wynn.Shares in Wynn Macau, the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary that operates the company’s Macau casinos, were frozen ahead of market open on Wednesday. Nasdaq-listed shares in Wynn Resorts have fallen 18.6 per cent since the Journal’s report was published."
28;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-01-30T06:57:47Z;Fallout from Wynn harassment claims reaches Macau;Wynn Macau shares hit by fears of impact on unit that produces bulk of group profit;The fallout from the sexual harassment allegations against casino tycoon Steve Wynn has spread to Macau, a crucial cash cow for his eponymous company, after the local gambling regulator said it was “concerned” about the claims made against him in the US.Macau, the only part of China where casinos are legal, has been booming. Last year the enclave generated 71 per cent of the adjusted earnings at parent company Wynn Resorts, where Mr Wynn is chairman and chief executive as well as owning nearly 12 per cent of the shares.Wynn must re-bid for its Macau casino licence in 2022, and worries about the impact of the allegations that Mr Wynn sexually harassed women who worked at his casinos have unnerved investors.Shares in Wynn Macau, the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary that operates the company’s Macau casinos, dropped 6.5 per cent on Monday and fell as much as 7.8 per cent on Tuesday after Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau (DICJ) said it has met Wynn Macau’s management to discuss the allegations.The DICJ said it was “concerned” about the claims of harassment, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal and which Mr Wynn has denied.“The DICJ reiterated that the government of the special administrative region [of Macau] is concerned about the suitability of the gaming concessionaires’ major shareholders, directors and the principal employees,” it said in a statement.Wynn Macau said in a statement that it was “aware of certain media comments regarding the Gaming Inspection and co-ordination Bureau of Macau and will co-operate fully with any requests”.Ben Lee, who runs a gaming consultancy in Macau called IGamiX, said the DICJ’s intervention was worrying for investors because the regulator is “normally very reticent” about commenting publicly on allegations about concession holders.The timing is particularly sensitive, he added, because Wynn will have to re-bid for its government casino licence in 2022, alongside the other five casino concessionaires.“When you’re coming up to such an important issue, you have to make sure your ducks are lined up and you’re beyond reproach,” said Mr Lee.Wynn Resorts has formed a special committee of independent directors to investigate the allegations against its chairman. Mr Wynn resigned as finance chair of the Republican National Committee over the weekend. He said in a statement that “the idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous”.Gaming regulators in the US state of Massachusetts, where Wynn Resorts is building a casino near Boston, said they will review the company’s licence.Analysts expect the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which oversees Wynn’s Las Vegas business, to follow suit.They add that if he were forced to step down it would be a big blow to the business that bears his name.“While there is likely to be some attempt to downplay Mr Wynn’s day-to-day involvement in the company’s operations, the fact is that he is more involved in the day-to-day than most other CEOs,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a research note. “His leadership in managing the personalities at the company would be extraordinarily difficult to replace if he were to step down.”In a section on risk factors in its 2016 annual report, Wynn Resorts said its competitiveness was dependent “to a large degree on the efforts, skills and reputation” of Mr Wynn and that his loss “could significantly harm our business”.Additional reporting by Nicolle Liu
29;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-01-29T20:06:42Z;Wynn sell-off continues, leads decline on S&P 500;;Wynn Resorts shares fell sharply for a second straight day and led the decline on the S&P 500 after allegations of sexual harassment against chief executive Steve Wynn surfaced on Friday.Wynn shares were down 9 per cent to $164.70 after ending Friday 10 per cent lower. Including Monday’s decline, Wynn shares are now down more than 2 per cent year-to-date. However they remain up nearly 60 per cent over the past 12 months.The casino operator has said it is investigating claims that Mr Wynn engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment towards staff. Mr Wynn said the idea that “I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous”. He has also stepped down as the finance chair of the Republican National Committee.UBS analysts on Monday downgraded Wynn to “neutral” from “buy” but raised the price target on the stock. They noted that the allegations against Mr Wynn “and subsequent investigations will probably cap near-term upside in the stock, in our view, so the stock’s outperformance combined with increased uncertainty in the outlook has prompted our downgrade”.The decline also comes as Bloomberg reports that the government of Macau could also be looking into the harassment claims.Macau had endured a more than 2-year slump in gaming revenues that began in mid-2014 amid Beijing’s anti-graft campaign and some weakness in the Chinese economy. But gambling in the region has bounced back and analysts have taken a rosy view on Macau once more. Indeed, Wynn Resorts earlier this month reported a 41 per cent jump in fourth quarter revenues to $6.3bn driven largely by its Macau operations, including Wynn Palace, which launched in August 2016.

The company last year reached a deal with the activists to allow them to approve an independent director to the board, preventing a proxy fight. A spokesperson for Avon said the management team is “committed to delivering value for all shareholders, and will continue to take actions to improve performance”.The rise in Avon shares came on a weaker day for Wall Street, as the sell-off in US Treasuries continued with the yield on the US 10-year breaching 2.7 per cent for the first time since 2014. By lunchtime in New York, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent to 2,858.98, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 26,505.08. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 7,475.08.Meanwhile, shares in Wynn Resorts fell for a second day, after allegations reported on Friday that chief executive Steve Wynn had sexually harassed women over decades. The casino operator said it was investigating claims that Mr Wynn engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment towards staff. Mr Wynn said the idea that “I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous”.Shares in Wynn, which posted upbeat results last week thanks to strong revenue at its operations in Macau, fell 7.6 per cent to $166.60. Meanwhile, shares in rival Las Vegas Sands were up more than 4 per cent to $78.57.UBS analysts downgraded Wynn to “neutral” from “buy” on Monday, but raised the price target on the stock, noting that the allegations against Mr Wynn “and subsequent investigations will probably cap near-term upside in the stock, in our view, so the stock’s outperformance combined with increased uncertainty in the outlook has prompted our downgrade”.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was up 0.7 per cent as financials rose 1.1 per cent, bolstered by a rally for state-owned Chinese banks. ICBC was up 3.7 per cent while China construction bank gained 2.7 per cent. State-run Chinese oil groups were also climbing, pushing up the energy segment 2.5 per cent. Wynn Macau shares dropped as much as 6.3 per cent in Hong Kong on Monday following a more than 10 per cent slide for Wynn Resorts on Friday after the Wall Street Journal reported allegations that founder and chief exeuctive Steven Wynn had sexually harassed women who worked at its casinos. In Sydney financials were up as well, climbing 0.6 per cent and boosting the benchmark S& P/ASX 200 index 0.5 per cent higher.

33;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2018-01-28T18:04:05Z;Steve Wynn political donations under fire after harassment claims;Casino magnate quits as RNC finance chair as group investigates sexual abuse reports;Republican politicians should return donations from Steve Wynn, the casino magnate, after allegations that he sexually harassed women over decades, two GOP senators said on Sunday.Mr Wynn resigned as Republican National Committee finance chair over the weekend, and his company, Wynn Resorts, which operates casinos from Las Vegas to Macau, said it was investigating claims he engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment towards staff.Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham urged fellow Republicans to return any contributions from Mr Wynn, who assumed the RNC role after the election of Donald Trump.“I don’t even think it’s a close call to return the money. I’m very pleased that he immediately stepped down from the RNC position,” Ms Collins told CNN. “The allegations against him are very serious, because they do involve harassment at the workplace and inappropriate behaviour and sexual abuse.”Wynn Resorts shares fell sharply on Friday after the allegations that its billionaire founder and chief executive sexually harassed women who worked at his casinos, prompting the company to launch an investigation.The board of directors said it had formed a committee led by Patricia Mulroy, a member of the board’s corporate governance and compliance committees and a former member of the Nevada Gaming Commission, the state casino regulator.Mr Wynn — who has a nearly 12 per cent stake in his namesake company, which has a market capitalisation of $18bn — said in a statement: “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.”The allegations against Mr Wynn were reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing the accounts of dozens of people who worked at Mr Wynn’s properties.In one case, the WSJ reported, Mr Wynn paid a $7.5m settlement to a manicurist at the Wynn Las Vegas who alleged he forced her to have sex with him. Other employees also alleged that he pressured them to perform sex acts.The shares were off more than 10 per cent in Friday’s trading. The drop was the biggest one-day fall in Wynn shares since December 2016.Mr Wynn, 76, is among the most prominent figures in business to be swept up in a widespread cultural reckoning over sexual abuse and harassment. Wynn Resorts operates casinos in Macau and Las Vegas, where Mr Wynn helped reshape the Strip around luxurious resorts.He has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Mr Trump, a one-time rival in the casino business. Mr Wynn declined to support Mr Trump’s campaign in 2016, but acknowledged giving the Republican presidential contender advice as a “friend”.Wynn Resorts said it “is committed to operating with the highest ethical standards and maintaining a safe and respectful culture”. The company said it required all employees to receive annual anti-harassment training and offered a hotline where employees could anonymously report misconduct.“Since the inception of the company, not one complaint was made to that hotline regarding Mr Wynn,” Wynn Resorts said.Gaming regulators in Massachusetts, where Wynn Resorts is building a casino near Boston, said it would review the company’s licence. According to Wynn Resorts, the $2.4bn Boston Harbor project is “the largest private-sector single-phase construction project in the history of the state of Massachusetts”.“The commission is now aware of, and is taking very seriously, the troubling allegations detailed in the Wall Street Journal article,” said Elaine Driscoll, spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.“The suitability and integrity of our gaming licensees is of the utmost importance, and ensuring that suitability is an active and ongoing process. Consequently, the MGC’s Investigations and Enforcement Bureau will conduct a regulatory review of this matter to determine the appropriate next steps.”The Nevada Gaming Control Board, which regulates casinos in the state, told Bloomberg: “We’re aware of the situation and reviewing the information.”Mr Wynn and his company both said the allegations stemmed from a legal battle with his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, over her stake in the company. Ms Wynn’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.The claims are the latest in a wave of sexual misconduct allegations, touched off by the accusations of dozens of women against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein— which have since spread to powerful men in politics, entertainment and corporate America.

The drop, if sustained, would be the biggest one-day fall in Wynn shares since December 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.The lurch lower follows a report from the Wall Street Journal that details allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr Wynn. Mr Wynn – who has a nearly 12 per cent stake in his namesake company – told the Journal that the claims were “preposterous.”The claims are the latest in a wave of sexual-misconduct allegations touched off by detailed accusations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, and which has since spread to ensnare powerful men in a range of industry including politics, entertainment and corporate America.
35;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

They also topped the average of analysts’ forecast, which was 46 cents.The company was boosted in particular by a surge in revenues in North America, its largest market. They were up 89 per cent at $3.4bn, while total group revenues worldwide were up 48 per cent at $5.94bn, ahead of expectations.Like several other companies in oil and other industries, however, Halliburton was hit by a non-cash charge from writing down the value of its tax losses following the steep cut in US corporate tax rates passed at the end of last year. The company took an $882m charge for that writedown, while warning that it was still working through its analysis of how the upheaval in the tax system would affect earnings, and “this provisional amount is subject to change”.It also took a $385m charge for writedowns in the value of its business in crisis-hit Venezuela. Including those charges, Halliburton reported a loss per share of 92 cents.Jeff Miller, chief executive, said 2017 had been “a dynamic year for the oil and gas sector that marked another step on the road to recovery for our industry”, and described Halliburton as “well positioned to take advantage of opportunities presented by a growing North America market and improving international outlook”.He said he was “optimistic about what I see in 2018”, with oil and gas prices supporting increasing activity in North America, and encouraging increases in tender activity and “positive discussions” with international customers. His comments follow similarly upbeat statements from competitor Schlumberger last Friday.The advance in Halliburton shares came alongside a broader rise on Wall Street where investors appeared largely unfazed by the US government shutdown. By midday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 2,820.23, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 26,103.42, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent to 7,381.59.Meanwhile, Wynn Resorts was the second-biggest gainer on the S&P 500, with shares rising nearly 5 per cent to $188.28 after it posted upbeat fourth-quarter results.Profits jumped to $491.6m, or $4.77 a share, in the three months ended in December, from $113.8m, or $1.12 a share. That reflected a net tax benefit of $339.9m after the company revalued its US deferred tax assets and liabilities. Adjusting for one-off items, the company reported earnings of $1.40 a share, eclipsing analysts’ forecasts by 3 cents.Net revenues climbed 29 per cent from a year ago to $1.69bn, ahead of expectations, as casino revenues in Macau rose 25.3 per cent from a year ago.Wynn’s results also helped lift rival casino operators, with shares in Las Vegas Sands up more than 2 per cent to $76.23, MGM Resorts shares climbing 1 per cent to $36.75 and US depositary receipts in Melco Resorts increasing 1 per cent to $29.51.
37;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2017-12-21T15:46:17Z;Contrary in the coal mine;Problem is that some things are cheap for a reason;Dualities define us. Liberals or conservatives. Cat or dog lovers. Bull market enthusiasts or contrarians, whose contempt for glib nostrums would extend to ones about dualities. They aim to sell what has made lots of money, then buy what hasn’t — the corporate disasters and almost terminally unloved. For instance, in the US this might suggest betting against Boeing and Wynn Resorts, as shares in the aerospace group and casino operator have almost doubled so far this year. At the other end, the sportswear maker Under Armour and Envision Healthcare are among the stocks to have halved in value. The danger is that some things are cheap for a reason. The member of the Euro Stoxx 600 index to inflict most pain on owners this year is Steinhoff International, the scandal-hit South African conglomerate. Its equity has lost more than nine-tenths of its value, and bondholders debate the recovery value of its debt. Buying veers into heroic double or quits territory. The way to dabble with softer contrariness is to stay close to the herd, considering very big companies unlikely to be trampled. Strategists at Citigroup, for instance, have totted up the results using the 250 largest members of the MSCI World. They calculate what happens when selling the 10 best performers of the previous year, and buying the 10 worst. Once in a while the contrarian strategy is spectacularly right, as it was in 2016. Backing a rebound in commodity producers and emerging markets produced gains of 31 per cent, nearly four times the MSCI rise. This has not been a year of reversals. Teva Pharmaceutical shares halved in 2016 then halved again in 2017. UK telecom operator BT followed a 22 per cent decline with a 24 per cent fall. Technology stocks surged ever upwards, investor enthusiasm undimmed. Contrarians today must fear the worst. They avoid Chinese and tech stocks above all, while embracing dull polluters that generate energy. It’s a view that seems likely to be wrong for some time yet. The irony is that to profit, lonely contrarians must draw the crowd their way.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

Net income climbed to $74.9m, or 73 cents a share, in the three months ended in June, compared with $70.4m, or 69 cents a share, in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, net revenue jumped nearly 45 per cent from a year ago to $1.53bn, topping analysts’ expectations of $1.45bn. Revenues in Wynn Macau, its largest division, rose 6.8 per cent year-on-year to $682.7m.The pace of gross gaming revenue growth in Macau heated up throughout the second quarter — rising nearly 22 per cent on average — according to Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau. After shrinking for three years amid a crackdown in corruption in China, the gambling hub’s revenues continue to recover. However, the near-26 per cent growth clocked in June missed analysts’ expectations.Shares in Wynn have surged more than 60 per cent so far this year.

While the pace of revenue growth quickened from May, June’s figures were shy of the 30 per cent median estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg.That weighed on shares of US casino companies with operations in Macau:
41;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2017-05-21T21:11:58Z;Macau casinos cash in again as China’s luxury sector rebounds;Despite recovery, gambling executives are wary of further crackdown from Beijing;Casino executives in Macau are confident that the slowdown of recent years is behind them amid a broad recovery in luxury goods demand in China.The only part of China where casinos are legal, Macau was hit hard by President Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown and austerity drive, which scared away many of the high-rollers who had helped revenues surge in previous years.Macau is the world’s largest gambling centre but revenues have declined sharply since 2014 — when China’s corruption crackdown first began to hit the enclave. The six casino operators in Macau have seen their combined market capitalisation fall 46 per cent since early 2014, wiping out $97.7bn of shareholder value.Gross gaming revenue — a key industry measure — started to grow again on an annualised basis in August after more than two years, amid reduced fears about the anti-graft campaign and the opening of a number of multibillion-dollar casino resorts.“The numbers are up, the scaffolding is down, the energy is up and we’re on the road to good times,” says Geoff Freeman, chief executive of the American Gaming Association, the lobby group for US casino groups including Macau operators Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts.Fitch, the credit rating agency, expects gross gaming revenue to grow by 12 per cent this year to $31bn, after peaking at $45bn in 2013 and falling to $28bn last year.Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein, the equity research house, says that Macau’s performance has tracked the wider luxury sector in China, which is recovering amid a perception that the toughest days of Mr Xi’s anti-graft campaign are in the past.“The anti-corruption campaign has seen a moderation in the last few months and there’s also an element of fatigue,” he says. “High net-worth individuals are sitting back and thinking that ‘If I haven’t been affected by now, then I’m probably OK’.”A surge in real estate prices and an increase in the money supply in China have also left wealthy individuals and the middlemen who provide them with credit in Macau — known as junkets — with more access to the funds they need for gambling.But executives are concerned that if the VIP sector rebounds too strongly, the Chinese government will put pressure on the Macau authorities to tighten regulation further.“The central government has made it clear to us that they don’t want to see gaming revenue shooting up,” says Francis Lui, deputy chairman of Galaxy Entertainment, another of the six casino operators in Macau. “They want diversification.”Over the last couple of years, the government of Macau, which is a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, has clamped down on the junkets and instituted a number of measures designed to discourage people using the city as a conduit to get their money out of China.Earlier this month, the Macau government proposed further restricting the use of ATM cards by Chinese consumers, in order to curb capital outflows from the mainland and reduce the risks of money laundering.Macau — and the casino operators — have been under pressure from Beijing to show that they are transforming the city into a broader-based tourist destination such as Las Vegas, rather than just a den for high stakes gamblers.This plan has been helped by the opening of a slew of large resorts over the last couple of years, including the Wynn Palace, Galaxy’s Phase Two and Melco International’s Studio City.Improvements to Macau’s poor infrastructure, such as a new ferry terminal and light rail system, will also help attract more mass market gamblers and their families when they are completed over the next year, analysts say.Macau attracted more than 30m tourists last year, most of them from mainland China and Hong Kong. The number of visitors increased by a little more than 5 per cent year on year in the first quarter this year.Paulo Martins Chan, director of the Gaming Inspection and Co-Ordination Bureau, Macau’s gambling regulator, says that the industry is “in a good balance today,” with nearly half of the casino revenues coming from mass market players rather than VIPs backed by the junkets.He says that his agency was continuing an audit of all the junket operators designed to weed out those with questionable records, leaving those that are “financially healthy and capable”.Charlie Choi, chairman of the Macau Gaming Information Association, a lobby group for junkets, says that the industry had “learnt lessons over the past two years” when several junket groups collapsed amid the slowdown because of unsustainable bad debts.“The survivors have improved their credit management and are being much more careful,” he says.
42;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2017-01-27T03:45:41Z;Wynn Macau shares pop nearly 5% on revenue jackpot;;Shares in Wynn Macau rose as much as 4.8 per cent in Hong Kong after the casino operator reported better than expected results for the fourth quarter.Net revenue for the three months ended December totalled $917m, rising 65 per cent from the previous year, according to unaudited results released by the company on Friday. That bested a median estimate of HK$6.9bn ($893m) from analysts.That boost was due in large part to revenues from the new Wynn Palace casino, which launched in August and brought in $418.7m in the fourth quarter, though this was partly offset by a $57.2m fall in revenues from the eponymous Wynn Macau casino, which brought $498.4m.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation also outperformed, coming to $226m for the period compared to analyst expectations of HK$1.7bn ($216m).Results at the unit in Macau, the only part of China where casinos are legal, helped bolster revenues at the Wynn Resorts, which rose to $1.3bn, besting estimates of $1.27bn and bringing the full year net revenues to $4.5bn for the Las Vegas-based company.Shares in Wynn Macau were up 2.9 per cent at HK$14.30 in late morning trade in Hong Kong.
43;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-12-09T09:26:28Z;Macau denies report of lower limit on ATM withdrawals;Casino shares jolted by fears of new front in China’s battle to stem capital flight;Macau denied a report that daily money withdrawal limits from ATMs in the gambling haven would be halved, after a sell-off in casino stocks that highlighted investor jitters over China’s efforts to staunch capital flight.The Macau monetary authority said in a statement on Friday that it had halved the amount that could be withdrawn from an ATM per transaction to 5,000 patacas ($626), but that the daily withdrawal limit of Rmb10,000 ($1,449) remained unchanged.Macau-exposed gaming stocks listed in the US, Hong Kong and Australia fell heavily after Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reported that the daily limit for ATM withdrawals by mainland bank card customers of China UnionPay in the former Portuguese colony — the only place in China where casinos are legal — would be lowered to 5,000 patacas from 10,000 patacas as of Saturday.China has moved in recent weeks to staunch capital gushing from the mainland, including tightening scrutiny of cross-border investment by Chinese companies and banning the purchase of certain insurance products. In some cases, repatriation of profits by foreign companies has been affected.The moves have shaken foreign investors and international markets. China’s foreign exchange regulator waded in on Friday to try and calm the waters: “At the moment, we haven’t seen any increase in corporate and individual purchases. Cross-border capital flows are generally relatively stable, and have maintained the basis for stable operation,” it said in a statement to China’s official Xinhua news agency.China UnionPay said in a separate statement on Friday that its policies on overseas cash withdrawal by cards issued from mainland China “remain the same” and that the daily maximum was still “capped at 10,000 renminbi equivalent per card per day”. It added that it “will continue to provide safe cross-border payment services while complying with the regulations and laws issued by relevant authorities”.Following the statements from UnionPay and the Macau authorities, casino shares in Hong Kong closed down between 4 and 8 per cent while Australia’s Crown finished down 5.3 per cent.US-listed casino stocks including Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and Melco Crown Entertainment fell by more than 10 per cent after the report first emerged — losses initially matched in Asia by Hong Kong-listed Galaxy Entertainment, Sands China and MGM China. Crown Resorts lost as much as 8 per cent in Sydney.In Macau on Friday there were no signs of disruption at any ATM machines, and mainland Chinese still thronged the casinos. In a sign of their importance, Lawrence Ho, son of gambling magnate Stanley Ho, told reporters that “if the news were true, it would be a blow to the industry in Macau.”Restrictions on the amount of money that can be moved through Macau began with an anti-corruption campaign launched by Chinese president Xi Jinping, as the city was a popular means of laundering ill-gotten money.This week, data showed China’s foreign exchange reserves fell nearly $70bn in November as the country’s central bank defended the renminbi from steeper depreciation on the back of accelerating capital outflows.Additional reporting by Gabriel Wildau in Shanghai and Gloria Cheung in MacauTwitter: @HornbyLucy
44;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-11-21T18:18:04Z;Investors bet on Macau casino operators after CS upgrade;;Investors are betting on a Macau VIP comeback.Casino operators with large Macau presence saw their shares rallied on Monday after Credit Suisse issued an upgrade on a handful of companies, citing healthier junket trends and the opening of new VIP rooms as a fresh sign of recovery.Shares in Wynn Resorts climbed six per cent to $97.97 after the Swiss bank raised its rating on its Macau unit, Wynn Macau, to “neutral” from “underperform”.Meanwhile, shares in Las Vegas Sands rose 6.2 per cent to $98.05 and shares in MGM Resorts gained 2.4 per cent to $29.12 as their subsidiaries Sands China and MGM China were upgraded to “outperform from “neutral”. Melco Crown Entertainment shares climbed 3.3 per cent to $19.40, on a ratings boost as well.Analysts at Credit Suisse said consolidation among so-called junket operators is nearly done. Junket operators are middlemen who have fuelled growth in Macau’s gambling market by bringing wealthy Chinese to the region and providing them with credit lines needed to sidestep currency controls in the mainland.“As the volume is now concentrated among the top junkets, which have a much stronger balance sheet (to grow business), better internal control system (to comply with the new junket regulation) and agents network (to source players and managing fund flow), we believe this provides a solid foundation for healthy growth in 2017,” Kenneth Fong, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said.He added that some new junket operators are also opening new VIP rooms, which is another sign of recovery.Indeed, gaming revenues have increased for the past three months, after a crackdown on corruption in China and a drop in prices of natural resources weighed on the VIP segment and kicked off a downturn in mid-2014.“As the anti-corruption campaign normalises, we believe VIP revenue will gradually reflect the true underlying demand,” Mr Fong said. He thinks Macau is at the start of a recovery cycle that could last as long as two years.Unlike the US, Macau’s gambling market tends to be dominated by high-rollers dubbed the VIP market. These so-called “casino whales” spend significantly more than the mass market – which tends to be less profitable because these people spend less per person and largely tend to visit around the holidays.
45;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-11-02T20:44:45Z;Wynn sales dragged by disappointing quarter in Macau;;Casino operator Wynn Resorts saw its shares fall on Wednesday after it posted disappointing third quarter sales due to declining revenue in its biggest market, Macau, despite the recent opening of a major new resort.Wynn said that revenues were $1.11bn in the third quarter, an 11.4 per cent increase from the same period a year ago but just shy of the $1.12bn that analysts had expected. It posted net losses of $17.4m, or 17 cents per diluted share, compared with a profit of $96.2m or 95 cents a share in the year ago period.Excluding special items, adjusted earnings of 75 cents per diluted share, topped analysts’ estimate for 72 cents per share.The company said that its revenue was boosted in part by Wynn Palace, which opened in August, as well as its Las Vegas operations, where quarterly revenues increased 3.9 per cent year-on-year to $427.1m. However, those gains were partially offset by an 11.5 per cent year-on-year decrease at Wynn Macau, as casino revenues declined nearly 11 per cent there to $518.1m.Wynn shares, which have risen 34 per cent from a year earlier, skidded 4.7 per cent lower in after-hours trading.
46;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-09-01T21:32:38Z;US casino shares rally on Macau lift;An improvement in gaming revenues send shares of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands higher;Shares of US casino companies with operations in Macau rallied on Thursday as gaming revenues in China’s gambling peninsula rose for the first time in 27 months.Gross gaming revenue in Macau climbed 1.1 per cent in August from a year ago to 18.8bn patacas (about $2.36bn), according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau. That was the first rise in revenues since May 2014 and followed a 4.5 per cent decline the previous month.The protracted slump in Macau’s gaming revenues was driven by a Chinese crackdown on corruption and weakness in the wider economy.Shares in Wynn Resorts jumped 4.3 per cent to $93.17. Shares in Las Vegas Sands climbed 7.2 per cent to $53.81, while shares in MGM Resorts International rose 3.2 per cent to $24.65. Melco Crown Entertainment shares increased 7.4 per cent to $13.94 and the Russell 3000 casinos and gambling index rose 4.5 per cent.Not everyone thought the bounce was justified.“We remain on the sidelines of the Macau gaming names [Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and Melco Crown] as estimates and valuations adjust to a ‘new normal’ of a weak Chinese economy and a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds, contributing to more muted revenue growth in Macau,” said Cameron McKnight, an analyst at Wells Fargo.The rally in casino shares came alongside softness in the wider market. Downbeat economic data showing that the US factory sector contracted for the first time in six months, along with productivity that was worse than initially estimated, dragged stocks lower in earlier trade.At the close, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,170.9 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.1 per cent to 18,419.3. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 5,227.2.Thursday also marked the arrival of an 11th sector, as real estate became a distinct sector in the Global Industry Classification Standard. Financials, the sector from which real estate has been removed, declined 0.5 per cent, while the newly launched real estate sector, slipped 0.1 per cent.Elsewhere, shares in Salesforce fell 4.4 per cent to $75.91, after the cloud services company issued a sales outlook for the current quarter that was shy of analysts’ estimates.The California-based company forecast sales in the range of $2.11bn-$2.12bn, just shy of the $2.13bn that analysts were looking for. The news accompanied better than expected second-quarter earnings and sales.Analysts also pointed to disappointing billings in the second quarter, noting that implied billings growth of 12 per cent in the third quarter would be “the slowest growth since the recession”,according to Brian Schwartz, analyst at Oppenheimer. However, he noted that the soft results were transitory and that the company was headed towards a stronger position.Meanwhile, shares in Campbell Soup fell 6.3 per cent to $56.91 after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and a full-year earnings outlook that missed analysts’ estimates.

The period reflected new revenues linked to its $15bn takeover of Jarden, the household goods maker.Molson Coors jumped 4.5 per cent to $102.16 after analysts at Citi upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, citing expected cost savings after its completes the takeover of the portion of MillerCoors it does not own from SABMiller.“Given the reputation for strong cost-cutting cultures at the major brewers . . . most of our recent discussions with investors have surrounded Molson Coors’ $200m annualised cost synergy guidance and the degree of conservatism that might perhaps be embedded in that figure,” Citi analyst Wendy Nicholson said.Shares of hotel operator Wynn Resorts slid 6.4 per cent to $97.95 after the company was allocated fewer gaming tables at its new Wynn Palace in Macau than it had sought.Google owner Alphabet climbed 3.3 per cent to $791.34 as sales growth at its mobile advertising business accelerated.Excluding currency movements, the company would have reported a 25 per cent jump in revenues, up from 18 per cent a year earlier.“The report reaffirmed our view from last quarter that the first quarter underperformance was a temporary event and that the core business was healthy,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,173.60 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 18,432.24. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 5,162.13.
48;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-07-29T08:46:23Z;Wynn Macau dealt setback with licences;Casino operator allocated fewer new tables than sought in under-pressure industry;Macau casino operators remain under pressure from a drop-off in high rollers even as they bet that new multibillion-dollar resorts will boost their appeal to a broader range of Chinese gamblers.The Macau casino companies controlled by US gambling tycoons Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn this week reported an annualised fall in VIP betting during the second quarter of 2016, as the corruption crackdown and financial problems in China continued to deter the wealthiest gamblers.In the latest setback, shares in Wynn Macau fell more than 6 per cent on Friday after the Hong Kong-listed company revealed it had secured fewer table licences than expected for its $4.2bn resort, which opens next month in the only part of China where casinos are legal.Macau regulators have allowed the company only 100 tables at the Wynn Palace casino, far short of the 200-250 analysts were hoping for.The company said it would move 250 of its table games from its existing casino to the new resort, a shift that analysts warned could lead to “cannibalisation”.But Mr Wynn, chief executive and chairman of parent company Wynn Resorts, said many of the tables at the existing Wynn Macau casino had been in effect surplus to requirements, with just 60 of the 180 VIP tables there generating almost all of the earnings.“We had an enormous amount of tables that were idle, with payroll, in anticipation of the shift to the other place,” he said on a call with analysts.Mr Wynn was “positive” the new property would bring in more “premium mass” gamblers from China, a category he defined as those spending $2,000-$3,000 per bet.He said the Wynn Palace, which will comprise luxury rooms and restaurants featuring decor including 25-foot Fabergé eggs, would be “the most elegant, the most completely diversified attraction in the hospitality industry that exists anywhere in the world”.Analysts said they were hopeful the opening of the Wynn Palace and Mr Adelson’s Parisian casino resort in September would help attract more mass-market gamblers, who bet with cash rather than borrowing from shadowy middlemen known as junkets, as do many VIPs.“Over the longer term, we believe Wynn Palace may . . . enable the company to gain share in the highly profitable premium mass business and maintain a competitive edge in VIP,” said Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong.Operating profit at Wynn Macau fell 8.7 per cent to $86m in the second quarter, compared to the same period in 2015. The amount of money bet by VIPs fell 23.8 per cent to $11.8bn but casino revenue — which accounts for 95 per cent of overall revenue — increased 5 per cent to $608m as Wynn enjoyed its luckiest quarter in Macau.Overall, gross gaming revenue at Macau’s casinos, including those operated by Wynn Macau and Sands China — the Hong Kong-listed unit of Mr Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands — fell 11 per cent to $13bn in the first half of the year, from the same period in 2015.At Sands China, gross gaming revenue fell an annualised 20 per cent in the second quarter to $1.4bn, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation slipped 2 per cent to $488m.“The operating environment in Macau remained challenging during the quarter, but we do see signs of stabilisation, particularly in the mass market,” said Mr Adelson.
49;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-05-02T15:34:12Z;US stocks bounce, casino operators rally;;US stocks began the month on the front foot as they recovered from their worst weekly performance since February.The advance on the benchmark S&P 500 was led by a 0.6 per cent gain in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary and financial sectors. Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500, climbing more than 6 per cent to $93.85.Wynn resorts and other casino operators rallied as the decline in gaming revenues in Macau slowed in April. Gross gaming revenue in China’s gambling peninsula slid just 9.5 per cent year-on-year to 17.3bn patacas (about $2.2bn) in April, slower than the 16.5 per cent drop recorded in March, according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau.Shares in MGM Resorts rose 2 per cent to $21.75, shares in Las Vegas Sands rose 4.4 per cent to $47.13, while Melco Crown Entertainment shares gained 3.8 per cent to $15.35.The advance came even as manufacturing expanded at a slower-than-expected pace in April. A gauge of manufacturing slipped to 50.8 in April, from 51.8 the previous month, according to the latest figures from the Institute of Supply Management. That missed economists’ estimates for a reading of 51.4.Elsewhere, the dollar inched up 0.1 against the yen, to ¥106.55 yen. The greenback had declined to its lowest level against the Japanese currency since October 2014 on Friday, after the Bank of Japan held steady on monetary policy. Last week, the US Treasury placed Japan, China and Germany on a new currency watchlist.Wall Street’s gains followed a quiet session in Asia Europe, where markets in Shanghai, Hong Kong and the UK remained closed.
50;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-04-07T20:36:48Z;Bed Bath & Beyond given boost from upbeat sales;US stocks decline amid risk-off day in markets;Bed Bath & Beyond shares advanced on Thursday after the home goods retailer unveiled upbeat sales data and announced a quarterly dividend programme.Shares in the New Jersey-based company rose more than 4 per cent earlier in the day after it said its same-store sales had climbed 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, ahead of Wall Street estimates for a 0.8 per cent rise. Its shares retreated later in the day, closing 0.3 per cent higher at $48.97.While in-store comparable sales were “flat”, sales from “customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 25 per cent”.Profits came in at $303.5m, or $1.91 a share, compared with $321m, or $1.80, in the three-month period the year earlier. Excluding certain items, adjusted profits of $1.85 topped forecasts by four cents.Revenues climbed 2.4 per cent year-on-year to $3.4bn, matching expectations. The company also initiated a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents a share.The shares have declined more than 36 per cent since the beginning of last year as the home furnishings category continues to face competition from Amazon and other ecommerce retailers.“While the company is adapting and the pace of change may be accelerating internally, the cost of staying relevant and delivering even modest top-line growth [as guidance suggests] is just much higher than in the past,” said Seth Sigman, an analyst at Credit Suisse.“That continues to cause significant declines in profitability and cash flow.”It was a risk-off day in markets. At the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 1.2 per cent to 2,042, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1 per cent to 17,542, and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.5 per cent lower at 4,848.Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after the casino operator unveiled plans to convert its 130-acre golf course in Las Vegas into a “paradise park”.The planned lagoon is expected to be lined by a white sand beach and boardwalk and offer water sports.Wynn projected that the Wynn Palace, scheduled to open in Cotai, Macau, in June, would draw gross gambling revenues in the range of $2.4bn to $3.1bn and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $630m-$850m.Investor optimism was buoyed further after analysts at Telsey Advisory upgraded the shares from “market perform” to “outperform” and lifted their price target from $67 to $112.Wynn’s shares advanced 11.7 per cent to $99.99.“Based on the stronger than expected outlook provided by the company, we believe our alternatives for the stock are to doubt it, chase it or get ahead of it,” said David Katz, a Telsey analyst.“We choose the latter, given that historical execution supports confidence in management to achieve at least the bottom end of the guided range, which is where we have placed our estimates.”ConAgra Foods rose after the group swung to a profit in the quarter to February 28.The packaged foods group, based in Omaha, logged a net profit of $206.3m in the three-month period, from a loss of $952.7m in the same quarter in 2015.Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of 68 cents a share, topped analysts’ estimates of 55 cents. Sales of $2.92bn also beat expectations of $2.86bn.ConAgra shares climbed 1.5 per cent to $46.09, extending their 2016 gain to 9.3 per cent.

The proposed lagoon is expected to be lined by a white sand beach and boardwalk and offer water sports.The company also projected that the Wynn Palace slated to open in Cotai, Macau in June will draw gross gambling revenues in the range of $2.4bn to $3.1bn and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation in the range of $630 to $850m, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.Investor optimism was buoyed further after analysts at Telsey Advisory Group upgraded the shares to “outperform” from “market perform” and lifted their price target to $112 from $67.“Based on the stronger than expected outlook provided by the company, we believe our alternatives for the stock are to doubt it, chase it or get ahead of it,” David Katz, an analyst at Telsey Advisory said.“We choose the latter, given that historical execution supports confidence in management to achieve at least the bottom end of the guided range, which is where we have placed our estimates.”In the midst of all the optimism however, analysts at Morgan Stanley, who are “overweight” the stock, warn that this could “prolong the de-leveraging process … and could fuel incremental balance sheet concerns if market trends take another leg down”. Wynn has long-term debt of $9.2bn as of the end of fiscal 2015.
52;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-04-06T20:31:42Z;Constellation Brands gains ground on brighter earnings outlook;Energy shares advance on the back of a sharp rally in WTI oil price;Shares in Constellation Brands marched higher after the US drinks maker issued a better than expected full-year earnings outlook and said it was evaluating the merits of an initial public offering for a part of its Canadian wine business.Shares in Constellation, the owner of Modelo and Corona beers, advanced 5.9 per cent to $160.34. The New York-based company expects full-year earnings between $6.05 to $6.35 a share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $6.11.The news came alongside fourth-quarter profits that climbed to $243m, or $1.19 a share, compared with $214.6m, or $1.06 a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 14 per cent to $1.5bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.15 a share, on sales of $1.5bn.Rob Sands, chief executive of Constellation, said the company’s Canadian business “delivered excellent overall financial results, outperformed the industry and gained market share, and we believe its full value is not being recognised”. He added that an IPO could “create better visibility” and that a final decision on pursuing the plans would be made this year.The rally in Constellation’s shares accompanied a broader advance in the US stock market. At the close, the S&P 500 had advanced 1.1 per cent to 2,067, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 17,716. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 4,921.The S&P 500 telecoms sector widely underperformed the broader market, sliding 1 per cent.AT&T and Verizon Communications, the group’s two largest components, began trading “ex-dividend” on Wednesday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That means investors who buy the stock now will not receive the combined $5.3bn in quarterly dividends that each are set to pay in May.AT&T slipped 0.2 per cent to $38.64, while Verizon was unchanged at $53.52.Still, telecoms have been the top performers this year, rallying 13.8 per cent against a market that has tilted higher by just over 1 per cent. Investors have scooped up the stocks for their juicy dividend yields as US Treasury bond yields have remained under pressure from a more cautious stance on rate rises by Federal Reserve policymakers than was expected at the beginning of 2016.Energy shares advanced on the back of a sharp rally in the price of oil. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, climbed 5.2 per cent to $37.75 a barrel as American crude inventories posted their second-biggest weekly drop of the year.ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly traded energy group, rose 1.3 per cent to $83.31. ConocoPhillips, a large exploration and production company, rallied 4.4 per cent to $40.74.Elsewhere, shares in Wynn Resorts fell 1.5 per cent to $89.55 after the casino operator said a slowdown in Macau weighed on its quarterly results.Wynn said preliminary net revenues in the region were projected to be between $603m to $613m in the first quarter, down from $705m in the year-ago quarter.The decline in Macau monthly gross gaming revenues picked up steam in March, falling 16.3 per cent, following a muted 0.1 per cent decline the previous month, according to Macau’s Gaming Inspection, and Coordination Bureau.

This after clocking a 71 per cent decline in 2015, which left it as the third worst performing stock on the benchmark index.A slowdown in the Chinese economy and a protracted slump in crude prices took its toll on Freeport last year. But shares in the Arizona-based company have seen more than just a little rebound in the first three months of the year.So what has prompted investor sentiment to improve?“With a newly constructed Board (including two representatives of Carl Icahn), the departure of longtime Chairman and co-founder Jim Bob Moffett, and the consolidation of leadership under CEO Richard Adkerson, Freeport has a renewed focus on its key mining operations, de-emphasized its oil & gas division, and is moving to strengthen the company’s overleveraged balance sheet,” Matthew Korn, an analyst at Barclays, said.Freeport has also benefited from an improvement in copper prices.But it isn’t just the copper miner, Wynn Resorts and Range Resources, which were among those grabbing the stock market razzies last year, are clocking some of the biggest gains this quarter.Here’s a look at the stocks that are set to be the 10 best performers on the S&P 500 in the first quarter and how they fared last year:And here’s a look at the 10 biggest decliners:
54;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-03-22T20:28:03Z;Travel-related stocks shaken by Brussels attacks;US stocks lack direction but healthcare a standout performer;Travel-related stocks were shaken on Tuesday after a series of co-ordinated terror attacks in Brussels sparked concerns about demand ahead of the key summer season.At least 30 people were killed after two bombs went off in the city’s airport, and another one hit a metro station.The S&P 500 airlines index fell 2.5 per cent, before recovering to a decline of 1.3 per cent.Airline stocks frequently decline on the back of terrorist events amid worries that travellers will be rattled and choose to stay home instead of taking trips.American Airlines declined 1.6 per cent to $42.76, United Continental fell 1.1 per cent to $60.49 and Delta Air Lines declined 1.4 per cent to $49.41. All three large US carriers operate flights to Brussels, according to the airports’ websites.Elsewhere in the sector, Carnival, a cruise ship operator, fell 2.1 per cent to $48.75 and Priceline, a travel booking service, dropped 2.3 per cent to $1,319.41.Hotel stocks fell as well: Wyndham Worldwide declined 1.2 per cent to $76.15, while Hyatt Hotels fell 2.1 per cent to $48.80.Wynn Resorts, which runs casinos, bucked the trend after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.Wynn may go from a “double-digit ebitda decliner to double-digit grower in the next six months”, said Morgan analyst Thomas Allen, referring to a measure of profits called earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.He added that the brand might also benefit from a stabilisation in Macau, a Chinese territory known for gambling that has taken a powerful blow from the government’s corruption crackdown and a broader economic slowdown in the country.Wynn shares rose 2.4 per cent to $95, bringing their year-to-date rally to 37 per cent.Lumber Liquidators shares also climbed after the company said it reached a settlement with a California regulator relating to sales of certain laminate flooring. The review was completed with “no formal finding of violation or admission of wrongdoing”, the company said.As part of the agreement, however, it will pay the California Air Resources Board a fine of $2.5m and “implement a series of voluntary compliance procedures” to ensure its flooring products comply with the regulator’s standards.Investors appeared to be relieved with the news that the inquiry has ended. The shares jumped 16 per cent to $13.94 although they are still down 20 per cent for 2016.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,049.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average weakened 0.2 per cent to 17,582.57 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 4,821.66.The S&P 500 healthcare sector was the standout performer on Tuesday, jumping 0.9 per cent. Within the group, biotechnology stocks posted particularly large price gains. Amgen rose 2.5 per cent to $150.62, adding to a 1 per cent gain on Monday as traders moved back into the sector that was shunned in the earlier part of the year.
55;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-03-01T21:40:53Z;Casino operator boost as revenues decline is stemmed;US stocks rebound on first trading day in March;Shares of Macau casino operators received a shot in the arm on Tuesday as gaming revenues in China’s gambling peninsula recorded their smallest drop since the decline began in June 2014.Gross gaming revenue in Macau slid just 0.1 per cent year-on-year to 19.5bn patacas ($2.4bn) in February, according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau. That compares with a 21.4 per cent drop the previous month.The news pushed shares of Wynn Resorts 2.3 per cent higher to $84.35. Las Vegas Sands climbed 5 per cent to $50.67, while Melco Crown Entertainment rose 6.1 per cent to $16.75. MGM Resorts gained 5.1 per cent to $19.90.A slowdown in the Chinese economy coupled with Beijing’s crackdown on corruption has hurt revenue in Macau but the lunar new year holiday helped lift spending.After revenues fell for 21 consecutive months, the latest figures show a sharp slowing of the decline, boosting sentiment on casino stocks.In the retail sector Dollar Tree shares fell sharply in pre-market trading on Tuesday after a disappointing full-year earnings outlook and lower fourth-quarter sales than expected. But shares in the budget retailer reversed their losses and closed 2.3 per cent higher at $82.07.Dollar Tree said it expected to earn between $3.35 and $3.65 a share, below analysts’ estimates for earnings of $3.78.Fourth-quarter profits of $229m, or 97 cents a share, compared with $206m, or $1, in the period a year ago.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $1.07 a share. Adjusting for one-off items, earnings of $1.01 a share turned up shy.Net sales more than doubled to $5.37bn — the midpoint of its guidance — helped by its acquisition of Family Dollar last year, but missed expectations for $5.41bn.SunEdison shares tumbled 23.2 per cent to $1.52 after it failed to file its annual report amid an internal investigation of its financial position that began last year.The renewables company has come under pressure as so-called yieldcos — completed projects that are spun off by energy companies through vehicles that earn stable cash flows and distribute them in dividends — have taken a hit.Terraform Power, SunEdison’s yieldco, which has fallen more than 69 per cent since the start of 2015, declined 1.4 per cent on Tuesday.US-listed shares in Fiat Chrysler climbed 7.2 per cent to $7.34 after the carmaker said sales of cars and light trucks had jumped 12 per cent in February, topping expectations for a 9.2 per cent rise.Ford rallied 4.6 per cent to $13.09 after US light vehicle sales advanced 20.2 per cent, eclipsing estimates for 12.6 per cent growth.After three consecutive monthly losses, US stocks rebounded on the first trading day in March.Every big sector, bar utilities, was in the green, with economically sensitive technology, financials and consumer discretionary leading the way.By the close, the S&P 500 had rallied 2.4 per cent to 1,978.35, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1 per cent to 16,865, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.9 per cent to 4,689.6.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
56;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-02-12T22:20:37Z;Wynn Resorts jumps on Las Vegas fortune;US stocks snap a five-day losing streak;Wynn Resorts shares popped on Friday after the casino operator reported better than expected fourth-quarter profit, boosted by its Las Vegas business.Shares in Wynn jumped 15.83 per cent to close at $69.14 after the company said net income slid to $104.8m or 86 cents a share in the three months ended in December, from $148.4m or $1.07 a share in the year ago period, but topped analysts’ expectations for earnings of 60 cents a share.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.03 a share eclipsed forecasts.Meanwhile, revenues declined 17 per cent to $946.9m, shy of analysts’ estimates.The decline was driven by a 27 per cent drop in net revenues in Macau, the company’s largest source of revenue. A 3.8 per cent gain in Las Vegas revenues helped offset the decline.Beijing’s crackdown on corruption and the economic slowdown in China has hurt Macau gaming revenues — which have declined for 20 consecutive months.But investors warmed to the stock as billionaire founder Steve Wynn noted that January in Macau “was our best month in a long time”.“While still too early to call an inflection point for Macau, in our view, management expressed a more positive outlook than on their most recent . . . earnings calls,” said Felicia Hendrix, an analyst at Barclays.“VIP trends may remain muted but increased visitation, retail spend and a strong start to Chinese new year is a positive for the mass market.”Wynn shares are down about 50 per cent since the start of 2015.Groupon shares advanced 29 per cent to $2.89 after the US coupon company reported better than expected fourth-quarter results.The Chicago-based company reported earnings of 4 cents a share excluding one-time items, ahead of expectations for break-even.Meanwhile, sales climbed 4 per cent to $917.2m, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for $845.9m. Sales in North America, the company’s biggest source of revenue, climbed 13 per cent.However, the company reported a net loss of $46.5m or 8 cents a share in the three months ended in December, compared with a profit of $8.8m or 1 cent a share in the year-ago period.Analysts had forecast a loss of 5 cents a share.JPMorgan Chase was among the top performers on the S&P 500 index after chief executive Jamie Dimon bought $26m of shares in the US bank in a sign of confidence amid a painful week for financial stocks. The shares climbed 8.33 per cent to $57.49.Investors also bid up other bank stocks. Bank of America rose 7.08 per cent to $11.95 while Citigroup advanced 7.32 per cent to $37.54.American International Group, meanwhile, jumped 4.91 per cent to $53.00 after activist investors Carl Icahn and John Paulson secured representation on the US insurer’s board of directors.Mr Icahn has been calling for AIG to break up but management has resisted in what has become a public spat.US stocks snapped a five-day losing streak as strong US retail sales, a rally in the banking sector and a rebound in oil increased investor appetite for risk.By the close, the S&P 500 had advanced 1.95 per cent to 1,864.41, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 2 per cent to 15,970.75 and the Nasdaq Composite had gained 1.66 per cent to 4,336.51.
57;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-01-15T22:07:49Z;Wynn bucks the sell-off on Las Vegas win;US stocks sink following a sharp sell-off in China and more oil price falls;On a day when 96 per cent of companies on the S&P 500 were in the red, shares in Wynn Resorts were rallying after the gaming company reported preliminary fourth-quarter results that showed growth in Las Vegas and earnings in Macau that were modestly above consensus estimates.Shares in Las Vegas-based Wynn jumped more than 13 per cent to $58.36 by the close after the company said it expected revenues in a range of $387m to $395m, compared with $376.8m in the year-ago period. At the close they were flat at $51.50.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) were expected to rise to between $123m and $131m, compared with $111.2m a year ago and ahead of forecasts.The company said revenues and earnings in Macau, the Chinese casino gambling centre, are estimated to decline from last year.A slowdown in the Chinese economy coupled with the nation’s crackdown on corruption has seen Macau’s gaming revenue decline for 19 consecutive months.Wynn said adjusted ebitda in Macau is expected to be in the range of $156m to $164m, down from $241.2m in the year-ago period. However, the high end of that range was above consensus estimates for $157m.“Given the high short interest in Wynn Resorts, this pre-release should lead to a sharp short covering rally, which recently has led to swings of 10 per cent or more,” said Harry Curtis, an analyst at Nomura.However, he said that investors should wait to “understand the sustainability of the strength in December in Macau” before jumping in.Shares in Wynn Resorts slumped more than 50 per cent last year.Walt Disney shares fell 5.26 per cent to $93.90 after analysts at Barclays downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “equal weight” and reduced their price target to $89 from $98.Analysts noted that despite boosts to the stock from the latest instalment in the Star Wars film franchise, there is a risk to earnings next year as its sports channel ESPN continues to lose subscribers even as sports programming costs climb.Disney shares have been hurt as viewers increasingly choose to “cut the cord” on their cable and network television subscriptions as competition from online streaming sites such as Netflix and Amazon rises.With Brent crude, the global oil marker, and West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, both falling below the $30-a-barrel mark, energy stocks took a hit.Marathon Oil was the biggest loser, falling 10.25 per cent to $8.14, shares in Chesapeake Energy declined 4.04 per cent to $3.56 while shares in Transocean dropped 6.45 per cent to $9.86.The S&P 500 energy sector was one of the worst performing sectors alongside information technology.The decline in technology shares was led by Intel, which slid 9.10 per cent to $29.76, after the company issued disappointing sales guidance for the current quarter and amid a broader sell-off in US equities.US markets were lower on Friday following a sharp sell-off in Chinese equities and oil prices that sapped confidence.By the close, the S&P 500 had declined about 2.1 per cent to 1,880.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen around 2.3 per cent to 15,985.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 2.74 per cent to 4,488.02.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
58;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-01-07T17:59:10Z;Yahoo leads decliners exposed to China;Broad market losses led by financials, industrials, materials and technology;US companies with exposure to China took a beating on Thursday over rising economic and financial woes for the world’s second-biggest economy.Among the US stocks that declined was Yahoo, which holds a large stake in Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce heavyweight.The US media and technology company’s shares skidded 6 per cent to $30.16, extending a 12-month decline to 26.5 per cent. Alibaba’s shares dropped 5.9 per cent to $72.77.Several casino companies that have large operations in Macau fell sharply amid fears that a cooling Chinese economy and a corruption crackdown by Beijing will keep gamblers away.Wynn Resorts, which generated 58.7 per cent of its revenue from Macau in the third quarter, sold off by 9.4 per cent to $60.19. Las Vegas Sands dropped 9.1 per cent to $39.79.Also in the red on Thursday were so-called cyclical stocks, which tend to be sensitive to economic fluctuations. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of heavy machinery, dropped 3.4 per cent to $63.94, a steeper fall than US markets more broadly.Metals miners suffered as the price of copper, a key industrial commodity, slumped 1.6 per cent, touching the lowest level since 2009. Freeport-McMoRan, a large copper miner, slid 9.2 per cent to $5.61.Elsewhere KB Home shares fell 14.8 per cent to $10.05 after the homebuilder reported disappointing fourth-quarter results.The Los Angeles-based company reported profits of $44.1m, or 43 cents a share, on sales of $985.8m. This was short of Wall Street estimates for earnings of 50 cents a share, on sales of $1.1bn.KB Home delivered 2,580 homes last quarter, up 16 per cent from a year ago, but chief executive Jeff Mezger said inclement weather and labour shortages in some markets had “tempered” deliveries and “ultimately impacted our profitability for the quarter”.Homebuilders came under pressure after the disappointing results and amid a broader market sell-off. DR Horton fell 4 per cent to $28.53, Lennar slid 4 per cent to $43.43, and PulteGroup dropped 4 per cent to $16.22.Meanwhile Walgreens Boots Alliance said its net earnings in the quarter to November 30 had been 30.5 per cent higher than in the same period in 2014. Adjusted earnings per share clocked in at $1.03, handily topping Wall Street estimates of 96 cents.Shares of the pharmacy chain rallied 2 per cent to $81.17, adding to a 12-month rise of 7 per cent.Investors bid up shares of JC Penney. The department store chain said same-store sales had risen 3.9 per cent during the holiday shopping period as unseasonably warm weather weighed on other retailers, such as competitor Macy’s.JC Penney’s shares advanced 3.6 per cent to $7.26.On Thursday the S&P 500 fell 2.4 per cent to 1,943.09, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.3 per cent to 16,514.10, and the Nasdaq Composite lost own 3 per cent to 4,689.43.
59;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-01-04T22:19:54Z;Netflix falls amid US subscriber worries;Downbeat sentiment on China prompts broad sell-off in equities;Netflix was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on the first trading day of the year following an analyst downgrade and amid a broader sell-off in US equities.Shares in the online streaming site fell more than 6 per cent to $107.19 after the stock was lowered to “neutral” from “outperform” and the price target cut to $115 from $128 by analysts at Baird. They closed down 3.86 per cent at $109.96.The analysts said their quarterly US subscriber survey suggested “potentially weaker US subscriber results for the second consecutive quarter” compared with a normal quarterly increase into the holiday period.The survey showed 46 per cent of its 3,000 US respondents were Netflix streaming subscribers compared with 47 per cent the previous quarter.“This appears to point to more flattish Q4’15 US subscriber progress and, if accurate, potentially raises some questions around the US subscriber growth trajectory,” said William Power, an analyst with the firm.A $1 price increase, which took effect in October, could have had a greater impact on subscription growth than previously thought, he said.Moreover, Mr Power noted that Netflix’s international subscriber growth could beat forecasts but that the expectation was largely priced in. Netflix shares advanced more than 130 per cent last year.Shares in Tesla were also on the back foot after the electric carmaker reported fourth-quarter total vehicle deliveries at the low end of its guidance range.Its shares fell 6.92 per cent to $223.41 after the Palo Alto-based company said it delivered 17,400 cars in the last quarter, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sunday. This compared with its previous outlook for 17,000 to 19,000 deliveries.The company also said it delivered just 208 of its Model X sport utility vehicle, which launched with a two-year delay in September. Tesla noted that it was prioritising “quality above all else”.The fourth-quarter figures brought its 2015 deliveries to 50,580, the low end of its guidance. However, analysts noted that the automaker had lowered its outlook through the year.Chinese equities plunged on Monday amid concerns about the health of its economy, prompting Beijing to use its circuit breaker rule. That set the tone for global markets. .US-listed shares in Chinese companies were punished, with shares in ecommerce site Alibaba down 5.64 per cent to $76.69.Shares in Baidu, a search engine group, fell 2.65 per cent to $184.03 while shares in Cheetah Mobile fell 2.87 per cent to $15.56.The sell-off in Chinese stocks also weighed on shares of Macau casino operators, though their shares had recovered most of their losses by the close. Wynn Resorts was down 0.61 per cent at $68.77, Las Vegas Sands was down 1 per cent to $43.40, and Melco Crown Entertainment was off 0.77 per cent to $16.67.All 10 big sectors on the benchmark S&P 500 were in the red. The S&P 500 was down 1.53 per cent to 2,012.66, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.58 per cent lower at 17,148.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was off by 2.08 per cent to 4,903.09.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
60;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2016-01-03T14:54:15Z;Week ahead: Corporate review US;Amazon revenues set to be a fifth higher than last year’s record, with focus on cloud unit;By almost any measure 2015 was a bumper year for Amazon, the online retailer.The share price has more than doubled and analysts expect this year’s revenues to be a fifth higher than 2015’s record, even in the face of a strong dollar.Soaring retail sales are not the only reason for the Seattle-based group’s success. A subtle but equally important shift has been the decision to break out its cloud computing business as a separate unit in financial results.When the tight-lipped company lifted the veil on Amazon Web Services in April, analysts were surprised by its margins. It has been the group’s most profitable segment this year by operating income.Many in the finance community are salivating over the idea that AWS could become a separate listed entity, given its profits and its fast growth.But a closer look shows that its apparent profitability stems largely from its decision to lease, rather than buy, much of its equipment. Depreciation expenses are set to soar, and the paper profits will be hard to maintain.Brian Pitz of Jefferies expects Amazon’s growth to continue this year, as its retail operations benefit from sizeable investments in warehouses and logistics.“They are taking share of new categories because of their ability to service customers faster than everyone else,” he said.“They’ve created such a moat, no one will be able to catch up.” Leslie HookThere is not a whole lot of loving going on at Whole Foods. Shares of the US supermarket, much of whose goods are labelled organic, dropped by a third in the year just ended, while the S&P 500 has risen 0.7 per cent.Several factors have served to upend Whole Foods. Amid growing concerns over its prices, there has been stiffer competition, particularly given that many mainstream supermarkets such as Kroger have built a strong offering of organic produce, while Walmart has also expanded in this area.According to Neil Saunders, an analyst at the Conlumino research group, other problems include the experience of shopping at a Whole Foods, which critics say in New York is not inviting.And with its focus on the high end — the store has been dubbed “Whole Paycheck” because of its high prices — Whole Foods may be paying too much attention to impressing with new stores instead of keeping existing ones up to scratch.“A combination of falling margins and slowing sales growth presents a long-term danger to profitability,” said Mr Saunders.“The whole purpose of reducing prices should be to attract and keep more customers, with a consequent uplift to the sales line. However, at present this dynamic is not working as effectively as it should.”For 2016 investors will be closely watching to see the extent to which Whole Foods can balance margins and customer traffic.Last month’s $1bn repurchase programme has not revived demand for the shares. Lindsay WhippEvery winning streak comes to an end. This year, after betting heavily on its business in Macau, Wynn Resorts’ luck ran out abruptly.In the nine months to September 2014, the gaming company earned more than $3bn in revenues from its casinos in Macau, compared with just $1.2bn from its business in Las Vegas.But last year, after the Chinese government made it clear that it was no longer acceptable for officials and executives to gamble in Macau, takings at casinos dropped 35 per cent.Revenues at Wynn’s Macau arm declined to $1.9bn in the year to September. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were 46 per cent lower at $548m.Wynn has postponed the opening of a $4.1bn resort by three months and Steve Wynn, the casino mogul, has criticised Macau for what he calls its “preposterous” policy of limiting how many gambling tables he can have in the new joint.After the shares more than halved from $139 to $65, Mr Wynn bought a million shares. The move was meant to reassure investors after the dramatic price fall but had little effect.November was the 18th consecutive month of shrinking casino revenues in Macau, and casino operators are still doubling down: between them they have committed to almost $27bn in new developments.The plan is to make the switch, as Las Vegas has done, to a family-friendly entertainment hub. But it may be a long time before the transformation kicks in and lady luck shines on Wynn Resorts again. Malcolm MoorePerhaps more than any other company, Netflix has changed the way people watch television.The streaming service has produced its own programming and bought the rights to other producers’ shows and movies, making them available on demand for a set monthly price that is much lower than a standard subscription for cable or satellite services.Its impact, in the US in particular, has been profound. With Netflix and other companies offering on-demand viewing, many viewers are “cutting the cord”, shunning the pricey bundle of channels offered with a cable or satellite subscription in favour of cheaper online alternatives.Fear gripped the media sector this year as evidence grew that cord-cutting was hurting audience ratings and advertising revenues.Netflix was not affected: its shares rose more than 140 per cent over the year. With a market capitalisation of close to $50bn it is worth more than CBS and Viacom combined.Whether the group can sustain subscriber growth and deliver profits that justify its lofty valuation is another matter. Still, on-demand, digital-based viewing is the future of television and Netflix is well placed to benefit. Matthew GarrahanFor Chesapeake Energy last year provided a textbook case of the consequences for a highly leveraged company of steep falls in the price of its principal product.Chesapeake is the second-largest natural gas producer in the US, surpassed only by ExxonMobil, and the slump in US gas prices sent its shares down about 80 per cent.After the departure in 2013 of Aubrey McClendon, the risk-taking entrepreneur who built the company, Chesapeake seemed to be heading in the right direction.It stabilised its finances in October 2014 with a $5.4bn sale of some gasfields to Southwestern Energy at what was described as a “blowout” price.But borrowings built up during its period of rapid growth under Mr McClendon remained high, and net debt was about $10bn at the end of September.As the price of US benchmark Henry Hub gas dropped from more than $3 per million British thermal units at the end of 2014 to below $2 at the end of 2015, earnings were squeezed. Weaker prices for oil and natural gas liquid compounded the problem. Chesapeake reported an underlying net loss of $83m for the third quarter.The energy group has been cutting costs and capital spending to shore up its cash position, but Chesapeake’s future will be shaped by the prices of gas and oil.

61;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2015-10-16T10:29:21Z;Steve Wynn lashes out at ‘preposterous’ Macau regulations;US casino tycoon criticises table allocations as China graft crackdown dents revenues;US casino tycoon Steve Wynn has lashed out at Macau for its “preposterous” policy on the allocation of gambling tables, as China’s corruption crackdown and the slowing economy continue to weigh on gaming revenues in the territory.Mr Wynn was expressing his frustration with the government’s failure to indicate how many betting tables it would allow his company, Wynn Resorts, to operate when it opens its latest 1,700-room, $4.1bn casino early next year.Many of the high-rollers who fuelled the decade-long boom in Macau — the only part of China where casinos are legal — have stopped betting since President Xi Jinping started to clamp down on corruption and money laundering in 2013.Under pressure from the government, Macau’s casinos have been trying to follow the Las Vegas model and diversify into mass market gambling and tourism. But Mr Wynn said that the “rather mystical” way that the government allots table permits makes it difficult for operators to plan for this transition.“Will our property be overwhelming enough to kick that market into a different place?” he asked after the release of disappointing third-quarter results on Thursday. “It’s hard to say. I have no idea how many tables we’re going to have.”The billionaire chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts said it was “preposterous” that rival casino group Melco Crown had no idea how many tables it could operate just three weeks before its $2.5bn Studio City resort throws open its doors.“How in the world do we underwrite the job security of the local workforce in Macau, keep the promise of promotions and better opportunity under these circumstances?’ he added. “I’m at a loss to answer that question.”38%Drop in Wynn Resorts’ net revenues in Macau in the third quarter, compared with the same period a year earlierWynn Resorts’ net revenues in Macau fell 38 per cent in the third quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier, to $585m as VIP gaming turnover more than halved to $12bn.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation halved to $163m compared with the third quarter of 2014, and undershot analysts’ consensus expectations of $176m.Morgan Stanley said Wynn could cut costs by moving as many as 2,000 of its existing staff to the new resort when it opens in March, but that the total number would depend on the government’s table allocations.Galaxy Entertainment, another Macau casino operator, also reported a significant drop in business during the third quarter, blaming the graft crackdown, China’s slowing economy, smoking restrictions and concerns about the liquidity of the middlemen known as junkets who provide credit to high-rollers.The company, chaired by Chinese billionaire Lui Che Woo, said revenue fell 29 per cent year on year to HK$12.3bn ($1.6bn) while adjusted earnings contracted 36 per cent to HK$2.1bn.Mr Lui said he was “cautiously optimistic that we are starting to see the market stabilise”.The Macau casino regulator had not responded to a request for comment.
62;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2015-10-02T17:04:19Z;Slower revenue fall boosts Macau casinos;Possible government aid for the region’s economy also helps;Shares of Macau casino operators jumped on Friday as the decline in gaming revenues slowed in September and on reports that the Chinese government was considering measures to support the region’s economy.Gross gaming revenue fell 33 per cent in September from the previous year to 17.1bn patacas ($2.1bn), according to the latest figures from Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.That figure compared with a 35.5 per cent drop reported in August and was much lower than the 49 per cent drop recorded in February.Local media reports that the Chinese government would support Macau’s growth “in all aspects” also gave casino stocks a shot in the arm.The crackdown on corruption and the economic slowdown in China has weighed on casino operators in Macau, with gaming revenues declining for 16 months straight, although the rate of decline has slowed over the past seven months.Junket operators, who lend to high-stakes Chinese VIP gamblers, also took a hit last month on reports that an employee had stolen investor capital from junket operator Dore Entertainment.Kenneth Fong, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said junkets reserved more capital to brace for withdrawals following the Dore incident, which “led to a temporary slowdown in revenue in the middle of September as system liquidity tightened”. However, the junket operators have said “liquidity has since then stabilised”. They added that they are “cautiously optimistic on mass traffic” ahead of the important Golden Week holiday in China.Wynn Resorts was the biggest gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 with shares up 23 per cent to $63.47. Shares in Las Vegas Sands advanced more than 10 per cent to $40.87, shares in Melco Crown Entertainment gained 14 per cent to $15.51 and MGM Resorts International shares climbed 6 per cent to $19.79.Nordstrom announced a special cash dividend of $4.85 a share and an additional $1bn share buyback programme after the market closed on Thursday. The news pushed shares of the luxury goods retailer 5 per cent higher to $75.08.Micron Technology shares climbed 8 per cent to $15.91 after the chipmaker reported better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and said the outlook for memory chips looked favourable in the long term.Profits fell 59 per cent from a year ago to $471m or 42 cents a share, but well ahead of analysts’ expectations for earnings of 29 cents a share. Sales declined 15 per cent to $3.6bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.Favourable supply dynamics for its memory chip along with “Micron’s technology progress, and emergence of new categories of demand with smartwatch[es] and car[s], would allow Micron to grow its revenues and earnings faster than its peer group of tech companies over the next 12 to 18 months”, Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst at Jefferies said.Shares in Gilead Sciences slid as much as 2.4 per cent to $95.99 after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and maintained their $127 price target. Valeant Pharmaceuticals shares also fell 2 per cent after Morgan Stanley analysts cut their rating on the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight” and lowered their target price to $200 from $284. Valeant rebounded to close 1.6 per cent higher on the day.US stocks sold off after the latest report from the labour department showed the economy created 142,000 jobs in September and downwardly revised August’s figures.By end of day, however, the main indices had pared their losses. The S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 1,951.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 16,472.37, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.7 per cent at 4,707.77.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
63;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2015-08-04T19:37:05Z;Las Vegas growth aids MGM Resorts revenues;Casino group held back by slowdown in Macau;Las Vegas is back in the limelight for MGM Resorts which once again is relying on its home turf for revenue growth.Domestic resorts helped the casino group counter a slowdown in the Chinese territory of Macau, where an anti-corruption campaign drove high-rolling punters away and sent sector revenue tumbling.MGM’s overall net second quarter income totalled $98m, 11 per cent less than the $110m it reported a year earlier, the Las Vegas-based operator said. But higher-than-expected revenue from its Las Vegas operations helped it avoid the fate of its rival Wynn Resorts, which last month reported a 72 per cent drop in second quarter net income.“These resorts are continuing to gain operating momentum while we continue to make significant progress on our development pipeline in Cotai, Maryland, and Massachusetts,” said Jim Murren, chief executive, who highlighted a series of high-profile events that MGM ran in its US resorts in recent months.MGM Resorts shares rose 9.6 per cent to $21.75 on Tuesday.MGM’s revenue fell 7.6 per cent to $2.3bn. Excluding its China operations, MGM recorded 4 per cent growth from the Las Vegas Strip, Detroit and Mississippi.MGM China’s revenue fell a third to $557m, as high-betting punters fled from Macau, the only place in China where gambling is legal, due to a large-scale corruption crackdown and the mainland’s weakening economy.Operators in Macau are learning from Las Vegas— where gaming typically accounts for less than half casino operator revenue — by expanding further into leisure and entertainment.Earlier this year, MGM came under pressure from activist investor Land & Buildings to boost its stock price by spinning off its MGM China unit and becoming a real estate investments trust.Diluted earnings per share slid to 17 cents from 22 cents in the second quarter of 2014.
64;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2015-05-01T15:52:01Z;Exxon edges out Apple as top S&P 500 dividend payer;Oil company boasts an annual payout rate of $12.2bn against $12bn for tech group;ExxonMobil has reclaimed the crown as the top payer of dividends on the S&P 500 from Apple during a week when the market punished Wynn Resorts for slashing its payout.Companies with excess cash and access to cheap borrowing rates have increasingly returned capital to shareholders in recent years. Dividends and buybacks together are expected to potentially top $1tn in 2015 and in the current era of low bond yields, investors have sought blue-chip companies that offer a regular payout.The sluggish economic recovery has meant that corporations are reluctant to spend on big, long-term operational projects. The alternative use of cash for many companies has been through payouts and share repurchases, often at the urging of activist shareholders.While dividends and buybacks both return capital to shareholders, they represent a different psychology for investors. Buybacks are a short-term commitment that can often alter in scale, whereas dividends are seen as a permanent decision.“Buybacks can be cancelled or curtailed at any time,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. “Dividends are a different story — corporations hate to cut dividends.”Investors hate it, too. Wynn shares dropped 17 per cent on Wednesday when the casino operator posted a first-quarter loss and cut its dividend by two-thirds.While a dividend cut is the worst case scenario, investors also often expect companies that boost dividends to keep increasing their payouts.“Once a company [increases the dividend] four or five years in a row, no good deed goes unpunished,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “Companies almost have to continue.”ExxonMobil has consistently raised its annual dividend for more than three decades and the oil company boasts an annual dividend rate of $12.2bn, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That places it ahead of the $12bn being paid out by Apple, which briefly assumed the top spot this week, after announcing an increase of 11 per cent in its quarterly dividend on the back of the company’s record results.Among dividend payers, Microsoft sits third with $10.2bnFor the full-year 2015, dividend payments are expected to set a new record and Mr Silverblatt is looking for a double-digit increase in dividends this year.With interest rates so low — the yield for both the S&P 500 and 10-year Treasury note are around 2 per cent — dividend paying companies have performed well in recent years.During the current share market bull run, which began in March 2009, the S&P 500 Aristocrats index — 52 companies that have boosted their dividends for 25 consecutive years — has returned 300 per cent. The broad S&P 500 index, including the reinvestment of dividends, is 250 per cent higher over the same period.“There are not a lot of places to go for income,” Mr Silverblatt said. “You can’t go to a bank and people are too nervous to go to a bond fund because interest rates are going up. Dividend payers are one of the few places.”

Overall sales fell 28 per cent to $1.09bnAnalysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $1.34 a share on sales of $1.1bn. Adjusted earnings of 70 cents a share fell short of estimates.Net revenues at Wynn Macau — which accounted for nearly 70 per cent of the company’s revenues last year — fell 38 per cent year on year to $705.4m. Table games turnover in the “VIP segment” was $17.1bn, 52.4 per cent lower than the year ago period.An anti-graft campaign in China under president Xi Jinping has curbed spending by mainland Chinese gamblers in Macau.On the company’s earnings call, chief executive Steve Wynn said hopes for improvement during the lunar new year failed to materialise and that “the depression of the VIP market continues”.Meanwhile, net revenues at Wynn Las Vegas, rose 1.6 per cent from the prior year to $386.9m.With operations in Las Vegas “largely focused on the high-end, versus mass market and convention/leisure customers, we don’t see Wynn capturing as much potential upside from a US recovery as MGM Resorts”, said Joel Simkins, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Wynn also cut its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share, from $1.50, which implies an annual dividend of $2.Shares of Wynn Resorts, which have declined more than 25 per cent so far this year, fell 17 per cent to $108.77.Starwood Hotels, owner of the St Regis and Sheraton brands, said on Wednesday that it has hired Lazard to “explore a full range of strategic and financial alternatives” to increase shareholder value.The news accompanied Starwood’s first-quarter results, which showed a sharp drop in profit. Shares of the hotel operator climbed 8 per cent to $87.53.Humana was among the worst performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the health insurance provider missed first-quarter profit expectations following a rise in cost to pay medical benefit claims.The Kentucky-based company said net income climbed 17 per cent from a year earlier to $430m, or $2.82 a share. Excluding certain items, the company said it earned $2.47 a share, shy of analyst consensus by 8 cents.Shares slid 7 per cent to $168.05, wiping roughly $2bn off its market valuation.Genworth Financial shares soared 12 per cent to $8.92 after the company’s chief executive said he was talking to prospective buyers and was willing to take the company private as he seeks to overhaul the financial company.“We’re in the early stages of talking to players who might be interested and in the blocks or the GLAIC entity,” Tom McInerney said on a conference call, referring to the company’s global life and annuity insurance unit.Overall, US equities weakened after a report showed first-quarter growth in the world’s largest economy rose 0.2 per cent from a quarter earlier — below projections for a 1 per cent rise.The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent to 2,106.85 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4 per cent to 18,035.53. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.6 per cent to 5,023.64.
66;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2015-04-29T12:05:18Z;Macau gaming: entertainment value;Macau needs to make money from more than gambling;It isn’t over until the fat lady sings, we are told. Yet the opposite may be true of Macau’s decline. Casino operators there could use a bit of opera — indeed any sort of tourist attraction — to diversify their revenues. Heavy reliance on gaming (relative to more mature markets such as Las Vegas, where more than half of the top line comes from other sources) has caused a precipitous collapse in first- quarter earnings. Analysts, initially slow to react, are ever more bearish as the longer term realities of the crackdown on Chinese officials’ conspicuous consumption hits home.Over the past 12 months earnings expectations have fallen dramatically: across the sector, forecasts for this year and next have been cut by around half. Much of the erosion has occurred this year. So the stocks still do not look cheap, despite large share price falls: some sector names trade as high as 18 times 2016 forecast earnings.Worse, previously dependable dividend yields, based on strong cash generation, are increasingly in doubt. After the US close on Tuesday, Wynn Resorts, parent company of Wynn Macau, cut its dividend by two-thirds. It blamed the downturn in Macau and an “uncertain” outlook in the territory. The market was surprised: shares in both companies fell by around a tenth.Alternative regional destinations may be winning as Macau loses: Barclays says that VIP turnover at Australia’s Crown Resorts and Echo Entertainment together rose 73 per cent in the second half of last year.Still, Fitch Ratings, among others, expects that Chinese VIP gaming will pick up in the second half of this year. In reality, it is extremely hard to forecast when the situation might improve. The slide in gross gaming revenues has in fact accelerated in the first quarter of this year. It is down two-fifths from a year ago. Predicting the turnround will be hard, but if the share prices’ close tracking of gaming turnover is any guide, investors can wait and watch the data.Meanwhile, attempts to diversify are nascent. Non-gaming accounts for only 10 per cent of sales. Somebody call that fat lady.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
67;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2015-04-24T19:10:42Z;Wynn-Wynn situation is Wynn-lose for casino couple;An acrimonious board battle with a personal edge has played out in public;“Luck be a Lady” is one of Steve Wynn’s favourite songs. But a roll of the dice by his ex-wife Elaine failed on Friday as she was dumped from the board of the casino company she helped him build over 13 years.The Wynn-Wynn situation has been lose-lose for the company as an acrimonious boardroom battle played out in public, with both sides sniping through the media for months.A vote to resolve the matter and remove Ms Wynn from the board at Wynn Resorts’ annual meeting in Las Vegas led the share price to immediately rise 1.8 per cent to $130.36.Ms Wynn, 72, twice married and twice divorced to Mr Wynn, 73, holds 9.4 per cent of the company.She argued that she was the only independent voice on the board.Having known her ex-husband since they were both in their teens, she told Fortune magazine: “Sometimes you have to put a lasso around that and pull him back down to earth. Not too many people other than me are willing to do that. I’m the formidable match for Steve Wynn.”Sending out her own, gold-coloured, voting cards to shareholders she urged them to recognise that since all her wealth was tied up in her shareholding, her interests were aligned with theirs.But the board said her attempt to unwind an agreement banning her from selling down her stake put the company’s stability at risk.It accused her of putting her own interests first, passing $10m of shares to her charitable foundation to sell during a blackout period and of knowing her nephew was competing against Wynn for a prime patch of Las Vegas property. Ms Wynn denied all the accusations.Mr Wynn has tried to stay on the sidelines. He complained in a television interview last week that he — a man who has fought blindness, put his elbow through a Picasso, and single-handedly rescued his daughter from a kidnapping — was in an impossible position.“I didn’t happen to agree with them (the directors). I’m in an impossibly embarrassing situation of either not supporting my former wife Elaine, which I am happy to do and obliged to do, or not supporting my board of directors who are all very fine highly respected independent men,” he said on the Charlie Rose TV show, his wiry hair dyed russet.“So on this issue I have recused myself, made public my opinion and I am not commenting on any of this sort of thing because I have nothing constructive to add to the conversation except that it is an uncomfortable situation to be in,” he added, with a poker face.Ahead of the vote, one proxy advisory firm recommended shareholders endorse the board’s attempt to oust Ms Wynn, another said she should stay and a third, Institutional Shareholder Services, declared that shareholders should not vote for any of the nominees to the board, saying that Wynn’s “overall corporate governance profile ranks among the worst, not the best, of US companies”.Sometimes you have to put a lasso around that and pull him back down to earth . . . I’m the formidable match for Steve WynnUltimately, while Mr and the former Mrs Wynn built their empire together, he has received the lion’s share of the credit.In its annual report, Wynn Resorts said it believes Mr Wynn has achieved “brand name status” as the pre-eminent casino developer of our times. “Mr Wynn’s involvement with our resorts provides a distinct advantage over other gaming enterprises,” it said. Anything that happens to him, it added, would have a materially detrimental impact on the business.The board had less time for Ms Wynn’s claims that she helped to build the brand, advising on everything down to the linen in the bedrooms.“Ms Wynn maintains her office at the company’s headquarters and repeatedly describes her activities as being comparable to those of management,” the board said in a letter to shareholders. “The operational contributions Ms Wynn claims to make are more appropriately matters to be handled by the company’s highly trained and professional staff.”It added a checklist of qualities that its two nominees possessed compared with Ms Wynn, who it claimed had no chief executive or chairman experience, no financial or capital markets experience and no property development experience.The uncomfortable tinge of sexism was played up by Ms Wynn, who noted that she was the only woman on a board of white males. In response, Wynn published a list of its top female employees, including Linda Chen, COO of Wynn Macau, Kim Sinatra, the company’s general counsel and Teri Peers its chief accounting officer. “We look forward to expanding the board with one or more qualified, diverse and independent directors by the end of 2015,” the company said after the vote.It was an unfortunate sideshow for a company that has seen its fortunes in Macau, now responsible for $4bn of its revenues compared with $1.5bn from Las Vegas, wane after a clampdown by the Communist party that has restricted access to Macau. Mr Wynn’s concession in Macau is due for renewal in 2022, but the government can rescind it, with just one year’s notice, from the summer 2017.The company is also fighting legal battles in Japan and the United States against Kazuo Okada, the Japanese pachinko tycoon. Wynn forcibly redeemed Mr Okada’s 20 per cent stake in the company in 2012 after alleging that his company tried to bribe gaming officials in South Korea and the Philippines. Mr Okada denies the allegations and has sued for libel.
68;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2014-10-29T02:45:58Z;China anti-graft drive squeezes Wynn Resorts in Macau;Third-quarter revenues in the territory fall as Chinese high-rollers stay away;China’s anti-corruption campaign is creating ripples in Macau, with Wynn Resorts reporting that revenues fell in the third quarter because of a big drop in the number of high-rollers visiting casinos in the Chinese territory.The company owned by flamboyant gaming tycoon Steve Wynn said revenues from VIP gamblers – Chinese punters who gamble in special rooms in casinos – in Macau plunged 17 per cent from last year to $25bn.This sparked a 5.6 per cent decline in overall turnover in Macau, which caused group revenues to fall 1.5 per cent even though revenues from operations in Las Vegas rose 9 per cent over the same period.Xi Jinping, China’s president, is aggressively pursuing an anti-graft and austerity drive that has hit everyone from top party officials and military officers to wealthy Chinese who like to play baccarat in Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is the only place in China where gambling is legal.Macau has seen spectacular growth since it abandoned a monopoly gambling system in 2002 and allowed six operators, including Sheldon Adelson’s Sands China and James Packer’s Melco Crown, to open casinos.The gaming companies have gained from a fast-growing economy across the border in mainland China that has propelled both the number of mass-market tourists and wealthy Chinese gamblers who visit the tiny enclave. Macau last year leapt past Switzerland to become the world’s fourth richest territory per capita, according to the World Bank, largely because of the massive growth in Chinese punters.But in recent months, questions have been raised about future prospects as Mr Xi’s campaign has started to bite. Gaming revenues have fallen year on year for the past four months as wealthy Chinese become more nervous about being seen gambling in Macau.Experts say the rest of the year will remain tough since Mr Xi is expected to visit Macau in December for the 15th anniversary of the territory’s return to China, which is making wealthy Chinese and particularly government officials even more cautious about visiting.Casinos also have been forced to ban smoking in most parts of their properties from this month, which is expected to dent their businesses. In addition they are facing increasing labour strife as workers complain they are not reaping enough of the benefits of the boom in Macau that has created many jobs but also has caused property prices in the territory just an hour by ferry from Hong Kong to spiral higher.The Associated Press quoted Mr Wynn as saying that he was unsure how long the tougher conditions in Macau would prevail, adding he did not know whether it was a “squall or the rainy season”.While Wynn reported a significant fall in gambling revenues in Macau, the company said adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) fell only 1.1 per cent to $326m in the third quarter. For parent group Wynn Resorts, adjusted ebitda rose 5.3 per cent to $459m.Twitter: @AsiaNewsDemetri

Net revenues slipped 4 per cent from a year earlier to $8.9bn.Profits dipped to $146m, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter from $266m, or 77 cents, the previous year. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 31 cents per share.Hubert Joly, Best Buy chief executive, said the company was grappling with a difficult retail environment, noting overall consumer electronics sales tracked by research group NPD slid 2.5 per cent in the period.“Like other retailers and as reflected in this quarter’s performance, we continued to see a shift in consumer behaviour: consumers are increasingly researching and buying online,” he said.Brian Nagel, an analyst at Oppenheimer, echoed a note of caution, forecasting a difficult second half of the year as competitors encroach on the electronics market.Best Buy shares declined 7 per cent to $29.81, erasing some $760m from the retailer’s valuation.The company’s shares are among the 10 worst-performing on the benchmark S&P 500 this year, trailing only Mattel, Staples, Whole Foods and Coach.Mobileye jumped after at least eight investment banks initiated coverage of the Israeli technology company following its initial public offering earlier this month.A majority of the analysts who started covering the company, including those with Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Wells Fargo, recommended the stock as a “buy” on Tuesday, citing strong growth prospects as carmakers increase their use of Mobileye’s technology.The company makes software, chips and other applications that process visual data to stop cars from colliding. Its customers include BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan and Volvo.“Mobileye is at the centre of arguably the most powerful automotive megatrend in history – active safety and autonomous mobility,” Itay Michaeli, an analyst with Citi, said. “This isn’t just another regulatory-driven penetration story, but also arguably the auto industry’s ‘iPhone’ moment.”Mobileye shares advanced 8 per cent to $41.43.The US and Chinese gambling sectors were under pressure after brokerage Morgan Stanley trimmed its forecasts for Macau gaming growth, as decelerating Chinese economic activity weighs on visits to the world’s betting hub.Analysts with the bank now expect full-year gaming revenues in Macau to rise 6 per cent in 2014 from a year earlier, compared to an earlier 12 per cent forecast.The tempered forecast comes despite the bank’s belief that activity has stabilised in Macau following two straight months of declines, which Morgan Stanley attributed to the World Cup.Stronger volumes and busier floors in August, which have yet to be confirmed by Macau’s gaming bureau, would not offset other headwinds, Thomas Allen, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said.Mr Allen highlighted a change made to transit visa rules, which reduced the length of time Chinese passport-holders can spend in Macau from seven to five days, as well as a forthcoming smoking ban, for some of the expected difficulty.The visa change was “impacting both VIP and mass players’ ability to get to Macau as often as some would like”, he said.Shares of Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts slipped roughly 1 per cent to $67.85 and $199.28, respectively. Shares in Pinnacle Entertainment and MGM Resorts were relatively flat.Overall, US equities continued a two-day advance as consumer confidence climbed to a seven-year high and durable goods orders eclipsed Wall Street expectations.The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.02. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.2 per cent to 17,106.70 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 4,570.64.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
70;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2014-06-03T17:05:06Z;Casinos sink on Macau spin of wheel;;US casino operators fell broadly as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, fell short of Wall Street expectations.Overall gaming revenues rose 9.3 per cent from a year earlier to 32.4bn Macanese patacas, or $4.1bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.Analysts on average had expected a rise between 13 and 15 per cent.Since the year’s start, revenues have reached roughly $20.8bn, or 16 per cent higher than the year ago level.Analysts with Citigroup said much of the weakness in the sector – the Dow Jones US Gambling Index has fallen 13 per cent over the past three months – has been due to recent reports of “crackdowns on illegal use of Union Pay Cards, transit visas and junkets running away”, which they say are overblown.“Adding to pressure, in May the Macau government announced that a full smoking ban in the mass gaming areas will be implemented,” analyst Anil Daswani said.“Again, we believe these fears are overdone as the ban will not apply to premium mass or VIP.”Citi added the addition of new rooms would likely lift overall growth in the sector in the coming years.Wynn Resorts fell 4.49 per cent to close at $208.23, Las Vegas Sands dipped 2.57 per cent to $75.44 and MGM Resorts International declined almost 3 per cent to end the day at $25.83.Dollar General stuck to its profit forecast even as consumers spend more on lower-margin items at a US discount chain that has fared well since the financial crisis.The company, which is based in Tennessee, said it was generating lower profits from its sales as shoppers buy more “lower-margin consumables” such as tobacco and candy.While Dollar General stuck to a prediction that it will make between $3.45 and $3.55 a share in the current financial year, it cautioned “the volatility of the macroeconomic environment continues to pressure the consumer”.Overall, sales climbed almost 7 per cent to $4.52bn in the quarter to May 2. Net income rose to $222m from $220m.Shares in the company advanced 3.85 per cent to close at $56.39.Hillshire Brands, the US company behind Jimmy Dean sausages, said it will start talks with both Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson Foods over the takeover bids that the companies have each made.Shares in Hillshire jumped about 9.5 per cent to close at $58.65 after Pilgrim’s Pride confirmed it had raised its offer from $45 a share to $55 a share in cash.Pilgrim’s Pride shares fell 2.24 per cent to $25.34 while Tyson declined just over 3 per cent to $42.07.Tyson Foods has an offer of $50 a share, or roughly $6.8bn, on the table.The fight for Hillshire, which itself is trying to buy rival food producer Pinnacle, comes as companies seek to wrestle pricing power from retailers, global groups seek growth in new markets and conglomerates reshuffle their brand portfolios.US carmakers advanced on Tuesday as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all topped monthly sales expectations.Any reputational damage that General Motors has incurred because of its mass recall of cars has yet to reach showrooms in the US.Sales of its vehicles rose 12.6 per cent in May from a year earlier, almost double the tally that analysts had forecast.Although the figures echo the strong performance across the industry last month, they also underline that the decision by GM chief executive Mary Barra to recall more than 10m cars in the US has not put off consumers.Ford reported a 3 per cent rise in US sales in May. Ford shares rose 0.64 per cent to $16.55 while General Motors climbed 1.12 per cent to close at $35.25.Overall, US equity markets closed slightly lower. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.04 per cent to 1,924.24 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent to 16,722.34.

71;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2014-05-02T22:00:46Z;Wynn Resorts gains on Macau gambling data;US equities little moved after strong non-farm payrolls;Wynn Resorts led a surging casino industry on Friday as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, showed a resilient Chinese business that has benefited from new infrastructure and rail connections.Gaming revenues in Macau increased 11 per cent from a year earlier to 31.1bn patacas, or $3.9bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. For the year, sales are running 18 per cent above last year’s levels. The rise was above analyst expectations for a 7 per cent advance.The figures followed better than expected quarterly earnings from Wynn, which said sales rose 14 per cent from a year earlier to $1.5bn. Profits climbed 12 per cent to $227m, or $2.22 per diluted share.Wynn said it remained on track to open its latest 1,700 room resort in Macau in the first half of 2016 and both mass market and VIP segments in Macau showed 20 per cent plus growth. Analysts on Wall Street said they expected strong growth to continue, even as new hotels open over the next few years.“May Golden Week is off to a very strong start, with record mass market crowds in Macau over the past four days,” Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said. “Even our most sceptical contacts in Macau are surprised at the crowds they’ve seen this week.”Shares of Wynn rose 7.3 per cent to $221.68, while MGM Resorts advanced 4.3 per cent to $26.49 and Las Vegas Sands increased 1.6 per cent to $80.60.Cosmetics and beauty company Estée Lauder was cheered by investors after reporting renewed momentum in several emerging markets.The company enjoyed an increase in sales in China and Latin America during the first three months of the year, helping lift overall sales 11 per cent to $2.5bn.Profits, in turn, rose by almost a fifth to $213.2m, or 54 cents a share, from $178.8m, or 45 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Shares in the company advanced 4.7 per cent to $75.62.LinkedIn slid as much as 8.3 per cent after the company said it expected full-year sales to be in a range between $2.06bn and $2.08bn, shy of Wall Street expectations.The guidance offset better than expected first-quarter results. Sales rose 46 per cent from a year earlier to $473m. LinkedIn swung to a loss of $13m, or 11 cents per share, compared with a profit of $23m in the first quarter of 2013.Adjusting for certain items, the company said it earned 38 cents per share, four cents ahead of forecasts. LinkedIn’s hiring solutions business – which accounts for more than half of sales – continued to slow.Tech companies, including Amazon and Twitter, have been hard hit for reporting slowing growth this quarter, however slight. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch point out that, with US equity markets still near records, misses are being punished more than beats are being rewarded.“The focus appears to be shifting back to fundamentals, as post-reporting performance spreads widened last week,” equity strategist Savita Subramanian said.Skechers shares dipped after it announced it was interested in purchasing the Los Angeles Clippers, the US basketball team whose owner was recorded making alleged racist remarks.The maker of trainers said on Friday it was exploring acquiring an interest in the team. The National Basketball Association commissioner, Adam Silver, said this week that he would do “everything in my power” to force Donald Sterling, the current owner, to sell.Shares in Skechers fell 4.8 per cent to $39.93.Overall, US equities were little moved after the monthly non-farm payrolls report showed weaker than expected wage growth, even as overall payrolls expanded at the greatest rate since early 2012.The S&P 500 was down 0.13 per cent at 1,881.14 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.28 per cent to 16,512.89. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite nudged down slightly to 4,123.90.
72;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2014-04-01T16:35:41Z;US casinos gain from Chinese gambling appetite;;Shares in US casinos climbed on Tuesday after figures showed gambling revenues in Macau rose by a double-digit rate for the second consecutive month, as demand from Chinese visitors remained robust.Gaming revenues increased 13 per cent from a year earlier to 35.5bn patacas, or $4.4bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.The rise was at the top end of analyst expectations for a 10 to 13 per cent advance.Sterne Agee analyst David Bain said he expected upward revisions to earnings estimates in the next several weeks based on better than expected figures for the first three months of the year.“Results were on the high-end of recent expectations and we believe, provide solace for those with macro-China concerns – something that caused disruption in the otherwise upward momentum for Macau names,” Mr Bain said.Shares in Wynn Resorts climbed 2.26 per cent to close at $227.18, MGM resorts rose 2.59 per cent to $26.53 and Melco Crown Entertainment increased 5.67 per cent to $40.84. All three companies have properties in Macau.Ford Motor led US automakers higher following better than expected monthly sales figures.The second-largest US car manufacturer reported a 3.4 per cent rise in sales in March as buyers returned to dealership showrooms as the weather eased.The Detroit-based company sold 244,167 vehicles last month, compared with 236,160 in the same month a year earlier.Ford was joined by Chrysler and Toyota in besting Wall Street estimates, as sales rose 11 per cent and 4.9 per cent from a year earlier, respectively. General Motors initially delayed its monthly report due to a computer issue, but later announced that sales in March were 4.1 per cent higher on last year.Shares in Ford rose almost 5 per cent to $16.31 while General Motors slipped 0.23 per cent to $34.34.Intuitive Surgical shares climbed after the company announced it had won regulatory approval to bring a new surgical system to the US market.The company said the Food and Drug Administration cleared its da Vinci Xi Surgical System, a new system that uses minimally invasive approaches to abdominal surgeries.“We view this as a significant positive for Intuitive Surgical, as it has the potential to both drive a replacement cycle and further increase penetration/utilisation within hospitals,” JPMorgan analyst Tycho Peterson said.Intuitive Surgical ended 12.7 per cent higher at $493.60, leading the benchmark S&P 500.Nvidia, the chipmaker, advanced following a broker upgrade to ‘market outperform’ on Tuesday as analysts at JMP Securities warmed to the company’s focus on the cloud market.“The company is successfully realigning its business model to more stable growth and gross margin opportunities, and, in our opinion, is in a position to deliver earnings upside in coming quarters,” analyst Alex Gauna said.Mr Gauna established a $26 price target on the company and said Nvidia should benefit from an increase in sales of its Tegra mobile processor for auto applications. He noted PC headwinds should also be lower than in past years.Shares in Nvidia increased just over 4 per cent to $18.65.Overall, US equities strengthened for the third consecutive day following a rise in the monthly ISM manufacturing survey. The report showed improving new orders and production activity at the country’s manufacturers.Millan Mulraine, a strategist with TD Securities, said gains in key forward looking indicators in the monthly ISM report pointed to “sustained upside momentum” in the future.“This report offers an upbeat assessment on US manufacturing sector momentum in March, and more importantly with the key forward-looking heading higher, it provides a constructive outlook on the performance of this crucial sector,” he said.The S&P 500 advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,885.52 after touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.46 per cent to close at 16,532.61. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 1.64 per cent to end the day at 4,268.04.
73;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2014-02-11T11:10:07Z;Casino owners battle over online gambling;;A debate over the future of internet gambling has created a rift among US casino industry titans, pitting advocates of expansion such as Jim Murran, chief executive of MGM Resorts, against billionaire opponents Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn.The split, which erupted in an advertising battle this week, comes at a pivotal moment for the industry, following last year’s launch of online gambling in Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada. As many as 10 states – including California, Illinois and Pennsylvania – may consider similar legislation in 2014, according to the research firm Gambling Compliance.The push for expansion is coming from a new coalition led by the American Gaming Association, whose members include casino groups such as MGM and Caesars that are eager to develop the online market further.The AGA has launched an ad campaign to push back against Mr Adelson and Mr Wynn – who chair Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, respectively – and promote what it claims are the benefits of legal and regulated internet gaming.“Internet gaming is here,” said Geoff Freeman, AGA president. The choice for the industry was either to get involved or be pushed aside, he added.The prize is a US online gaming market that, if legalised and regulated, could be worth as much as $13.4bn within five years, according to H2 Gambling Capital, an industry research firm.But Mr Adelson, one of the Republican party’s largest donors, has vowed to spend “whatever it takes” to stop internet gambling.Richard McGowan, a Boston College professor who studies the industry, says Mr Adelson’s opposition is rooted in a fear that internet gambling will harm his casinos in Nevada and Pennsylvania. The billionaire argues, however, that the social costs outweigh the revenues.Mr Wynn had remained publicly agnostic until siding with Mr Adelson last week. Mr Adelson has assembled other high-profile figures such as former New York Governor George Pataki and former Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln, to push his message at the state and federal levels.The group launched a six-figure ad campaign on Monday urging Congress to restore the Wire Act of 1961 – which prohibited internet gambling until a 2011 Department of Justice ruling overturned the federal blanket ban and allowed states to decide for themselves.Internet gaming is here. The choice for the industry is either to get involved or be pushed aside“The main thing is to raise public awareness that this is happening. Ninety-five per cent of people have no idea that three states have authorised [internet gambling]. If they did, they would be very frightened by the prospect,” Mr Pataki said.Mr Adelson’s group has corralled support from 16 state attorneys-general opposed to online gambling expansion. It is circulating FBI memos warning that internet casinos can be used by terrorists and criminal syndicates to launder money.Before the late 1980s, most forms of gambling had been prohibited in the US outside Nevada and New Jersey. But the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 changed that by allowing Indian tribes to operate casinos on reservations for their own benefit.Cash-strapped states subsequently authorised slot parlours and small casinos, and by the late 2000s, states were fiercely competing for gambling revenues by building larger and more elaborate casinos. In 2014, 22 states will operate commercial or racetrack casinos, while 28 states host tribal casinos.The AGA had previously been split on the question of internet gambling – primarily due to Las Vegas Sands’ presence on its board. But under Mr Freeman, who took over the group in mid-2013, it now contends that online play is the next logical outgrowth of the industry’s development.Pointing to the fact that Americans are already gambling online through offshore sites to the tune of $3bn a year, the AGA is advocating for federal legalisation and regulation to protect consumers and recapture lost revenues. It says Europe is an example of how online gambling can be regulated and operated safely.The AGA has retained its own team of heavy-hitters including political strategist Jim Messina, who helped mastermind President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election and is a part-time elections adviser to David Cameron’s Conservative party. Known for his use of data and social media-driven messaging, Mr Messina could be influential in winning over voters and legislators.Other states’ appetite to consider online gambling legislation may depend on the experience of recent converts. New Jersey reaped a meagre $8.4m in online gambling revenue after launching in late 2013.The figure was much worse than Governor Chris Christie and most analysts had expected, and industry observers and advocates will be keen to see if a parallel market of online gamers emerges or if the games cannibalise bricks-and-mortar casinos’ revenues.While Europe’s online and traditional casino markets have managed to coexist, the abundance of casinos in the US compared with Europe means that there are few international precedents to help predict who will win the high-stakes battle for the industry’s future.
74;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2013-12-29T17:29:12Z;Activist hedge funds launch fight for right to pay bonuses;;"Activist hedge funds are fighting for the right to pay bonuses to directors that they place on corporate boards.This comes as 33 US companies have amended their bylaws to disqualify any directors that receive payment from outsiders, in the hope of deterring attacks by activist investors such as Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb.The bans have raised the ire not just of activists but of institutional shareholders, many of whom are sceptical about the motives of the activists but who want to retain the right to choose directors for themselves.Prominent activists vow they will not back down, and are canvassing support among shareholders and their advisers.Mr Icahn dismissed concerns that directors paid by activist shareholders would have incentives to act in their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole.“Why is it all right for a company to give directors free access to planes and hundreds of thousands in board fees and all kinds of perks, yet if I find a Nobel prizewinner who is going to really help a company it is not all right for me as a holder of a lot of stock to give him a share in my profits?” he said.Existing board directors are just as likely to act against shareholder interests, Mr Icahn added, for example by opposing a takeover of the company.“If you give a director hundreds of thousands in board fees a meeting and all kinds of perks, he doesn’t have a lot of incentive to see that come to an end.”Lawyers who defend companies against activist attacks have been pushing the idea of a payments ban this year, and companies including Halliburton, McGraw Hill Financial, Marathon Oil and Wynn Resorts have already amended their bylaws, according to the corporate governance advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services.But another activist fund, Jana Partners, argues that existing board directors have often built up substantial shareholdings and stock options, so activists’ nominees would only be compensated in line with other directors.When Jana nominated directors to the board of fertiliser company Agrium earlier this year, it proposed paying them bonuses based on the company’s performance over the coming years. Elliott Management proposed similar payments to its nominees to the board of Hess, the energy company. Both plans proved controversial: Jana’s nominees lost; Elliott withdrew the scheme.“Our only real constituency is shareholders,” said Charles Penner, partner at Jana. “If we can convince them that we have a structure that works, then we can get there.”In November, the organisation advised voting against the re-election of board members at Provident Financial. The California bank had adopted a version of the payment ban that would even have prevented activists from paying a one-off fee to nominees for agreeing to stand for election, currently a widespread practice.Chris Cernich, director of proxy fight research at ISS, said: “Whether investors are for or against Hess-like compensation, they are unified they want to be able to decide for themselves.”"
75;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2013-09-19T12:24:02Z;Caesars bets on online gambling market;;At 9.19am Pacific Daylight Time on Thursday, somewhere in Nevada, a resident or visitor to the state logged on to a computer or a tablet to play World Series of Poker online for the first time for real money.For Caesars, the operator of the WSOP brand – which in the land-based world of gambling has been an annual Las Vegas tournament since 1970 – the money to be made from this particular player and others in the months following the launch is of trifling concern.Of more relevance is the symbolism of the moment. Caesars has become the first large Las Vegas casino operator to take a dime out of online gambling.Outlawed by Congress seven years ago, online gambling is finally gaining a legal foothold in the US, albeit in limited form. State by state, legislators are passing regulations allowing for online poker, casino and bingo. Sports betting remains off the table.Nevada has led the way, followed by Delaware, though their small populations make it tough for online operators to make money. But New Jersey is set to go online in the next few months, and New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California are actively planning for regulation.The US online gambling market could be worth $7.4bn in gross winnings by 2017, according to consultants H2 Gaming Capital, on the assumption that 17 states will have regulated online gambling.It is not just the politicians who have been slow to come round to its acceptance, and only then because of the tax revenue benefits.Some of the big casino moguls have proved ambivalent at best, hostile at worst, regarding online gambling as an errant, untrustworthy offspring that would damage the revenues of their casino palaces.To Sheldon Adelson, online gambling represents nothing less than a threat to society – “a toxin which all good people ought to resist” – as the chief executive of Las Vegas Sands wrote in Forbes magazine in June.Steve Wynn, in a hurry to expand his mega-casino Wynn Resorts empire across North America and Macau, has an ambivalent attitude to online gambling.It’s going to look like a tsunami in a bath tub“I don’t know how to make the experience on a computer screen 17 inches in diameter particularly unforgettable,” he said on a typically colourful analysts’ call in April. He quickly added that his company would some day have to find the formula.But Caesars, under chief executive Gary Loveman, is throwing itself at the task, and Nevada’s 2.8m population is about to bombarded with a publicity onslaught.“It’s going to look like a tsunami in a bath tub,” said Mitch Garber, the former chief executive of PartyGaming recruited by Mr Loveman six years ago to set up and run the group’s online strategy.A potentially bigger market is the 39m visitors who descend on Las Vegas each year. Airport advertising, billboards on the Strip, wraparound posters at Caesars’ hotels, hotel room keys and Do Not Disturb signs will all aim to persuade visitors about the attractions of WSOP online.Another day, another refinancing at private equity-owned Caesars Entertainment. In this case the Las Vegas-based casino operator said this week it was seeking to raise almost $5bn in bonds and loans to refinance its commercial mortgage-backed securities and a chunk of junior debt.continue readingTheir online gambling experience may only be limited to the length of their Vegas holiday, but lobbyists for online gambling think this will still be worthwhile.“It will get more Americans exposed to playing online and maybe they will put pressure on their own state legislators,” said John Pappas of the Poker Players’ Alliance.The launch of WSOP online is a moment to savour, too, for the European industry. Congress’s decisive ban in 2006 led to the exodus of European operators from the US, among them London-listed 888 Holdings.Now, 888, founded by the Israeli brothers Avi and Aaron Shaken, is back in the US. 888 technology is powering the WSOP website for Caesars, which like other US land-based casino groups lacks the back-end online gambling knowhow developed by the Europeans.“This is a magic moment for 888,” said chief executive Brian Mattingley. “We have a control room in Tel Aviv where people are watching the first deposits from the US coming in live.”It will get more Americans exposed to playing online and maybe they will put pressure on their own state legislatorsThose deposits are unlikely to be significant to 888’s revenues until 2015. By then, the industry may have a better idea whether Mr Adelson’s suspicions about online gambling cannibalising the land-based operators are well founded.Mr Garber recalls the pre-2006 days when online specialists such as PartyGaming and 888 were enriched by the popularity of internet poker among Americans.“We know Americans want to play poker online,” he said. “For us, this is a laboratory for others to watch and hopefully learn from it and follow it. Most of our competitors see online as a competitive part of the future and will be rooting for our success.”
76;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2013-02-05T17:10:08Z;Japan regulator probes Okada gaming group;;A probe into Universal Entertainment Corp, the gaming and resorts group run by Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada, widened on Tuesday as the company said that the Osaka stock exchange had asked it to explain its accounting for millions of dollars of payments made while securing deals in Manila.The involvement by the Osaka Securities Exchange – the first by a Japanese regulator – opens a new front in an investigation led by US and Philippine authorities into whether affiliates of UEC made illegal payments at around the time the company was lobbying to win one of four licenses to build casino projects in Manila, awarded in 2008 and 2009.In a statement last month, Tokyo-based UEC said there was a “need to verify the suitability of accounting procedures” it used to book $40m of payments reported by Reuters and Japan’s Asahi newspaper, and said it would revise its books if directed to do so by a panel of three outside experts it has asked to look into the affair.Reports of the approach by the OSE sent shares in the Jasdaq-listed company down more than 4 per cent on Tuesday. UEC also said that its release of earnings for the September-December quarter, scheduled for this Friday, would be pushed back to February 14.Mr Okada is also embroiled in a dispute with US casino magnate and former partner Steve Wynn. Wynn Resorts, which had ousted Mr Okada as director and forcibly redeemed his 20 per cent stake in the company, alleged in a lawsuit in February 2012 that the Japanese billionaire violated US anti-bribery laws by making unauthorised payments to Philippine regulators.Mr Okada has rejected the allegations, claiming they are without foundation and designed to draw attention from questions he raised at board level about Wynn Resorts’ own activities.Mr Okada issued a letter to the Wynn board last month requesting that it investigate Mr Wynn’s actions in getting a second concession in Macau. However, a Hong Kong-based gaming analyst said that in a conference call Mr Wynn hosted last week to discuss his company’s fourth-quarter results, the subject of Mr Okada and his feud against Wynn was not mentioned.The analyst said Mr Okada’s accusations are increasingly “a non-event for Wynn”. He drew a parallel with the dismissal this week of a shareholder lawsuit brought by a Louisiana pension fund that had alleged that a $135m donation to the University of Macau by Wynn Resorts was a waste of shareholders’ money.Nobuyuki Horiuchi, UEC spokesman, confirmed on Tuesday that the OSE had followed up on newspaper reports of accounting irregularities.A representative for the Japan Exchange Group, the OSE’s holding company, said it did not comment on any investigation under way at any specific listed company.Additional reporting by Michiyo Nakamoto
77;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-12-04T00:26:15Z;Oracle to pre-pay $867m dividends;;Oracle said on Monday it would pre-pay $867m worth of dividends that would otherwise not have fallen due until 2013, making it the latest US company to accelerate the distribution of cash to help shareholders offset some of the risk of higher taxes.Among the biggest beneficiaries of the move will be Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder and chief executive, who will receive a one-off payment of $205m from his stake in the database software group. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Oracle said Mr Ellison “did not participate in the deliberation or the vote on this matter”.The announcement follows a spate of special dividend payments by other US companies as politicians in Washington debate how to avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would be forced by the fiscal cliff. Higher taxes on dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at 15 per cent, are among the ideas proposed in some quarters.Costco last week announced a special dividend of $3bn to its shareholders to beat the end-of-year deadline that would bring automatic tax rises if a deal in Washington is not reached.The accelerated Oracle payment could save Mr Ellison more than $30m, if the lower tax rate instituted by the Bush administration is reversed. The software company said it would pay a dividend of 18 cents a share for stockholders of record on December 14, with the payment being made on December 21.Referring to the distribution as an “accelerated” payment, Oracle said it would not make the usual regular quarterly payments it would have made over the following three quarters as a result.A number of other US companies whose directors own a significant amount of stock, putting them at risk from higher tax rates, have also announced one-off dividends in recent weeks, including Franklin Resources, Wynn Resorts and Werner Enterprises.
78;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-11-01T19:33:49Z;Defiant Okada hits out in Wynn fight;;When shareholders of Wynn Resorts gather in Las Vegas on Friday for their annual meeting, one individual will be conspicuous by his absence.Kazuo Okada, a co-founder of the casino resort group, was until February a 20 per cent shareholder in the company, which takes its name from its other co-founder, Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas gaming magnate who built properties including the Bellagio and the Mirage.But Mr Okada’s stake was forcibly redeemed this year at a steep discount, after Wynn Resorts accused him of “unsuitable” behaviour that included paying bribes to international gaming regulators.The Japanese billionaire, who made a fortune from making pachinko gambling machines, may have been exiled from the company and barred from the shareholder meeting, but he is not giving up without a fight. He has launched multiple legal actions and used an interview with the Financial Times to criticise his former friend and business partner, claiming that the forced redemption of his stake was “illegal”.Mr Okada said there were “serious questions” over a $135m donation Wynn Resorts made to the University of Macau. He also told the FT his company was “looking into” other payments made by Wynn Resorts as it expanded its operations in Macau.Wynn has one casino resort in the city and is developing another close by on the Cotai Strip. As part of this development the company agreed to pay $35m to Tien Chiao Entertainment, a group that had won the right to develop a property on the land.The deal gave Tien Chiao the right to purchase a 12.5 per cent stake in the Wynn Cotai Strip development but the contract eventually changed to a flat fee of $50m.Mr Okada alleged that Tien Chiao Entertainment has close links with the ruling authorities in Macau. “We are looking into this to determine why the payment was made,” he told the FT.Wynn Resorts declined to comment on the Tien Chiao payment, but a person familiar with the matter said the payment was a standard commercial agreement. Tien Chiao would have had to invest hundreds of millions of dollars for its 12.5 per cent stake in the Wynn Cotai Strip property, which will cost an estimated $4bn to construct, and instead elected to receive a higher fee in exchange for allowing Wynn to develop its property on the site.Wynn Resorts infuriated Mr Okada in February when it redeemed the stake in the company held by Aruze USA, a division of his Universal Entertainment group, at a 30 per cent discount to its trading price, issuing a 10-year $1.9bn promissory note which pays a 2 per cent annual interest rate in redemption of the shares.That represents a healthy profit on Mr Okada’s initial investment of $120m but it has done little to temper his anger.“There are governance issues here,” Mr Okada told the FT through an interpreter. “Even if I turned out to be an unsuitable shareholder – and I don’t believe that to be true – I don’t believe the redemption of shares at a 30 per cent discount has a legal basis.”He claims the allegations about him paying bribes to gaming regulators – published in a lengthy report by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation – were a smokescreen, designed to distract from questions he raised at board level about the company’s activities.His chief concern was the donation by Wynn Resorts to the University of Macau. “I was the only one on the board to raise concerns about that donation,” he told the FT. “Macau is a rich country, thanks to its casinos and the University of Macau is relatively wealthy. I asked the board to explain why it made such a generous donation.”He claims no explanation was ever given. While Wynn Resorts declined to comment, a person familiar with the matter denied that the Freeh report was commissioned to distract from Mr Okada’s concerns about the donation.The person said Wynn Resorts had already commissioned two other investigations into Mr Okada because of suspicions about his behaviour more than a year before publication of the report by Mr Freeh. “[Mr Okada] is trying to distract from his own poor behaviour by making baseless allegations against the company,” the person said.Mr Okada told the FT the Wynn Resorts board was “weak”. The person familiar with the situation said the calibre of board members, who include Robert Miller, a former governor of Nevada, and Ray Irani, the chairman of Occidental Petroleum, “speaks for itself”.Mr Okada has endured several setbacks in his fight with Mr Wynn. Last month he failed to convince a court to allow him to vote his redeemed shares at Friday’s shareholder meeting. But Mr Okada refuses to back down.Mr Wynn once said: “I love Kazuo Okada as much as any man that I’ve ever met in my life”. It is unlikely he still holds that view.
79;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;The great American gamble;Is it time for western society to accept the inevitable – and openly celebrate casinos?;"As I was flicking through a political website the other day, I spotted a curious fact. According to calculations by Bloomberg, two of the five largest donors to the Republican party hail from the gambling industry. One, Sheldon Adelson, presides over a global empire of casinos, hotels and convention centres (such as The Venetian in Las Vegas); the other is Stephen Wynn, a man who played a key role in revitalising Las Vegas (via the Wynn Resorts group). And while both of them have tried to stay out of the limelight, Adelson is spending tens of millions of dollars on the campaign, and Wynn is offering sizeable donations too.Is this a coincidence? Perhaps. The other big donors on both sides hail from a wide range of other business backgrounds, such as finance, real estate and manufacturing. But, if nothing else, the presence of those tycoons casts a spotlight on a fascinating cultural contradiction.In some respects, the United States is a place that would prefer to sweep gambling out of public view, in line with its puritan past. During much of the country’s history, gambling has been explicitly banned. And even when it has been permitted or tolerated, it has almost always aroused unease and been pushed into the geographical and cultural margins of society.In the mid-19th century, for example, gambling was permitted in Mississippi – but only on river boats that were separated from society at large. Then, in the 20th century, some states legalised gambling in certain regions, such as Nevada (in the 1930s) and Atlantic City (in the 1970s). A host of Indian reservations took advantage of their special legal status to do the same. Zoning laws made it relatively easy to keep this culturally and geographically ringfenced and thus for mainstream Americans to avert their eyes. Such ringfencing was made easier still because groups such as the Indian reservations deftly filled that economic and cultural niche (not unlike the way Jewish communities provided lending services to Christians in Europe 700 years ago, when lending also aroused ambivalence).And yet in spite of this double-think – or, because of it – gambling carries powerful economic clout. According to the American Gaming Association, legal gambling revenues were $92bn in 2007 (the last published data). Out of that, $26bn came from those Indian reservation casinos. However, one of the most peculiar aspects of the whole gambling game is that government is involved too: state-run lotteries produced another $25bn of revenues. Commercial casinos, of the sort run by Adelson and Wynn, produced some $34bn of revenues, generating more than 350,000 jobs. (And that is before anyone even tries to calculate the growth of internet gambling, such as online poker.)So does that mean it is time to accept the inevitable – and openly celebrate gambling? American society might seem to be moving that way: more regions are now legalising casinos, say, and they are becoming more visible and acceptable in mainstream life. But personally, that trend makes me wince. A few years ago, I visited Atlantic City and was left very uneasy by what I saw; though many punters were enjoying themselves, others had a pinched, glassy stare. What was particularly unnerving was that many of those pinched faces did not look wealthy at all; worse, they were gambling in a venue dotted with pawn shops and where free alcohol was constantly served. The casinos had clearly perfected the system to keep some players chained to the machines and tables until their last drop of financial blood had been spent.Of course, many gaming fans would argue that this characterisation is unfair. I recently met with Gary Loveman, the thoughtful head of the Caesars group, who pointed out that it is hypocritical to criticise gaming for being good at sucking dollars out of customers, unless you also cast the finger at other businesses, such as retailers or food. Studies by psychologists suggest only a tiny proportion of the population can be defined as compulsive gamblers. These days the gambling industry is surrounded by a dense thicket of regulations, intended to keep criminals out of the business. And men such as Loveman say they have an incentive to treat consumers fairly. He claims, for example, that he would rather not serve free alcohol to customers as they play, but is prompted to do so by competitive pressures (ie without a ban, it is hard for one casino to break ranks).Yet those contradictions remain. Adelson and Wynn may be big Republican donors, but the Republican Christian right is anti-gambling. Casinos might be mutiplying, but most American voters do not want to think about the morality, say, of serving free alcohol to gamblers. And government rules swathe the sector. Yet the state itself is reaping fat benefits by persuading (mostly poor) people to gamble, via lotteries.The only thing that is clear is that all this ambivalence creates rich pickings for some; and, of course, revenues for the political machine, at a time when billionaires are ever more eager to spend money to influence how the wheel spins in the 2012 election game.gillian.tett@ft.com"
80;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-07-18T05:55:45Z;Wynn Macau second-quarter revenues fall;;Wynn Macau has announced its first decline in quarterly revenue since 2009, blaming slower Chinese economic growth and tougher competition in the Asian gaming hub.The Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts said it posted revenue of $907m in the quarter through June, a 7.1 per cent drop from a year ago.Steve Wynn, chairman of Wynn Macau, who recently revealed plans to build a new $4bn casino in Macau, said he was not worried about the decline and that he remained confident about China’s long-term prospects.“China represents, at least to our family, a more stable environment, even if things are a little edgier than any place else,” said Mr Wynn.He said the main challenge for Wynn Macau was to preserve profit margins amid a “price war” that has seen rivals give more incentives to gamblers and pay higher commissions to junket operators who bring mainland Chinese gamblers to Macau.Wynn Macau is the first gaming operator in the Chinese territory to announce its second-quarter results, which analysts said were in line with expectations.Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were $302m, down 3.9 per cent from a year ago. Net profit rose 83 per cent to $221m mainly because of a $108m charge in the same quarter last year related to the company’s $135m donation to the University of Macau.Shares in Wynn Macau were virtually flat on Wednesday, having fallen 34 per cent since April on signs of a sharp slowdown in gaming revenue growth. Macau’s total gaming revenue grew 7 per cent in May from the previous year while in June it rose 12 per cent, a much lower rate than last year’s 42 per cent annual growth.Analysts said they were concerned about the company’s disclosure that Chinese gamblers were taking longer to pay their debts.“This means that junket operations have less working capital on their hands and so they would be less able to extend credit to the gamblers. The velocity of money in Macau will slow down further and affect casino revenue,” said Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming, a consultancy.Linda Chen, chief operating officer of Wynn Macau, stressed that while debt collection had slowed because of the weaker Chinese economy, the company had seen no increase in bad debt levels.“Instead of taking one month, it might take us two months [to collect debts],” said Ms Chen.
81;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-07-15T15:32:08Z;Manila steps up to Asia’s gaming table;;Macau’s status as Asia’s top casino hub faces its toughest competition from Singapore, but the Philippines also aims to mount a serious challenge and has started to attract foreign investors.Two integrated resorts are slated to open in Manila next year: Belle Grande, owned by a company controlled by Henry Sy, the Philippines’ richest man, and the Solaire Manila complex, owned by Enrique Razon Jr, the country’s third-richest.Plans for a Las Vegas-style strip were unveiled in 2007 but were set back by the 2008 global financial crisis and a review of casino project contracts after Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino became president in 2010.Project sponsors also struggled to sign up globally connected casino operators as strategic partners, raising questions over whether the Manila Bay resorts could attract foreign gamers especially from China, the biggest source of foreign tourists in south-east Asia.In 2010, Belle Corp, the company that owns Belle Grande, tried to strike a deal with Harrah’s Entertainment, but the Las Vegas casino operator declined, worried the market was not big enough for four new resorts.Belle holds one of four licences to operate integrated casino resorts in the Philippine capital. Genting Hong Kong, Japanese billionaire and former Wynn Resorts director Kazuo Okada, and Mr Razon Jr, head of the country’s biggest port operator, have the others.However, an agreement early in July between Belle Corp and Melco Crown Entertainment to develop and run the $1bn Belle Grande could give Manila’s plan a big boost. Melco Crown is a joint venture between Australian billionaire James Packer and Lawrence Ho, son of Macau casino tycoon Stanley Ho.“The involvement of a Macau-based operator …sends a positive message to our main market in China that a name they are familiar with is also operating here,” says Francis Hernando, a vice-president of Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp (Pagcor).The country’s gaming regulator, Pagcor also runs 13 small casinos across the country, including four in Manila, and has also licensed six privately owned casinos.The entry of Melco Crown is also seen as a vote of confidence in the country’s regulatory system in the wake of criticism from Wynn Resorts that “official corruption in the Philippine gaming industry is deeply ingrained.”Cristino Naguiat, Pagcor chairman, estimates that, once all four integrated casino resorts – the other two being Genting’s Resorts World Bayshore and Mr Okada’s Tiger Resorts – are up and running, the Philippines could generate as much as $10bn in gaming revenue by 2016.
82;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-06-05T16:21:10Z;Wynn Macau to spend $4bn on casino resort;;Wynn Macau will spend $4bn on its new casino resort in the former Portuguese colony, a figure considerably higher than analysts’ estimates.Steve Wynn, chairman of the world’s third-largest gaming company by sales, revealed the figure on Tuesday in Macau at the annual shareholder meeting of the Wynn Resorts subsidiary.Mr Wynn denied that costs had spiralled away from initial estimates, saying the final design had more hotel rooms than originally planned. Analysts said initial guidance the company had given for the investment was $2.5bn-$3bn.The Las Vegas mogul has a record of pursuing ambitious projects. He is best known for building the Bellagio and the Mirage in the 1990s – at the time, Las Vegas’s most expensive properties and setting a new standard for audacious style and room prices on the Strip.However, he was forced to sell those and other properties to MGM Grand in 2000 in order to pay off mounting debt.Mr Wynn said the new Macau resort, its first on the Cotai strip, would be financed by a mix of equity, debt and cash flow from Wynn Macau’s existing businesses.He refused to confirm reports that a $1.5bn bank loan had been lined up, saying the group had $2bn in cash and a strong balance sheet that would keep financing costs low.With its latest project, Wynn Macau is hoping to gain ground on rivals in the former Portuguese territory, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal. Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands already has four casino resorts there – three of them in Cotai.But recent signs of slowing growth in Macau gaming revenue and in China’s economy generally have battered shares of Macau gaming stocks including Wynn Macau.Since the beginning of May, shares of Wynn Macau and SJM Holdings, which is controlled by the family of Stanley Ho, have each dropped by about 25 per cent while Mr Adelson’s Sands China has fallen 15 per cent – all outpacing a 13 per cent fall in the Hang Seng index over the same period.Concerns were fuelled last week by data showing that total gaming revenue in Macau grew 7.3 per cent in May, the slowest pace since July 2009, and a Chinese manufacturing report underscoring the flagging mainland economy.Analysts were particularly concerned by indications that so-called VIP gamblers from China – who account for more than 70 per cent of Macau’s gaming revenue – appear to be spending less.“While detailed figures have not been released yet, we believe that the high-roller segment was the most disappointing. Our conversations with junket operators suggest that they have turned more conservative in credit offering, amid near-term economic and political uncertainties,” wrote Gabriel Chan, analyst at Credit Suisse, in a note to clients.Nevertheless, Mr Wynn said his company would not reduce the share of tables allocated to VIP rooms at the new property from the current 60:40 mix. The new casino will have about 500 tables and 2,000 hotel rooms and is expected to be completed in 2016-2017.“A $4bn investment on a VIP-centric property that opens its doors four years from now is a big bet on China’s VIP market and the fact that it will continue its strong growth rate,” said Gary Pinge, regional head of gaming and consumer at Macquarie Securities.Wynn Macau shares rose 1.7 per cent in Hong Kong on Tuesday.Additional reporting by Rahul Jacob in Hong Kong
83;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-05-11T14:22:59Z;Letter from Lex: Spanish indecision;Week starts with France and ends in Spain;The week began with France and Hollande, but by the end it was all about Spain. Markets took François Hollande’s victory in the French presidential elections in their stride, but the same cannot be said of Spanish banks. Ministers and regulators went directly from a state of denial to one of knee-jerk reaction as they partly nationalised Bankia, the country’s third-biggest domestic bank by assets, and asked other banks to set aside additional provisions totalling more than €35bn – on top of the €54bn required in February.In the corporate sector, meanwhile, it was about mooted M&A deals, Japanese giants and US consumers. Fragrance maker Coty stepped up pressure on cosmetics maker Avon with a raised offer of $10.7bn – and Warren Buffett’s backing. Another of the world’s richest men, Carlos Slim, made an opportunistic €3.2bn bid for Dutch telecoms operator KPN through his América Móvil group. Elsewhere, investors scoured Glencore’s first-quarter update for more clues on its planned $90bn “merger of equals” with Xstrata. Others hoped that Deutsche Telekom could reach a deal to solve the problems dogging its T-Mobile USA business, but were sceptical of any partnership with US wireless company MetroPCS.In Japan, household electronics names Sony and Toshiba reported results with the latter better-placed to reach its goals. Carmaker Toyota seems to have put recent setbacks, including a disastrous recall and devastating natural disasters, behind it. In the US, department store Macy’s reported disappointing first-quarter results, although American consumers are still supporting a slow and halting recovery. However, not nearly enough of spenders are making their way to Las Vegas for the liking of casino and hotel operator Wynn Resorts.And finally some good news. Investors have belatedly wakened from their apathetic slumber in the debate over executive pay, with Aviva’s boss the latest to fall foul of rising discontent. Other chief executives had better be on their best behaviour.John Casey, Lex publisher
84;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-05-02T16:49:18Z;Wynn in Macau: bright lights;Bets on gaming resorts in the territory assume that growth will continue;Gamblers don’t really care about their surroundings. The tackiness of earlier Las Vegas developments and now Macau, where the lotus flower-inspired Grand Lisboa casino dominates the skyline, are testament to that. But the authorities, with an eye on diversifying revenues, do care. Macau has just approved a 2,000-room, resort-style development from the habitually elegant Wynn Resorts. This, however, assumes that a Vegas-style shift to all-round entertainment will naturally follow in Asia.So far, so good, admittedly. Gaming income is up by a quarter this year from 2011. Casinos have squeezed more out of their clients too: that jump came from an 8 per cent rise in overnight visitors. New resort-style developments such as Sands’ Cotai Central have added capacity yet hotels are almost 90 per cent full.Shares in Sands China and Wynn Macau – 72 per cent owed by its parent – have outperformed the Hang Seng by more than 100 per cent apiece over the past two years. SJM Holdings, owner of the Grand Lisboa, has outperformed both again by a further 100 percentage points. For Wynn, it is not just the growth but the returns: last year Wynn’s parent produced $1.72 for each dollar of Macanese assets (SJM: $1.4) compared with 36 cents in Vegas.But Macau is not (yet) another Vegas. Three-fifths of hotel guests come from China and most are on brief junkets: stays averaged 1.5 nights last year, compared with 3.7 in Vegas. The casino-resort is still new in Asia, and success in the next few years assumes cultural interest as well as no hiccup in Asia’s growing disposable income.For now, Macau’s careful control of table numbers and the region’s still limited casinos would suggest more gambling growth. The three trade at only 15 times forward earnings. But this new resort phase of Macau’s story is not yet such a clear bet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
86;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-05-02T09:44:40Z;Wynn Macau wins approval for resort;;Las Vegas billionaire Steve Wynn has received approval for his Macau business to proceed with a 51-acre casino resort in the former Portuguese colony in what is a positive sign for other casino properties also awaiting the go-ahead.Wynn Macau, a subsidiary of Wynn Resorts, will invest $3bn in the 1500- to 2000-room hotel and casino project, which analysts say should be completed within four years. Trading in the company’s shares was suspended on Wednesday in Hong Kong ahead of an official announcement.The approval comes as the Macau gambling industry struggles to keep up with demand from wealthy Chinese gamblers and Asian tourists. In 2011, Macau's gambling revenues were $34bn, almost six times the revenues of Las Vegas.Analysts said that the land grant on the Cotai strip of reclaimed land was a good sign for other casino operators such as Galaxy Entertainment Group, Melco Crown and SJM Holdings, which is controlled by the family of Stanley Ho.On Wednesday, government figures showed that gambling revenues for the territory rose 22 per cent in April to $3.13bn, helped by the opening of a second casino last month owned by Sheldon Adelson’s Sands China.Macau is the only place in China where wealthy and middle class Chinese can gamble. Despite concerns among some analysts that the slowing Chinese economy could depress the giddy growth in gambling revenues in Macau, the latest numbers highlight the gaming industry’s resilience.Mr Wynn said the long-awaited land concession paved the way for “what will be the single most important project in the history of Wynn Resorts”.Richard Huang, an analyst with CLSA in Hong Kong, said the approval was a “major positive for all the companies”.It is a signal that the Macau government is also likely to relax its table cap from 5,700 tables as new projects on the Cotai strip get the go-ahead.Hotel occupancy in Macau's key casino properties is running at 96 to 99 per cent, Mr Huang said. During peak hours, he said it was increasingly typical for all of the VIP tables to be occupied and most of the mass market tables to be busy as well.The Macau government was believed to be slowing approvals for new projects because of concerns about labour shortages in the territory. As unemployment fell to 2 per cent, however, the government has relaxed its policy on foreign workers.CLSA said in a research note on Wednesday that given this pent-up demand the market in Macau was strong enough to support multiple openings over the next few years. The brokerage is predicting 8,100 gaming tables by 2020, compared with 5,700 currently.For Wynn Resorts, the approval from the Macau government came as welcome news as the company is engaged in a high-profile legal battle with Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada.In March, Mr Okada took the unusual step of recording a video attacking Mr Wynn, only a day after Mr Okada had filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent the forced redemption of his 20 per cent stake in Wynn Resorts by the company on the grounds that he was an “unsuitable” business partner.Mr Okada said Mr Wynn had deemed him unsuitable because he had questioned a $135m donation made by the US casino group to the University of Macau.
87;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-03-14T13:08:41Z;Las Vegas Sands sued over Macao licence;;Las Vegas Sands, the US gaming company, is being sued by a former business partner in Macao over the way it applied for a licence to operate casinos in the world’s largest gaming market.Asian American Entertainment, a private company registered in Macao, alleged in court filings that LVS, which is controlled by Sheldon Adelson, breached an agreement to jointly bid for a Macao gaming licence. AAE is seeking damages of 3bn patacas ($375m).LVS has not submitted a defence as yet and has two months to do so.The case marks the latest in a series of legal and regulatory challenges facing US casino groups operating in Macao, the former Portuguese colony, which produced more than five times the gaming revenue of Las Vegas last year.In one Nevada court case, LVS is fighting allegations, made by Steve Jacobs, the former chief executive of Sands China the subsidiary that operates the Macao casinos, that he was asked to collect information on senior Macao government officials to help the company “use improper “leverage” on local officials. Mr Jacobs also claims he was ordered to withhold certain sensitive information from the board of Las Vegas Sands. LVS denies all the allegations.Wynn Resorts, the gambling group controlled by Steve Wynn, has its own legal problems to tackle after it was sued by Kazuo Okada, its former vice-chairman, over the alleged mishandling of his investment and a $135m donation to the University of Macau last year. The legal action has prompted the US Securities and Exchange Commission to demand information from both parties.AAE’s allegations are related to events that began in 2001 when Macao said it would open its gaming market to competition and invited applications for gaming concessions to be issued in 2002. Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong gaming magnate, had a monopoly over Macao’s gaming market in the four decades since 1962.According to the English translation of court documents, AAE claims that Marshall Hao, its chairman, suggested to LVS that a casino “similar to the Venice-themed resort that [LVS] owned and operated in Las Vegas” would work in Macao. AAE decided to apply for a Macao casino licence together with LVS because it needed backing by a business with experience in running casinos, the filings said.AAE has accused LVS of terminating the contract unilaterally and entering into a competing agreement with Hong Kong-based Galaxy Entertainment in 2002 and then using research material jointly developed with AAE to submit a separate application for a gaming licence. LVS and Galaxy subsequently dissolved their partnership after they decided to pursue their own plans separately.LVS, which generated half of its 2011 revenue of $9.4bn in Macao, declined to comment on any details of the dispute.Jorge Menezes, the lawyer representing Asia American Entertainment, said that according to his client, one reason for LVS partnering AAE stemmed from the fact that it was unclear whether the Nevada gaming regulator, which oversees casinos in Las Vegas, would allow US casino operators to pursue Macao concessions on their own. Mr Menezes declined to comment on details of the lawsuit.Mr Menezes said AAE filed a breach of contract lawsuit against LVS in a Nevada district court in 2007 but that the case had been dismissed on procedural grounds.Little is known about Mr Hao, who also goes by the name Shi Sheng Hao and has dual Taiwanese and US nationality. He caused controversy in 2008 when he and his family donated more than $250,000 to John McCain, the then Republican presidential candidate, and other US politicians.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles
88;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-03-13T19:47:31Z;Okada ups ante in Wynn dispute;;Kazuo Okada, the Japanese billionaire locked in a dispute with the US casino magnate Steve Wynn, has recorded a 15-minute video attack on his former ally, a day after filing a lawsuit seeking to block the forced redemption of his stake in Wynn Resorts.In the video, published on the website of his Tokyo-based Universal Entertainment group, Mr Okada said Mr Wynn had portrayed him as an “unsuitable” business partner after he questioned a $135m donation made by the US casino group to the University of Macau last year.His understated delivery in Japanese was a rare public statement by the Las Vegas casino tycoon’s low-profile business partner of 12 years.“I have trusted Steve Wynn and I have never scrutinised his activities,” said Mr Okada. “I became suspicious when Steve Wynn suddenly changed his attitude to question Universal’s investment in the Philippines after he had long been supporting it from behind the scenes.“His attitude changed because I became suspicious regarding the purpose and reason for the large donation made to the University of Macau and opposed to it.”Speaking in a subtitled video clip, Mr Okada said it was only last year that Mr Wynn started objecting to his plan to build his own casino in Manila Bay.“Mr Wynn suddenly started saying in board meetings that since the Philippines was corrupt, there must be something inappropriate taking place with Okada’s Philippines project,” he said.Mr Okada said in the video that the bribery charges were made by a “biased” report by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who was commissioned by the Wynn Resorts board.“The Freeh report is based on hearsay, speculation, rumours, unproven allegation and misunderstandings.“It does not take into account any explanation of information from our side since the board never gave us a chance to explain,” Mr Okada said.Wynn Resorts did not respond to the video. But the company did respond to Mr Okada’s counterclaim lawsuit, filed in Nevada on Monday.The lawsuit seeks to block the forced redemption of Mr Okada’s $2.77bn stake in Wynn Resort and accuses Mr Wynn of running the casino group like a “personal fiefdom”.“Despite its enormous length and scurrilous allegations, the Okada response fails to contain any meaningful denial of the facts detailed in the Freeh report,” said Wynn Resorts in a statement.“Wynn Resorts looks forward to having Mr Okada’s actions and the company’s response presented to and adjudicated in court.”The case against Mr Okada comes amid growing concerns among some US companies that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is too unclear.The American Gaming Association, which represents the casino industry, is among the signatories of a letter issued last month by the US Chamber of Commerce to the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission asking for better guidelines.
89;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-03-12T23:01:39Z;Okada sues to stop redemption of Wynn stake;;Kazuo Okada has hit back at Steve Wynn, filing a lawsuit that seeks to block the forced redemption of his $2.77bn stake in Wynn Resorts, accusing his former friend of racketeering and running a “personal fiefdom”.The counter-claim, filed in US federal court in Nevada on Monday, is the latest salvo in a dispute that has pitted the billionaire gaming magnates against each other.The spat exploded last month when Wynn Resorts said it would forcibly redeem the 20 per cent stake in Wynn Resorts held by Mr Okada’s Aruze USA group after accusing him of giving bribes to public officials in the Philippines.Mr Okada has made few public statements over the allegations but struck back on Monday with the lawsuit, alleging that the “purported redemption” is “corrupt and unfair” and not “legally enforceable”.The lawsuit alleges that Mr Wynn and Kim Sinatra, Wynn Resorts’ general counsel, “committed a series of predicate acts of racketeering … and other similarly wrongful activities”.Mr Wynn and Ms Sinatra “executed on a scheme and pattern of racketeering activity, the aim of which was to defraud, defame and steal from … Mr Okada,” the lawsuit alleges. The aim of the alleged scheme was “illegally placing and maintaining the control of Wynn Resorts in a single man – Mr Wynn.”The Wynn Resorts board comes under attack in the lawsuit, with directors of the company accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by backing the redemption on “unconscionable terms”. The board “did not act in a fully informed, good faith and independent manner, and their actions are both contrary to the law and not objectively reasonable,” the lawsuit alleges.Mr Wynn, who declined to comment, and Mr Okada were once firm friends: Mr Okada backed Mr Wynn’s plans to develop new casinos when the Las Vegas billionaire decided to start his own company, after losing control of Mirage Resorts, the company he founded, to Kirk Kerkorian in a takeover battle.Although publicly the relationship between the two men appeared solid – Mr Wynn in 2008 said he loved Mr Okada “as much as any man I’ve ever met in my life” – it recently began to unravel behind the scenes. Mr Okada objected to a $135m donation made by Wynn Resorts to a university in Macao – where Wynn Resorts operates a lucrative casino resort – and the two clashed over access to financial records.More recently, the Wynn Resorts board released an investigation by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, into the corruption allegations against Mr Okada.The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the bribery and corruption allegations. It has also launched a probe into allegations Mr Okada made in an earlier lawsuit against the company about the $135m donation to the Macao university.
90;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-03-02T20:27:19Z;Casino operators vie for Asian jackpot;;The bitter feud between Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas mogul, and his former ally Kazuo Okada has cast fresh light on how casinos are looking beyond Macao and Singapore for new growth in Asia.Wynn Resorts recently seized Mr Okada’s 20 per cent stake in the company, which runs casinos in Las Vegas and Macao, after accusing the Japanese gaming tycoon of bribing regulators in the Philippines and South Korea. Mr Okada denies the allegations.While South Korea and the Philippines have small gaming markets, casino operators hope to repeat the success they have had in Macao and Singapore. After overtaking Las Vegas in 2006, Macao now generates about six times more gaming revenues than the Nevada gambling haven.Singapore has shown even more dramatic growth since legalising gambling in 2009. Its two casinos – Sheldon Adelson’s Marina Bay Sands and Genting’s Resorts World Sentosa – had combined revenues of $6bn in 2011, putting the city neck and neck with Las Vegas, which has welcomed gamblers since the 1940s. Mr Adelson was cited by Bloomberg last year as saying Singapore had transformed the way casinos viewed Asia.“Singapore for us has opened up a new market for south-east Asia that most people did not understand existed,” he said. “For the youngest person in this audience, for the rest of their life, there will never be a saturation of the potential market in this part of the world.”Export-dependent countries such as Japan and Taiwan, which have kept out casinos to avoid unsavoury social problems, are now looking at Singapore with envy. Gary Pinge, an analyst at Macquarie, says Asian regulators are paying more attention to Singapore – and not the bigger Chinese territory of Macao – as it has showed that the industry can coexist with tight government control.Mr Okada, a 69-year old billionaire who made his fortune making pachinko machines – a cross between pinball and slot machines, which are popular in Japan – is now eying the Philippines. He plans to open his first self-branded casino resort in 2014, and boasts of turning Manila Bay into a “world-class entertainment, luxury shopping and prime gaming destination” with the $2bn investment.While Wynn Resorts accuses Mr Okada of courting Filipino gaming officials with lavish overseas trips and gifts, it and rival Las Vegas Sands say they have no interest in the Philippines.Aaron Fischer, head of consumer research at Asian brokerage CLSA, says Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing are the ideal places for casinos because mainland China makes up the bulk of Asia’s gaming demand. But there is no sign of these markets opening up soon.In the meantime, Mr Fischer adds, “major listed casino operators would be more comfortable investing in the more politically stable, mature economies like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan”.Mr Okada is looking to do just that. He plans to invest $4bn in a large casino resort in South Korea, which only has state-owned casinos at the moment – a move that industry experts say will pose a threat to western operators.Mr Adelson visited the South Korean city of Busan last week to study the potential for integrated resorts. But he and most foreign operators are waiting for Seoul to relax restrictions that, for example, ban locals from all but one remote casino.Mr Fischer says Japan remains the “holy grail”. A group of 150 Japanese politicians this month resurrected an effort to push through legislation to legalise casinos, which has been previously opposed by anti-gambling legislators on social and moral grounds.But a Japanese gaming consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it would take at least 18 months to enact legislation. When they are built, however, Mr Fischer expects Japan’s first casinos to generate more than $10bn in their first two years.“As an indication of Japan’s appetite for gambling, there are 12,000 pachinko halls and 5m slot machines in the country today. That’s five out of eight slot machines in the world,” he says.Most foreign operators refuse to discuss plans for Japan, but they are engaging in furious lobbying, according to casino executives. Mr Adelson also visited Tokyo last week where he told a conference that Japan would benefit from Singapore-style casino resorts.Taiwan is also seen as a potentially lucrative market after the government passed laws for casinos to be built on three islands located in the Taiwan Strait near mainland China. But there has been little progress since the people on one of the islands vetoed plans for the first casino in a 2009 referendum.But for now, the emerging market that has attracted a lot of interest from foreign casino operators is Vietnam. Stanley Ho, the ailing Hong Kong tycoon who was at the centre of a public feud over his vast gaming empire last year, has run casinos there for about two decades.Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International has also agreed to manage a property that is being built at a new beach resort 130km south-east of Ho Chi Minh City. Las Vegas Sands also plans a similar project in Ho Chi Minh City but has not released a timetable.See Lex
91;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Rich pickings to play for;With Asia’s casino revenues these days outstripping those of Las Vegas, a bust-up at a group that spans Nevada and Macao highlights cultural differences as well as the big sums that are involved;The Okada restaurant at the Wynn casino in Las Vegas is renowned as one of the finest dining establishments in a city fast becoming the culinary capital of the US. Its website boasts that the menu, which includes the Rainbow Roll (snow crab, cucumber, avocado and assorted sashimi) and Beef Tenderloin Robatayaki (cipollini onions and yakitori sauce), represents “Japanese cuisine elevated to an art form”.How much longer the restaurant will trade under the Okada name is unclear, after a week that has laid bare simmering tensions between Steve Wynn, the casino magnate who founded Wynn Resorts, and Kazuo Okada, the Japanese billionaire who invested alongside him.Wynn Resorts, which operates casinos in Las Vegas and Macao, has accused Mr Okada, who until this week owned a 20 per cent stake in the company, of giving bribes to international gaming regulators. The group has seized his stake, for which it will pay Mr Okada $1.9bn in 10 years, representing a 30 per cent discount to its market value. The action followed an independent report by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which made the corruption allegations against Mr Okada. The claims were the subject of a court filing by the company in the Nevada district court on Tuesday.Mr Okada has denied breaking any laws. A representative said this week that the accusations levelled against him were “motivated by self-interest and represent the results of an incomplete and otherwise flawed corporate governance process”.The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the bribery and corruption allegations. It has also launched a probe into allegations Mr Okada has made in a lawsuit against the company about a $135m donation by a Wynn subsidiary to a university in Macao. He is seeking to block the seizure of his stake by applying for a temporary injunction.On Friday Wynn Macau, the group’s Hong Kong listed subsidiary, removed Mr Okada from its board.The unfolding saga and the tensions between Mr Wynn and the man of whom he once said, “I love Kazuo Okada as much as any man that I’ve ever met in my life”, underscore the shift in the industry’s centre of gravity from Las Vegas to Asia. Led by Macao, the former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong, a new and highly lucrative frontier has opened in that continent for US companies such as Wynn and Las Vegas Sands.Asian casinos are in line to generate total revenues of $58bn this year, according to estimates by PwC, the consultancy. Most of that will come from Macao, where revenues have soared by more than 30 per cent a year and are forecast to reach $44bn in 2012 – far outstripping Las Vegas, where gaming spending has slid to about $6bn since the financial crisis.Casinos in Singapore, which is not exactly known for excess and extravagance, are on the verge of overtaking Las Vegas and are estimated to have pulled in about $6bn in revenue in 2011 just two years after they opened. This has boosted the coffers of Las Vegas Sands, the only US operator with a casino in that country, and further enriched Sheldon Adelson, its billionaire chief executive, who is bankrolling the super-political action committee supporting Newt Gingrich’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.Mr Adelson and Mr Wynn have led the Asian expansion by Las Vegas groups. They were once bitter rivals, with Mr Wynn, who prides himself on his luxury properties, accusing Mr Adelson of running a “Walmart-style operation”. Their spat was played out in the pages of Las Vegas newspapers, yet the two have since patched things up, according to people close to them.They remain outsize personalities in an industry not lacking in colourful characters. Mr Adelson, who has a net worth of about $25bn, told Forbes magazine recently that he “might give $10m or $100m” to ensure Mr Gingrich wins the Republican nomination. Mr Wynn has appeared in television commercials for his Las Vegas Encore property apparently sitting on the edge of its roof some 48 floors up. He was friendly with the singers Michael Jackson and Frank Sinatra – he named one of his restaurants Sinatra at Encore in honour of the star – and once put an elbow through Le Rêve, the Picasso painting he was due to sell for $131m (the picture was repaired but the sale was cancelled).He is revered in the gaming industry for ushering in the era of the vast resort casino and his meticulous attention to detail. He opened the first 3,000-room hotel in Las Vegas (The Mirage) and turned the nearby Bellagio into a must-see attraction thanks to its dancing fountains, which shoot jets of water into the air in time to classical and pop favourites.“He concentrates on achieving excellence and is fastidious in his approach,” says Warwick Bartlett, chief executive of Global Gaming and Betting Consultants, an Isle of Man-based adviser on the industry. “He put a Ferrari showroom in the Wynn [hotel] in Las Vegas and no one thought it would work, but it now sells more Ferraris than anywhere else …he’s a pathfinder.”Mr Okada is a different kind of pathfinder, having made his fortune in Japan making pachinko machines. Pachinko, a hybrid arcade-style gambling game, is a popular pastime in Japan that nonetheless occupies a legal grey zone. Playing is lawful – flashy parlours can be found near any rail station or shopping arcade – but collecting money after a successful game is a violation of anti-gambling statutes. To get around these, parlours hand out token prizes that players trade for cash in back-alley kiosks – a fig leaf that has kept police and politicians looking the other way.Pachinko is certainly lucrative but Mr Okada has of late had his eye on richer pickings: developing a casino in the Philippines. Less than a month ago, he was looking triumphant at the groundbreaking ceremony for his $2bn Manila Bay Resorts project – the first casino the 69-year-old has built on his own.But his dream of turning his Aruze group into a global casino operator is at risk after Wynn Resorts accused him of infringing the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by hosting Filipino gaming regulators in $6,000-a-night suites and plying them with gifts and expensive meals. The report prepared by Freeh, Sporkin and Sullivan, the law firm run by Mr Freeh, alleges that the wife of one regulator received a Chanel bag.In the report, Wynn Resorts board members allege that Mr Okada spoke of needing to “follow the local culture” by giving gifts to government officials. The law firm interviewed all members of the Wynn Resorts board who were present at a meeting in February 2011. The report alleges that one board member “recalled Mr Okada stating that conducting business in the Philippines was all a matter of ‘hiring the right people’ to pay other people”, while another director remembered him “being ‘adamant’ during the FCPA discussion that it is not corrupt to give ‘gifts’ ”.“This report is in the heartland of the kind of allegations that have caused the [US] Department of Justice and the SEC to launch investigations,” says David Schindler at Latham & Watkins, another law firm.The rift between Mr Wynn and Mr Okada, who both declined requests by the Financial Times for comment, highlights the cultural risks that surround the expansion by western groups into countries where bribes to officials and regulators may be more socially accepted. “I’ve been involved in dozens of cases in Asia where people say that in order to do business in these jurisdictions you have to pay bribes,” says Mr Schindler.The danger for casino operators is that by adhering to anti-bribery laws from their home countries, they risk falling behind competitors in a region that is the world’s fastest-growing gaming market. “Companies from the US and UK, which have rigid bribery laws, risk being locked out of deals in Asia,” says Mr Bartlett.Yet students of Las Vegas history know US casino gaming has long suffered from its own problems with corruption and bribery. Organised crime got its hooks into Las Vegas the moment the gangster Bugsy Siegel drove there from Los Angeles in 1942 and decided the dusty desert town had potential as a tourist destination. Over the next three decades a succession of Mafia-related interests controlled several casinos in Las Vegas, their ownership often concealed from the authorities.When Mr Wynn visited as a boy in the 1950s, many of the city’s casinos were under the influence of organised crime. But by the late 1970s – the time of his ascendancy in Las Vegas – Wall Street firms and institutional money had replaced the Mob.Junk bonds financed Mr Wynn’s plans and a new generation of resort casinos was born: vast gaming palaces such as The Mirage and Bellagio, with thousands of rooms, luxury restaurants and top-class entertainment.As destinations including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and even Sri Lanka consider opening their gaming markets and offering casino licences, Mr Wynn and his rivals are waiting to pounce. But like every good gambler they will be aware that, besides the enticing rewards to play for, different cultural perceptions mean there are also significant risks.Additional reporting by Roger Blitz in London and Jonathan Soble in Tokyo
92;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-02-24T20:02:08Z;Okada blames ‘false’ claims for Wynn removal;;Kazuo Okada, the Japanese billionaire, has blamed “false and misleading assertions” for his removal from the board of Wynn Resorts’ highly successful Macao subsidiary.Mr Okada is embroiled in a dispute with Steve Wynn, his former friend with whom he founded the Las Vegas-based casino group.This week, Wynn Resorts seized Mr Okada’s 20 per cent stake in the company after alleging that he made at least $110,000 in unauthorised payments to two gaming officials in the Philippines, where he is seeking to build a casino resort of his own.In an earlier dispute, Mr Okada filed a lawsuit last month challenging a $135m donation Wynn Macau made to a university in the Chinese-administered territory, which ranks as the world’s largest gaming market.Last week, Wynn Resorts disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched a preliminary inquiry into Mr Okada’s allegations. The US market regulator is also investigating counter-claims made by Mr Wynn against the Japanese businessman.Mr Okada was voted off Wynn Macau’s board at a meeting on Friday. “Taking into account the company’s high ethical standards, the board determined that it was obligated to remove Mr Okada as a non-executive director given the unacceptable conduct by Mr Okada,” the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.In a letter Mr Okada sent to his fellow board members ahead of the meeting, which he did not attend, he said the vote’s result was “predetermined and …my attendance at the meeting would be futile”.However, a spokesman for Wynn Resorts said on Friday night that no member of the Wynn Macau board had received Mr Okada’s letter.Wynn Resorts’ claims were made in a lawsuit filed on February 19 and are based on an internal inquiry conducted by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr Okada denies breaking any laws.Wynn Resorts’ board unilaterally seized Mr Okada’s 20 per cent stake in the company for $1.9bn or a 30 per cent discount to its market value – a move that Mr Okada hopes to block.A person familiar with the matter said he planned to apply for a temporary injunction, though no application has yet been made with the courts.Wynn Resorts also requested that Mr Okada resign from its board. Under US law, removing him from the parent company requires a shareholder voteThe company argues that inside knowledge of the casino business helped Mr Okada obtain a licence to build the competing property in the Philippines.Additional reporting by Enid Tsui in Hong Kong
93;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-02-24T00:33:15Z;US probes Wynn Resorts’ allegations;;US authorities are investigating Wynn Resorts’ allegation that Kazuo Okada, a co-founder and director of the casino company, violated anti-bribery laws by allegedly making unauthorised payments to Philippine regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.The preliminary investigation comes as Wynn Macau holds an emergency board meeting on Friday afternoon in Macao to discuss the removal of Mr Okada as a director, according to two people familiar with the situation, and as Steve Wynn moves to sever ties with his long-term business partner and co-founder of his casino empire.The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s investigation is looking into allegations that Mr Okada made at least $110,000 in unauthorised payments to two gaming officials in the Philippines, where he is building a casino resort of his own, according to a person familiar with the matter.The allegations were made in a lawsuit Wynn Resorts filed Sunday against Mr Okada and are based on a three-month internal investigation conducted by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Some of the money was allegedly used to buy a Chanel bag for the wife of one of the regulators. Mr Okada has denied breaking any laws.Last week, Wynn disclosed that the SEC had launched a preliminary inquiry into allegations Mr Okada made in a lawsuit he filed last month against the company concerning a $135m donation a Wynn subsidiary made to the University of Macau.On Wednesday, Wynn’s attorney, Debra Yang, a partner with Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and former US attorney for the Los Angeles area, flew to Washington and met with criminal prosecutors at the Department of Justice, according to another person familiar with the matter. It wasn’t clear whether the DoJ was also investigating.The SEC and DoJ often work closely on cases involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibit US companies or their agents from paying bribes to government officials to win or retain business.The SEC and DoJ declined to comment.Wynn Resorts, which operates several casinos in Las Vegas and Macao, has been rocked by the acrimonious dispute between the company founders and former friends. The group this week requested that Mr Okada resign.At the board meeting Friday, the other board members of Wynn Macau could unilaterally vote against Mr Okada’s continued presence on the nine-person board under Hong Kong’s listing rules, according to people familiar with the situation, but it would require a shareholder vote to remove Mr Okada from the board of US parent Wynn Resorts, they said.The Wynn board last weekend unilaterally redeemed Mr Okada’s 20 per cent stake in Wynn Resorts for $1.9bn, or a 30 per cent discount to its market value – a move that Mr Okada is trying to block by applying for a temporary injunction.The two sides are facing a lengthy battle on top of investigations by regulators into certain charges they have laid out against each other.Mr Okada last month sued Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas, accusing the company of refusing him access to its financial records and questioning the $135m donation to the University of Macau. Mr Okada could not be reached for comment. Wynn Resorts declined to comment.The removal of Mr Okada from both boards would distance him from the running of one of the world’s most successful casino groups. The company argues that such inside knowledge of the casino business helped Mr Okada obtain a licence to build a competing property in the Philippines.
94;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-02-22T18:59:03Z;Wynn raises the stakes in Las Vegas;Tussle with Okada casts a poor light on Nevada’s corporate law;"There isn’t much moral high ground in Las Vegas and Steve Wynn failed to take it this week.Mr Wynn, who pioneered Vegas’s rise from tawdriness to a luxury family resort – and then extended his empire to Macau– spent the weekend not only accusing his former business partner of bribing foreign officials but seizing his $2.5bn stake in Wynn Resorts at a substantial discount. By the time Kazuo Okada woke up on Sunday, his equity had vanished.The Wynn-Okada tussle is an enthralling battle of wills between two hardened Vegas gamblers. It is also a sad reflection of the lack of investors’ rights in Nevada, which takes to deliberate extremes the US tendency to place the interests of corporate directors above those of their shareholders. The irony is that the 70-year-old Mr Wynn may yet be hoist by his own – and his adopted state’s – legal petard.Mr Okada, accused by Wynn Resorts of greasing palms to smooth the construction of a $2.3bn casino complex in Manila, remains a director of the company. Mr Wynn found it easy enough to dump him as a fellow shareholder but showing that he breached his duties as a director will be tougher, for which Mr Wynn is to blame.It is a shame that he muddied things in how he chose to strike against Mr Okada, a former slot machine operator with whom Mr Wynn partnered when plotting a return from the hostile takeover of his Mirage Resorts by Kirk Kerkorian in 2000. If he had been fairer, he could have enhanced his reputation.As it is, instead of looking like a crusader against corruption in Asian gambling – of which there is plenty – Mr Wynn comes across as a brutal infighter who neatly outwitted an inconvenient rival. His stake in Wynn Resorts increased, together with the share price, but his moral authority was diluted.Mr Okada has serious questions to answer. An internal investigation by Louis Freeh, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, alleged that he and his associates had made $110,000 in cash payments and gifts to foreign regulators. Mr Okada denies misconduct, describing the accusations as “outrageous”.The trouble is that Wynn Resorts’ board – on which Mr Wynn and his former wife Elaine sit – ruled on the matter itself. Rather than waiting for Nevada’s regulators to assess the allegations against Mr Okada, it took things into its own hands. It seized his stake at 31 per cent below the share price, offering to compensate him in cash (plus 2 per cent interest) a decade from now.The board says it had no choice but to act promptly given the seriousness of the allegations. If Mr Okada has breached the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars US corporations from paying bribes to gain business overseas, it would have been in danger of losing its licences. It also says the terms of the share repurchase were dictated by its articles of incorporation.Perhaps, but that’s because Mr Wynn devised them, as well as insisting on Mr Okada signing over his voting rights and barring him from selling his stake without Mr Wynn’s approval. When battle was joined, the board decided (with a rubber stamp from Moelis & Co, the investment bank) to discount this illiquid, non-voting block.In most places, it would rightly be illegal for a board to confiscate the property of a shareholder of whom it doesn’t approve in such a manner. But this is Nevada and these are the deeds of Wynn Resorts, drafted and signed by Mr Wynn in 2002.Having suffered one takeover, Mr Wynn did his best with his new company to minimise the chances of ever having his authority challenged again. As well as arrogating voting rights, he specified that its directors’ liability “shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted” by Nevada law.That is very full indeed, since Nevada has one of the laxest corporate statutes in the US, heavily favouring directors’ rights over those of shareholders. Michal Barzuza, a law professor at Virginia University, describes the state as a “no-liability corporate safe haven”, which “allows officer and directors to avoid liabilities that are almost axiomatic in corporate law”.Nevada’s regime is no accident, since it set out to compete with Delaware, where most US companies incorporate, by being more laissez faire. Its biggest sop to directors is to absolve them of their duty of loyalty to the company, providing that they are not guilty of intentional misconduct or fraud and have not knowingly violated the law.It provides intriguing possibilities in this case, since Wynn Resorts itself says that Mr Okada failed to attend FCPA training or to sign the corporate code of conduct. It also claims that he told other directors that he saw nothing wrong in giving hospitality to regulators in Asia, where it was accepted practice. (The company reports that Mr Okada later denied saying this.)Even on the company’s version of events, Mr Okada could argue that he was not knowingly guilty of anything and thus did not breach his duties as a director in Nevada. Mr Wynn would then find it hard to push him off the board; since his voting stake has gone, it cannot be wielded against him.The Wynn affair casts a poor light on Nevada’s corporate law and the ability of a board – led by a powerful and well-connected Las Vegas mogul – to crush an awkward shareholder. It also tarnishes the US practice of encouraging states to “race to the bottom” in allowing companies to curb investors’ rights.A tussle over whether Mr Okada remains a director may be beside the point since his equity has been cashed. But it provides a chance for Nevada’s courts to show that they don’t just obey Mr Wynn."
95;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-02-22T00:52:28Z;Okada raises the stakes in Wynn battle;;Kazuo Okada, the Japanese billionaire at the centre of a dispute with Wynn Resorts, is seeking a restraining order against its board to prevent it from redeeming his 20 per cent stake in the company, which operates casinos in Las Vegas and Macao.Wynn Resorts has filed a lawsuit against Mr Okada, a director and co-founder of the company, accusing him of “improper acts” and trying “to convert Wynn Resorts assets for his own benefit”. But people familiar with the situation said Mr Okada would respond with his own lawsuit.Universal Entertainment, the company he controls, said in a statement that Wynn’s actions were “motivated by self-interest and represent the results of an incomplete and otherwise flawed corporate governance process”.As the barbs between the two sides intensified, Bob Miller, the former governor of Nevada who now sits on the Wynn board, said during a press conference call that the company had concluded that Mr Okada was “unsuitable” and “posed an ongoing risk” to Wynn Resorts following an investigation into Mr Okada’s alleged attempts to develop a casino in the Philippines.Mr Miller said Wynn’s gaming licenses “would be put under a cloud” were it not to take action against Mr Okada. Mr Miller added that “it would potentially jeopardise not only our existing licenses, but clearly could be utilised as a sign or our unsuitability for prospective licenses in any other jurisdiction”.Wynn plans to redeem the Japanese tycoon’s stake at a steep discount over a decade, alleging in court papers that the former friend of Steve Wynn, its founder, made unauthorised payments to gaming regulators and violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.In a lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in district court in Nevada, Wynn alleged that Mr Okada pressed ahead with plans to create a casino in Manila Bay in the Philippines in spite of the company’s objections.“Many doors opened for Okada in the Philippines due to his well publicised relationship with … Wynn Resorts,” the company alleged in the filing.Mr Okada “touted his relationship with and affiliation” with the company “to convince others” that Wynn supported his plan.In the lawsuit, Wynn said that it commissioned an “independent investigation” of the gaming industry in the Philippines and decided against investing in the country. The company alleged that Mr Okada was “undeterred” and arranged for Mr Wynn to meet Benigno Aquino, the president of the Philippines, and was “embarrassed and angry” at having to cancel the arrangements.Mr Okada’s Tokyo-listed gaming group, fell by more than 20 per cent on Monday after news about the redemption of his stake in Wynn. The shares seemed to have hit a floor on Tuesday, falling 0.3 per cent.Mr Okada sued Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas last month, alleging that the company was blocking his efforts to gain access to its financial records after he questioned gifts made by the company to the university. That prompted the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week to open an inquiry into those donations.

Apple, which accounts for more than a 10th of the index’s market capitalisation, gained 2.5 per cent to $514.85, as it threatened legal action against ProView of Taiwan, in a long-running dispute over use of the iPad name in China.Although tech stocks make up 20 per cent of the S&P 500, and Apple shares have gained 25 per cent this year, Morgan Stanley analysts said the sector’s outperformance could continue.“Mega-cap technology stocks look extremely attractively valued against mega-cap stocks in other sectors,” Adam Parker, the investment bank’s chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note.Wynn Resorts climbed 6 per cent to $119.40 as investors responded enthusiastically to the board’s move to forcibly buy out the stake of Kazuo Okada, a Japanese billionaire, who is alleged to have made unauthorised payments to gambling regulators.While most of the share price move appeared to stem from hopes that the long-running boardroom feud may soon be over, Jon Oh at CLSA securities also said the terms of the forced buy-out were favourable to shareholders.Macy’s shares were up 1.2 per cent at $36.69, after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for the department store chain climbed by 12 per cent.Bank investors appeared to take heart from the Greek bail-out deal, with Morgan Stanley up 0.5 per cent to $19.26 and Citigroup climbing 1.3 per cent to $33.36.Bank of America rose 1.1 per cent to $8.11, rallying again, after shares suffered their first weekly fall of 2012 last week.Shares in the CME Group, the largest US exchange group by market capitalisation, slipped 1.3 per cent to $290.08 as Alex Kramm at UBS removed the stock from his “top pick’s” list after a rally, which has seen shares gain more than 20 per cent by the end of last week.Gas exploration and production companies were hit as US natural gas futures fell on Tuesday, having reached February highs last week.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 1.7 per cent to $36.01, as a joint venture with Williams Partners to build a pipeline from the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania to New York failed to generate enthusiasm.
97;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-02-20T23:47:58Z;Universal Entertainment shares plummet;;Universal Entertainment, the Japanese gaming group, had more than Y32bn wiped off its stock market value as investors reacted to an acrimonious dispute between Kazuo Okada, its founder, and Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas-based gaming magnate.The two men, once firm friends – and fellow shareholders and directors of Wynn Resorts, which operates casinos in Las Vegas and Macau– have fallen out in spectacular style.According to a person close to the situation, the dispute is likely to intensify on Tuesday when Wynn Resorts is expected to file a lawsuit in Nevada District Court, Clark County, that details alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by Mr Okada and other “related offences”.Wynn Resorts has requested the resignation of Mr Okada from its board and redeemed his 20 per cent stake in the group at a 30 per cent discount to its trading price, alleging that he violated US anti-corruption laws by making unauthorised payments to gambling regulators.The company has issued a 10-year $1.9bn promissory note in redemption of the shares, which pays a two per cent annual interest rate. Mr Okada’s stake at the current trading price is worth $2.77bn.Mr Okada, who made his fortune on pachinko machines, hit back over the weekend, accusing Wynn Resorts of acting like “a Star Chamber and not like a board of a publicly traded company, protecting the interests of its stockholders”.“The decision by the Wynn Board, which followed a rushed investigation that lacks absolute findings, to redeem Universal Entertainment’s nearly 20 per cent holdings in Wynn Resorts based on its project in the Philippines is outrageous,” Universal Entertainment said.Wynn Resorts’ move was prompted by an internal investigation into Mr Okada allegedly detailing “numerous apparent violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act” by Azure USA, the parent company of Universal Entertainment.The company’s probe was led by Louis Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and allegedly uncovered cash payments and gifts worth approximately $100,000 to “foreign gaming regulators”.Universal Entertainment said it had “not even been provided with the opportunity to review the Freeh Report,” adding it was “more evident than ever” that additional independent oversight was needed on the Wynn Resorts board.“Universal Entertainment will take all legal actions necessary to protect its investment and prevent a forced redemption of its shares,” it said.Mr Okada and Mr Wynn were once close: the upscale sushi restaurant at one of Mr Wynn’s Las Vegas properties was named after Mr Okada, in tribute to his then friend. Mr Wynn said in 2008 that he loved Mr Okada “as much as any man I’ve ever met in my life”.But simmering tensions exploded last month when Mr Okada filed a lawsuit in Clark County District Court, alleging that he had been prevented by Mr Wynn from seeing Wynn Resorts’s financial records. Mr Okada had objected to a $135m donation made by the company to a university in Macau.Universal Entertainment’s Jasdaq-listed shares closed 21 per cent lower at 1,516 yen on Monday, valuing the group at 121.6bn yen.
98;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-02-20T19:49:25Z;Wynn Resorts: Chinese roulette?;A row between the founders of the casino group is dwarfed by fears over China;This isn’t baccarat. It’s mud-wrestling. Steve Wynn, chairman of Wynn Resorts, and Kazuo Okada, boss of Universal Entertainment, were once friends. They have made piles of money together opening casinos in Las Vegas and Macao. Mr Okada owns (or perhaps owned) a fifth of Wynn Resorts shares. But because of a disagreement over Mr Okada’s plans to build a gambling resort in the Philippines, thereby becoming a regional competitor, accusations of misconduct are flying back and forth. The Wynn Resorts board has voted to redeem Mr Okada’s stake at 30 per cent below the current share price, over a 10-year period.If Mr Okada can be forced to accept these terms, Wynn Resorts shareholders will be delighted. They become the beneficiaries of a very cheap share buy-back. But there will be a long legal wrangle, or a pricier settlement, before the last mud is slung. Wynn’s management has, at least, successfully set the terms of the dispute. The fight is, for now, about whether Mr Okada must accept a discount, not whether he can demand a premium. Well played.But should the conflict make smaller investors in Wynn Resorts nervous? If the prospect of bare knuckled business practices makes any of them jumpy, it is curious that they put their money to work in the casino industry. And if they are inclined to think about risks, they should think about business fundamentals first.Wynn is a very well-run company that has outperformed rivals Las Vegas Sands and MGM by 80 per cent and 120 per cent respectively over five years. But it is a concentrated play on China, which was the source of almost four-fifths of profit in the last quarter. That dependence will rise as it has another mega-hotel planned in Macao. A Chinese slowdown will turn the fuss over Mr Okada into a distant – even pleasant – memory.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
99;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-02-20T09:16:27Z;Wynn Resorts seeks founder’s resignation;;Wynn Resorts has requested the resignation of Kazuo Okada from its board and redeemed his stake in the company, bringing to a head the long-simmering dispute between Mr Okada and Steve Wynn, his co-founder at the hotel and casino operator.Wynn Resorts’ move follows an internal investigation alleged to have revealed payments from Mr Okada to foreign gaming regulators in apparent violation of US anti-corruption laws.Led by Louis Freeh, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation director, the inquiry found that Mr Okada and his associates had apparently violated US anti-corruption laws over three years, including giving cash payments and gifts totalling $110,000 to overseas regulators. Based on the report, the Wynn board deemed Mr Okada “unsuitable”.Mr Okada was Wynn Resorts’ largest shareholder through Aruze USA, the American unit of Universal Entertainment, the Japanese gaming group in which he owns a majority stake. His 20 per cent stake in Wynn was worth about $2.77bn.But on Saturday, Wynn Resorts unilaterally redeemed the 24m shares held by Aruze, citing provisions in the company’s articles of incorporation that concern a finding of “unsuitability”. Wynn will pay Mr Okada $1.9bn for the shares in 10 years, representing a 30 per cent discount to their market value. The final payment may be more, as the promissory note for the redemption bears an annual interest rate of 2 per cent.Shares of Wynn Macau, the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, rose 3 per cent on Monday. Analysts said that stock in the casino group would be worth a lot more if the buy-back were to go ahead, although it was unlikely that Mr Okada would accept the board’s decision without a fight.Universal Entertainment shares fell 21 per cent on Monday in Tokyo. The company issued a statement late on Sunday saying it had not had a chance to review the Freeh report but calling the redemption of Mr Okada’s shares “outrageous”.“Universal Entertainment will take all legal actions necessary to protect its investment and prevent a forced redemption of its shares,” it said.The action is the most dramatic development yet in a dispute between Mr Okada and Mr Wynn, his long-time business partner. The rift is tied to Mr Wynn’s 2010 divorce from his wife, Elaine, which left him with about 9 per cent of the company bearing his name, while Mr Okada had more than twice that.Since then, Mr Okada has pursued his own plans through Universal Entertainment to develop a casino in the Philippines, putting the group in competition with Wynn Resorts.Mr Okada sued Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas last month, claiming that the company was blocking him from accessing its financial records after he questioned gifts made by the company to a university in Macao. That prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission last week to open an inquiry into those donations.Mr Freeh’s report was the culmination of a year-long investigation and found that Mr Okada had apparently violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making payments to two chief gaming regulators at the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, which oversees Mr Okada’s licence to operate in that country. Sources close to the situation said that Mr Freeh concluded his investigation after interviewing Mr Okada last week.Robert Miller, a former Nevada governor and chairman of Wynn Resorts’ compliance committee, said the board was “deeply disturbed by the behaviour of Mr Okada”.Wynn Resorts said it would also recommend that Mr Okada be removed from the board of Wynn Macau, its Hong Kong-listed subsidiary. It also said it had filed a lawsuit against Mr Okada and Universal Entertainment for “breach of fiduciary duty and related offences”.Mr Okada could not be reached for comment.Additional reporting by Enid Tsui in Hong Kong

Its shares slipped 2.5 per cent to $105.25.Tesorolast week attributed falling margins at Californian refineries to the narrowing spread between WTI and Brent crude but Chevron blamed a wider fall in demand for petrol and overstocked supplies.“The rise in the price of crude has been a result of fear about supply from Iran and Nigeria rather than increased demand,” said Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer. “That means petrol price rises have not kept up with crude price rises, and refiners are taking the hit.”ExxonMobil fell as much as 1.7 per cent but recovered to end the day down 0.4 per cent to $84.74. The two large energy stocks had weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, though the blue-chip index recovered to end the day up 0.2 per cent to 12,471.02.Elsewhere, US stocks inched up, with the S&P 500 closing 0.2 per cent higher at 1,295.5, now up 2.8 per cent for the year, and off to its best start since 2006. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.5 per cent to 2,724.7.December US retail sales disappointed, coming in just 0.1 per cent higher, or 0.2 per cent lower once car sales are stripped out. That halted a run of better than expected US economic data.“Although we’re bullish on equities for the year, we think the S&P 500 will have to take a leg down first as the realisation dawns that talk of the US decoupling from Europe and Asia is simply untrue,” said James Dailey, chief investment officer at Team Financial Managers.But energy stocks were the worst performers in the S&P 500 as the price of natural gas fell to a multiyear low of $2.72 per mbtu. That pushed explorers down with Cabot Oil & Gas off 3.6 per cent to $67.15, though the group said it was earning as much as $4 per mbtu of gas from production in the Marcellus Shale.Oil and gas field services companies were hurt, with Baker Hughes falling 3.8 per cent to $48.29.Dick’s Sporting Goods rose 11.1 per cent to $40.43 as the company said it would buy back $200m of its shares and maintained full-year guidance in an earnings update.David Strasser, a retail analyst at Janney, maintained his “buy” rating on Dick’s, telling clients the company had weathered its seasonally toughest quarter of the year.Bank of America topped $7 for the first time since October in the morning session, before slipping back to $6.79, a fall of 1.2 per cent. Citigroup was up 1 per cent to $31.60 and JPMorgan climbed 0.5 per cent to $36.85 ahead of earnings on Friday.Investment banks were subdued except for Jefferies, which broke above $15 for the first time since September, before closing 6 per cent up at $15.42. Questions about Jefferies’ exposure to eurozone sovereign debt had pushed its shares below $10 towards the end of 2011.Morgan Stanley climbed 0.4 per cent to $17.17 as Credit Suisse analysts estimated the market value of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage – which is 51 per cent owned by Morgan Stanley – at $15bn, a 30 per cent discount to the market value when the joint venture was launched.Morgan Stanley has the right to purchase another 14 per cent of the company in May, which Howard Chen at Credit Suisse said would “ultimately” make “strategic sense” despite Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s valuation fall.Separately, Moshe Orenbuch at Credit Suisse tipped commercial banks to outperform investment banks when fourth-quarter earnings are unveiled. “While we expect a more revenue challenged quarter from the capital markets sensitive names, we think the large commercial banks will post respectable fourth-quarter results, particularly given improved loan growth trends in the quarter.”Regions Financial slipped 2.3 per cent to $4.69 as the bank confirmed the sale of its brokerage unit, Morgan Keegan, to Raymond James. Shares in Region had climbed more than 10 per cent this week on reports the sale could be worth more than $1bn.Raymond James eventually agreed to pay $930m, although Morgan Keegan will pay a one-off dividend of $250m to Regions before the sale completes.New Jersey lender Hudson City Bancorp fell 1.9 per cent to $7.12 as Brian Foran at Nomura said the bank’s lending margin could fall by another 60 basis points as existing loans are repaid and new funds are extended at lower prevailing interest rates.Wynn Resorts fell 1.9 per cent to $109.80 on reports that Kazuo Okada, the casino operator’s vice-chairman, had sued the company for access to financial records in a dispute over the use of funds.Shares in Sears Holdings climbed 3.3 per cent to $34.00 on a volatile day of trading. The stock had fallen five per cent at the opening on reports a financing company was no longer extending credit to suppliers for deliveries to Sears, but shares rallied after filings revealed Edward Lampert, the veteran investor and Sears chairman, had increased his personal stake in the company.
101;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2012-01-03T22:18:50Z;Miners rally on Chinese economic data;;Energy and material stocks gave Wall Street a new year bounce as miners and steelmakers rallied on economic data from China.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China for use in steelmaking, climbed 8 per cent to $22.07 after the official Chinese purchasing managers’ index moved back above 50 for December, suggesting China’s factories expanded output. US Steel Corp climbed 5.9 per cent to $28.03.The S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent to 1,277.05, led by financials, with Citigroup climbing 7.7 per cent to $28.33 and Morgan Stanley up 6.3 per cent to $16.08The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5 per cent to 12,397.31 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.7 per cent to 2,648.72.“Technically, stocks enjoy a seasonal tailwind early in the first quarter,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird, who said the S&P 500 could be set for “an attack on the 1,300 area” if cyclical sectors rally.Oil explorers and producers gained as the price of crude oil rose after Iran made threats over a US aircraft carrier near its waters.Driller and oilfield services provider Nabors Industries jumped 9.7 per cent to $19.02 for the best performance in the S&P 500 and oil producer Denbury Resources climbed 7.9 per cent to $16.29.A rash of joint venture deals announced between US explorers and foreign companies provided more evidence of rising prices for drilling rights in booming shale plays.Chesapeake Energy closed up 5.9 per cent to $23.60, after announcing a joint venture with French oil group Total.Chesapeake’s Total deal comes on top of existing joint ventures with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation but, despite the company’s apparent ability to generate cash from its shale acquisitions, its share price has fallen significantly over the past year.Analysts point to the company’s failure to bring its debt level to less than $10bn.“The key now will be to see how much [of the Total deal] flows through to debt reduction,” said Tim Rezvan at Sterne Agee. “Spending has been out of control at Chesapeake without the transparency of other companies,” he added.Devon Energy climbed 6.6 per cent to $66.11 after announcing a transaction with Sinopec International, another Chinese oil company, which will take a one-third interest in five separate Devon ventures for $2.2bn.Oilfield services provider Halliburton was a rare faller, closing 1 per cent lower at $34.15, as BPproceeded with plans to recover all costs related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill from the company.A Washington court’s decision to delay implementation of Environmental Protection Agency rules on interstate air pollution wreaked havoc among coal miners and utilities.The EPA rules, which were meant to be effective from January 1, aim to curb mercury and sulphur emissions from power stations.Coal miner Peabody Energy rose 8.8 per cent to $36.01, while Consol Energy, which operates coal-fired power stations, climbed 6.1 per cent to $38.93.But not all analysts were convinced by the rally. “This is just a temporary reprieve,” said Brandon Blossman, of Tudor Pickering. “Clean air regulations have been moving along for the last 30 years and this is just the latest incarnation. The industry is not going to reverse the trend.”Non-coal utilities had rallied strongly since the EPA first announced the new clean air rules on December 21, but gave up gains on Tuesday. Gas focused Public Service Enterprise Group fell 3.6 per cent to $31.81 and FirstEnergy fell 3.4 per cent to $42.81.Wynn Resorts climbed 3.2 per cent to $113.97.

Muse of Barclays Capital. Micron Technology surged 7.3 per cent to $6.75, as Barclays Capital recommended that clients buy the stock.Shares in Californian rare-earth miner Molycorp climbed 4.8 per cent to $25.12 after the company said more than three-quarters of phase-one production at its flagship California manufacturing facility had been committed to customer orders or internal use.
102;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-12-27T21:44:35Z;Sears slump weighs on Wall Street;;The market capitalisation of Sears Holdings fell by more than a quarter yesterday after the company said it would close as many as 120 Kmart and Sears stores after sales of consumer electronics declined in the holiday shopping period.Sears’ shares tumbled 27.2 per cent to $33.38, their lowest level since early 2009.The decision to close stores came after comparable same-store sales for the eight weeks to December 25 fell 5.2 per cent across the group compared with the same period in 2010.The closures will generate $140m to $170m of cash from sales of inventory and the leasing or sales of the locations, the company said in a statement.But that was a drop in the ocean compared to non-cash charges of $1.6bn to $1.8bn that the company said it will book as a result of the poor sales performance.Wall Street opened lowered on the Sears’ announcement and an unexpectedly large fall in the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities. But stocks rallied after a survey of consumer confidence report jumped almost ten points from its November level to 64.5.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day almost back where they started. The S&P was up just 0.01 per cent to 1,265.43 and the Dow edged down 0.02 per cent to 12,291.35Homebuilder stocks are among the best performers in the S&P 500 in the quarter to date, and share prices were little affected by the Case-Schiller data.Lennar was off just 0.4 per cent to $19.30, DR Horton fell 0.8 per cent to $12.35 and PulteGroup close 0.5 per cent lower at $6.05.The Nasdaq Composite index closed up 0.3 per cent to 2,625.2, helped by strong performances by Apple and Google, the two most heavily weighted stocks in the index.Apple was up 0.8 per cent $406.53 and Google climbed 1.1 per cent to $640.25 on reports that 6.8m Apple iPhone and Google Android smartphones were activated on Christmas day, more than double the previous daily record of 2.8m on 25 December 2010.Mead Johnson Nutrition climbed 5.8 per cent to $69.08, recovering some ground from a 10 per cent sell-off in the week before Christmas.The company said it had conducted tests on samples of its Enfamil powdered baby food formula, tied to a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the death of a newborn baby in Missouri, and found no presence of bacteria.Computer Sciences Corp fell 9 per cent to $24.10 after the company withdrew its 2012 financial guidance and said it stood to lose up to $1.5bn after the UK government scrapped the company’s contract to build an electronic patient records database.Stocks with exposure to internet gambling continued to benefit from reports at the end of last week that the Obama administration intended to make it easier for US states to legalise internet poker and certain other online betting.International Game Technology, which sells computerised gaming equipment, climbed 5 per cent to $17.37 and casino chain Wynn Resorts was up 3.2 per cent to $113.53.Shares in dishwasher manufacturer Whirlpool fell 8.9 per cent to $46.62. The share price hit a 52-week low last week, and that appears to have triggered more selling, which had an exaggerated impact amid light trading volumes, traders said.Banks underperformed the wider market with the financial sector of the S&P 500 falling 0.7 per cent, far more than any other broad S&P 500 sector.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $15.29 and Bank of America was off 2.1 per cent to $5.48.MetLife climbed 0.3 per cent to $31.20 as the life insurer said its retail deposit business would be acquired by General Electric financial services division.The business has $7.5bn in customer funds and an online banking platform. General Electric shares were off 1.2 per cent to $18.01.The deal should mean MetLife avoids some regulations faced by banks under the Dodd-Frank financial reform passed last year.Bank stocks have weighed on the S&P 500 throughout the year, and the financial sector is set to end 2011 17.7 per cent lower than it started – easily the worst performing sector in the benchmark US index.Once dividends are included, only financials and materials have failed to deliver a positive return in 2011, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.The CBOE Vix index of volatility edged up for the first time in a week, climbing 5.3 per cent to 21.83, although Wall Street’s “fear gauge” remained well below the elevated levels of the summer, during which it touched a high of 48.00.
103;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-12-19T21:40:51Z;Big banks tumble as BofA breaches $5;Rules may require big banks to hold extra capital;"Bank of America shares fell beneath $5 for the first time since 2009, as bank stocks suffered heavy selling, pushing the S&P 500 to the brink of 1,200 for the first time since November.BofA shares closed at $4.99, a fall of 4 per cent on the day, after trading as low as $4.92.Citigroup fell 4.7 per cent to $24.82, JPMorgan fell 3.7 per cent to $30.70, Morgan Stanley fell 5.5 per cent to $14.16 and Goldman Sachs was off 2.7 per cent to $87.70.That left the S&P 500, which had opened in positive territory, down 1.2 per cent to 1,205.35.Big bank stocks had opened lower on reports that the Federal Reserve would adopt new Basel capital regulations requiring systemically important financial institutions to hold more capital, but selling picked up momentum during the day.“Once BofA breached the $5 level, bank stocks got dumped,” said one trader. “It’s a level that some institutions have to sell at.”The financial sector of the S&P 500 has dragged on broader US markets throughout the second half of this year and has fallen 23 per cent for the year to date, compared with a fall of just 4 per cent for the wider market.But some investors said the panic selling was limited. iShares’ US Preferred Stock exchange traded fund, which tracks preferred stock of US banks, fell just 0.1 per cent to $35.57, still $2 above its August lows.“Preferred stock gets wiped out in an insolvency and, if people were really worried about that scenario, we’d expect to see the ETF fall much more,” said James Dailey, at Team Financial Managers.The fall in bank stocks and more negative news flow from Europe, where there were reports a conference call among European Union finance ministers had failed to agree on raising the ceiling for bail-out funds, drove selling of other cyclical stocks.Genworth Financial was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 8.2 per cent to $5.75. The US insurer sells a consumer debt insurance product in the eurozone.Coal miners Peabody, Cliffs Natural Resources and Alpha Natural Resources were all among the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500, down between 5 and 7.5 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 per cent to 11,766.41 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off
1.3 per cent to 2,523.14.Homebuilder stocks were barely given a boost by a rise in the National Association of Home Builders confidence index to 21, its highest level since May 2010, from a revised 19 in November. PulteGroup fell 3 per cent to $5.59. DR Horton fell 2 per cent to $11.76.Even Lennar, considered by many analysts the most attractive US homebuilding stock because of the company’s low level of debt, fell 1.4 per cent to $18.51.Zynga fell 4.7 per cent to $9.05. The social game developer is trading 95 cents below its $10 initial public offering price after falling 5 per cent on its market debut on Friday.Groupon shipped 4.5 per cent to $22.00, just $2 above its own IPO price, as Stifel Nicolaus became the latest underwriter of its IPO not to recommend the stock to clients, as it initiated coverage. Stifel analysts called the discount offers website, “the internet’s overgrown toddler”, on account of its “get big fast” strategy.Cablevision Systems climbed 2 per cent to $13.00, recovering some ground after falling 8.5 per cent on Friday when Tom Rutledge, chief operating officer, unexpectedly said he would quit the cable company without offering a reason.Citigroup analysts said the market reaction was “a touch extreme” and urged clients to buy the stock at a compelling valuation.Las Vegas Sands fell 2.6 per cent to $40.46 even after the casino company’s China unit said an investigation by Hong Kong stock market regulators for alleged breaches of regulations had ended.Rival Wynn Resorts fell 3.3 per cent to $102.20.AT&T fell 0.4 per cent to $28.74 amid reports that the mobile phone network was stepping back from talks on asset sales intended to help gain approval for its acquisition of T-Mobile USA.That would suggest the company may be giving up on the T-Mobile purchase in the face of regulatory hurdles.Yahoo slipped 2.2 per cent to $14.63 despite reports after the market closed on Friday that private equity groups interested in taking a minority stake in the internet portal might raise their per share price from the $16.60 reportedly offered previously."
104;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-11-28T21:48:23Z;US stocks surge after European rally;Equities gain after previous week’s heavy sell-off;Shares in Genworth Financial surged amid a rash of buying, as Citigroup analysts said the insurer will avoid bankruptcy.More than 2.5m Genworth shares were bought and sold, the heaviest trading day this month, as the stock gained 12.6 per cent to $6.07. Genworth’s market capitalisation has halved this year, amid fears of losses on a consumer debt insurance product it sells in the eurozone. But Citigroup analysts told clients the market appears to “be overly discounting the possibility of bankruptcy.”Wider US markets had their best day in November, as investors seized on record Black Friday retail sales figures, and reports that French officials are pushing for a deal on eurozone fiscal union, to reverse some of last week’s heavy gains.Only eight members of the S&P 500 were in the red, while all 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded gains, as stocks across the board were caught up in the improved sentiment. Although there was plenty of bad news to chew on as the rating agency Moody’s warned of multiple eurozone defaults, investors were determined to accentuate the positive.“It’s as though many of the people who capitulated last week have decided to reverse and pile back in all at once today,” said Colin Cieszynski.The S&P 500 closed up 2.9 per cent to 1,192.55, while the Dow gained 2.6 per cent to 11,523.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.5 per cent to 2,527.34.Metal and mining stocks led the rally, with the materials sector of the S&P 500 up 3.8 per cent.Commercial Metals Company gained 23.8 per cent to $14.17 on reports that veteran investor Carl Icahn had offered to buy the steelmaker for $15 a share, a 30 per cent premium to its Friday closing price.United States Steel Corporation was up 8.5 per cent to $24.16, while metallurgical coal miner Alpha Natural Resources gained 7.9 per cent to $20.29, both benefiting from renewed optimism about Chinese demand for steel.Big bank stocks also bounced with Morgan Stanley up 4 per cent to $13.80 and Goldman Sachs up 2.3 per cent to $90.78.Citigroup rose 6 per cent to $25.05, as investors shrugged off a judge’s decision to tear up the bank’s settlement with the SEC over alleged miss-selling of mortgages.Amazon was among the main beneficiaries of the Black Friday sales rush. It rose 6.4 per cent to $194.15 after the company said it sold four times more Kindle products on Black Friday than it did last year.First Solar gained 10.5 per cent to $44.56 after analysts at Jefferies said construction had begun on the company’s long-delayed Topaz solar farm project in San Luis Obispo County, California.Monsanto was up 2.6 per cent to $69.49 on reports that France’s highest court had cancelled previous decisions banning the use of the company’s genetically modified maize cultivation in France.Netflix shares were given a boost after Susquehanna analyst Vasily Karasyov removed his “sell” recommendation on the stock. The shares rose 9.5 per cent to $69.95 although Mr Karasyov told clients he had not changed his outlook on the company, but was simply reacting to the large falls in the share price this month.Chinese video streaming websites Youku and Tudou both made strong gains after Katherine Leung at Goldman Sachs said the companies would benefit from Chinese government plans to eliminate advertising during the airing of TV dramas. Youku was up 7.3 per cent to $16.86 and Tudou was up 3.9 per cent to $12.But US web start-ups Groupon and LinkedIn had a tough day. Groupon tumbled 9 per cent to $15.24, almost $5 beneath its IPO price. LinkedIn fell 4.9 per cent $60.Pharmacy chains underperformed the market as the US Supreme Court refused to reverse a judgment by a West Virginia court that the biggest pharmacy chains were not complying with a law requiring them to fill prescriptions with cheaper generic drugs.Sears Holdings, which owns the KMart chain of pharmacies fell 1 per cent to $57.83 and Walgreen was up just 1 per cent to $32.79.Kellogg was another faller. The cereal maker fell 0.4 per cent to $48.62 after Kenneth Zaslow, food analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said the company’s planned, “investment in manufacturing, retraining, and rehiring likely will limit margin expansion for several years.”Shares of Madison Square Garden jumped 10 per cent to $28.37 after the NBA reached a labour deal with basketball players to secure a 66-game season.Wynn Resorts gained 7.1 per cent to $114.60 on an upgrade from analysts at Keybanc, who said the Macau gaming market remained robust, refuting the fears of other analysts that Wynn might suffer from a decline in Chinese business junkets to Macau.Google shares rose 4.5 per cent to $588.19 after Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney told clients the company “has begun to show signs of margin stabilisation,” which have not been reflected in share price rises.
105;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-11-15T20:05:40Z;Caesars Entertainment revives offering plan;;Caesars Entertainment, the debt-laden casino group, has revived plans for an initial public offering a year after pulling a planned listing because of concerns about market volatility.The owner of Las Vegas casinos including Caesars Palace, the Flamingo and Planet Hollywood pointed to positive trends in the business and leisure travel market in a regulatory filing. It added that the possible legalisation of online gambling in the US could open up a lucrative new market.The renewed IPO push comes amid a flurry of other deals, with Groupon, the daily deals operator, completing a listing and Zynga, the online social gaming group, due to float this month. As many as nine companies are seeking to complete listings in November.Caesars was taken private at the peak of the bull market in 2006 by Apollo Global Management and TPG, the private equity investors, in a highly leveraged $17bn deal. The company has close to $20bn of debt, according to Tuesday’s regulatory filing.But since its purchase, Caesars – formerly known as Harrah’s – has struggled to restructure its debt amid the global recession and an economic downturn that has wreaked havoc in Las Vegas, its biggest market.The company was further weakened by its lack of presence in the booming Macau gaming market. Caesars failed to secure a gaming licence in Macau and could only watch as rival companies, such as Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, capitalised on a market which has grown larger than Las Vegas.In Caesars home Las Vegas market, the opening of MGM Resorts’ $9bn CityCenter project increased room capacity in the city at the worst possible time, which has depressed room rates for rival operators. Several high-profile casino developments have also stalled, such as the billion dollar Echelon and Fontainebleau projects, while the city leads the US in mortgage foreclosures and unemployment.However, there are signs of a rebound in visitor numbers to Las Vegas, which attracts a large share of US convention trade. Furthermore, Caesars, owner of the World Series of Poker, would be a prime beneficiary if lobbying efforts succeed at reforming US online gambling laws.Caesars said in the filing it was “better positioned than our competitors” to take advantage of “new opportunities” in the gaming industry. “We are the only US land-based casino company that owns an online gaming business,” it said.Caesars said it planned to raise $50m in the IPO, far less than the $530m it hoped to raise in its scrapped IPO from last November.
106;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-10-20T21:14:42Z;Shale oil exploration costs hit Newfield;Regional banks face scrutiny from investors;Shares in oil and gas field developer Newfield Exploration plunged on Thursday, after the company cut its full-year production guidance by 4 per cent because of rising costs at a large shale oil exploration site in the Rocky Mountains.“In response to service cost pressures, Newfield is voluntarily reducing its activities in the Williston Basin,” the company said in its quarterly earnings statement.Newfield shares fell 14.9 per cent to $35.81, as the company said it had cut the number of active rigs at Williston and deferred completion of 13 wells into 2012.“The explosion in shale exploration means there’s a huge demand for completion equipment so costs are rising and margins are being squeezed,” said Robert Morris, at Citibank.The S&P 500 ended a volatile day up 0.5 per cent to 1,215.37, as rumour and counter-rumour about the status of negotiations on the eurozone rescue fund shifted sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent to 11,541.78 but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,598.62.“The economic backdrop today was good,” said Phil Orlando, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. “Unemployment claims were good, the Philly Fed survey was excellent but it’s still Europe that’s moving markets, so we’re staying on the sidelines,” he added.Goldman Sachs put out a downbeat note on “lacklustre” results at regional banks, but highlighted, “the potential for dispersion within the sector and the growing ability to identify outperformers”, as investors judge banks on their ability to grow high margin loan books.Microsoft slipped back slightly in after-hours trading, despite a healthy quarterly earnings report issued after the close of the markets. Sales rose 7 per cent compared with the same period last year to $17.4bn.Fifth Third Bancorp was up 9.1 per cent to $11.63 after the Midwest-focused lender revealed its net interest margin had increased 3 basis points to 3.65 per cent, driven by increased commercial loans.But Huntington Bancshares dropped 6.9 per cent to $4.88 after its net interest margin fell 6bp to 3.34 per cent and it increased its allowance for credit losses to non-accrual loan coverage from 181 per cent to 187 per cent.Money manager Janus Capital Group closed up 1.6 per cent to $6.38, despite revealing that assets under management fell more than 10 per cent during the third quarter. Fund management fees helped push the company’s operating margin up 0.3 percentage points to 31.3 per cent, but investors withdrew more than $2bn from Janus funds while falling asset prices knocked $20bn off AUM.Wynn Resorts fell 5.3 per cent to $123.37, after the company dashed hopes it would pay out a special quarterly dividend, on top of its normal $0.50 payout.Jon Oh, an analyst at CLSA, said Wynn needed to hoard cash as it faces capital expenditure of between $2.5bn and $3bn to build a second casino in Macau.Wynn shares have been highly volatile for the past month on rumours of a slowdown in Chinese corporate junket tourism to Macau.But the company’s third-quarter earnings showed a 41.7 per cent increase in revenues at Wynn Macau compared with the same quarter in 2010, with occupancy robust into October.Personal computer manufacturer Dell fell 5.4 per cent to $15.05 after the world’s leading manufacturer of hard disk drives, Western Digital Corporation, warned that flooding in Thailand could disrupt production for several quarters to come.Western Digital was down as much as 5 per cent in early trading, nearing its tangible book value of $21 – the value the company’s assets would fetch in a fire sale. But the stock rebounded to close the day up 6.2 per cent at $25.96.But Western Digital is still down almost 10 per cent for the week, after the company closed all its Thai plants indefinitely.Memory manufacturers rose on the news, however, on hopes for higher sales of netbooks, which incorporate memory, but do not include hard drives.STEC Inc was up 5.7 per cent to $10.82.Union Pacific Corporation, one of the biggest US railroads, posted record profits of $1.85 a share, although the strong performance was mainly down to higher charges. Its shares were up 4 per cent to $94.59.
107;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-10-07T21:38:27Z;Wall Street ends week with a spring in its step;;In a week where the S&P 500 moved into bear territory, breaking below the 1,100 barrier for the first time in a year, Wall Street closed Friday in surprisingly good cheer, buoyed by strong retail sales data and a better than expected employment report.The 23 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters posted a 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales for September, handily beating analyst expectations. The corresponding figure in September 2010, when the economy appeared to be in much ruder health, was only 2.7 per cent.Bellwether discount retailer Target posted a 5.3 per cent increase in sales and its shares rose 5.1 per cent for the week to $51.56.Limited Brands, which operates high-end chains including Victoria’s Secret, enjoyed double digit year-on-year sales growth. The stock rose 5 per cent for the week to $40.43.Bulk goods retailer Costco posted a 12 per cent rise in sales, although a decision to raise membership fees to offset higher commodity prices alarmed investors. Shares fell 3.8 per cent to $79.02, the second-worst performing stock in the S&P 500.The consumer discretionary index of the S&P 500 was up 4.1 per cent for the week. Since markets began to slide in late July, the sector has outperformed the broad S&P 500 by more than two percentage points.“We’ve had sixty days of bad economic news and falling markets, but consumers are still going out and buying stuff, and at a healthy clip too,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.But some retail analysts were worried resilient consumer spending may be debt-driven.“Taken as a point in time, September sales data do look very strong,” said David Strasser, hardline retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. “But we question whether that is sustainable, if consumption is outpacing wage growth.”At 4.7 per cent in July and 4.5 per cent in August, the personal savings rate – the fraction of US personal income that is not consumed – has fallen beneath 4.8 per cent for the first time since 2009.The broad S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent for the week, as European politicians appeared to inch towards a co-ordinated recapitalisation of the continent’s banks. An FT report to that effect late on Tuesday had sent the S&P 500 up 4 per cent in forty minutes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent for the week to 11,103.12, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.6 per cent to 2,479.35.But US banks ended a volatile week on a low note. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 3.7 per cent Friday. A leak, late on Thursday, of a draft text of the Volcker rule, which would seek to stop proprietary trading by banks, caused alarm. By the week’s end, Tuesday’s euphoria at the prospect of European bank recapitalisations had also given way to worries about the speed of implementation.“As with everything in Europe it’s going to happen slower than the markets want,” said Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities.Bank of America was down 3.6 per cent for the week to $5.95, after a 6 per cent fall on Friday. Goldman Sachs fell 5.5 per cent Friday to end the week down 2 per cent at $94.56. But despite its own 6 per cent fall on Friday, Morgan Stanley ended the week up 5.4 per cent to $14.24.That represented a turnround for Morgan Stanley, which was hit early in the week by reports that some banks were cutting exposure to the firm, as the cost of buying insurance on its debt hit 30-month highs.On Friday Morgan Stanley received a vote of confidence from analysts at its rival Goldman Sachs. Goldman’s options team put out a note recommending clients buy calls and sell short-dated credit default swaps to profit from a rise in the Morgan Stanley share price.“We believe concerns regarding its European swap and loan exposures appear overdone,” Goldman’s equity research analysts wrote in the note.Apple shares were down 2 per cent for the week to $369.80, after a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, and the death of founder and figurehead Steve Jobs.Sprint was by far the biggest faller in the S&P 500, losing 10 per cent of it market capitalisation on Friday afternoon, to close the week down 10.9 per cent at $2.71, after its chief executive said the mobile phone network may need to raise additional capital.Sprint also announced it will upgrade to a 4G network next year, which sent the share price of its current wireless network provider, Clearwire, tumbling 32.2 per cent to $1.39.Material stocks were the best performers in the S&P 500 on renewed hopes for global growth. Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 11.7 per cent to $34.01. Cliffs Natural Resources, which extracts iron ore and metallurgical coal, used in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.2 per cent to $55.87.Wynn Resorts, the casino chain, reversed two weeks of heavy losses to close the week up 12.1 per cent to $129.06. Nomura analysts came out in defence of the stock, which had been hit by fears of a decline in Chinese junket tourism to Macau.Shares in Yahoo jumped 17.5 per cent to $15.47 over the course of the week after reports suggested Microsoft was preparing a bid for the internet portal. Microsoft denied interest but Alibaba remained in the running, along with various private equity houses.AMR, the holding company of American Airlines, was down 15.5 per cent for the week to $2.50, on reports the company is considering bankruptcy.Seed company Monsanto was up 18.1 per cent to $51.56 after reporting strong quarterly sales.
108;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-10-03T18:07:13Z;S&P 500 closes at lowest level in a year;;The S&P 500 closed below 1,100 for the first time since September 2010, falling 2.9 per cent to end the session at 1,099.18A relatively calm morning session ended when AMR Corporation, the holding company for American Airlines, crashed 20 per cent in minutes just after midday. AMR ended the day down 33 per cent at $1.98 on speculation that the company may file for bankruptcy.A sell-off in big bank stocks followed almost immediately afterwards. Citigroup led fallers down 9.8 per cent to $23.11, Bank of America fell 9.6 per cent to $5.53, a full 47 cents below its previous year low. Goldman Sachs was down 4.7 per cent to $90.08. All three stocks were at levels not seen since March or April 2009.Morgan Stanley fell to a level not seen since December 2008. The stock was down 7.7 per cent to $12.47, amid heavy trading in options.In just three hours of trading, open interest in $5 October puts on Morgan Stanley – giving buyers the right to sell 100 Morgan Stanley shares for $5 in October – increased by a factor of five to 24,000. The cost of $5 October puts doubled from 12 to 25 cents during the day.The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose to 558 basis points at the close of the New York Session, up 72bp. That equates to $558,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years.Bank of America CDS rose 30bp to an all-time wide spread of 446bp, while Citigroup rose 33bp to 348bp.Shell-shocked banking analysts were at a loss to explain the falls.“I left for lunch at midday and things were quiet, I came back and the bottom had fallen out of banks,” Christopher Mustacio at Stifel Nicolaus said.Tentative explanations ranged from the reports about American Airlines, although the company’s $11bn is unlikely to sink a bank, to exposures to Europe, where Franco-Belgian bank Dexia had been downgraded, before markets opened.But all analysts agreed the falls did not reflect the fundamentals. “Investors are afraid of 2008, there’s a sell first, ask questions later attitude,” said Mr Mustacio.Dan Greenhouse, chief investment strategist BTIG, said investors might be “derisking in case the S&P 500 breaks through 1,100, because a lot of people think it will fall a lot more if it does”.And therein lies the importance of the 1,100 figure. Although the S&P 500 has suffered heavy selling during August and July, the 1,100 had served as a signal for bargain hunters to pour back in to the market. When the benchmark index touched its previous year intraday low of 1,101.54 on August 9, it rebounded immediately, closing the day at 1,172.88.On Monday, the barrier was broken in the last minutes of trading, holding out hopes for a quick bounce on Tuesday.But Monday’s losses leaves the S&P 500 perilously close to bear market territory, signalled by a fall of 20 per cent from a previous cyclical high. The benchmark index is down 19.4 per cent since its April 29 peak.Shares in trust banks also fell sharply, after Sanford Bernstein Research evaluated the revenue impact of a flatter yield curve on lending margins, and revenue from reinvested earnings.Bank of New York Mellon fell 4.7 per cent to $17.72, State Street lost 5.5 per cent to $30.40 and Northern Trust Corporation retreated 2.8 per cent to $34.01.Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said earnings per share at all three institutions could suffer a 3-4 per cent hit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4 per cent to 10,665.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.3 per cent to 2335.83.Yahoo jumped 2.7 per cent to $13.53 as Wall Street had its first chance to react to news of a potential bid that broke after the markets closed Friday.Jack Ma, chairman of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, which is 40 per cent owned by Yahoo and controls Yahoo China, told an audience at Stanford university that he was “very, very interested” in buying Yahoo.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 8.4 per cent to $57.90 as analysts weighed the company’s sales of the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch I and 550MW Desert Sunlight plants, immediately after securing government loan guarantees on Friday.Micron Technology, a volatile semiconductor stock that suffered heavy selling last week after poor quarterly results, was down a further 14.1 per cent to $4.33, the first time the stock has broken through the $5 level since 2009. Fellow semi stock Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.8 per cent to $4.53 as fallout from weak quarterly results last week continued.Frontier Communications fell 7.4 per cent to $5.66 after Macquarie recommended that clients sell the stock due to the telecommunications group’s dependence on high-yield debt funding.Pharmaceutical Product Development jumped some 25.8 per cent to $32.28 after confirming that it would be acquired by Carlyle Group and Hellman & Friedman in a $3.9bn cash deal.Energy and industrial stocks linked to global economic growth, however, sold off heavily.Wynn Resorts fell 0.7 per cent to $114.32. The company is down by a third in just two weeks, on fears of a decline in junket tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macau, which accounts for up to a third of the company’s revenue.

110;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-09-30T20:50:01Z;Wall Street suffers worst quarter since 2008;;A poor week ended a miserable quarter on Wall Street. The S&P 500 gave up a strong rally to end 0.4 per cent down for the week. That gave the benchmark US index its worst quarterly performance since 2008. The index fell 14.3 per cent over the third quarter, 7.2 per cent of that coming in September.The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1.3 per cent for the week to 10,913.38, strongly outperformed the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 2.7 cent to 2,415.40. That suggested a flight to the safety of large-cap stocks.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things,” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.Other analysts blamed the divergence between the two indices on mutual fund managers taking profits, and dumping less well-known stocks, before they have to declare quarter-end positions to their clients.A mixed performance by semiconductor stocks captured the week’s other theme of strongly backing outperformers and dumping laggards.Chip-manufacturer Jabil Circuit was up 6.3 per cent for the week to $17.79, after eking out impressive earnings-per-share growth for the quarter ended August 31.For other semiconductor stocks, stagnant sales dominated. Micron Technology fell 23.4 per cent for the week to $5.04. The stock fell 14 per cent on Friday after Micron declared a quarterly loss of 14 cents, on falling sales of Dram memory components to computer manufacturers.Micron’s rival Advanced Micro Devices was down 20.6 per cent for the week to $5.08, after its own quarterly results, published on Thursday, showed the company had failed to make an impression in the growing tablet market.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, often watched as an indicator of global industrial health, because semiconductors are used in everything from solar panels to smartphones, was down 5.9 per cent for the week.The week had started brightly, with the S&P 500 up above 1,190 at one point on Tuesday on hopes of a comprehensive deal on eurozone sovereign debt. But the rally reversed on reports of disagreements between European countries over further writedowns for private holders of Greek debt.Since the index dipped below 1,200 at the start of August, it has traded in a narrow band between 1,100 and 1,220, with volatile rallies and sell-offs quickly reversed.“The longer issues in Europe remain unresolved, the more nervous the market will get, and the S&P 500 could break below 1,100 even without big news,” said Channing Smith, director of equity strategies at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were up 1 per cent for the week, more than any other sector. Life assurers were the main beneficiaries, with Genworth Financial up 7.7 per cent for the week to $5.74.Most big banks also fared well, with Citigroup up 2.5 per cent for the week to $25.61. But Bank of America fell 3 per cent to $6.12, only 12 cents off its year-low. BofA dropped certain claims against the Lehman Brothers estate to resolve its long-running bankruptcy case.Other highly cyclical stocks fell. Material stocks were down 2 per cent, over continued concerns about falling Chinese demand if the world economy stagnates.Alpha Natural Resources, the metallurgical coal supplier which is dependent on Chinese demand for steel, fell 13.2 per cent to $17.69. ANR’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent since the start of August.Gaming group Wynn Resorts continued its recent sharp decline, falling 17 per cent over the week to $115.08. The stock has suffered from rumours of declining tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macao, although data suggest Macao arrivals remain robust.Big tech stocks, which have outperformed other cyclical stocks during market volatility this quarter, also had a rough week. Apple fell 5.7 per cent to $381.32 and Google fell 2 per cent to $515.04.Consumer staple stocks outperformed consumer discretionary stocks, and utilities were up, in a sign that investors were buying defensively even as the broad index rose.Ingersoll-Rand was down 11.1 per cent for the week to $27.56. The stock fell 13.8 per cent on Friday after the company cut its earnings per share guidance for the current quarter by more than 10 per cent.Netflix fell 12.4 per cent to $113.27. The market capitalisation of the video streaming and DVD delivery company halved in September after it had lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers after a price hike.
111;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Macao casino operators hit by China fears;;Macao casino operators were hit by large falls in their share prices on Friday as investors became increasingly nervous about the impact of the slowdown in the mainland Chinese economy.Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands, the US gaming groups now making most of their profit in Macao, saw shares in their Hong Kong-listed subsidiaries lose 17 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, their worst one-day performance since listing two years ago.SJM, the largest gaming group in the Chinese territory by market share, fell 8.7 per cent and MGM China dropped nearly 12 per cent. The Hang Seng index was down 2.3 per cent amid a general equity sell-off in the region but the gaming sector was the worst hit.The gaming industry in the former Portuguese colony has been a success story amid the global economic slowdown, with revenue expected to reach US$34bn this year, more than 40 per cent higher than last year and five times more than Las Vegas’s 2010 revenue.However, it is highly dependent on mainland China, with big spending Chinese responsible for more than two-thirds of chips bought in Macao, according to casino operators.The sell-off appears to have been triggered by rumours that some junket operators were in trouble. These are companies responsible for drawing so-called VIP gamblers to Macao casinos by extending them generous credit and, sometimes, by being flexible about debt collection.One junket operator – Grand Korea Leisure – has stopped extending credit to mainland Chinese high-rollers. The Seoul-based company, which has a small Macao operation, said the move was temporary and a repeat of a “credit clearing” exercise that saw it halting VIP credit for two months last year. It did not give a specific reason for the latest move.A junket operator in Macao who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was not aware of rivals experiencing a credit crunch. However, he had heard of mainland Chinese investors pulling capital from their investments because of monetary tightening at home.“There are many wealthy factory owners from the east coast of China who have been making good returns from Macao simply by lending money to junket operators in return for 1-1.5 per cent in monthly interest. They have seen Macao as a profitable sideshow to their real business, which is experiencing a slowdown. However, some of them are in need of cash at home and have trouble borrowing from banks. So they are cashing out from Macao,” he said. So far, this only had a limited impact on the junket operators, he added, as they were still seeing strong growth in business.Analysts on Friday said Macao’s growth would not continue at the current pace because the market had become so big and Chinese visitors could be spending less if there was a marked slowdown in the mainland economy. However, they predicted a gradual slowdown rather than a hard landing because recent data were encouraging. August gaming revenue in Macao rose 57 per cent year-on-year to US$3bn, while the number of visitors to the city rose 14.4 per cent to 2.7m.“Investors were spooked by slowing growth in China and they want to lock in profits after strong gains by stocks such as Wynn Macau and Sands China over the past year,” said Philip Tulk, analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland.Following Friday’s sell-off, Wynn Macau shares were still up 47 per cent from a year ago while Sands China shares were up 33 per cent.
112;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-09-26T20:58:27Z;Casino stocks hit by fears of Asian slowdown;;Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands slid to their fifth consecutive sessions of losses, and Melco Crown Entertainment its fourth in five, as investors fretted that a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy might effect their casino operations in Macau.“There seems to be an awful lot of concern that a slowdown in the Asian economies will reduce the funding that’s available for the corporate junket business, which is really the engine of these businesses’ growth in Macau,” said David Katz, an analyst at Jefferies.Wynn depended on its Macau operation for about a third of revenue, LVS for more than 40 per cent, and Melco for almost its entire business, Mr Katz said. All three operators are now down more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday, significantly underperforming the broad S&P 500.On Monday Wynn was down 1.4 per cent to $136.78, off more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday. LVS fell 1.6 per cent to $43.69, down 11.2 per cent over the five days. Melco fell 3.3 per cent to $9.85 and is off almost 17 per cent since Tuesday.But most analysts said company data did not suggest a slowdown was imminent. Carlo Santarelli, gaming analyst at Deutsche Banks said, “I’m not seeing anything fundamental out of Macau to make me believe there is anything changing in the VIP. I think the share price moves are more reflective of general macro fears in the equity markets.”Elsewhere, the S&P 500 bounced a healthy 2.3 per cent to 1,162.95, to snap a five day slump, driven by a strong rally in bank stocks.Financials in the S&P 500 rose 4.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector. Citigroup jumped 7 per cent to $26.72 and JPMorgan was also up 7 per cent to $31.65. Bank of America also outperformed the sector, up 4.6 per cent to $6.60, as crisis meetings involving European and American officials once again raised hopes of a solution to the eurozone crisis, which has battered bank stocks.Gains for big banks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5 per cent to 11,043.86, but the Nasdaq Composite index, which has a lower weighting of financials, and whose bank stocks tend to be small domestic lenders, lagged behind, up only 1.4 per cent to 2,516.69.Consol Energy was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 9 per cent to $37.17, after announcing the $193m sale of royalties on a Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to Antero Corporation.Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 8.1 per cent to $108,449, after Warren Buffett’s company announced it would use some of its $48bn cash hoard to repurchase shares. The buy-back programme allows for unlimited purchases as long as the stock is trading at a premium of less than 10 per cent of book value, and the company’s cash pile remains above $20bn.Netflix was up 2.2 per cent to $132.22, despite reports of a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content. Netflix’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent in recent weeks after it broke off negotiations to renew a content contract with the Stars cable network, and a move to separate its streaming and DVD delivery business lost it up to 1m subscribers.Expedia, the online travel company, jumped 4.7 per cent to $28.44 after Piper Jaffray analysts upgraded the stock to “buy”, arguing international bookings could account for 50 per cent of revenue by 2013.Clorox Company, the cleaning products manufacturer, was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 4.3 per cent to $66.44, after investor Carl Icahn withdrew his nominees to the board of directors, citing shareholder resistance to his attempted buy-out of the company. Clorox had been up almost 10 per cent for the year before Monday on expectations of a takeover.With the S&P 500 down 17 per cent from its April 29 peak at the start of the day, most analysts notes on Monday were discussing the probability of a bear market and how to position for it.Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategist, said the high correlation among sectors in the S&P 500 leaves few obvious defensive plays. Less than a quarter of healthcare stocks and only half of consumer staple stocks have a correlation to the index of less than 0.9. The 80 per cent of utility stocks, which are exhibiting low correlation to the S&P 500, may be the best bet for investors expecting the market to enter bear territory.But, Mr Parker warned “low beta stocks have seen a recent increase in trading volume relative to high beta stocks”, which has driven up prices, so investors would have to pay a price to buy into defensive stocks.Two less intuitive candidates for defensive plays are exchanges and brokers. Exchanges have seen trading volumes spike during recent market volatility, which has increased revenue. Several analysts have recommended buying into the sector, and Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Intercontinental­Exchange have all outperformed the S&P 500 since July 25.On the day, Nasdaq OMX was 0.3 per cent higher at $24.47, CME Group had gained 0.7 per cent to $259.83 and Intercontinental­Exchange had risen 0.4 per cent to $122.58.But Alex Kramm at UBS, who has “buy” ratings on all three names, said: “We still think there’s value in exchanges as a defensive play within financials.”The New York Stock Exchange is down 29 per cent since July 25, almost twice the fall in the S&P 500, although it has largely moved in tandem with potential merger partner Deutsche Börse, so has suffered from falls in European markets.Despite NYSE’s underperformance, “I’d hesitate to pick it as a favourite given uncertainty around the merger”, said Mr Kramm.Brokers have also benefited from a sharp rise in trading volumes. In a note last week Brad Hintz at Bernstein Research said Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and LPL Investment Holding, all of which have significantly underperformed their indices, had “relative near-term opportunities” from elevated trading volume.But on Monday he revised down earnings per share estimates for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, arguing that the impact of depressed IPO and M&A activity on investment bank earnings would outbalance any sharp rise in revenue from their brokerage businesses. He predicted Goldman Sachs would deliver a 20 cent loss per share in the third quarter.
113;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-07-19T22:41:36Z;Earnings vs bonds;;"It is hard to concentrate on the earnings season when the financial system hangs in the balance in both Europe and the US. On Tuesday, though, investors tore their gaze away from Brussels, Washington and the Murdoch pieman to focus on positive corporate figures from both continents.Goldman Sachs’s poor profit numbers may be the exception that proves the rule. After Coca-Cola and Wynn Resorts beat forecasts yesterday, almost 80 per cent of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have exceeded second-quarter earnings expectations.The bulls are taking heart and have been turning back to a favourite valuation tool: comparing earnings and bond yields. The earnings yield, the inverse of the price-earnings ratio, show how much profit investors get for each dollar. When earnings offer more than bonds, equities are meant to be cheap; when less, expensive.This model has an impressive history: it suggested equities were extremely overpriced in September 1987, a month before Black Monday, and in February 2000, a month before the dotcom bubble burst. It said equities were cheap at the start of 2003, and at the end of August last year, both just before recoveries.But it relies on a basic mistake. Bonds pay nominal yields; they do not go up with inflation. Corporate earnings, by contrast, tend to rise with prices. On top of that, bond yields are good hard cash, unlike profits. Comparing them makes no sense.There is no denying that it worked reasonably well for three decades. When it really mattered, though, the earnings yield proved useless; throughout 2007 and 2008 it insisted shares were cheap.Perhaps the model needs to be reset. If investors have permanently shifted away from equities, the world may revert to how it was pre-1970. Before then, earnings yields only once (in December 1921) fell below bond yields. Just as now, that did not mean shares were always cheap."
114;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-07-06T21:01:20Z;Media stocks drag Wall Street lower;;News Corp lost ground as the furore over alleged phone hacking at one of its British newspapers deepened while US stocks were largely flat as investors paused for breath following the strongest rally for two years last week.The media group was down 3.6 per cent to $17.47, one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P 500 index, as David Cameron, British prime minister, said he was backing a public inquiry into allegations of phone hacking at the News of the World.This was the first big share price move since the latest set of allegations surfaced and comes as News Corp is attempting a full takeover of BSkyB, the UK satellite broadcaster. The stock is still up 20 per cent over the year, however.The fall weighed on the S&P media index, which was down 0.9 per cent.In other news from the sector, there were reports that the owners of Hulu – which includes Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast’s NBC Universal – were committed to selling the video streaming service. Shares in Disney were down 1 per cent to $39.57 while Comcast fell 1.9 per cent to $25.49.But despite these losses, the benchmark S&P 500 index was flat at 1,339.22 overall as traders were reluctant to place large trades ahead of crucial employment data on Thursday and Friday.“The markets are probably just going to bounce around a bit until the employment report later this week,” said Yu-Dee Chang, chief trader at Ace Investment Strategists. “But the report is likely to surprise to the upside and I think the markets will continue up from there.”Sentiment on Wall Street was not helped by the largely disappointing economic news in the session.Data from the Institute for Supply Management indicated that US non-manufacturing business had expanded less than expected last month.The ISM index showed a reading of 53.3 in June, which was below the 54 expected by economists and down from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion.Separate figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consulting firm, showed an 11.6 per cent rise in planned job cuts in June to 41,432 from May’s 37,135. This was a potential worry given the non-farm payrolls report coming out on Friday.Financial stocks were the worst performing as the sector continued to suffer from news in the previous session that Moody’s had downgraded Portugal’s debt to “junk” status.Bank of Americawas down 2.5 per cent to $10.73 while Morgan Stanleylost 1.9 per cent to $22.72.The S&P financial index was down 0.6 per cent but is still up 4.4 per cent from the lows of last week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,626.10, helped by slight gains in the industrial, material and retail sectors. Urban Outfitters was up 5.6 per cent to $30.75 while Caterpillaradded 1.5 per cent to $110.08.The Nasdaq Composite crept up 0.3 per cent to 2,834.02.Many analysts were still confident that the markets would march higher in the second half of this year – even despite the 5.6 per cent gains last week – as they believe that the US economy will start to pick up in the next few months from the “soft patch” of the last few months.We “expect a second half recovery for the equity market,” said analysts at Citigroup. “Strength from corporate America and some resolution on southern European and US debt concerns should lead to equity market gains.”In other news, General Motors was up 1.1 per cent to $31.19 after Morgan Stanley added the carmaker to its “best idea” list, saying share-price declines have made US carmakers more attractive.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain store, was up 1.5 per cent to $43.38 after reporting that same-store sales had risen by 4.8 per cent in June, which was well above analysts’ estimates of 2.2 per cent growth.Shares in Tesorowere up 4.1 per cent to $24.10 after Barclays Capital upgraded its rating on the oil refiner, saying its restructuring will help it outperform peers over the next few years.It has now been just more than two years since the start of the US economic recovery. Of the stocks to gain ground since the end of June 2009, Netflix, the DVD subscription and online video streaming service, is up 603 per cent and Wynn Resorts, the US casino operator, has risen 397.7 per cent.
115;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-07-01T20:30:24Z;Wall Street rally gathers pace;Rising optimism over economy;Wall Street saw its sharpest weekly gains in two years after better than expected manufacturing data buoyed risk appetite, helping the major indices achieve their fifth consecutive session of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.4 per cent to 1,339.67, led by the consumer discretionary, financial and industrial sectors, after strong data raised hopes that the US economy was coming out of the recent slow patch.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing, led by Apollo Group, which jumped 6.4 per cent to $46.46 after the operator of for-profit schools reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.Elsewhere in the sector, Darden Restaurants was up 6.1 per cent to $52.78 while Wynn Resorts added 4.2 per cent to $149.57.But the gains were broad based, with all 10 major sectors moving forward after the reading for the ISM manufacturing index came in at 55.3 for June. This was ahead of the 53.5 in May and better than the 52 expected by economists. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.This number followed news on Thursday that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index had come in at 61.1, which was also well above economists’ expectations and raised hopes that the economy was improving after weeks in the doldrums.“This data are a strong sign we are coming out of the recent soft patch,” said Mark Lamkin, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Lamkin Wealth Management.This feeling on Wall Street lifted risky assets. The S&P financial and industrial sectors were up 1.7 per cent while the consumer discretionary sector added 2 per cent and technology stocks were up 1.7 per cent.Defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecoms were some of the worst performing, rising only 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Gains in the industrial sector were led by Cummins which put on 3.8 per cent to $107.42 while the technology sector was dominated by gains from Visa and MasterCard.The credit card companies continued to be lifted by news on Wednesday that the US Federal Reserve set a higher than expected cap on debit card transaction fees. Visa was up 4.4 per cent to $87.97 while MasterCard added 4.4 per cent to $314.47.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average index up 1.4 per cent at 12,581.86 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.5 per cent higher at 2,816.03.The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 5.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, over the week.The S&P 500 added 5.6 per cent over the five days, the best week on the index since July 2009. The Dow and the Nasdaq also saw their best week in two years.The only real downbeat news in the session was that the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence index came in at 71.5 for June, slightly short of the 72 reading expected and down from 74.3 in May, but the markets shrugged this off.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 4.8 per cent to 15.72, adding to the 21.7 per cent drop it had already seen this week as investors positioned themselves for a steady climb in the equity markets.The week on Wall Street kicked off in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the big indices bounced off key technical support levels reached the previous week after nearly two straight months of losses.The S&P 500 had fallen 7 per cent from the start of May, reaching a bottom at the end of last week. The index found its support level just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound that followed over the news five days was sharp, with the S&P index putting on around 1 per cent every session.The markets were helped by a partial resolution to the situation in Greece on Wednesday and then the stronger manufacturing data on Thursday and Friday. Investors were also positioning themselves for the upcoming earnings season – starting in earnest on July 11 – which is expected to be quite strong.In recent quarters markets have generally rallied before and during the earnings season as investors turn their attention away from macroeconomic concerns and on to companies news.This repositioning took form of a rotation into risk assets. The best performing sectors over the week were energy, which was up 7.2 per cent, technology, which added 6.8 per cent and consumer discretionary, which rose 6.6 per cent.One of the biggest pieces of corporate news from the session was the strong earnings results from Nike, which came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter.Shares in Nike were up 13.1 per cent to $91.82.
116;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-05-24T16:57:27Z;Spain to take a gamble on selling its lottery;;Spain is pushing ahead with a plan to privatise the country’s state lottery in a sell-off that will transform one of its oldest national traditions into the world’s largest stock market listed gambling company worth as much as €25bn ($35.2bn).The planned stock market listing of 30 per cent of Loterías y Apuestas del Estado, organiser of the country’s El Gordo, or the Fat One, Christmas lottery, is part of a planned multibillion-euro sale of public assets to slash government borrowing by a third this year.Spain’s socialist government, which suffered its worst defeat in the post-Franco era in this week’s regional elections amid protests in city centres, has also said it will sell 49 per cent of the state airports authority that controls Madrid and Barcelona airports to raise an additional €8bn.The planned autumn sale of the state lottery, which traces its roots back 199 years to Spain’s first modern lottery draw in Cadiz, is expected to raise between €6.5bn and €7.5bn. If completed it would create Europe’s most valuable listed gaming group and the biggest Spanish offering on record.Millions of Spaniards play the lottery each year, attracting revenues of €9.8bn on an average spend of €210 for each member of the population in 2009, or €77.36 each after prizes of €5.9bn.The thousands of prizes paid out in last Christmas’ El Gordo, or “Fat One”, lottery – including top rewards of €3m – came at a time when 22 per cent of the adult Spanish population are registered as unemployed.Loterías, which was established in its current form in 1985 by royal decree to unify Spain’s various state gaming enterprises, reported a net profit of just under €3bn in 2009, with €2.92bn going to the Spanish treasury.At the top end of its estimated value Loterías would be worth more than the top two gambling companies Las Vegas Sands and Sands China, making it the largest in the world by market value.Madrid is expected to officially announce a bank that will act as financial adviser for the sale this week, officials said, and will later select five investment banks to sell the shares in the company to investors.Lazard is viewed by company insiders as a favourite to manage the process, with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley among several others that are in the running for other roles, which count among the most prestigious investment banking mandates on offer in Europe this year, according to bankers.The sale of Loterias comes as several of Spain’s troubled private savings banks, known as cajas, are rushing to attract private investors after the Bank of Spain judged the sector as a whole to need an extra €15bn to cover soured loans made during Spain’s decade-long property boom.El Gordo, which last Christmas paid out €2.3bn in 1,700 prizes after a number picking ceremony in Madrid where school children sing out the winning numbers, is the largest Christmas lottery pay-out, with an estimated four in five Spaniards purchasing tickets.Tickets, which have a face value of €200, are frequently split into smaller amounts – often between co-workers, family and friends.
117;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-04-25T05:25:33Z;Macao: outstripping Vegas;An elegant indicator of the great global wealth transfer;There are few more elegant indicators of the great global wealth transfer than the revenue-per-available-room rates reported by the US casino operator, Wynn Resorts. In the first quarter of 2008, Wynn’s revpar was $285 in Las Vegas and $244 in Macao. In the first quarter of this year, the figures were $211 to $272 in Macao’s favour.It is difficult, indeed, to see what might upset the growth trajectory of this former Portuguese colony, the only place in China where casinos are legal. Restrictions on visas for mainland visitors and the opening of new casinos in Singapore have not done much to hurt it. Gross gaming receipts of $2.5bn in March were more than three times that of three years earlier. Wynn Macau, floated in Hong Kong in October 2009, soared to a high this week as it reported first-quarter profit up 66 per cent. Its price/book spread with its Paradise, Nevada-based parent, about 10 percentage points on debut, is now pushing 27.Tightened liquidity seems unlikely to curb demand. As Credit Suisse points out, junkets’ rolling-chip turnover – the aggregate bets placed by VIP gamblers – has continued to rise, even as China has restrained credit growth. Further restrictions on mainland visitors may not do it either, given the offsetting effect of improved travel links: a new light-rail line between Guangzhou and nearby Zhuhai, for example, has cut journey times by more than half. For casinos, the big risk is overzealous expansion. Yet in that event, investors would be better advised to rotate within the sector – buy the operator trading at below-average valuations but experiencing above-average growth – than exit altogether. Yes, this is a very crowded trade: Wynn Macau’s performance this year is 55 percentage points better than the benchmark. But sometimes there is wisdom in crowds.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
118;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Crackdown likely to change face of gaming;;Steve Wynn and other Las Vegas casino operators have hastily cancelled partnerships with the online poker companies that were on Friday charged by US prosecutors with illegal gambling, money laundering, bank fraud and other offences.Wynn Resorts on Saturday annulled its strategic relationship formed three weeks ago with PokerStars, while Fertitta Interactive, the owners of Station Casinos, also pulled its recently announced deal with Full Tilt, as the gambling industry scrambled to adjust to the impact of the new US crackdown on the sector’s online activity.The founders of PokerStars, Full Tilt and Absolute Poker, which dominate both the legal and illegal online poker market globally, face a host of criminal charges as well as a £3bn civil suit.After Congress passed laws in October 2006 banning online gambling transactions, operators fled the US and regrouped in Europe, where laws on online gambling were at the time opaque.PokerStars and Full Tilt, which continued to take US customers after the 2006 exodus, have in recent years moved into the regulated market that was beginning to take shape in Europe, advertising in jurisdictions such as the UK.But with US prosecutors seeking assistance from law enforcement agencies abroad to arrest some of the defendants and seize proceeds located outside the US, industry experts began questioning over the weekend whether there was a future for these companies in other jurisdictions.It could be to the benefit of online gambling companies listed in Europe, including Bwin. party, 888 and Sportingbet, at least in the short term. European operators have seen their poker liquidities suffer as PokerStars and Full Tilt marketed heavily to grab customers.One sector analyst who declined to be named said the indictments against the three companies should lead to a shift in market share to listed operators. “One never stops being amazed by the volatility in this sector,” the analyst said. “But it has to be good news for Bwin. party if the main competitors that have been dominant in the poker market are knocked out.”But any short-term benefit may be offset if the indictments lead to a brake on progress towards a regulated US market, something that companies such as Bwin. party and 888 need.Warwick Bartlett of Global Betting and Gaming Consultants said the indictments were “a game-changer – no question”.The sector, he said, was moving towards a position whereby online gambling round the world would either be legalised in markets that would tax operators heavily and regulate the activity closely – or it wouldn’t be legalised at all.“As government tax revenues decline those countries will act and join the high-tax, high-regulation, low-profitability club,” Mr Bartlett said. “The so-called grey market where a lack of law prevents the closure of internet gambling companies will disappear.”
119;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-04-04T20:54:17Z;US airlines hit by Southwest woes;;Shares in Southwest Airlines lost ground after a problem with one of its planes on Friday caused hundreds of its flights to be cancelled over the weekend, while the wider markets were broadly flat as gains in the materials sector were balanced by losses in technology stocks.The largest US airline by number of domestic passengers lost 1.7 per cent to $12.46 following the news that one of its aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing when a hole formed in its canopy.This then prompted planes to be grounded over the weekend and Monday as the airline examined its planes looking for metal fatigue and cracks.Related stocks also lost ground in the session. AMR, American Airlines’ parent company, was down 1.9 per cent to $6.27 while Hawaiian Holdings lost 2.5 per cent to $5.88.In the wider markets US equities struggled for direction, with the S&P 500 moving only fractionally higher to 1,332.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,399.96, just a hair’s breadth away from 12,400, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,789.19.The materials sector led the gains, boosted by deal activity and slightly higher commodity prices. Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, was up 12 per cent to $66.34, after it purchased a 90 per cent stake in AS Silmet, a rare earth processing facility in Europe, in a deal valued at $89m.Elsewhere, China’s Minmetals Resources launched a C$6.3bn hostile bid for Equinox Minerals, sending US shares in the Toronto-based miner up 30.1 per cent to $7.76.Massey Energy, the coal miner, was up 0.9 per cent to $69.87 while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, added 1.3 per cent to $55.77. The S&P materials sector was up 0.7 per cent.But these gains were balanced out by losses in the technology sector after the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales of semiconductors fell 1.1 per cent in February from the previous month to $25.2bn.Avago Technologies, a semiconductor company, lost 2.9 per cent to $30.60 while Nvidia, the graphics chipmaker, fell 3.6 per cent to $17.55. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.9 per cent while the S&P technology index fell 0.5 per cent, the worst performing of the S&P 500 sectors.This neutral session followed on from 0.5 per cent gains on Friday after news that 216,000 US jobs had been created in March and that the unemployment rate had fallen to a two-year low at 8.8 per cent.The S&P 500 is now up 6 per cent in the past three weeks, bouncing back from the losses sustained following the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. The index is 0.7 per cent below the mid-February high for the S&P before the geopolitical tensions began to affect the markets.According to Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund, technicals are going to be key over the coming months.He argues that if the S&P advances past 1,344, the mid-February high before the revolt in Egypt, then the index will continue up to 1,400. “If it fails to get to 1,344, we are going to retest the floor of 1,280,” he said.In corporate news, shares in Ambassadors International plunged 76.8 per cent to $0.65 after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. Ambassador is the parent company of Windstar Cruises, the cruise ship operator.In the preceding two days shares in the company had rocketed in value, gaining 194.7 per cent.Pfizer, the drugmaker, added 0.8 per cent to $20.54 after agreeing to sell Capsugel, the world’s largest maker of hard capsules, to private equity group KKR for $2.4bn in cash.The sale will allow Pfizer to buy back common stock this year in excess of the $5bn in repurchases it was planning. But Pfizer also lowered its revenue forecast for 2011 and trimmed its 2012 revenue guidance as a result of the deal.Shares in Ford Motor continued to gain ground after news on Friday that it had overtaken General Motors as North America’s top-selling carmaker in March, while reporting a 19 per cent gain in US sales.The carmaker was up 2.6 per cent to $15.56, helped by an upgrade by Credit Suisse to “neutral” from “underperform”.Shares of defence contractor General Dynamics fell 5.2 per cent to $73.37 after Gulfstream Aerospace, its business jet unit, said that a jet crashed during a test flight on Saturday.
120;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-03-31T20:27:34Z;Gaming merger aims to outplay US rivals;;Bwin.party became the world’s biggest listed online gambling company on Thursday, the product of two very different cultures that are merging to compete with big US rivals.The new entity traded for the first time on the London Stock Exchange after the merger of Bwin, the Austria-based sportsbook specialist, and UK-based Party Gaming, whose dominance of online poker six years ago made it one of the biggest noises in the FTSE 100.The merger was first aired in December 2008 at McDonald’s just north of Gibraltar, where Bwin and PartyGaming are licensed. Their offices are about a thousand metres apart. Yet it has taken eight months since it was announced for the deal to complete.“It was a rollercoaster,” says Jim Ryan, the Party Gaming chief executive who will share the role in Bwin.party with Bwin’s Norbert Teufelberger. “[There were] issues to do with valuation, issues to do with structure.”As well as merger talks, they held separately discussions with other companies. “Whenever we stumbled on a particular issue, we had other people to talk to,” Mr Ryan says.Both companies were “industry dinosaurs”, as Mr Teufelberger puts it, with different strengths and weaknesses. PartyGaming had poker, better cost control and a stronger grip on the US market, where it dominated until the US legal clampdown in 2006 forced out several European operators. Bwin had sports betting, brand-building expertise and better knowledge of the fragmented European markets.One of the principal aims of the merger was to create scale to compete more effectively. Analysts forecast 2011 revenues of the new entity at €841m ($1.2bn, £739m). The company, which will yield €55m in synergies, says pro forma earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for 2010 were €171m. That is well below the €196m forecast last year, after Bwin last week reported a 77 per cent fall in earnings before tax and interest because of merger-related IT costs.Still, on the European stage, that leaves Bwin.party about two to three times bigger than its nearest listed online rivals, although both William Hill and Ladbrokes outrank it when revenues and earnings from their betting shops are included.But PartyGaming has found competition from private operators particularly tough. PokerStars and Full Tilt, the two big online poker businesses that have dominated the unregulated US poker market since Party­Gaming left the field, have also taken market share in the regulated European territories.By merging poker liquidities – in other words combining the number of poker players and the amounts staked – Mr Ryan hopes to insulate better its PartyPoker brand from PokerStars and Full Tilt’s march on Europe.“I don’t know that there’s any competitor out there who has a scale to attack and be successful in each of those markets over the course of the next couple of years,” says Mr Ryan. “This is what this merger does for us.”Bwin.party expects to be at the forefront as European markets are liberalised. But it is to the US that many eyes in the sector are turned, as a host of US politicians at federal and state level have drawn up draft bills for the long-awaited regulation of online gambling.Bwin.party has contributed ideas on tax models for the US and is talking to the bodies that run American football, baseball and basketball, longstanding opponents of sports betting. But most analysts believe any online gambling legislation will be weighted in favour of US operators. European entities’ best hope is to form joint ventures with US companies to capture a slice of the US market.US companies are already positioning themselves. Wynn Resorts, the Las Vegas casino operator, and PokerStars last week announced a “strategic relationship”, a move that analysts say could make it difficult for European operators to gain noticeable US market share.Reports on Thursday suggested Full Tilt was due to announce a partnership with the owners of Station Casinos.Mr Ryan prefers to interpret the move as a positive catalyst for US regulation rather than a threat to Bwin.party’s ambitions.
121;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-03-31T18:34:41Z;Sands China in regulatory probe;;Sands China, the Macao casino group controlled by Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson, has revealed it is being probed by Hong Kong’s securities watchdog for alleged breaches of regulations.The news comes a month after the company’s New York-listed parent, Las Vegas Sands, disclosed that US federal and state authorities were investigating its compliance with laws that prohibit bribing foreign officials.Shares in Sands China slid 5.7 per cent to HK$17.36 in Hong Kong on Thursday.In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, the company said it had been asked by the Securities and Futures Commission to produce “certain documents” but declined to provide any details.People familiar with the matter said the SFC investigation was launched several months ago, independently of the US investigations.Lawyers and analysts on Thursday speculated that the SFC probe might be connected to a wrongful termination lawsuit filed in the US last year by Steven Jacobs, the former chief executive of Sands China.Mr Jacobs alleged in a Nevada court filing that he was fired “without cause” last year, after resisting “repeated and outrageous demands” by Mr Adelson to “use improper ‘leverage’ against senior government officials of Macao”.Mr Jacobs also alleged he was asked to “refrain from disclosing truthful and material information” to the Sands China board, “so that it could decide if such information relating to material financial events, corporate governance, and corporate independence should be disclosed …to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange”.The SFC regulates all companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and has been taking a harder line against companies that provide false or misleading information to the public.Mr Adelson has said Mr Jacobs’ accusations are baseless.Speaking about the US probe at a conference this week in Las Vegas, Mr Adelson said: “When the smoke clears, I am absolutely, not 100 per cent, but 1,000 per cent positive that there won’t be any fire below it. We’re going to be found absolutely clean.”Analysts said the SFC investigation would only add to the uncertainty surrounding Sands China and its parent Las Vegas Sands.Aaron Fischer, of CLSA, said: “There could be a negative earnings impact in the short term because some players might feel less comfortable gambling at the Sands properties.“But we don’t think over the long term there will be any serious impact like losing a licence.”Sands China is one of six casino groups licensed to operate in Macao, a former Portuguese colony that is now the world’s biggest gaming market.Competitors include MGM Resorts International and Wynn Macau, a unit of Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts.Besides Macao, Las Vegas Sands operates in the highly regulated markets of Nevada, Singapore and Pennsylvania.
122;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-03-26T02:59:34Z;Push to reform US online gambling laws;;Steve Wynn, the casino mogul who reshaped Las Vegas in the 1980s, is leading a push to reform internet gambling legislation in the US after striking a deal with PokerStars, one of the leading online poker operators.Wynn Resorts, which owns the Wynn and Encore casinos in Las Vegas, has formed a “strategic relationship” with PokerStars which will culminate in a co-branded online poker site, if their efforts to reform the laws are successful.In a joint statement the two companies said they would “work to secure the passage of federal legislation that will … define illegal internet gambling … and establish a regime for the assessment and collection of taxes”.Although millions of Americans play online poker, it is illegal to own or operate a site from within the US, which means the biggest companies are all based off-shore.But Mr Wynn, who built sprawling Las Vegas resort casinos such as the Bellagio and the Mirage, said that the “lack of regulation of internet gaming within the US must change”.His support for a change in the laws is significant because Las Vegas casino operators have in the past been among those most keen to protect the status quo. “We must recognise that [online gambling] is occurring and that law enforcement does not have the tools to stop it,” he said.“As a company that has safely conducted gaming in the US for more than 40 years, we believe that the same can be done for poker on the internet.”Cash-strapped US states are exploring the legalisation of online poker with the aim of generating much needed tax revenues which could go towards paying off record deficits.California, Iowa and Florida are among the states considering legalisation. New Jersey was also considering legalisation but Chris Christie, the state’s governor, recently vetoed a legalisation bill. Still, momentum for new legislation continues to grow and in Mr Wynn the legalisation lobby has a key casino figure in its camp.“With this deal PokerStars now has one of the most influential people in Las Vegas on its side as it seeks inclusion in any federal poker legislation, while Wynn has the biggest poker operator as a partner, with industry-leading technology and an immense database of players,” said Ed Birkin, an analyst with Barclays Capital, in a research note.PokerStars, which is licensed and registered on the Isle of Man, said it was “closely regulated in many European countries” and had been “endorsing the adoption of the same approach in the United States for years, with [the alliance with Wynn Resorts] representing a critical step in that direction.”“We have long supported the enactment of local regulatory regimes that protect consumers and provide valuable tax revenues and jobs,” said Mark Scheinberg, chairman and founder of PokerStars.
123;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-02-04T21:48:47Z;Wall St shrugs off weak jobs data;;Wall Street edged higher led by tech stocks as investors shrugged off weak January employment data.The S&P technology index was up 1.1 per cent to 472.98 headed by JDS Uniphase after the company posted forecast-beating second-quarter earnings.The maker of communications equipment for telecom and cable companies was up 29.9 per cent to $22.75 after reporting revenues up 38 per cent and earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations.Related technology stocks were lifted by the news. F5 Networks, a cloud computing software maker, was up 4.6 per cent to $123.64 while Juniper Networks, the world’s second-biggest maker of data networking equipment gained 4.1 per cent to $40.06.But the key event concerning the markets was the January non-farm payroll figures, which showed that only 36,000 new jobs had been created last month. Economists had expected 136,000.Traders were left unsure which way to turn for much of the day, however, after the data also showed that the unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level since April 2009. Unemployment was expected to rise slightly, but instead fell to 9 per cent from 9.4 per cent. This was partly caused by a fall in the size of the labour force, however. Many commentators were quick to point out that the headline 36,000 figure was not as bad as it seemed as the adverse weather conditions during the sampling week would have skewed the data.Ira Jersey, a US interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse, said: “The results were not as bad as they seemed. At best, the results were expected and at worse they were a little below consensus,” Mr Jersey said.Equities were in negative territory for much of the day, but rallied in late trade as investors finally concluded that the data was an aberration. “We discounted today’s headline employment figure because of the poor weather during the sampling week,” said Bob Baur chief global economist at Principal Global Investors.The S&P 500 closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,310.87, helping the index gain 1.9 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to close at 12,092.15, the first time the index has ended a week above 12,000 since June 13, 2008. The index was up 1.7 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent in the session to 2,769.30, a rise of 2.6 per cent over the past five days.Also preventing the markets from losing ground over the employment numbers on Friday was the fact that the whole week had seen promising economic data. The ADP employment survey on Wednesday estimated that 187,000 non-farm private jobs were added in January. Figures from the Labor Department on Thursday showed job increases last month, and other reports showed strong manufacturing and service sector growth in the US economy.In other earnings news Las Vegas Sands posted disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares in casino stocks lower. The global casino group saw profit and revenue jump in the quarter, helped by growth in its Macao and Singapore operations, but investors had hoped for greater revenues and so the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $46.03.This weighed on related stocks. Wynn Resorts, another US casino operator, was down 1.1 per cent to $118.06 while MGM Resorts was 2.2 per cent lower at $14.81.Elsewhere, Power One, which makes power converters, were down 21.2 per cent to $9.26 after giving a weak first-quarter revenue outlook. This came despite the company posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Coinstar, the vending machine and DVD rental kiosk operator, was down 11.9 per cent to $38.96 after saying that its first-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street’s expectations.The week on Wall Street began with a rebound following the sharp 1.8 per cent losses seen at the end of the previous week.This was helped on Monday by near record quarterly profits from Exxon-Mobil and news on Tuesday that Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, reported a threefold rise in quarterly profits. ExxonMobil was up 3.2 per cent to $83.28 over the week while Pfizer added 5.9 per cent to $19.30.Strong economic data also lifted sentiment. Solid data on consumer spending, manufacturing and employment gave investors cause to be hopeful about the pace of the US recovery.After healthy gains on Monday and Tuesday, however, Wall Street stalled.The S&P kept just above the 1,300 mark while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just above 12,000.
124;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2011-01-24T19:41:05Z;Ho keeps Macao casinos stake in the family;;Stanley Ho, the billionaire chairman of Macao’s biggest casino operator SJM, has handed over his shareholding to family members in order to ensure a smooth transition of control of his gaming empire.Mr Ho’s 31.65 per cent stake in STDM, the controlling shareholder of SJM, will be roughly split between Chan un-Chan, Mr Ho’s third wife, and his second wife’s five children – Pansy Ho, Daisy Ho, Maisy Ho, Josie Ho and Lawrence Ho.A company statement said 89-year-old Mr Ho no longer had an “attributable interest in shares of the company”.Mr Ho, who retains a nominal 100 shares in STDM, has been in frail health since he suffered a head injury in 2009.“There was a concern among shareholders that there would be a bun fight [for control of the company], but that seems less likely, given these actions,” said Philip Tulk, an analyst with RBS.SJM’s shares, which hit a 52-week high last week of HK$15.04, closed down 4 per cent at HK$13.80.Aaron Fischer, an analyst at CLSA, said he was “not surprised” by the announcement.“He is simply passing on his shares to his family members,” Mr Fischer said.Analysts said they did not expect the move to have any effect on the management of SJM.Last month, Angela Leong, Mr Ho’s fourth wife, was appointed managing director of SJM, which followed the transfer of 7 per cent of SJM to Ms Leong in December.“The conventional wisdom is that Angela Leong will be leading the company,” Mr Tulk said.While Mr Ho’s decades-long monopoly of the casino industry in Macao ended in 2002, SJM still controls about a third of the market in the former Portuguese colony, which has outstripped Las Vegas in annual revenues.Gaming revenues increased by almost 60 per cent in 2010, as wealthy Chinese flocked from the mainland to the tiny territory. Wynn Resorts and Sheldon Adelson’s Sands China are major competitors to SJM’s businesses.Melco Crown Entertainment, a joint venture between Lawrence Ho’s company and Australian billionaire James Packer, and MGM Resorts International’s MGM Macau, a joint venture with Pansy Ho, also have significant shares of the gaming market in Macao.

128;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2010-09-29T08:59:31Z;Macao tries to cool housing market;;Macao has unveiled measures to cool its property market amid concerns that low interest rates and strong Chinese demand are fuelling a bubble, following similar recent moves by Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and mainland China.The government said it would increase land supply, tighten mortgage lending rules and increase transaction costs in an effort to take the steam out of speculative activity.Once a sleepy gambling backwater, Macao has been growing at a breakneck rate since the beginning of this decade. The economy took off after it liberalised the gaming market and brought in more casino operators, including Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and Melco Crown Entertainment. The city overtook Las Vegas as the world’s biggest gaming market in 2006.While gaming revenue rose rapidly, however, so did house prices. Residential property prices in Macao have increased almost a third since the end of 2008, according to KB Wong, director of valuation and advisory services at DTZ, the property consultancy.Macao’s tightening measures come as other Asian countries move to curb the rise in house prices. In China, premier Wen Jiabao this month called on local governments to take part in a drive to discourage speculation and said that limiting price increases was central to maintaining social stability.On Wednesday, Singapore’s Straits Times reported that several banks in the city state had seen a drop in home loans applications after the government moved to cool its market for the third time in a year a month earlier.Hong Kong last month also raised minimum deposits for luxury properties and released additional land for development following price rises of about 40 per cent since the end of 2008. Australia in April reinstated a range of measures to restrict foreign investment in residential property following months of complaints that foreigners were pushing up prices.Like Hong Kong, the luxury property market in Macao has also seen much stronger growth, thanks to heavy buying interest from mainland Chinese and Hong Kong investors. The higher-end of the market, Mr Wong said, had risen as much as 40 per cent in the past three years.“The biggest problem in Macao is prices are now so high that ordinary people cannot afford to buy,” said Mr Wong.According to government data, the median monthly income in Macao was about MOP8,500 ($1,064) in the second quarter of this year, the same level as it was in the last quarter of 2008.To curb foreign buying, the government said non-Macao residents would need to put down a 30 per cent deposit for flats costing less than MOP3.3m, compared with a 10 per cent requirement for Macanese. Down-payments for flats above that value will be 30 per cent regardless of the buyers’ nationality.

130;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2010-05-23T22:01:11Z;Viva Macau downfall offers cautionary tale;Airline carrier contests loss of operating certificate;The sudden collapse of a budget airline in Macao has demonstrated that regulatory risk can still trump seemingly safe bets in the world’s largest gambling market.While most foreign investors have benefited handsomely from the Chinese special administrative region’s fivefold increase in gaming revenues since 2002 – which has in turn fuelled the local tourism and property markets – the decline and fall of Viva Macau offers a cautionary tale.Viva was controlled by MKW Capital Management, an international private equity fund, and counted among its investors the nephew and late brother of Edmund Ho, Macao’s first chief executive after the former Portuguese colony returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999.The start-up carrier operated under a sub-concession arrangement with Air Macau, which in effect allowed Viva to “piggy-back” off the licence of the Chinese state-owned incumbent. This pragmatic structure was first pioneered, with the Macao government’s blessing, in the gambling industry. The city’s three original casino licence holders – Galaxy Entertainment, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau and Wynn Resorts – were allowed to grant one sub-concession to a competitor.Las Vegas Sands, which runs the world’s two largest casinos in Macao, MGM Mirage and James Packer’s Crown group all owe their presence in the Chinese special administrative region to a derivative licence.Viva’s problems began in late March after a payment dispute with its long-standing fuel supplier, the Nam Kwong group, also controlled by the Chinese government. The airline said it was refused fuel despite having a positive credit balance with Nam Kwong.“Nam Kwong was the largest beneficiary of Viva’s business,” said one person familiar with the dispute. “Their decision to cut Viva off was beyond comprehension.” Viva and MKW, whose website notes “we succeed when our companies succeed”, declined to comment. Nam Kwong could not be reached for comment.With Viva forced to cancel flights and its passengers stranded, Macao’s government entered the fray. Citing “[the need] to protect Macao’s image as a tourism city”, the government announced on March 28 that it “had requested and obtained Air Macau’s consent to terminate its sub-concession contract with Macau”. On the same day, Macao’s Civil Aviation Authority revoked Viva’s air operator certificate.Viva is contesting the revocation in Macao’s courts, and has held talks with overseas airlines eager to establish a presence in the territory. Some executives say Viva’s fate highlights a dramatic change in local leadership styles after Mr Ho stepped down in December and was replaced by Fernando Chui, a former minister for social and cultural affairs.Though both hail from two of the territory’s richest families, Mr Ho was much more of a wheeler-dealer. “Everyone in Macao has got a story about calling Edmund with a proposal and hearing him say ‘Why not?’,” says one banker. “The new chief executive is a bureaucrat.”
131;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2010-05-03T18:17:10Z;One oligarch does not a geoeconomic trend make;;"The Russians are coming, aren’t they?UC Rusal’s controversial, but ultimately successful, Hong Kong listing was supposed to be the harbinger of an important new geoeconomic trend. If the heavily indebted aluminium group, controlled by oligarch Oleg Deripaska, could raise $2.2bn on the Chinese special administrative region’s stock exchange, surely other Russian resource companies would follow its lead?The story pitch went something along these lines: by listing in Hong Kong, Russian resource companies intent on tapping the China market could themselves claim to be part Chinese and share the wealth with Chinese shareholders.Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands, the American casino companies making money hand over fist in China’s other SAR, Macao, hailed a similar symbiosis when they listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year.More than three months on from Rusal’s Hong Kong debut, however, and local investors are still awaiting the much anticipated Russian invasion.Strikeforce Mining & Resources, which mines copper and molybdenum, is looking at a modest $200m Hong Kong IPO, people close to the deal confirmed on Monday.But SMR, too, is controlled by Mr Deripaska. What of Russia’s other oligarchs?Sergey Popov’s coal company, Suek, is reportedly setting its sites on a £2bn initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, despite concerted lobbying from senior executives at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.One oligarch, in other words, does not a trend make. Until Mr Deripaska’s peers follow him to Hong Kong, talk of a brave new Sino-Russian financial axis will remain just that.Reading the futuresThe future, we all know, is in the stars. So it is appropriate that the multinational team of eggheads trying to predict bubbles in financial markets at Switzerland’s prestigious Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich should call itself the financial crisis “observatory”.On Monday, the number gazers revealed the results of their boldest experiment to date – a six-month exercise, inaugurated last November and concluded this month, to see whether their mind-boggling mathematical models had real predictive power regarding four widely different asset classes.From Brazil’s Bovespa equity index, a Merrill Lynch European corporate bond index, the gold spot price and, as of December, cotton futures, the mathematicians and economists put their algorithms to work identifying trends, based on a fundamental belief in their ability to detect underlying patterns.The aim was to test two key hypotheses: whether bubbles can be diagnosed in real time before they end; and whether the termination point can be predicted with a higher probability than just chance.The result, according to Didier Sornette, professor of entrepreneurial risks, was broadly positive. The modelling was judged – using layman’s language – to have scored a win for the equity index and the gold price, a draw in the case of cotton, and be subject to a replay for the bond index, because of special circumstances. Of course, mathematical modelling of complex financial markets is nothing new, even if the technological firepower being devoted to it is constantly evolving with spiralling computing power. Likewise, the models themselves are being steadily refined. Prof Sornette, previously at the University of California in Los Angeles, is a mathematician and physicist who also teaches earth sciences.Needless to say, a precise judgment about the success of the experiment depends profoundly on the definitions and on where the experimenters place their goalposts. Some might quibble about the precise meaning of “bubble”, others about the degree of statistical correlation sufficient to deem a prediction accurate.But “observatory” members argue that, in spite of such definitional differences, their findings break new ground. While myriad academics are researching market phenomena, Prof Sornette says most content themselves with proof of concept and looking to the past, rather than daring to make predictive forecasts, then publicly put to the test.Perhaps more relevant to mere mortals, much of the brainpower being applied to such subjects is taking place behind the very closed doors of hedge funds and the like. By contrast, the Zurich team is based at a university where the incentive and mission is to publish. Emboldened by their first findings, the Zurich stargazers are now broadening their work to seven more asset classes, before boldly going even further. Some may dismiss their efforts as more akin to astrology than astronomy, but hedge funds are apparently already keen to learn more about their methods.world.view@ft.com"
132;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;MGM Mirage’s ‘serious’ business in Macao;;Stanley Ho, the Chinese gaming tycoon, could not believe the proposal he received in the spring of 2002. “Are you serious,” he asked Philip Wang, an emissary sent by MGM Mirage to enquire about the tycoon’s interest in forming a Macao joint venture with the US gambling group.“We are very, very serious,” replied Mr Wang, a senior vice-president for MGM Mirage.“[The approach] was really a wild card,” he later told investigators from New Jersey’s Division of Gaming Enforcement. “At the time, we were very desperate.”MGM Mirage, controlled by Kirk Kerkorian, had finished fifth in the race for three new casino concessions in Macao, the Chinese special administrative region that is today the world’s biggest gaming market.One had gone to Mr Ho’s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, the others to MGM Mirage’s US rivals, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts.“We licked our wounds for a bit, and then tried to analyse whether there were any other opportunities for us to enter the Macao market,” Gary Jacobs, MGM Mirage’s former general counsel, told the DGE in a regulatory report completed in May 2009 but only released this week.MGM Mirage eventually formed a joint venture with Mr Ho’s daughter, Pansy, that gained entry to Macao after three more gaming concessions were approved by the government.The report, citing Mr Ho’s alleged association with Asian organised crime figures, recommended that Pansy Ho be declared an “unsuitable” partner and that MGM Mirage “disengage from any direct or indirect business or financial association with [her]”.But rather than heed New Jersey’s directive, MGM Mirage this week agreed to sell its 50 per cent interest in the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City and continue its partnership with Ms Ho.Ms Ho declined to comment on the New Jersey report. Mr Ho has consistently denied any connections with Macao or Hong Kong criminal gangs, or triads.“The DGE’s report acknowledges there is no evidence that Pansy Ho has engaged in any wrongdoing or been accused of any illegal activity,” Jim Murren, MGM Mirage chief executive, said in a statement.But the DGE’s report lays bare the company’s efforts to enter Macao and harshly criticises its due diligence procedures.The DGE also details Ms Ho’s financial dependence on her father. According to the report, Mr Ho established a special “Petunia Trust” on his daughter’s behalf, which she used to fund her investment in the joint venture with MGM Mirage.In addition, Ms Ho borrowed money from Goldman Sachs, HSBC and UBS.The patriarch’s largesse also extends to Ms Ho’s younger sister, Daisy, who the report says receives a monthly “allowance” of $25,000 from her father.This is in addition to the considerable salaries, expense accounts and share benefits both women enjoy as executives and directors at their father’s holding company, Sociedade de Turismo de Macau, and Hong Kong-listed conglomerate Shun Tak Holdings.The attempt to form a joint venture with Mr Ho foundered in 2003 when a regulator in Nevada, where MGM Mirage is based, warned that the state’s Gaming Control Board would not approve it.“Specifically, [the regulator] raised concerns about Stanley Ho’s alleged organised crime connections, issues involving loan sharking and debt collection at his Macao casinos, and Stanley Ho’s [negative] experiences with other casino regulatory agencies,” the report says.While there is no evidence that Mr Ho is personally connected to the Asian underworld, his casinos’ long-established practice of sub-contracting so-called “VIP rooms” to outside operators has given an unsavoury cast of characters entry to Macao’s gaming market.“You would have to be living under a rock not to know about Stanley Ho and what the [negative] perception of Stanley Ho is,” Terry Lanni, MGM Mirage’s former chairman and chief executive, told the DGE. “There was no way of clearing Stanley Ho in the eyes of regulators.”MGM Mirage therefore turned its attention to forming a 50-50 joint venture with Ms Ho, in the hope she would be seen as sufficiently independent from her controversial father.That was indeed the conclusion of regulators in Nevada, Illinois, Michigan and Mississippi, and the two partners opened the $1.25bn MGM Grand Macau in December 2007.Where other state regulators saw a daughter independent from her father, New Jersey saw a fig leaf and a catalogue of due diligence failings at MGM Mirage.The company, however, is unlikely to miss Atlantic City, where overall casino revenues were $260m in February – compared with $1.8bn in Macao.Additional reporting by Justine Lau.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.5 per cent to 10,583.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.7 per cent at 2,308.42.“The ISM [manufacturing] report was more encouraging news and we seem to be on track for a recovery,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “Towards the end of the year, a number of money managers were trying to protect gains. In that protective mode, people were not as aggressive about deploying money into equities. But now, when you take the gloves off, we’ll see what investors’ true inclinations are in terms of what they think about the economy and which sectors they put their money into.”The price of US crude jumped above $80 a barrel following encouraging Chinese manufacturing data, helping to lift the S&P 500 energy sector 2.8 per cent.Shares in Chesapeake Energy climbed 8.5 per cent to $28.09 after Total, Europe’s third-largest oil producer, agreed to buy a quarter of the company’s assets in Texas.The joint venture, which is worth up to $2.25bn, will allow Total to expand into the US shale gas business.Barron’s also forecast that Chevron’s share price could rally as much as 20 per cent over the next 12 months as oil prices rise.The recommendation helped the country’s second-largest energy producer gain 2.7 per cent to $79.06.Deutsche Bank gave an extra boost to CVR Energy and Tesoro, raising the oil refiners from “hold” to “buy”. CVR gained 8.3 per cent to $7.43 while Tesoro, which was identified as a potential takeover target, was up 9.3 per cent at $14.81.Metal prices also rose sharply, lifting Alcoa 3.3 per cent to $16.65. The steepest daily increase in gold prices for more than two months boosted shares in Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer of the metal, 2.6 per cent to $40.39.Boeing, the world’s second-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, helped to lift the industrials sector 1.7 per cent higher.Barclays Capital raised the stock to “overweight”, saying that the company was in a good position to benefit from recovery after resolving disputes with its suppliers and completing a successful 787 test flight.Jesup & Lamont also upgraded the manufacturer from “hold” to “buy”, making Boeing its top pick in commercial aerospace. Its shares were up 3.8 per cent to $56.18.Novartis surprised investors with a plan to buy out minority shareholders in Alcon, the US eyecare company, for the equivalent of $11.2bn in equity. The Swiss drugmaker had already agreed to purchase Nestlé’s majority stake in the company. The announcement sent shares in Alcon down 5.7 per cent to $154.98.In the financial sector, Credit Suisse raised Morgan Stanley from “neutral” to “outperform” on the same day as UBS raised its recommendation on the bank from “neutral” to “buy”.Analysts said this year would prove to be an “inflection point” for Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest US lender by assets, as it benefited from its joint venture with Smith Barney. Its shares rose 4.4 per cent to $30.91. UBS also gave a boost to casino stocks, raising both Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts from “neutral” to “buy”.Las Vegas Sands would be likely to beat gaming revenue estimates this year thanks to its Macau business, the bank’s analysts predicted.Its shares, which surged about 150 per cent last year, were up 11.2 per cent to $16.62. Wynn gained 9.8 per cent to $63.96 after analysts recommended the company on the basis of its attractive valuation.Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, gained 2.4 per cent to $20.88 after hitting its highest intraday price for almost three months.
134;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-11-08T20:43:56Z;Online gambling moves need traditional backing;;While online poker companies and US gamblers have greeted this year’s proposed legalisation measures with enthusiasm, such efforts are unlikely to succeed without further support from traditional bricks and mortar casinos.The most recent important move by online gaming supporters in Congress came in August, when senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey introduced a bill that would exempt “games of skill”, which it explicitly defined to include poker, chess and backgammon, from gambling bans.Mr Menendez’s bill follows the introduction in the spring of a more sweeping attempt at legalisation and regulation by Barney Frank, a powerful House committee chair. Mr Frank has been swamped with financial regulation and other economic crisis issues but looks likely to get his bill at least to a floor vote.The Senate has long been seen as the trickier of the two legislative bodies to get through and poker lobbyists gave Mr Menendez’s bill a warm welcome. But while the senator plays a role in the Democratic leadership, he does not chair a relevant committee and has no co-sponsors for his measure. No hearings have been scheduled and that would ordinarily be the next step.Regardless of Senate procedures, the bottom line is that no legislation on internet gambling is going to become law without the consent of Senator Harry Reid, former Nevada Gaming Commission chairman, who as Senate majority leader is the most important man in the chamber.“I would agree that Harry Reid is critical to any gaming issue that is going to move through,” said John Pappas, executive director of the Poker Players Alliance. “We’re hopeful we can continue to educate him.”Mr Reid has not moved from his position, which is that internet poker would be too unwieldy to control, Jim Manley, his spokesman, said on Friday. “He’s still pretty sceptical about the ability to regulate online gaming,” Mr Manley told the Financial Times.Mr Reid is the Senate’s biggest recipient of donations from the casino industry and the bricks and mortar industry remains divided. Harrah’s Entertainment and MGM Mirage favour allowing some online betting, while Wynn Resorts and others are opposed.That split has taken the traditional companies’ American Gaming Association out of the fight.The Players Alliance acknowledged it would help if it could win support from others in the non-virtual side of the industry.Mr Pappas said positive sentiment would inevitably spread in Las Vegas as the companies realised that online poker was the “way of the future”.In the meantime, federal prosecutors continue to seize funds moving between gambling companies and their clients and occasionally to wrest guilty pleas from executives.And even the best-laid lobbying campaigns can backfire.David Carruthers, then chief executive of London-traded BetonSports, once wrote an op-ed piece supporting the US legalisation of sports betting, while his company secretly controlled the industry group the Offshore Gaming Association.The latter fact emerged only after his indictment. Mr Carruthers is due to be sentenced in about two months’ time.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
136;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-11-03T23:28:34Z;Las Vegas;;Las Vegas is a microcosm of the US economy, geared to the spending habits of the US consumer and thus facing an uncertain future. Lack of consensus on Sin City’s prospects was evident last week in the third-quarter results of its gaming companies, some of which narrowly escaped debt-related disaster this year. Wynn Resorts’ Steve Wynn rattled share prices with a gloomy prognosis for high-roller spending and downmarket regional operators echoed it. Yet, with MGM Mirage set to report on Thursday, convention specialist Las Vegas Sands ended the week trumpeting the return of group bookings, which bolster mid-week occupancy.MGM, which makes about 80 per cent of its earnings in the City of Dreams, is likely to be upbeat, as it has been throughout this downturn. The nightmare isn’t over, however. Visitors are spending less away from the tables, three-fifths of Strip revenues in 2008. Meanwhile, Vegas’s fortunes are more tied to conference and convention spending than previously, and sectors such as finance and automotive remain feeble. Aggressively filling 2010 schedules comes at the expense of room rates. With MGM’s CityCenter development adding 6,000 rooms this year, pricing pressure is set to rise.Doubts have started to creep in. After last week’s rout MGM shares are a third below their September high, at which point Barclays Capital notes they priced in spending growth similar to previous recoveries in spite of the mismatch between visitor numbers and room supply. The shares are still trading close to the top of their historical range for enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. True, they went higher in the froth of the credit spree. But a meaningful move upwards from here would require a bet on consumers returning to free-spending ways and a comeback for land sales and grandiose developments – all of which appear unlikely.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter
137;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-10-19T16:45:29Z;Billionaire paid price to revive Sands’ fortunes;;Deep in the heart of the Venetian casino in Las Vegas, past the whirring slot machines, the canals and singing gondoliers, Sheldon Adelson is plotting the next phase of his company’s expansion.Poring over plans for Marina Bay Sands, his new $5.5bn casino hotel project in Singapore, the 76-year-old billionaire is in a combative mood, heaping scorn on the “doubting Thomases” who wrote off Las Vegas Sands during the financial crisis.It has been a tumultuous year for the casino resort group controlled by Mr Adelson. With markets tumbling following the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September, shares in Las Vegas Sands fell 99 per cent. They hit a low of $1.38 in March amid fears the company would breach its debt covenants and be forced into bankruptcy.In an interview with the Financial Times Mr Adelson, who ploughed $1bn of his own money into Las Vegas Sands to keep it afloat, says the company’s critics were wrong. “I kept saying to everybody: our business model is still intact. Why is the stock going down?”“It was bewildering to me. Nothing in our company had fundamentally changed. Our pipeline of growth was there and is still there today.”With resorts across the globe, Las Vegas Sands is asset-rich. But it is also highly leveraged, with net debt of about $10bn and a costly development pipeline that includes its project in Singapore and a cluster of new hotels in Macao that will supplement properties it operates there, such as the Venetian Macao and Sands Macao.Investor fears were stoked by the company’s admission last November that its ability to continue operations was in “substantial doubt” if it failed to raise new capital. The warning came as the group suspended construction of new projects in Macao.Yet Mr Adelson, the son of a Boston cab-driver, has succeeded over the past year in bringing the company back from the brink. A management shake-up and a capital injection of $1bn from the billionaire and his family helped the group to a more sound financial footing.The group shored up its balance sheet and completed a $2.1bn share sale. After hitting $1.38 in March the shares have climbed past $18, valuing the company now at $12bn.More recently, it announced plans for an initial public offering in Hong Kong of its Macao assets. Analysts expect the company to raise $2bn-$3bn, which could further firm up the balance sheet and mean construction of suspended Macao projects is restarted.Mr Adelson declines to comment on the Hong Kong IPO, which could happen by the end of next month. But he denies ever fearing that the group risked bankruptcy. “Never,” he growls. “Not for a moment. I wasn’t going to cap my career of 64 years with a loss.”However, he admits the year had some low points. “I bit the bullet and I sold equity. That was the lowest point …because I felt that my job was to enhance shareholder value and here I had diluted it, including [my own stake].“But I paid the price. I put up $1bn to save the company. We were down as low as [a market capitalisation of] $1bn and we’re back to $12bn today.”The equity sale diluted his stake from 69 per cent to 52 per cent. But the recent revival in the company’s shares has lifted the value of his holding up to $6bn from about $500m at the low point this year.Despite the improvement, his stake is still a long way off $36bn, the approximate value of his holding when Las Vegas Sands shares hit their peak of $144 in October 2007.Mr Adelson credits Michael Leven, his new chief operating officer, for much of the success in turning the company round. Mr Leven replaced Bill Weidner, Mr Adelson’s long-time second-in-command, who left Las Vegas Sands at the end of 2008. With Mr Leven in place, the group embarked on a cost-cutting programme, shedding 6,000 jobs and cutting $600m of costs.As trading conditions have stabilised, Mr Adelson reiterates his support for the group’s business model. Unlike his competitors MGM Mirage and Wynn Resorts, his model depends on the sale of non-core assets, such as shopping malls or condominiums, to support debt incurred in building his casino hotels.“I borrow money and I pay it back from the sale of non-core assets which I build specifically for this purpose. And then I’ll have my core assets debt free.” He estimates markets will return to normal within the next two or three years, allowing him to sell off non-core assets, such as the company’s retail operations in Macao.The past 12 months have been anything but normal, but analysts say Mr Adelson’s actions helped ensure Las Vegas Sands’ survival. “He bought stock in the open market, which was a sign he still believed there was a lot of inherent value in the company,” says Dennis Farrell, a gaming analyst with Wachovia Capital Markets. “It said: we believe this company is a survivor.”
138;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-10-09T09:49:55Z;Wynn’s debut defies recent gloom;;Wynn Macau, controlled by US gaming tycoon Steve Wynn, rose as much as 13 per cent in its trading debut on Friday, defying the recent trend of disappointing first-day performances by new stocks in Hong Kong.Wynn shares closed up 6.9 per cent at HK$10.78, after hitting HK$11.40 in early trading. The company, which holds the Macao operations of Wynn Resorts, priced its US$1.6bn listing at the upper end of a price range at HK$10.08 a share.While Hong Kong’s initial public offering market has been very active, with a slew of companies still in the pipeline to sell shares in coming months, there has been concern about whether investor demand is cooling after a string of weak debuts.At least five companies dived below their issue prices on their trading debuts in Hong Kong since September. These include Glorious Property, which fell 15 per cent on its first day of trading last week, and Metallurgical Corporation of China, the world’s second largest IPO this year which closed down nearly 12 per cent on its debut last month.This week, Powerlong Real Estate, the Chinese property group, delayed the trading of its shares after pricing its HK$2.75bn (US$353m) IPO below an indicative range.However, sentiments appeared to be improving after five small listings advanced on their first day of trading in the last few days. Fine jewellery designer Eternite surged 62 per cent on Wednesday while Jiangchen, an apparel manufacturer, rose 110 per cent on Thursday.On Friday, people familiar with the situation said that United Company Rusal, the aluminium empire of Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, was seeking to raise up to US$2bn in Hong Kong in the next few months to repay debt, restarting an earlier listing plan that was postponed by the financial crisis last year.Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and Bank of China International are handling the IPO. They declined to comment.Rusal is reportedly in talks with a range of potential cornerstone investors, including Aluminium Corp of China, China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth find, and Singapore’s Temasek, according to the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong.Wynn sold shares at a time when Macao, the world’s largest gaming market by revenue, is turning around from a weak first half. In August, the former Portuguese colony had its best month after gross gaming revenue jumped 17 per cent year on year to a record high of US$1.4bn.Visa restrictions on residents in neighbouring Guangdong province, one of Macao’s most important feeder markets, have been relaxed. Gamblers are now allowed to visit once a month compared with once every three months previously.Wynn’s strong performance should bode well for Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, which is also planning a Hong Kong listing of its Macao business this year.
139;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-10-05T23:02:19Z;Ho’s hold on Macao gaming is loosening;;"One senior Macao gaming executive summarises the industry’s explosive growth since 2002 as a journey “from monopoly to oligopoly”.In that year, Stanley Ho’s 40-year monopoly was terminated and concessions extended to five other casino operators, including Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts of the US.Mr Ho, who will turn 88 next month, was hospitalised in August after a fall. The health scare reignited speculation about who will inherit the billionaire’s vast commercial empire – especially Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, his holding company; casino operator Sociedade de Jogos de Macau; and Shun Tak Holdings, a property and transport conglomerate.Mr Ho has 17 children by four wives. The two best-known children, Pansy and Lawrence, have Macao gaming joint ventures with, respectively, MGM Mirage and James Packer’s Crown.Pansy and Lawrence would have to exit those investments before becoming involved in SJM, where Mr Ho’s fourth wife, Angela Leong, is a director.Pansy, meanwhile, has the inside track at Shun Tak, where she is managing director."
140;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-10-05T16:58:23Z;Macao table take outstrips Vegas;;The tables have finally turned for casinos in the world’s largest gambling market by revenue.Their luck appeared to be running out earlier in the year, with concessionaires in Macao, the Chinese special administrative region near Hong Kong, seeing first-half revenues fall 12.4 per cent year-on-year to $6.4bn.But August was a bumper month. Macao’s six licensed casino operators, who manage 32 properties in the tiny territory, raked in $1.4bn in gross revenues – their biggest monthly haul. Casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, by contrast, have been averaging about $470m a month over the past year.“It’s like someone poured boiling water over an anthill,” David Green, gaming practice director at PWC, says, referring to Macao’s now teeming streets and casinos. “[Gamblers] are certainly finding their way here – in hordes.”The invisible hand of the Chinese government seems to lie behind the change. Guangdong, China’s most populous and richest province, is one of Macao’s two most important feeder markets, alongside Hong Kong.In 2007 and early 2008, as Macao’s economy overheated, visa restrictions were imposed on individual travellers from Guangdong, who were previously able to visit Macao up to 24 times a year. Indeed, over the first six months of this year, visitor numbers fell 11.4 per cent to 10.4m.But things have turned around very quickly. According to a recent research report by Credit Suisse, individual travellers from Guangdong may now enter Macao 12 times a year, compared with just six visits at the height of the restrictions. Meanwhile, there are no limits on how many times Guangdong residents can visit Macao as part of a tour group.The policy, and who sets it, has never been clear. “[It] is set in consultation with the central government and the Guangdong [provincial] government,” Steve Wynn, chairman of Wynn Resorts, said at a recent press conference.Mr Wynn – who is spinning off his company’s Macao arm in a $1.6bn initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange – added that the central government’s “liaison office” in Macao, and Macao’s government, also play a role in the deliberations.Industry executives and analysts point to another factor behind the turnround – the availability of credit.Macao’s gaming market is skewed towards high-rollers, or “whales”, who are wined and dined by intermediaries known as “junkets”. More importantly, junkets provide the whales with credit and also collect their debts.“The key function of junket operators is to provide liquidity and credit in Macao – just like banks,” says Gabriel Chan, head of casino and gaming research at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.Junkets are important because, as huge as Macao’s casino revenues are, they represent only a fraction of what is being wagered. In VIP baccarat – the whales’ game of choice, which accounts for two-thirds of Macao gaming revenues – the house win rate, is typically just 2.85 per cent.Last month Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, the gaming flagship of tycoon Stanley Ho and Macao’s market leader, reported first-half VIP revenues of $1.1bn on “VIP chip sales” of $38.1bn (equivalent to a win rate for the casinos of 2.83 per cent).In reality, relatively little cash changed hands for the nearly $40bn chips that SJM’s junkets “sold” to VIP gamblers in the first half. Most chips were extended on credit, with SJM’s junkets responsible for collecting the $1bn that VIP gamblers actually lost.Mr Chan, at Credit Suisse, estimates that in August alone, Macao junkets extended VIP gamblers more than $31bn in notional credit, compared with a low of $19bn last December.Industry executives and analysts estimate that junkets are now collecting VIP debts two weeks after they are incurred. In the depths of the global financial crisis, the lag was two months.As one Hong Kong-based investment banker puts it, referring to the degree of risk junkets must take: “Junkets really are at the sharp end of the stick.”
141;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-09-30T16:37:43Z;Strong demand for Wynn IPO;;Wynn Resorts priced the $1.6bn initial public offering of its Macao operations on Wednesday at the top end of an indicative range amid strong demand as investors bet that the city’s gaming market would continue to improve.The US casino operator controlled by Steve Wynn plans to sell a 25 per cent stake in its Macao business in Hong Kong at HK$10.08 a share, the upper end of a price range of HK$8.52 to HK$10.08.In spite of recent disappointing performances of new listings in Hong Kong and competition from a flood of upcoming IPOs, investors rushed to buy Wynn shares on the back of good news on the state of the world’s biggest gaming market.Macao, the former Portuguese colony, had its best month in August after gross gaming revenue jumped 17 per cent year on year to a record high of $1.4bn.Visa restrictions on residents in neighbouring Guangdong province, one of Macao’s most important feeder markets, have been relaxed. Gamblers are now allowed to visit once a month compared with once every three months previously.Wynn’s IPO is being arranged by JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS.Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands is planning a Hong Kong listing of its Macao business this year.Just less than 13 per cent of Wynn’s IPO has been reserved for four tycoons from Hong Kong and Malaysia – Walter Kwok, Thomas Lau, Quek Leng Chan and Chua Ma Yu.Mr Wynn has said the IPO will make his group “more of a Chinese company”, although it will retain just $5m of the Hong Kong IPO proceeds for “general corporate purposes” in Macao.Wynn shares are due to begin trading on October 9.
142;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-09-24T04:00:24Z;MCC plunges in HK’s worst debut this year;;Metallurgical Corp of China shares plunged on Thursday in Hong Kong’s worst market debut this year as a flood of new listings have made investors more selective.Shares of the dual-listed company, which are also listed in Shanghai, hit a low of HK$5.40 in early trading, 15 per cent lower than the offer price of HK$6.35. The shares later recovered to HK$5.61.Poor showing by the company’s shares in Shanghai, which fell 4.6 per cent to Rmb6.04 on Thursday, also affected the stock’s performance in Hong Kong.MCC shares had begun trading in Shanghai on Monday, when they closed up 28 per cent at Rmb6.94, an increase considered muted by Chinese standards. The shares lost a total of 8.8 per cent over the past two days.The company, which raised a combined US$5.1bn from Hong Kong and Shanghai in the world’s second largest initial public offering this year, is one of China’s largest engineering companies. However, investors have shunned the construction sector where companies have been plagued by low margins.Timothy Fung, China equity strategist at Credit Suisse Private Banking, said investors in Hong Kong had become more cautious because of a strong pipeline of upcoming new listings.“Investors realise they have lots of choices. They have also learnt that IPOs don’t always go up,” said Mr Fung.According to Dealogic, at least 15 companies plan to sell shares in Hong Kong by the end of this year. Wynn Resorts, the casino operator controlled by Steve Wynn, is raising up to $1.6bn by selling a 25 per cent stake in its Macao operation. Speaking in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Mr Wynn said the listing will help the Las Vegas-based group realise its aspirations of becoming “more of a Chinese company”. Trading will start on October 9.Rival Las Vegas Sands, controlled by Sheldon Adelson, is also slated for a listing in Hong Kong this year.Sinopharm, China’s biggest pharmaceuticals distributor, rose 7.88 per cent on Thursday after rising nearly 16 per cent on its debut on Wednesday. The Hang Seng index was down 2.5 per cent.
143;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-09-23T21:31:46Z;Wynn Resorts upbeat about Hong Kong IPO;;The Hong Kong initial public offering of Wynn Resorts’ Macao operations will help the Las Vegas-based group realise its aspirations of becoming “more of a Chinese company”, according to Steve Wynn, its chairman.Wynn Resorts will raise up to $1.6bn by selling a 25 per cent stake in its Macao operations, as it becomes the first American-based company to establish a presence on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Macao’s gaming market, the world’s largest, was monopolised by Stanley Ho for 40 years until 2002, when five other concessions were extended to investors including Wynn Resorts and Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands group.Mr Ho, a Hong Kong-born tycoon of Chinese and Dutch ancestry, likes to present himself as the only truly local casino operator in Macao.His gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, is still the largest player, with a 30 per cent market share.But its leading position is under threat – especially from Las Vegas Sands, which has built the world’s two largest casinos in Macao, by number of tables.Mr Ho has played the nationalist card repeatedly over the years, fuelling speculation that the Chinese central government is worried about the growing influence of US commercial interests in Macao.Mr Wynn on Wednesday sought to play up his own company’s local credentials, although it will retain just $5m of the Hong Kong IPO proceeds for “general corporate purposes” in Macao.“The IPO is giving us the chance to share ownership of [our Macao] concession with Chinese investors and financial institutions …and basically become more of a Chinese company,” Mr Wynn said at a briefing in Hong Kong.He added that Wynn Resorts had originally hoped to enter Macao in 2002 with a Chinese partner, but a tie-up could not be arranged at the time.Just under 13 per cent of the Hong Kong offering has been reserved for two Hong Kong tycoons, Walter Kwok and Thomas Lau, and two Malaysian tycoons of Chinese descent, Quek Leng Chan and Chua Ma Yu.In contrast to his arch-rival Mr Adelson, Mr Wynn has taken a more cautious approach in Macao. He has so far opened just one property in the former Portuguese colony, the Wynn Macau, with another, Encore, slated to follow in April.But Wynn Resorts seems to have timed its Hong Kong IPO perfectly, with Macao casinos enjoying their best ever month in August after a slow first half.Mr Wynn also said visa restrictions on residents in neighbouring Guangdong province, Macao’s most important feeder market, had recently been relaxed, with gamblers now allowed to visit once a month compared to once every three months previously.
144;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-09-20T17:13:58Z;Vegas aims to cash in on MGM’s CityCenter;;Las Vegas’s struggling economy will be given a significant boost on Monday when some 12,000 people are appointed to posts at CityCenter, the sprawling $8.5bn resort development seen as crucial to the resurgence of the casino capital.MGM Mirage, which owns other Las Vegas casinos such as the Bellagio and the MGM Grand, has spent four years developing the 18m sq ft CityCenter, which is the largest commercial real estate project in the US.The future of the development, which includes upmarket hotels, a casino, shopping centre and concert arena, fell into doubt this year when MGM Mirage was unable to access frozen credit markets.However, the company secured several debt waivers and has since completed a $2.5bn refinancing, securing the funds needed to complete the development and open it as planned in December.The group also issued new shares, which diluted the stake held by Kirk Kerkorian, its largest shareholder, from 52 per cent to 37 per cent.Jim Murren, chief executive of MGM Mirage, told the FT that CityCenter would be a shot in the arm for Las Vegas, which has been badly hit by the downturn.Unemployment in the city is at 13.6 per cent, well above the US average of 9.7 per cent, while other ambitious construction projects have been abandoned, exacerbating the weakness of the city’s job market.“CityCenter is going to be vital to the ability of Las Vegas to recover from this recession,” he said. “Not only because it represents a project that has survived [the downturn] but because people are going to come from all over the world to see it.”The 12,000 available positions at CityCenter have attracted more than 160,000 applications, underscoring the extent of the downturn that has hit the city.“This concentration of new jobs is not happening anywhere else in the US,” said Mr Murren. “To have it happen [in Las Vegas] will have a profound effect.”While MGM Mirage prepares for the grand opening of CityCenter in December, other casino companies have been less fortunate with their projects.The $3.5bn Fontainebleu development sought bankruptcy protection this summer and 3,500 construction jobs were lost, while other costly projects have been shelved.The downturn followed a decade in which Las Vegas was the fastest-growing city in the US, with plentiful casino jobs and minimal corporate taxation attracting thousands of residents and businesses.But when the consumer credit bubble burst last year the city went into a steep decline, becoming one of the focal points of the housing crisis.Convention business dried up and tourists became more prudent about spending in the resort city.
145;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-09-09T17:30:47Z;Genting Singapore in rights issue;;Genting Singapore, the Malaysian controlled company building one of two casino resorts in the island state, on Wednesday announced a S$1.63bn (US$1.14bn) rights issue aimed at shoring up its balance sheet and possible acquisitions.The company, a subsidiary of the Genting gaming group of Malaysia, sought to dampen rumours that its Resorts World development at Sentosa was significantly over budget, saying its costs were on track and it would open on schedule early next year.Justin Tan, managing director of Genting Singapore, said the rights issue would “strengthen the company’s financials and put us in a strong position to tap strategic opportunities”.However, analysts said it was likely the project was hitting its revised budget targets but costing much more than the S$5.2bn estimate when the contract was awarded in late 2006.“I think it is probably because of the cost overruns that Genting has had to incur in building this integrated resort,” said Abdul Jalil Rasheed, head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management in Kuala Lumpur.Mr Rasheed said Genting Singapore might be planning to invest part of the proceeds in initial public offerings in the Macao operations of Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands, which are expected to take place in Hong Kong later this year.Genting Singapore operates casinos and integrated resorts in several countries including Australia, Malaysia, the Philippines and the UK.Genting Singapore said it would offer shareholders one share for every five held at 80 Singapore cents, a discount of 33 per cent to the stock’s last traded price. Genting has agreed to subscribe for its 54 per cent of the rights issue.Genting Singapore shares, which have more than doubled in price this year, closed at S$1.19 on Tuesday. The shares were suspended in Singapore on Wednesday.The rights issue by Genting Singapore follows the sale in May by the family that owns its Malaysian parent of its entire 9 per cent personal stake in the Singapore unit for S$615m.
146;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-07-22T16:26:22Z;Wilmar aims for $4bn in HK listing;;Wilmar International, the Singapore-based agribusiness, is looking to raise up to $4bn through a listing of its China-related operations in Hong Kong by the first half of 2010, according to people familiar with the situation.The company is seen as an Asian version of US-based ADM and Bunge in terms of its agricultural processing operations, with ADM holding a stake in the group. The company’s China business mainly consists of edible oil processing and consumer packaging.Wilmar told the Singapore Stock Exchange this month that it might float 20-30 per cent of the China business. Based on that amount, this would value the entire China unit at up to $14bn.News of Wilmar’s listing comes amid a pickup in new listings in Asia spurred on by a revival in investor confidence. Hong Kong has dominated Asia’s initial public offering market this year, with 16 companies raising a total of $2.6bn, according to data from Dealogic. China Zhongwang’s $1.27bn IPO was the largest in Hong Kong this year.This week Wynn Resorts, the gaming group controlled by Steve Wynn, said it hoped to float a minimum 25 per cent interest in its Macao operations in Hong Kong by the end of this year, potentially raising as much as $2bn. Last week, China Pacific, a Shanghai-listed insurer, revived plans for what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar listing in Hong Kong.However, all eyes are on mainland China after Beijing recently lifted a suspension on IPOs that was imposed last September. China State Construction Engineering Corp plans to raise as much as Rmb50.2bn ($7.3bn) in a Shanghai IPO this month.Kuok Khoon Hong, Wilmar’s chief executive, first raised the possibility in May of the listing of the China business, saying at the time that it could take place either in Hong Kong or Shanghai in an effort to “unlock shareholder value”.A listing by Wilmar would increase the company’s free float of 17 per cent – which is seen as low when the group has the second-highest market value on the Singapore Exchange – and could raise its weighting in the MSCI index.“A listing would give Wilmar the advantage of being regarded as a domestic company by Chinese market regulators,” said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam at RBS Securities in Singapore.He added: “If people see the Wilmar IPO as another green shoot, it is a pretty chunky one …A dual listing in China would raise Wilmar’s profile.”Wilmar has appointed Bank of China International, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for the listing. Wilmar would not comment, while BOC, Goldman and Morgan were unavailable for comment.
147;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-07-21T22:24:57Z;Wynn files to list Macao unit in Hong Kong;;A Las Vegas-based casino company has taken the lead in a race to become the first international casino operator to list in Hong Kong, taking advantage of renewed investor appetite for stocks with links to the world’s biggest gambling market.Wynn Resorts, controlled by Steve Wynn, hopes to float a minimum 25 per cent interest in its Macao operations. The spin-off is expected to raise $1bn-$2bn by the end of this year. However, people involved in the transaction cautioned that “the total amount [sought] is not clear”.Wynn Resorts has submitted a preliminary filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.The application gives Mr Wynn a head start on his rival Sheldon Adelson, whose Las Vegas Sands is mulling a similar Hong Kong initial public offering for its Macao assets.Las Vegas Sands has invested more aggressively in the Chinese special administrative region, opening the world’s two largest casinos there, but has been struggling to service its debts.Wynn Resorts’ IPO application comes despite figures, released on Monday by Macao’s gaming regulator, that showed that first-half gaming revenues fell 12 per cent year-on-year to 51.4bn patacas ($6.4bn) ..The Chinese government, concerned that Macao’s gaming industry was growing too fast, has made it more difficult for its citizens to obtain visas to visit the former Portuguese enclave.Macao gaming revenues rose in five years – from 41.4bn patacas in 2004 to 108.7bn last year – making the market bigger than rivals Las Vegas and Atlantic City combined.“This is not controlled by the company but by the Chinese government – the government can increase the visa numbers,” said one person involved in the IPO. “But no one doubts the dogged determination of the Chinese gambler.”Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and their advisers are betting that investors will focus on Macao’s long-term future as China’s only legal gambling destination. While the territory is on track to record its first annual fall in casino revenues since the industry was liberalised in 2002, table capacity is expected to increase 25 per cent by the end of the year.UBS, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are advising Wynn Resorts. The company and its sponsors declined to comment.The Macao gaming flagships of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau and Galaxy Entertainment are already listed on the territory’s bourse.Shares in both companies have rebounded sharply from lows reached late last year.The benchmark Hang Seng Index has also soared 72 per cent since March, closing on Tuesday at 19,501.73.PwC estimates that companies will raise HK$100bn ($12.9bn) through Hong Kong IPOs this year.
148;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-07-21T19:23:06Z;FTSE on longest winning run in four years;;"The FTSE 100 recorded its longest winning streak in four years on Tuesday, in spite of jitters undermining its largest company.HSBC lagged behind the day’s rally on concerns it would spook investors by reporting an interim loss next month.Gossip that the bank had been talking down forecasts sent the shares lower by
1.6 per cent to 550p.Analysts said the interim loss would largely reflect an accounting oddity related to HSBC’s $17bn rights issue.Almost all the shares were issued in currencies other than dollars, HSBC’s reporting currency. So with HSBC shares rising during the cash call, the difference had to be accounted for as a derivative liability.HSBC has said it will book a non-cash $4.7bn charge in the first half, erasing its interim profit.Investors were also worried about HSBC’s own debt in issue. Marking debt to market contributed $6.6bn to its first-quarter results but a narrowing of credit spreads since April means these gains are likely to have reversed.Elsewhere among the banks, Barclays slipped 1.2 per cent to 309¼p after JPMorgan forecast its BarCap unit to have a £12.8bn capital shortfall by 2010.In a review of investment banks, JPMorgan said regulation on capital and liquidity requirements were likely to be in force by the end of 2010. The regulations would require banks to increase capital buffers by between 30 per cent and 100 per cent, the broker forecast.The FTSE 100 closed up for a seventh straight day, rising 0.9 per cent or 37.55 points to 4,481.17.Wm Morrison Supermarkets was the biggest blue-chip gainer after it raised earnings expectations in an unscheduled trading update.Improved profit margins helped ease concern that Morrison’s sector-leading sales growth of the past two years had been driven by discounting.Morrison rose 8.2 per cent to 274p while J Sainsbury gained 3.1 per cent to 326p and Tesco added 1.4 per cent to 375p.Robust industry sales data for July helped the trend among the grocers. But Marks and Spencer was down 1.2 per cent to 326p after the data suggested it was continuing to lose food market share to Waitrose.Sector peer Next faded 1.6 per cent £16.14¾ on profit-taking after a trading update. The clothes retailer raised profit guidance but remained cautious because of the swine flu threat.Similar reasons left Tui Travel as the day’s sharpest faller, losing 2.6 per cent to 228½p.Friends Provident slipped 2.5 per cent to 71½p on growing expectations of a stand-off with Resolution.Among the miners, Anglo American gained 4.1 per cent to £18.62½ amid speculation it may ask the Takeover Panel to give a “put up or shut up” deadline to Xstrata. The talk was apparently premature.Xstrata closed up 3.6 per cent at 723p, matching a rally among the commodity stocks that saw BHP Billiton take on 2.6 per cent to £15.30 and Cairn Energy climb 1.9 per cent to £23.84.Gaming stocks were under pressure after a profit warning from Playtech, the gambling software provider seen as a leading indicator for industry growth. The company blamed tough trading among licencees and teething troubles at its joint venture with William Hill.PartyGaming was down 3.9 per cent at 237¼p and 888 Holdings lost 4.1 per cent to 98¾p, while Ladbrokes was 2.5 per cent easier at 174¾p.William Hill, which lost 4.2 per cent to 191¾p, said it remained comfortable with 2009 expectations for its online business.Talk of disposals helped National Express rise 2 per cent to 311¼p ahead of interim results next week.Engineer GKN advanced 7.3 per cent to 88½p after Sweden’s Autoliv, the world’s biggest maker of seatbelts, provided an unexpectedly optimistic view of the second half.Separately, Cazenove and Goldman Sachs both issued “buy” advice on GKN. Cazenove saw auto industry demand improving steadily during the next few months, while optimism ahead of GKN’s interim results next month led Goldman to add the stock to its “conviction buy” list.The wooing of EcoSecurities, the carbon trading specialist, by rival suitors intensified on Tuesday after a declaration of interest from Sweden’s Tricorona sent its shares to a one-year high, writes Miles Johnson.Coming just a week after EcoSecurities rejected a second 77p bid from Guanbara, Tricorona said it was mulling an offer but stressed that there was no certainty it would make a move.EcoSecurities rose 4.7 per cent on the news, gaining 2.6 per cent to 86¼p.Earthport, the money transfer group, rose 7.1 per cent to 71½p on speculation that it could be the target of more than one bidder.London Town, the Aim-listed pub operator associated with Lord Ashcroft, the Conservative party deputy chairman, tumbled
80 per cent to 2½p after announcing it was considering a debt-for-equity swap with its three main shareholders.Daisy Group, a telecoms services provider, gained
3.7 per cent to 85p on its first day of trading following the reverse takeover of Freedom4, the wireless internet group.Speedy Hire, the tool-hire company, edged higher in spite of a downbeat trading statement that stressed “very difficult” conditions. After reiterating its full- year outlook, its shares ended the session up 6.2 per cent to 30p.Blacks Leisure, the retailer, reversed losses late in the session to close up
2 per cent at 50p, in spite of a downgrade to “sell” from Altium Securities.Brammer, the mechanical parts manufacturer, fell
10.2 per cent to 114p after its first-half sales figures disappointed.Playtech tumbled 24.2 per cent to 342½p after the online gaming software developer said full-year profits would be dented by the slow progress of its joint venture with William Hill, the bookmaker.Hopes of a bid from a Chinese group lifted Gulfsands Petroleum by 3.5 per cent to 183p. Emerald Energy, Gulfsands’ partner in Syria, recently revealed a take-over approach."
149;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-07-20T19:31:30Z;Macao;;"A little-noticed filing said it all. Hong Kong-listed Macau Success, a HK$1bn regional tour operator once known as Travel Success, is changing its name again. Call it Success Universe Group, please. Association with the world’s biggest gambling hub used to confer glamour. Today’s connotations – profligacy, over-stretch – are less desirable. Casino revenues in Macao, down 12 per cent in the first half, are heading for their first year-on-year decline. VIP baccarat, responsible for about two-thirds of takings, was down almost a fifth.Against tough comparables – mainland China’s visa clampdown began last June – and a weak global backdrop, that may not seem disastrous. Annualised, those revenues would still top 2007. But concessionaires have bloated cost bases. City of Dreams, Melco Crown Entertainment’s rival to Las Vegas Sands’ Venetian on the Cotai strip, just bumped up table numbers by about 14 per cent, with more capacity expected by year-end. Indebted casino operators, many with covenants tied to earnings, resort to freebies and rebates to protect market share. City of Dreams’ average daily mass-market takings in its first month were slightly more than a third of the Venetian’s daily haul in the first quarter.A sharp second-half recovery in traffic seems unlikely. Of the 7m Chinese who visited Macao on individual visit visas last year, about four-fifths came from export-led Guangdong, one of China’s hardest-hit provinces. And with Macanese unemployment contained by the surge in capacity, Beijing is unlikely to relax visa restrictions designed to limit visits from the mainland soon. At the margin, two new casinos in Singapore and one in Manila won’t help. Four of the big six operators should make a loss this year.

150;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-07-20T17:32:33Z;Macao suffers fall in casino revenues;;The world’s largest gambling market is on track for its first year-on-year decline since it was opened to foreign competition in 2002.Macao, the Chinese special administrative region near Hong Kong, has reported a 12.4 per cent decline in first-half casino revenues to 51.4bn patacas ($6.4bn).If the trend continues, driven by a 20 per cent fall in visitor arrivals, this year will be the first to see a contraction since the monopoly of Stanley Ho, the veteran gambling tycoon, was broken up seven years ago.Macao’s liberalisation attracted multi-billion dollar investments by some of the world’s largest gaming companies, including Las Vegas Sans, Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage. Las Vegas Sands, which has struggled to meet its debt payments and suspended a Macao expansion project late last year, operates the world’s two largest casinos in the tiny territory.Controlled by Sheldon Adelson, Las Vegas Sands is considering a spin-off of its Macao assets on the Hong Kong stock exchange.Macao, with a population of 550,000, is dependent on visitors from mainland China.The Chinese government, however, has been restricting visa access since the middle of 2008.An investment bank gaming analyst said: “The key factor is what happens in July. In the second half we’re looking for a bit of a rebound.”Exacerbating the pressure on Macao casinos, the June opening of City of Dreams– a joint venture resort by Mr Ho’s son, Lawrence, and James Packer of Australia – contributed to a 14 per cent increase in first-half capacity.Stanley Ho’s gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, will open two more casinos before the end of the year, bringing 10 per cent more tables on to the market.Macao’s gaming market is heavily reliant on high-rollers who typically account for two-thirds of the territory’s casino revenues. Takings from VIP baccarat fell by 19 per cent in the first half, as the middlemen who find high-rollers for casinos and often collect their debts – reined in credit.
151;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-05-05T22:20:08Z;Gambling’s hot streak;Are the odds of a payoff getting worse?;"Who needs the thrill of striding into a casino and wagering one’s entire pay cheque on a roll of the dice when casino stocks offer a similar risk and reward? Intrepid investors who bought shares of US industry leaders in early March have hit the jackpot but would be wise to cash in their chips. Since then, two deeply indebted operators, MGM Mirage and Las Vegas Sands, jumped more than 500 and 600 per cent, respectively. Less imperilled Wynn Resorts rose more than 120 per cent, rallying nearly 15 per cent on Tuesday after reporting a quarterly loss. All three have either raised expensive cash or had to negotiate with lenders or both and none is out of the woods completely.Following their bounce, the big operators remain well off their 2007 highs, but the risk-reward equation is starting to look like a sucker’s bet. Las Vegas Sands trades about nine times 2010 enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – a multiple that implies not just survival but a rapid recovery. Wynn, which deserves a higher valuation, also looks rich at 12 times EV/ebitda. Measures like revenue per available room and occupancy rates have stabilised but should remain below peak levels for some time. This is a challenge for high fixed-cost companies facing hefty debt.Casinos remain a good business – it was over expansion in glitzy destinations such as Las Vegas and Macau that harmed these operators. Traffic has held up in less glamorous locales not requiring a hotel stay. Three US operators that eschewed Las Vegas are Ameristar, Penn National Gaming and Pinnacle Entertainment. This grouping outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of almost 30 percentage points in the past year while the aforementioned Vegas operators underperformed by 40 points.Speculators have prospered recently by owning the higher-risk operators but should recognise when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

152;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2009-04-27T22:03:46Z;Macao’s City of Dreams bets on high rollers;;On Cotai Strip, a reclaimed area in Macao billed as Asia’s answer to Las Vegas, workers are busy putting the finishing touches on City of Dreams, the newest casino in the former Portuguese colony.With a dome-shaped theatre, a Hard Rock-themed casino, stylish nightclubs and Harley Davidson motorcycles in the jackpot, Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) is betting that the $2.1bn project will be able to defy a slowing market in Macao and a deepening global recession when it opens its doors in June.In 2008, gaming revenue in Macao grew by 31 per cent to $13.5bn but there was a sharp slowdown in September after Beijing imposed visa restrictions that curtailed visitors to casinos from some parts of mainland China. High-rollers, meanwhile, also found it more difficult to tap credit as the global financial crisis worsened.For Lawrence Ho, son of “king of gambling” Stanley Ho and MPEL’s chief executive, the success of City of Dreams is not only crucial for his company but also the empire of the Ho clan, the most powerful family in Macao.When Macao ended Stanley Ho’s 40-year gaming monopoly in 2002 and granted licences to international tycoons, including Sheldon Adelson of Las Vegas Sands and Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts, some called it the end of an era.Analysts predicted Sociedade de Jogos de Macao (SJM), Stanley Ho’s gaming flagship, would lose its leading position as early as this year as bigger casinos and shinier gaming floors built by US rivals were expected to outdo his smoky gambling dens.In 2004, when Mr Adelson opened Sands Macao, the first casino operated by a foreign investor, doors were smashed and fences broken as gamblers forced their way in.The opening of Wynn Macao in 2006 and Venetian in 2007 continued to captivate the crowds and put more pressure on Stanley Ho.But five years on, SJM is still the biggest casino operator in Macao, the world’s largest gaming market.Las Vegas Sands and MGM Mirage, SJM’s heavily-leveraged foreign rivals, have recently been preoccupied with refinancing loans taken out during the boom times.Las Vegas Sands has stopped construction of its partially-finished developments on Cotai, where most building work by other casino operators has also been halted.Cranes now loom over idle building sites.The company, which has been struggling to offload its real estate and retail properties at the Venetian, has also declined to comment on speculation that it would sell Sands Macao, saying only that it would continue to explore all options.Analysts have speculated that cash-strapped MGM Mirage, which has a Macao joint venture with Pansy Ho, Stanley Ho’s daughter, could be forced to sell its 50 per cent stake in the tie-up, most likely to its partner.“By maintaining its leadership for so long, SJM has proved a lot of people wrong,” says Billy Ng, analyst at JPMorgan, who expects Stanley Ho to maintain a lead until at least next year.With Lawrence Ho and Pansy Ho, the Ho family has three of Macao’s six gaming licences and control about half of the sector, which has grown about five times since 2002.“Their market share may be smaller but don’t forget the pie is much bigger now,” says Gabriel Chan, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Adding to this is Shun Tak, Stanley Ho’s conglomerate, which has been benefiting from the territory’s breakneck growth in the last few years thanks to its vast interests in Macao’s property, transportation and hospitality industries.All these give the Ho family an upper hand again.City of Dreams is set to put MPEL, a partnership between Lawrence Ho and James Packer’s Crown group, in the best position to benefit from any turnround in Macao’s gaming sector.The property is likely to be the only large-scale casino opening in the enclave in the next two to three years.It is estimated to double MPEL’s market share to about 17 per cent in 2010.Although casino revenue in the first quarter of 2009 dropped 13 per cent from the same period last year, it was 8 per cent higher than the level in 2008’s fourth quarter and in line with the third-quarter figure. This is in spite of the fact that the beginning of the year is traditionally a low season.According to Morgan Stanley, gaming revenue in Macao is expected to decline 11 per cent in the first half of 2009 but is likely to rebound by 4 per cent in the second half of the year.“The worst is likely to be over as long as there are no more big corporate problems,” says Francis Lui, deputy chairman of Galaxy Entertainment, a Macao casino operator. “This year I am cautiously optimistic.”
153;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-11-11T18:05:22Z;Macao mothballed;;"Fortunes really do spin on a dime. Macao last year overtook Las Vegas as the world’s biggest gambling den by revenues. As palatial casinos sprang up on vast tracts of land, the enclave throbbed to the staccato of pneumatic drills. Silence is returning. Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands project was this week forced to down tools until the gambling magnate scrapes together some more cash; others have also gone eerily quiet.The tables turned earlier this year. The credit crunch coincided with new restrictions on Chinese tourists to Macao, the only part of China where gambling is legal. Gaming revenues, too, have tumbled. Gross revenues have fallen by a third from January to under $900m in September. As casinos mushroomed, competition escalated. Commission rates were jacked up and, just like banks, operators were too keen to extend credit to players. Wynn Resorts’ Macao business illustrates the point. Adjusted property earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – which excludes pre-opening costs and property charges, among other expenses – has grown on a quarterly basis, or stayed flat, since the beginning of last year. In the third quarter, however, it dipped 40 per cent quarter-on-quarter.Gamblers, of course, live on hope. In Macao, there are two. The first is that Beijing, which reclaimed Macao from Portuguese administration in 1999, will step in, perhaps by relaxing visa restrictions. Gambling is the very heart of Macao, employing swathes of the workforce and supplying by far the bulk of government revenues; Beijing, the theory goes, would not want this boat rocked. The second is that credit constraint-led culling of supply will improve profitability for the survivors. But, as punts go, neither is particularly compelling.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

154;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-10-31T22:43:07Z;Vegas maybe;;"Who needs Las Vegas when you have these markets? Shares in the largest casino operators have lately been as heart-stoppingly unpredictable as an all-night session at the roulette table. Las Vegas Sands, down about 94 per cent this year, dropped another 30 per cent this week – and then tripled from the lows. MGM Mirage and Wynn Resorts have been on a somewhat less spectacular ride – the latter supported by its bulging balance sheet and top-notch hotels. But both rallied euphorically as the week concluded.Concerns in the desert playground for MGM and Sands were that credit constraints would make fund-raising impossible for projects, such as the multiple towers of MGM’s CityCenter on a plot bigger than 1,000 tennis courts; or even that the companies could run out of cash before punters did. Those fears are, for now, fading. MGM offered reassurance on the financing for the $9bn development and successfully, if expensively, tapped high-yield markets. In addition, the sharp economic reversal has a perk. The demise of competing projects will enable MGM to hire the 9,000 workers it needs more easily. Plummeting costs of raw materials will also help to slice building costs by about $400m.Traffic at tables and slots, though, is slowing. Gaming revenues on the Strip fell 7 per cent in the year to August, before the latest turmoil made casual gamblers sit out the next poker hand. There is the odd bright spot. An increase in third-quarter revenues per available room at MGM’s Bellagio suggests top-flight visitors are still splurging. After a spate of cancellations in September, next year’s convention schedules are apparently filling out. Valuations are beaten-down. But Wall Street’s woes and the economic slump will extinguish glimmers of recovery should the “stay at home” mentality become entrenched. Add in cutbacks on airline routes and Las Vegas’s new developments, and investors may as well stick their money on black.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

155;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-09-21T17:53:22Z;Gamble pays off for Ho as SJM profits rise 8%;;Last week, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, the gaming flagship of tycoon Stanley Ho, issued its first set of results as a publicly traded company, recording an 8 per cent increase in first-half net profit to HK$571m ($73m). In doing so Mr Ho adhered to one of the cardinal rules of corporate reporting – do not disappoint the market.In spite of a 4.5 per cent year-on-year fall in revenues, SJM slightly exceeded the profit guidance it gave investors ahead of the company’s July initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange.It did help that SJM’s targets were modest to begin with. The company’s revenue and profit both fell in the three years prior to its listing, and it did not promise a miraculous turnround upon listing. Mr Ho may have waited almost 50 years to submit his gaming operations to public scrutiny – he was first given monopoly rights to the then Portuguese colony’s gambling sector in 1962 – but the 86-year-old tycoon has clearly mastered the art of managing expectations.By the time Mr Ho finally brought his company to market, completing a tortuous three-year process, the honeymoon was clearly over for the Macaogaming market.The industry had experienced a renaissance after Mr Ho’s monopoly lapsed in 2002 and five new entrants, led by Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts of the US, were given concessions. This year first-half gaming revenues in the tiny enclave, which has a population of 540,000 and reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, increased 55 per cent to 59.3bn patacas ($7.3bn), exceeding its two next largest rivals – the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City, New Jersey – combined.However, during the past year the Chinese government has become increasingly concerned about the strains that the sector’s explosive growth is putting on Macao’s labour market and infrastructure. Public frustration at inflation and other stresses boiled over during last year’s May Day holiday, when the previously quiescent territory was shocked by rowdy street protests.In an effort to calm the industry’s torrid growth, the Chinese government has recently restricted the frequency and ease with which mainland gamblers can visit Macao, contributing to a run on Macao casino stocks. SJM’s shares have fallen by more than 50 per cent in their first two months of trading.Macao, in turn, has extended a freeze on new concessions that was set to expire next year and indicated that it would cap the commissions payable to junkets, who ferry high-rolling VIP “whales” to the territory, probably at 1.25 per cent of chip sales. VIP gamblers still account for 70 per cent of Macao’s gaming revenues, in spite of expectations that liberalisation would transform the territory into more of a mass-market-dependent resort and convention destination.In a statement accompanying SJM’s results, Mr Ho cited the challenges of “increasing competition and tightened restrictions on travel to Macao from mainland China”.Francis Lui, vice-chairman of Hong Kong-listed Galaxy Entertainment, another concession holder, said: “China quite rightly wants sustainable growth [in Macao].“We have been paying [junkets] more than 1.25 per cent and welcome a cap [on commissions].”Reflecting more difficult market conditions, Galaxy last week reported a 15 per cent decline in revenues. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 50 per cent to HK$356m.

156;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-09-14T18:32:56Z;Aruze to open its first casino;;Aruze, the Japanese maker of pinball, pachinko and other gambling machines, said it plans to open its first casino resort – in the Philippine capital of Manila – by early 2010.The company, which owns about 24 per cent of Wynn Resorts, was granted a provisional gaming licence last month by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp (Pagcor), the government casino monopoly that wants to build a huge casino and entertainment complex.Aruze has acquired a 30-hectare property in Manila worth $300m, signalling it is moving ahead with plans to build its first casino resort estimated to cost at least $1bn.The project includes a 2,000-room hotel and a Ferris wheel similar to the London Eye.“The Philippine project represents the core element of our casino resort operation business,” Aruze told the Financial Times.Pagcor is banking on the $15bn project called “Entertainment City” to turn the Philippines into one of Asia’s leading gaming and tourism destinations in the next decade.It expects the project to boost tourism arrivals from under 3m a year now to more than 15m a year when the project is completed after five years.Pagcor has also granted a provisional gaming licence to Travellers International Hotel group, a joint venture of Philippine property developer Alliance Global and Star Cruises, the world’s third-biggest cruise ship operator.Star Cruises is owned by the Genting Berhad Group of Malaysia, which is developing one of two casino-centred integrated resorts in Singapore’s Sentosa Island, and holds the franchise for developing Universal Studios theme parks in Asia.Travellers’ casino resort, which is estimated to cost at least $1.1bn, is scheduled for completion by December 2009.
157;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-07-16T10:02:33Z;SJM debut dips in line with expectations;;Macao tycoon Stanley Ho’s gaming flagship finally made its stock market debut on Wednesday, dipping below its offering price in Hong Kong trade after overcoming a last-minute legal challenge.The debut for SJM Holdings, which raised $494 million in a scaled-back share sale amid a poor market, comes as the casino operator struggles to compete with aggressive US operators led by Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts.Ho’s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau has seen its market share of Macau’s $15 billion gaming market, the world’s largest, shrink to 40 per cent from 75 per cent three years ago, with more competition on the way and costs for labour and construction materials on the rise.The stock ended the morning session down 1.6 per cent at HK$3.03, below its HK$3.08 IPO price, which was at the bottom of an indicated range. The lacklustre performance was in line with market expectations.Hong Kong’s Court of Appeal dismissed an application for a judicial review launched by Winnie Ho, Mr Ho’s estranged sister, that sought to derail the $494m listing of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (SJM) by the casino tycoon.“In my judgment, none of the challenges sought …in the judicial review proceedings could be reasonably arguable,” Chief Justice Ma said on Tuesday.Ms Ho’s lawsuit had previously prompted SJM to delay its initial public offering by a week and to give retail investors until last Friday to return shares they had bought in return for a full refund.SJM said about 55 per cent of individual investors had withdrawn applications, which accounted for 146.99m shares. The retail tranche accounts for 15 per cent of the global offering.Even some SJM employees withdrew their share allocations, representing about 3.2 per cent of the shares they had sought.All the unwanted shares have been reallocated to the institutional portion of the offering. The withdrawal left the initial public offering undersubscribed by 102.87m shares.Deutsche Bank, the IPO’s bookrunner, has stepped in to make up the $40.7m shortfall. The bank has entered into derivatives transactions with a number of investors who will take on the economic benefits and exposure to the shares.SJM is selling 25 per cent of its shares for $494m, less than half the $1bn it had originally planned to raise in January. That attempt had to be postponed after the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong’s market regulator, sought more information about Ms Ho’s long-running dispute with her brother – which has given rise to more than 30 lawsuits in Macao and Hong Kong courts.Undeterred by Tuesday’s failure, Ms Ho said she planned to take her case to Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal. Even though SJM is finally able to get its long delayed listing off the ground, the company is expected to face other challenges.SJM lost its 40-year monopoly of Macao’s gaming market in 2002 and its share of casino revenue plunged to 40 per cent last year because of intense competition.The company also faces shrinking margins and labour shortages.Additional reporting by Tom Mitchell in Hong Kong
158;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-07-10T22:58:50Z;Wynn eyes HK listing for Macao growth;;Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas gaming magnate, is laying the groundwork for a possible listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange as he seeks funding for project development in Macao.Nasdaq-listed Wynn Resorts has mandated UBS, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank for the offering, according to people familiar with the company’s plans. However, they warned that the timing and fundraising target of a Hong Kong listing was impossible to predict given turbulent market conditions.“It is early days, but if it does get away we are looking at Wynn raising between $500m and $1bn from a [Hong Kong] listing,” one person said.Wynn is one of six licensed casino operators in Macao, the Chinese special administrative region and the world’s largest gambling market. In the first quarter of this year, Macao casino revenues grew more than 60 per cent to $3.7bn – bigger than its two nearest rivals, the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City in the US, combined.Wynn would be the second Macao casino company to tap funds in Hong Kong this year, following next week’s debut of Sociedade de Jogos de Macau. Controlled by Stanley Ho, SJM enjoyed a monopoly over Macao’s gaming market until 2002, when it was opened to outside competitors including Wynn and Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands.SJM has struggled to get its offering, led by Deutsche, off the ground, in spite of reducing its offer size from $1bn, set in January, to $494m this month. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index has fallen more than 30 per cent since its high last October.In spite of the local gaming market’s growth, Macao casinos are contending with a host of challenges, from rapid capacity build-out to higher labour costs and commissions for so-called “junkets”, which lure high-rolling VIP gamblers to the territory.Reacting to these pressures, Edmund Ho, the territory’s chief executive, extended a moratorium on new licences in April and said his administration would freeze land grants for new casino developments.Wynn operates the $1.1bn Wynn Macau and is scheduled to begin construction of its second casino in the territory, the Wynn Cotai, by the end of next year.Wynn, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche declined to comment on Thursday.
159;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

161;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-04-24T02:35:07Z;Macao casino move cheers markets;;"The Macao government’s decision, announced on Tuesday, to rein back rapid growth in the world’s largest gaming market has been a long time in the making.Edmund Ho, chief executive of the Chinese special administrative region, said his government would – among other measures – extend a moratorium on the number of licensed casino operators in the territory, halt land allocations for new gaming investments and restrict expansion plans at existing casinos.Revealed at an otherwise routine question-and-answer session with Macao legislators, Mr Ho’s shot across the bow initially shocked the market, then cheered it. Share prices of US and Hong Kong-listed companies with gaming interests in Macao surged on the news.“It stops unfettered competition,” said one industry executive, who is nonetheless anxious to see the fine print from Mr Ho. “People can’t just come in and set up casinos. It will drive profitability per table up.”The growth of Macao’s casino industry has surged in recent months, especially noticeable in a city with a population of just 500,000. In the first quarter of this year gaming revenues increased more than 60 per cent year on year to $3.72bn – more than the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City combined.“We have to ensure our continued economic growth – but also resolve the new problems that have arisen as a result of [it],” Mr Ho said.“This move reflects the Macao government’s concerns – and probably also Beijing’s – about the side-effects of the gambling boom,” says Au Kam-san, a pro-democracy legislator who has long been critical of Mr Ho’s administration. “The gaming industry’s explosive growth has already exceeded the capacity of Macao’s limited resources.”The Macao government’s angst can be traced back to early last year when Jorge Oliveira, an influential policy official at the territory’s gaming commission, e-mailed senior casino executives the March cover article from Macau Business, an English-language monthly magazine. The article’s headline was unambiguous: “The Game’s Up: Revenue sharing threatens the system; Gov moves to block new players”.At that time Macao had just eclipsed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gambling market, vindicating the government’s decision five years earlier to terminate tycoon Stanley Ho’s monopoly in the industry. Five players were ushered in including Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, which has opened the world’s two largest casinos in the territory, Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage, which formed a joint venture with Mr Ho’s daughter, Pansy.But all was not well in Macao. The government was worried about “revenue sharing” or “franchise” agreements, under which outside parties piggy-backed off the licences of established players. Mr Ho’s gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, had pioneered these arrangements, running casinos for partners who bore most of the properties’ investment risk.Although typically involving businessmen and companies little-known outside Hong Kong and Macao, bigger fish were beginning to surface as well. In January of last year, Sir Richard Branson told the FT the Virgin Group intended to open a $3bn Macao gaming resort in co-operation with a licensed casino operator.Sir Richard’s public enthusiasm was the final straw for Macao government regulators. “That was probably not the best way to do business in China,” says one person familiar with Virgin’s approach. For its part, Virgin says it is still exploring opportunities in the territory.The Macao government’s skittishness was aggravated by anti-government protests on May 1 last year – the largest since the former Portuguese colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 – as people complained the boom had left them behind. In his remarks on Tuesday, Ed­mund Ho said the government would pay every Macao resident 5,000 patacas ($625) from its overflowing fiscal surplus – a sop that could damp turn-out at next week’s May Day march.Further illustrating the stress the casino industry is putting on Macao’s social and physical infrastructure, the Venetian Macao – the world’s largest casino – opened in August with 15,000 employees, 5 per cent of the territory’s workforce. When William Weidner, Las Vegas Sands president, spoke of his new property as “the casino that ate Macao”, his joke struck some as being too close to the bone.In this context, Edmund Ho’s announcement was perhaps inevitable. But as one senior casino executive says: “The government must get the new regulations out quickly so the industry knows what they are talking about. So far it’s only been a lot of froth.”"
162;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Macao curbs gaming;;The odds suddenly look a lot better for casino operators who took a punt on Macao, the world’s biggest gambling den. On Tuesday the government unveiled plans to extend a moratorium on new casino licences and stop doling out land for gaming developments.The move delighted investors in US gaming companies: shares in Las Vegas Sands surged 9 per cent on Tuesday, while Wynn Resorts jumped 7 per cent. The new rules play right into the hands of existing operators. Although they are technically subject to the new restrictions it is unclear how much will be grandfathered: expansion under discussion is unlikely to be halted. But newcomers, including hopefuls such as Sir Richard Branson, will not make it over the starting line. That leaves a lot of growth for a small club of players. Macao, the only part of China where gambling is legal, chalked up a 62 per cent rise in revenues to $3.7bn in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis.But government restrictions are only part of the story. Inadequate infrastructure, for example, is already posing a constraint on growth. The social consequences of turning a once sleepy village into one large casino add to the mix: frustration spilled out into anti-government protests last year. Even the market is signalling tentative signs of oversupply. Not all the spanking-new casinos are heaving with punters. Some ambitions have been trimmed. Overall, the number of gaming tables fell on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the first quarter, a rare occurrence. Las Vegas Sands’ year-on-year revenue at its older resort fell in the fourth quarter. And at least one would-be player appears to have lost out from the new curbs. Harrah’s Entertainment, which last year shelled out heavily for a Macao golf course, will have to drop any thoughts of building a casino there, for now. A few (hideously expensive) rounds of golf look like poor compensation.Post and read comments on this Lex
163;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-04-23T10:01:36Z;Macao to limit casino growth;;Macao is to rein in the growth of its gambling industry by extending a moratorium on the issue of new casino licences and freezing land allocations for the construction of gaming developments.In the first quarter of this year, gaming revenues in the territory soared 62 per cent year-on-year to $3.72bn – exceeding the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City’s revenues combined.Edmund Ho, Macao chief executive, told legislators about steps the Chinese special administrative region would use to address a backlash and ease concerns of Beijing politicians.They include a freeze on land allocations for future casino developments that could affect some projects planned by the six companies currently allowed to operate gaming establishments in the territory. Mr Ho also said a government moratorium on the number of casino operators, which is due to expire next year, would remain in place “for the foreseeable future”.The news sent shares of Galaxy Entertainment up 13 per cent and Melco International Development up 5.5 per cent in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Australia’s Crown, with which Melco has a joint venture, rose 5.5 per cent in Sydney.The territory’s casino industry was opened to overseas investment in 2002, ending the 40-year monopoly enjoyed by Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong-born Eurasian tycoon who is not related to Edmund Ho. The liberalisation led to a flood of investment from the likes of Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage. Stanley Ho’s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau hit back with the launch of a flagship property, the Grand Lisboa.Macao’s established casino operators have already locked in government approvals for their future projects, most of which are already under construction.The amount of investment in new casinos has badly strained Macao’s social and physical infrastructure. Parents fret about the number of students dropping out of school to take dealer positions, which are reserved for local residents. Government departments, banks and even dentist offices are also finding it difficult to hold on to their staff.Macao’s government has struggled to contain the backlash, which erupted during anti-government protests on May 1 last year.In an effort to mollify critics who say that most of the population have not shared in the wealth created by the boom, Edmund Ho announced that the government would give every Macao permanent resident a cash payment of 5,000 patacas ($625) from its fiscal surplus.
164;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-01-15T18:21:22Z;Lisboa’s end marks a new beginning;;Stanley Ho, the Macao gaming tycoon, did something this month that he had previously refused to even contemplate. His gaming flagship, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, announced on January 2 that it would tear down the Lisboa hotel and casino.Completed in 1970 and immortalised four years later when it was featured in a James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun, the Lisboa and its roulette-wheel design have long been synonymous with both Mr Ho and Macao, which in 2006 eclipsed the Las Vegas strip as the world’s largest gaming market.The decision to redevelop the 12-storey landmark casino was motivated by more than economics – the Lisboa could be replaced by a much taller tower. Coming just weeks before SJM’s planned $1bn initial public offering in Hong Kong, it also symbolised a break with Macao’s past and a new beginning for the company.Macao, a former Portuguese colony which reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999, has only recently begun to shed its reputation as a sleazy, triad-infested den of iniquity – an image that has rendered Mr Ho, who has long denied having any links to the territory’s underworld, persona non grata in the eyes of many overseas gaming regulators.Macao’s image began to change for the better this decade following the entry of five new casino operators.The new entrants, including Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Mirage of the US and Australia’s Publishing and Broadcasting (now known as Consolidated Media Holdings), have invested billions of dollars in nine new casinos since Mr Ho’s 40-year gaming monopoly was scrapped in 2002.SJM, which operates 18 casinos owned by its parent, Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, is undergoing an equally radical overhaul, with potentially important consequences for Mr Ho’s sprawling family.The tycoon, who recently celebrated his 86th birthday and is estimated to have a fortune worth more than $7bn, has fathered at least 17 children by four wives.“This is as much about succession planning as it is about the IPO,” says one person involved in the transaction. “Ho’s own legacy is complete. He’s more worried about his children.”Including SJM, Mr Ho and his family have interests in three of Macao’s six gaming concessions. Mr Ho’s heir apparent and daughter from his second marriage, Pansy, has partnered with MGM Mirage in an independent capacity. Lawrence, Pansy’s younger brother, has a joint venture with James Packer’s CMH.Rounding out this complicated set of Ho family dynamics is the tycoon’s fourth wife and mother of his five youngest children, Angela Leong.Ms Leong, who is just two years older than Pansy, is a director at SJM, which would appear to put her in pole position to take over the helm at the most lucrative operation in her husband’s business empire.While neither Pansy nor Lawrence have any direct ties to SJM, Ms Ho is an STDM director and also managing director of her father’s transportation and property arm, Shun Tak Holdings.MGM Mirage initially considered partnering with Shun Tak, but was dissuaded by regulatory concerns in its home market.“The regulators in the US frowned on that, especially in Nevada,” Terry Lanni, MGM Mirage chairman and chief executive, recalled in an interview before last month’s opening of the $1.25bn MGM Grand Macau.“Nevada didn’t think it would be appropriate because of the ownership that Dr Ho has in [Shun Tak] …They just made it very clear to us that he was an individual we could not do business with.”Ms Ho, who owes the bulk of her net worth to her father, has had to reassure US regulators that he has no influence over her partnership with MGM Mirage.“Rich fathers tend to give money to their kids,” Mr Lanni said. “I mean, who else would they give it to? [Nevada regulators] asked her: do you expect to receive any more money from your father? She said I have no idea but I’m not going to turn it down.”Ms Ho, who is also managing director of the MGM Grand Macau, said last month: “I think [people] are a little bit confused because the Ho family represents many things at the same time.“It becomes a bit cumbersome when I need to explain which side of the family business I’m involved with and …convince people that we are independent …Doing both the MGM venture on a private basis and continuing to manage and develop Shun Tak’s business itself do not carry, at least to date, any contradiction.”
165;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2008-01-15T18:00:30Z;Regulator query delays Macao gaming IPO;;Sociedade de Jogos de Macau has delayed the launch of its long-awaited initial public offering until at least next week, after the gaming company controlled by tycoon Stanley Ho was asked by the Hong Kong market regulator for more information.SJM, which plans to raise $1bn on the Hong Kong stock exchange, had been scheduled to start its roadshow on Tuesday but postponed the launch pending what one person involved said was a minor “procedural delay” to answer queries from the Securities and Futures Commission, the market regulator. SJM had been hoping to debut on February 4.“It’s just got so many moving parts. Don’t expect the roadshow this week,” one person said. “But it’s not a showstopper.”SJM’s listing, which was approved by the Hong Kong stock exchange’s listing committee, must also be cleared by the regulator’s corporate finance department before it can print a draft prospectus for investors. SJM and Deutsche Bank, which is leading the offer with support from CLSA and BNP Paribas, declined to comment, as did the market regulator.The IPO has been in the works for two years and involves a complicated corporate restructuring at SJM and its parent, Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau. Mr Ho is managing director of both companies, and also their public face.STDM’s multiple shareholders include the families of Cheng Yu-teng, who controls the New World group, and Henry Fok, the late Hong Kong tycoon. The company has also been at the centre of a long-running and highly litigious feud between Mr Ho and his estranged sister Winnie over her interest in the company.“We’ve had more lawyers working on this than bankers,” said another person involved in the deal.Macao’s gaming market, which surpassed the Las Vegas strip as the world’s largest in 2006, was monopolised for 40 years by Mr Ho and STDM. It was liberalised in 2002, paving the way for investments from some of the world’s largest casino companies including Las Vegas Sands, MGM Mirage, Wynn Resorts of the US and Australia’s Publishing and Broadcasting (now called Consolidated Media Holdings).SJM would use part of the proceeds to buy the 18 casinos it manages on its parent’s behalf, according to people close to the transaction. While still the dominant player in the sector, the company has lost market share to rivals.BNP Paribas estimates that the company will report a 60 per cent decline in net profit to $128m for 2007, after investing in a new flagship casino that opened in February, the Grand Lisboa.Total gaming revenues for all of Macao reached $7.36bn in the first nine months of last year – compared with $7.19bn in all of 2006.
166;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-08-10T18:47:16Z;Wall St falls on liquidity fears;;Wall Street looked on course to close lower on the day on Friday, completing a turbulent week during which an early rally was pared by increasing worries about contagion from the US subprime sector, but markets appeared set to gain overall for the week.By mid-afternoon, the S&P 500 was 0.8 per cent up for the week at 1,443.90, the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.8 per cent to 2,532.48 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent on the week to 13,163.21.However, all the indices were down on the day. The Dow fell 0.8 per cent, the S&P 500 was 0.6 per cent lower and the Nasdaq fell 0.9 per cent.On Thursday, the Federal Reserve joined the European Central Bank to intervene in the market, raising more fears of a liquidity crunch and failing to curb bearish sentiment. The Federal Reserve injected further liquidity into the banking system on three occasions on Friday.The week saw a surge in volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index – a measure of equity volatility – hit a 52-week high of 29.84 in early trade on Friday before moderating slightly. By midday, the index was trading up 15.4 per cent for the week at 29.04.“Volatility is here to stay,” said Doug Peta, markets strategist at J&W Seligman. “The Vix is going to stay well above 20. We’re going to look back at the days when the Vix was below 15 as an aberration.”Financial stocks led a rally in the first half of the week, before gains were pared by sell-offs on Thursday and Friday. By midday on Friday, the S&P investment bank index was up by 2 per cent for the week although it was down 1.7 per cent for the day. Goldman Sachs was down 0.8 per cent for the week at $178.56 after reports that it and other big Wall Street banks were being examined by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine their vulnerability to home-loan defaults.Other banks were hit by the news, but still appeared likely to end the week up. Bear Stearns was 1.2 per cent higher for the week at $109.65 by mid-afternoon on Friday, Lehman Brothers was up 5.8 per cent to $59.01 and Merril Lynch was up 6.1 per cent at $74.33.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in the spotlight as investors hoped that the government-sponsored enterprises would soon start buying mortgages to support that market. Fannie Mae said on Friday it had requested permission to increase its investments in home loans and mortgage bonds by as much as $72bn to help provide liquidity in the credit markets.In spite of President George W. Bush’s view that the mortgage lenders should reform their business models before being able to lift their investment portfolio limits, Fannie Mae was 18 per cent higher for the week at $66.82 while Freddie Mac was up 11.2 per cent at $61.92.Shares in Countrywide Financial, the largest US mortgage lender, fell by as much as 14 per cent early on Friday after the company warned adverse market conditions for mortgage lenders may continue to hurt its future earnings. Its shares were up 8.5 per cent for the week at $27.09.The debt and secondary mortgage markets are experiencing “unprecedented disruptions” which could impact the company’s performance, especially in the short term, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.Despite declining interest rates on standard mortgages, loans have become more expensive and less available for many borrowers, particularly those with poor credit.The S&P Homebuilders index was up 9.5 per cent for the week as hopes of at least one rate cut by the Federal Reserve were significantly raised. American International Group‘s stock rose by 4.6 per cent over the week to $64.47. The insurer reported a 3 per cent rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday, exceeding analysts’ expectations, although it also warned that losses in its mortgage guarantee business were spreading from subprime to prime borrowers.Home Depot was down 1.4 per cent on the week to $35.69 after an announcement on Thursday that it might have to sell its supply unit for less than the previously announced $10.3bn.Wynn Resorts Resorts boosted other casino stocks after it reported a quarterly profit of $89.6m earlier in the week. It rose 10 per cent to $111.24 over the week.Cisco shares ended the week 5.7 per cent higher, at $31.14, after the technology bellwether reported higher earnings than expected on Tuesday on the back of better quarterly sales.Sprint Nextel, the telecoms company, reported lower quarterly profits on Wednesday, but beat analysts’ average forecasts as it added new subscribers. Its shares were down 5.6 per cent at $18.65.Wall Street stocks dived initially on Friday after the moves by central banks. Central banks in the US, Europe and Asia pumped liquidity into the banking system, adding to concerns about a possible global liquidity crunch.“The effects of rising volatility and increasing risk aversion clearly appear to be spreading to the equity markets,” said analysts at Merrill Lynch. “Some equity hedge funds and quantitative long/short equity funds are now liquidating positions at decidedly unfavorable terms.”In a statement on Friday morning, the Federal Reserve said it was “providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets” and offered to provide reserves “as necessary” to promote a federal funds rate close to its target rate of 5.25 per cent.The markets looked on course to complete a fourth consecutive week of losses as the bearish tone over credit intensified. That would constitute the worst run in US equity markets since a string of six consecutive weekly declines in June and July of 2004.Leading the charge among financials were Fannie Mae, up 3 per cent at $64.43, and Freddie Mac, 2.8 per cent higher at $61.64. Talk that the government-sponsored enterprises might be allowed to expand their mortgage balance sheets continued to boost their stock prices.
167;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-08-07T22:03:09Z;US financials rally on Fed statement;;"Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday, thanks to a late rally that overcame an initially negative market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s policy outlook.“This was really the continuation of the rally that began on Monday,” said Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management. “The fundamentals were always there. If the Fed had made a stronger statement, we might have seen a worse market reaction.”After a jittery afternoon session, the S&P 500 index finished up 0.6 per cent at 1476.71, the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.6 per cent higher at 2,561.60 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.26 per cent at 13504.3.In post-market trade, shares in Cisco surged more than 6 per cent to $31.48 after the tech bellwether reported a 25 per cent rise in fiscal fourth quarter profit. Cisco rose 0.6 per cent to close at $29.69 in regular trade.The Federal Reserve reiterated the risk posed by inflation and continued to forecast a moderate pace of economic expansion. It noted that markets had been volatile in recent weeks.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards said: “This was a harsher statement than what the market was looking for. It leaves us with a couple of months of uncertainty and the Fed could have helped ease that with a sentence or two saying ‘we stand ready to inject liquidity into the system’.”The initial disappointment with the statement was reflected in sharp falls. The S&P 500 index plunged 1.4 per cent in reaction, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average both fell by 1.3 per cent immediately following the statement.But the final hours of trading saw a strong rally, led by homebuilders and some financial stocks. The S&P Homebuilder Index was up 5 per cent.TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: “The statement supports our view that, in the next six to eight weeks, we will know whether the ‘wheels are going to come off’, either from a financial crisis or a greater than expected economic slowdown due to tightening financial conditions, or [if] the financial markets and economy are going to successfully weather the current storm.”Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, finished 5.8 per cent lower. The Vix hit a peak of 26.47 on Monday, its highest reading since April 2003.Among the main S&P industry groups, the financials sector was in the spotlight, rising 0.9 per cent on the day.Leading the charge among financials were Fannie Mae, up 3 per cent at $64.43, and Freddie Mac, 2.8 per cent higher at $61.64. Talk that the government-sponsored enterprises might be allowed to expand their mortgage balance sheets continued to boost their stock prices.Both Fannie and Freddie currently operate under strict portfolio limits, and at the end of June their holdings of mortgages were about $38bn below those caps, said Credit Suisse.Analysts also said the sharp decline in the price of mortgage securities in recent weeks should entail higher profits for the GSE’s as their cost of funding has not risen sharply.“Even if some temporary flexibility is given, the GSEs will probably be required
to make formal requests to amend their growth enforcement orders, have explicit plans on what is to be purchased, and explain how such actions will help the market,” said Alex Li, fixed income strategist at Credit Suisse.The rebound in financials also extended to Wall Street investment banks, which have recently been hit hard by financing problems in mortgage and credit markets.In a conference call held on Tuesday, Moody’s said big investment banks faced a “modest” risk from subprime mortgages and no rating changes were expected.The issuance of new securities in both markets has slowed to a crawl as investors have baulked at buying a pipeline of $300bn in loans and bonds.By the close, the S&P investment bank index was up 1.4 per cent, with Bear Stearns up 2.7 per cent at $116.89, while Lehman Brothers was 4.2 per cent stronger at $60.71.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, was up 2.2 per cent at $27.35, after a rally of 7 per cent on Monday.Beyond financials, investors focused on quarterly earnings news.Wynn Resorts boosted other casino stocks after it reported a quarterly profit of $89.6m. The shares surged 10 per cent to $118.20, after setting an all-time high of $123.71 in early trade.Duke Energy reported a 17 per cent fall in quarterly profit and the stock was 5.4 per cent firmer at $18.86."
168;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-08-07T17:34:27Z;The Short View: Extreme volatility;;What in the markets can we rely upon? It was hard, ahead of Tuesday’s announcement from the Federal Reserve’s federal open market committee, to discern patterns in the extreme volatility of the past weeks. But one or two trends were clear.First, markets have lost faith in small-cap stocks. That is a logical response to more expensive credit. Small stocks are more likely to be bought out by private equity – justifying a premium while debt was cheap – and have debt on their balance sheet.The Russell 2000 index of smaller US stocks has endured a true “correction”, down more than 10 per cent from its recent high, even after Monday’s rally.Another long-term pattern that seems to be over is the dominance of “value” investing (buying stocks that are cheap compared to the underlying value of their assets) against “growth” investing (picking stocks with fast-growing earnings). It had grown difficult for bargain-hunters to find true “value” after a lengthy bull market, and investors are now attracted by the relative safety of stocks with strong earnings.What has endured the mess of the past few weeks? First, faith in emerging markets remains almost undimmed. Normally in risk aversion, emerging markets would be expected to fall further than the market as a whole. They have budged but barely any more than the rest of the market. By Monday’s close, MSCI’s emerging markets index had fallen 7.5 per cent since July 19, when the MSCI world index peaked. The world index itself was down 6.1 per cent. For the year, emerging markets were up 16.5 per cent, against 4.8 per cent for the world index. Compared with other risky assets, faith in emerging markets remains robust.Faith in human frailty also remains constant. Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts have both gained more than 40 per cent in less than a month.For FOMC reaction, visit www.ft.com/shortview
169;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-07-12T18:37:40Z;Observer: The shopping bag is the message;;A charity sale of British designer Anya Hindmarch’s canvas tote bag – wittily adorned with the phrase “I’m not a plastic bag” – was meant to raise awareness about the excessive use of plastic bags.The limited edition bags, designed for activist organisation We Are What We Do, became must-have fashion statements after celebrities including Keira Knightley and Alicia Silverstone were photographed with them.Crowds mobbed shops in Taiwan and Hong Kong last week when the bags, which are ostensibly environmentally friendly, went on sale. So many people showed up in Hong Kong that the sale had to be delayed and those at the front of the queue were given tokens to pick up their bags at a later date.When the lucky shoppers in Hong Kong went to pick up their bags on Tuesday, they were given their tote bag wrapped in three plastic bags so it would be disguised. It was apparently an ill-advised attempt by the store to avoid a repeat of the earlier, frenzied scene.We are what we do, indeed. But then again, in terms of making a public point about how people misuse plastic bags, it was a stroke of genius.Roll againLas Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts may have changed the way casino gambling is played in Macao, but the two US operators have not managed to change the games.It was the local Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, however, which this week introduced the traditional American casino favourite, craps. At SJM’s flagship Grand Lisboa casino, craps now competes for attention with Chinese dice games sic-bo and fish-prawn-crab and Macao’s perennial top draw, baccarat.SJM’s parent company tried to bring craps tables to Macao about 30 years ago, but the dice sat still. Tim Gilbert, vice president of table gaming, thinks this time may be different.“They’ll be drawn across the floor to this game,” he says, referring to the heavily Chinese clientele. “They are naturally drawn to crowded, boisterous entertainment.’’The Grand Lisboa is hedging its bet. So far it is opening one craps table and offering free lessons with dummy chips each weekday.Eight is the most auspicious number for Chinese, as against craps’ focus on the western lucky seven. So the casino might have boosted its odds by changing the game slightly – but no dice.Gore’s campaignAl Gore claims the Live Earth concerts he helped to organise last weekend were the biggest media event in history, based on global television and internet audiences.But in many countries, viewing figures were poor.In the US, for example, Live Earth suffered the ultimate humiliation of being beaten in the ratings by a soccer match.Only 2.75m people tuned in for the climate change awareness concerts compared with the 2.9m who watched Argentina trounce Peru 4-0 in the Copa America.The ratings were a disappointment for those in the Democratic party who hoped Live Earth would act as a springboard for Gore to enter the 2008 US presidential race.But there could be one final catalyst for the former vice-president to revive his White House ambitions before primary elections start in January.Gore has been nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace prize in recognition of his efforts to save the planet from global warming.The winner is scheduled to be announced in October and Gore supporters believe the award would provide the perfect piece of free publicity with which to launch a presidential campaign.Gore has repeatedly said that he has no intention of running for the Democratic nomination. But polls show he could be a threat to Hillary Clinton if he did.Perhaps Mrs Clinton should start lobbying for Bono – the rock star activist and perennial Nobel prize hopeful – just to make sure.Dim prospectFloodlight failure is nothing new at football matches in south-east Asia. International gambling syndicates have been known to pay a small fortune to ensure that games do not end in a result that would cost them a large fortune.So when half the lights went out on Wednesday in the Asian Cup group match in Jakarta between Saudi Arabia and South Korea six minutes before the final whistle with the score at 1-1, it seemed very suspicious.Interpol did not have to be alerted, however. The cause of the blackout was a problem at the state electricity company’s local base station.Luckily for all concerned, staff at the 45-year-old Gelora Bung Karno stadium (which has undergone an $8m facelift for the tournament) were able to dust down the generator. They got it started in just under 30 minutes, after which the match would have been abandoned.The embarrassing fiasco is not surprising. Indonesia’s creaking infrastructure needs $140bn to be spent on it in the next decade to maintain current growth levels.“Brownouts”, where the electricity dips, are common across much of the country, the water system is crumbling and there has been a litany of fatal transport crashes this year.Now that the world has witnessed the problems, it remains to be seen whether foreigners will have been encouraged to invest.And as for the floodlights, tournament organisers say the generator will now be working overtime to ensure they stay on for as long as necessary.Spoilers uniteEconomists have developed many econometric models aimed at estimating how valuable certain actions are to people. They could soon have an interesting case study to put some of their theories to the test.Certain members of the Bancroft family, the clan that controls Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal, have put pressure on the board to meet investors interested in coming up with a rival bid to the $5bn on the table from Rupert Murdoch.The meetings, some of which took place this week, seem to be mainly with billionaires or multi-millionaires who have an axe to grind against Murdoch.Ron Burkle, the Californian supermarket billionaire, took a drubbing in Murdoch’s New York Post’s Page Six gossip pages. Brad Greenspan, the internet entrepreneur who had a stake in the company that owned MySpace (and made millions when Murdoch bought it for $580m) has been trying to get more money from the sale, though his legal challenges failed. There was even talk of Charlie Ergen, who owns US satellite group Echostar, getting involved. Ergen bought rival DirecTV several years ago only to have the deal blocked by regulators after a mighty lobbying effort led by Murdoch. It looks as though the talks are not really amounting to anything serious – so far Murdoch remains the only bidder.The others seem unlikely to cough up the cash to thwart him, but if they are able to give the board enough ammo to press for a higher price from News Corp, they will be rubbing their hands with glee and notching up lots of utility value.Bankers banquetAnyone left with doubts about why The Rolling Stones still endure marathon tours when they could be kicking back in luxury can rest assured – it’s all about the money. Despite a busy schedule on their current “A Bigger Bang” world tour, The Stones last night gave a private show to a select group of bankers and financial analysts at the ultra-trendy Hotel Arts in Barcelona.The band was reportedly paid about €4m to strut its stuff in the middle of a two-day financial products conference hosted by Deutsche Bank. Observer expects news soon of a Stones bond issue securitised on future royalties and tours.Send your comments to observer@ft.com
170;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-07-05T20:41:13Z;Wall St mixed amid deals and strong data;;US stocks were mixed on Thursday. Deal activity, solid economic data and new record highs in several large technology companies were offset by higher bond yields and general scepticism over the outlook for equities.A $26bn buy-out of Hilton Hotels by Blackstone ignited other stocks in the hotels sector and also boosted real estate companies.Robust economic data ahead of the June employment report, due on Friday, failed to spark a strong response in stocks. The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 60.7 in June. It was the first print above 60 in more than a year and pushed bond yields higher.Late in New York, the S&P 500 index had closed up 0.04 per cent at 1,525.41. With the yield on the 10-year bond higher by 10 basis points at 5.14 per cent, utility and financial stocks were among the major sectors that declined. Telecoms led losses while technology was a notabled gainer. Energy lost its earlier lustre as crude oil prices retreated from a recent 10-month high above $72 a barrel.Among stocks in the news, Hilton closed up 25.9 per cent at $45.39, shy of the $47.50 a share buy-out offer. Blackstone rose 3.1 per cent to $30.63, still below its recent listing price of $31 a-share.Option volumes in Hilton stock surged on Tuesday before the deal was announced. Volumes set their highest daily volume since 2005, said Bespoke Investment Group. So far this week, Hilton’s stock is up 35.6 per cent.Other hotel stocks rallied sharply on Thursday. Marriott rose 7 per cent to $47.57, Starwood gained 7.8 per cent to $74.55, Choice Hotels was 7.4 per cent higher at $42.60, Wynn Resorts increased 4.5 per cent to $92.76 and Host Hotels had rallied 9.1 per cent to $26.01.“The most vocal speculation had always surrounded Starwood, given its prized assets and close ties to the financial community, but Hilton proved to be the first belle to the ball,” said analysts at CreditSights.Real estate stocks also rose as investors expect hotel buy-outs could involve unlocking the value of property. Real estate investment trust stocks rallied almost 1.5 per cent on Thursday and resisted weakness seen in other interest rate sensitive sectors.In other deal news, Huntsman had jumped 12.7 per cent to $27.50 on Thursday after the chemicals company said a private-equity firm had made a $6bn buyout offer. That raised the stakes as Huntsman received a $5.6bn bid last week from Basell Holdings, a Dutch chemicals maker.Aside from buy-out activity, another source of support for stocks could paradoxically come from investors who are worried that the market is heading for tough times.In recent weeks, equity volatility has been trending higher and traders say this reflects increased buying of put options on broad benchmarks.Timothy Krause, director of risk management at Zecco Trading said: “We have seen more buying of puts on ETF’s for indexes while calls seem more popular on specific companies.”Meanwhile, the level of short interest – stocks that have been sold by investors who do not actually own them – has risen to record levels in recent months according to the New York Stock Exchange.Should the broad market rally further as the second quarter earnings season gets under way next week, the pressure on bearishly positioned investors to liquidate positions may intensify.“Scepticism in the market means their money can still come into play,” said Richard Sparks, senior equity options trader at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.Large technology companies continued to attract buyers on Thursday, and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 0.4 per cent to close at 2,656.65. The close marked a fresh six-and-a-half year high and the Nasdaq’s gain of 10 per cent so far this year eclipses 2006’s total rise of 9.5 per cent.Research In Motion rose 4 per cent to $216.19 on news that it had gained approval to sell its BlackBerry device in China. Rim has risen more than 30 per cent from $165 a share in the past week since announcing strong earnings and a three-for-one share split.Shares in Apple set a new all-time record high of $132.97 on Thursday. The stock closed up 4.4 per cent at $132.75, amid strong sales of its newly released iPhone.Google also set a new record high of $544.40 and rose 1.4 per cent to close at $541.63.Another stock in the news was Cognos. The Canadian software company doubled its stock buyback program to $400m and the stock rallied 1.6 per cent to $340.20.Blue chips declined and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to close at 13,565.84.A drag on the Dow was General Motors, down 3.2 per cent at $36.76. The carmaker was downgraded by Bear Stearns, as GM’s share price has risen 31 per cent from a low of $28.92 on May 10. GM also reported a 21 per cent decline in June sales late on Tuesday. GM’s stock price remains 19.7 per cent higher so far this year.In other deal talk, Coca-Cola was reported to be pondering a bid for Cadbury Schweppes’ Snapple iced tea brand. Shares in Coke fell 0.4 per cent to finish the day at $52.67.In economic news, the upbeat ISM index of non-manufacturing activity for June arrived above May’s reading of 59.7 and was also better than a forecast slide to 58.1.“The data is certainly consistent with a view that the recovery in the service sector since the March low is no fluke,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Earlier in the day, private sector employment increased by 150,000 in June, according to the ADP. This follows a revised gain of 98,000 jobs in May. The figure was stronger than a forecast 100,000 and pushed bond yields higher.The ADP report has a mixed track record compared with the official monthly employment report, but bond traders were taking a cautious approach. The June employment report is due on Friday and economists expect a 125,000 rise in non-farm payrolls after a 157,000 gain in May. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.5 per cent.“The data flow points to optimism for Friday’s payroll report, where we continue to expect +150,000,” said economists at Lehman Brothers.
171;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-06-27T19:23:00Z;Playboy mansion planned for Macao resort;;Playboy Enterprises on Wednesday said it would open a 40,000 sq ft “entertainment destination” in Macao in 2009. It will feature not just bars, restaurants and shops but also a “Hugh M. Hefner Villa” modelled on the famous mansion built by the company’s founder.The complex will be part of Macao Studio City, a $2bn integrated resort and casino being built by Hong Kong-listed eSun Holdings and a US investment consortium.A casino will be run by Melco PBL, one of Macao’s six licensed gaming companies. Macao Studio City will also include television and film production facilities, a theatre, an arena and three hotels, among them a Marriott and a Ritz Carlton.Playboy is the latest globally recognised brand – including Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts – to have come to the region. Macao’s gaming industry last year eclipsed the Las Vegas strip as the world’s largest with revenues of $6.9bn.Although classy new casinos have transformed Macao, brothels, thinly disguised as sauna parlours and karaoke lounges, remain an integral part of the city’s underbelly and continue to draw many visitors.Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts entered the territory with casinos in 2004 and 2006 respectively.The debut of the $2.3bn Venetian Macao, a Sands development, will be the first test of Macao’s ambition to become a premier convention, tourist and entertainment destination.The 3,000-room resort’s facilities and attractions will include a 15,000-seat arena and another theatre for a resident Cirque du Soleil troupe.Sands is also sponsoring exhibition tennis matches featuring Roger Federer and Pete Sampras, and the Manchester United football team. Macao could not have dreamt of hosting such acts when it was a sleepy backwater.Not everyone is convinced that Macao will be able to match Las Vegas as an entertainment capital. “It does take time for [non-gaming] assets to ramp up,” one casino executive in the territory said.“None of us knows what the entertainment piece will be.”
172;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-06-08T21:21:08Z;Wynn plays a cautious hand in Macao;;Wynn Resorts has delayed a planned expansion of its Macao casino, citing new restrictions on visitors from neighbouring Guangdong province and an unprecedented increase in capacity.The announcement highlights larger regulatory and oversupply fears that, if realised, could have an impact on all casino operators in the world’s largest gaming market.“We are wary of the future effect of newly restrictive visa requirements,” Steve Wynn, chairman and chief executive, said.“In addition, management recognises and will continue to monitor the effect on our business of the dramatic expansion in supply represented by the openings of the Venetian [Macao] and the MGM Grand Paradise in November.”Wynn Resorts was awarded one of Macao’s three original gaming concessions in February 2002. But it did not open the Wynn Macau until September last year – more than two years after Sheldon Adelson’s Sands Macao took the territory by storm.Mr Adelson’s next project – the $2.5bn, 3,000-room Venetian Macao – will be the world’s largest casino when it opens in August, complete with more than 1m sq ft each of convention and retail space.The Wynn Macau, which opened in September, had planned to mark its first anniversary with a 200-table, 900-slot expansion. That has been scaled back to just 25 new tables and 200 slot machines.It is the second time this year that Wynn Macau has delayed its expansion, which had originally been scheduled to open in February in time for the Chinese New Year holiday. However, the original target date was pushed back to September after Wynn Resorts’ chairman expressed dissatisfaction with the design, which would have resulted in two separate casino spaces. Mr Wynn wanted a more integrated floor plan.“The reason we brought it back was Mr Wynn wasn’t happy. We’ve made some significant changes in the space,” Grant Bowie, Wynn Macau president and general manager, said. “People were encouraging him to get open [in February]. But that’s not how he works. You only get one opportunity to make a first impression.”While the Wynn Macau’s first delay could be chalked up to the fact that its boss is a tough man to please, the second delay was attributed to much more fundamental concerns.In addition to potential oversupply stemming from the Venetian and MGM openings this year, Mr Wynn also cited “newly restrictive visa requirements imposed by the central government in China which have, in the past few weeks, restricted visitation to Macao from [neighbouring] Guangdong province”.Guangdong is China’s richest province and, with a population of more than 90m, a major source of gamblers for Macao. Reports first began to surface late last month that the Chinese government was making it more difficult for Guangdong residents to visit Macao by, for example, limiting the number of times a person could visit and slowing approval procedures.The restrictions, however, have yet to be confirmed by either central or provincial authorities, and opinions vary widely on their scope and likely effect.Manuel Joaquim das Neves, the head of Macao’s gaming regulator, said they were provincial in origin.“We still don’t see any negative effect,” Mr das Neves told the Financial Times. Macao’s gaming industry, he added, had had its strongest month on record in May, with revenues of $900m.
173;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;On Asia: Place your bets as investors punt on Macao boom;;"There is a place in greater China where the economy is growing even faster than the soaraway mainland, where gross domestic product is rising at 15 per cent a year, and where average wages are climbing at a similar rate.Welcome to Macao, the special territory handed back by Portugal to China in 1999, which is experiencing a casino-led, once-in-a-lifetime boom.The ratio of cranes to surface area whirring away on the Cotai strip – land recently reclaimed between two of Macao’s three islands – is high enough to give Dubai a run for its money.For international investors looking to put money into Asia, a Macao punt must be tempting.However, a debate rages over whether the growth story forms part of a genuine, sustainable re-rating of the economy or an investment-led boom that is likely to blow up when the speculators move on to the next opportunity.Of course, the simplest way to make money out of Macao is to jump on the one-hour ferry from Hong Kong and head for one of the territory’s casinos.Local casino king Stanley Ho lost his monopoly five years ago, after which US groups such as Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands landed to spruce up the Macao gaming experience.However, fund managers can play Macao via that other risky casino – the stock market.It is worth remembering that gaming revenues in Macao last year climbed 22 per cent to $6.95bn, surpassing the Las Vegas strip as the world’s biggest gaming hub in revenue for the first time.The forecast further rise in gaming revenues, as China allows millions more of its citizens every year to travel to Macao, has helped turn the spotlight on listed gaming operators.Several are listed in the US, including Wynn and Sands, whose share prices have been boosted by their Macao adventures.There is Melco PBL, the joint venture between Macao’s Melco and Australia’s PBL, which listed on Nasdaq last December and is a pure play on the territory.Melco PBL’s first casino, Crown Macao, opened last month over budget and with most of its higher-margin VIP tables unfinished. Investors will be hoping the opening of the partnership’s City of Dreams underwater casino on the Cotai strip next year runs smoother.Then there is Hong Kong-listed Galaxy Entertainment, which runs five casinos and is quietly fancied by many analysts.Galaxy focuses on attracting the nouveaux riches of the mainland, who make up 80 per cent of the gamblers who visit Macao. The company’s market share is a creditable 21 per cent, while its share of the crucial VIP market is nearer 30 per cent.At only eight times 2009 earnings, Billy Ng at JPMorgan rates Galaxy as the cheapest of the Macao gaming plays, given that its peers trade at between 11 times and 16 times forward earnings. He believes the share price could rise 25 per cent to HK$10 by the end of the year from HK$8.06 yesterday.The other sector to target is property. Choice abounds here too.Among them are Hong Kong-listed Shun Tak, which is developing many of Macao’s high-end residences, and the Macau Property Opportunities Fund, whose share price has risen 30 per cent since listing on London’s Alternative Investment Market a year ago.However, analysts are divided on whether property companies will continue to benefit from the boom.For instance, the brains at Goldman Sachs are bullish on Polytec Asset Holdings, believing the Hong Kong-listed developer is well positioned to benefit from the territory’s strong fundamentals. Goldman’s Anthony Wu says: “Macao is becoming less dependent on gaming, and this will help support the economy and the housing sector over the long term.”Not so, according to George Choi at Citigroup, who this week slapped a sell recommendation on the stock. He says: “We believe that the property market is driven by speculators; also, that developers will face higher land acquisition and labour construction costs, which will depress future margins.”Citigroup notes that a record 17,000 residential units are committed to be built over the next four years, fuelling rampant wage inflation among the hard-hat brigade. The government is also set to change policy and dispose of its land through auctions, not back-room deals, a move likely to drive up acquisition costs.Then again, owner occupation in Macao is close to 80 per cent, and locals typically spend only a quarter of household income on mortgage repayments. With wages rising fast, there is room for the Macanese to upgrade to newer apartments.The bulls say only 20 per cent of the $35bn committed to investment in the territory has been spent, ensuring the growth story will continue for a while. Even Sir Richard Branson, the UK entrepreneur, is trying to jump on the bandwagon and acquire land and a licence to build a $3bn casino.sunny.tucker@ft.com"
174;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2007-05-22T20:36:41Z;S&P 500 gives up earlier gains;;Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday, with technology the bright spot, as blue chips and the S&P 500 index failed to sustain record breaking momentum.Without fresh economic data, investors focused on deals news, with shares in MGM Mirage surging 27.1 per cent to $79.98. Kirk Kerkorian said Tracinda, his investment company, was negotiating with MGM about buying the casino operator’s Bellagio Hotel and City-Center properties in Las Vegas. Mr Kerkorian holds a 56 per cent stake in MGM.The S&P 500 made another foray above its record close of 1,527.46 set on March 24, 2000 on Tuesday, but could not hold gains. The S&P reached an intra-day high of 1,529.24, a shade under Monday’s intraday high of 1,529.87.The US benchmark again struggled to make the decisive move higher that would eclipse the all-time intraday high of 1,552.87 – set on the same day as the all-time closing high seven years ago. Late in New York, the S&P had closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,522.11. Technology and financials were the only two positive sectors among the 10 major industry groups in the index. Materials and energy stocks led losses.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.4 per cent higher at 2,588.02, and had reversed weakness earlier in the day as semiconductor stocks rebounded.Blue chips set an new intra-day record high, but failed to hold that rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.02 per cent lower to close at 13,539.95 after it had set a new record high of 13,586.68.The S&P’s flirtation with record levels comes after more than 90 per cent of companies in the index have reported first-quarter results.“Although US growth has been slowing, S&P 500 margins seem to have been maintained in part thanks to the strength of the global economy and a weakening dollar which have boosted overseas sales. Around 30 per cent of revenues now come from abroad,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.“While earnings growth may continue to decelerate, we are not likely to see outright falls as long as the US does not go into recession and growth elsewhere stays robust.”Although recent economic data have been inconsistent, the stock market is riding a wave of liquidity, say analysts. “There is an ample supply of inexpensive investment capital and real interest rates remain low,” said Doug Peta, equity strategist at J&W Seligman.As stock prices have rallied since the end of March, short sales of shares have risen sharply – indicating that some investors expect the market to suffer a reversal.A short sale is a sale of a security that the seller does not own, and makes money if prices fall.Late on Monday, the New York Stock Exchange said the number of shares that have been sold short, known as short interest, increased to 11.8bn as of May 10, a new record high, from 11.0bn on April 13.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said the 7 per cent rise in short interest over the past month was the 10th largest monthly increase in short interest over the last 16 years. They concluded: “It is hard to imagine that investors are overly bullish with short interest hitting record highs month after month.”Amid the MGM casino news, other gaming stocks rose on Tuesday, led by Boyd Gaming, up 5.5 per cent to $49.64, Wynn Resorts, up 7.4 per cent to $101.15 and Las Vegas Sands higher by 5.6 per cent at $80.19.On the back of Fremont General’s sale of its commercial real estate business to iStar, other mortgage lenders rallied, with shares in Accredited Home Lenders rising 4.9 per cent to $13.38. Shares in iStar rallied 3.9 per cent to $47.60.In company news, Chevron said it planned to sell its 12 per cent stake in power producer Dynegy, the power producer, in a move to exit non-core operations. Shares in Dynegy fell 3.3 per cent to $9.83, while Chevron was 0.8 per cent lower at $82.18.In earnings news, Staples said its first-quarter profit rose 12 per cent, but lowered its guidance for future earnings. Shares in the office products supplier had slid 2.4 per cent to close at $25.05.A brokerage upgrade boosted Citrix Systems, by 5.4 per cent to $32.91. The software maker set a recent high of $34.63 in late April.
175;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2006-10-26T13:01:53Z;Melco gets clearance for Nasdaq listing;;The Hong Kong stock exchange has reversed an earlier decision to block Melco International Development’s proposed Nasdaq spin-off, allowing it to proceed with an offering that could raise up to $1bn.Melco, controlled by Lawrence Ho, wants to spin-off part of its 50 per cent stake in a Macao gaming joint venture with James Packer’s Publishing and Broadcasting on the Nasdaq stock exchange – as it seeks funds for its casino developments in the former Portuguese enclave.The company said on Thursday that a Hong Kong stock exchange review committee had granted it “permission to proceed with the proposed separate listing of its Macao gaming joint venture”.This overturned a decision taken last month by the exchange’s listing committee, which was reportedly concerned that Melco did not meet the profitability benchmarks required before a Hong Kong-listed company can spin-off part of its business.At the time, Melco attributed the hiccup to “different interpretations in the way that accounting standards should be applied”. Mr Ho also emphasised that Melco’s intended Nasdaq vehicle would hold only a portion of its 50 per cent stake in the joint venture with PBL.The joint venture holds a gaming sub-commission, which PBL secured earlier this year from Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts (Macao) for $900m. Six companies have been licensed to operate or franchise casinos in Macao, whose gaming industry has seen explosive growth since it was liberalised in 2001.The Chinese Special Administrative Region is poised to overtake the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s largest gambling centre, possibly in the final quarter of this year.A number of recent casino openings, including Mr Wynn’s first foray into the market last month, has spurred demand. Driven by the opening of the $1.2bn Wynn Macao, September gaming revenues in the territory grew 37 per cent year-on-year to $575m.Melco and PBL’s first casino, the $255m Crown Macao, is scheduled to open in April. The two partners will also invest as much as $1.5bn in a large-scale gaming resort, City of Dreams, which they hope to inaugurate in 2008.The members of the Hong Kong stock exchange’s listing committee are divided into two 14-member panels, which meet on alternate weeks to review listing applications, spin-off proposals and other matters. Companies may appeal decisions made by one panel to the other.
176;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2006-10-05T13:33:46Z;Wall St rally sends Dow to record close;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new all-time high on Wednesday for a second consecutive day, extending the rally on Wall Street.Consumer stocks were at the forefront of the gainers. Recruitment company Robert Half International climbed 3.2 per cent to $34.45, while Starbucks gained 5.7 per cent to $35.96. Casino company Wynn Resorts added 6.2 per cent to $71.29.Technology stocks also rallied. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia jumped 9.8 per cent to $31.08 on rumours that it would be bought out by Intel.Sandisk added 5.8 per cent to $56.38 after it announced a deal to distribute its flash-memory products through 2,000 retail outlets in India in the coming weeks, and expand its presence to 14,000 outlets by the end of 2007.Other tech stocks also pushed higher. Microsoft climbed 2.1 per cent to a seven-month high of $27.94, and Ebay added 6.1 per cent to $29.90.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.2 per cent, or 16.11 points, at a fresh five-and-a-half-year high of 1350.22. The Nasdaq Composite was up 2.1 per cent, or 47.30 points, at 2,290.95.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent, or 123.27 points, to a new record close of 11,850.61, just shy of its new intra-day record of 11,851.25.Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak, said the Dow was not likely to surge from this point. “I don’t think the market is going to go off on a long sustained move here,” he said. “But it should be enough to press some of the bears [back] into the market.”Crude oil prices fell earlier in the day, but recovered after attacks near oil installations in the Niger delta. ExxonMobil rose 1.8 per cent to $66.61, and Valero added 4 per cent to $50.10.The mining sector had some rare losers, depressed by falling copper prices. Phelps Dodge sank 1.8 per cent to $78.65 and Freeport McMoran dipped 0.9 per cent to $49.04.Ford Motor ticked up 4 per cent to $8.56. General Motors and Nissan-Renault on Wednesday ended talks about forming a possible alliance, increasing the likelihood that Nissan and Renault would now seek to form a partnership with Ford.Medical device maker Medtronic added 3.8 per cent to $48.92 – its best day in four months – after regulators in Australia approved the sale of its Endeavour heart stent, used to keep arteries open.ImClone gained 8 per cent to $29.33 after it said it had received a $36-a-share take-over offer from a big pharmaceutical group last month. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who is on the company’s board, rejected the offer.Genentech dipped 1.7 per cent to $82.40 after an analyst said third-quarter sales of the company’s cancer drugs may have fallen short of estimates.
177;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2006-08-02T20:56:31Z;Wall Street gains on robust earnings;;US markets closed higher on Wednesday as investors were cheered by robust earnings news.Procter & Gamble reported a 36 per cent jump in fiscal fourth quarter profit, just ahead of analyst expectations, pushing its shares up 4.2 per cent to a three-month high of $58.29.TimeWarner added 2.6 per cent to $16.67 after it beat Wall Street estimates by reporting $1bn in profit in the second quarter, up from a loss of $409m in the same period last year.Health insurer Cigna leapt 10.2 per cent to $102.10 after beating analysts’ estimates with its second quarter results and raising its full-year forecast.The news pulled other insurers higher. Coventry Health Care rose 2.2 per cent to $54.52 and Health Net, which reports earnings on Thursday, climbed 5.5 per cent to $44.80.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.6 per cent, or 7.63 points, at 1,278.55, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent, or 16.82 points, at 2,078.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent, or 74.20 points, to 11,199.93.All the leading indices came off midday highs as the afternoon wore on. Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck said the afternoon pull-back was caused by nervousness over the broader economic outlook.“It doesn’t surprise me that we have rallies and flurries,” he said.“As much as there is good news in the earnings picture looking backwards, we do have this issue of what kind of cooling there is in the economy.”Software maker Adobe Systems gained 13.9 per cent to $32.28 after it said that it would meet its earnings target when it releases third quarter results in September.Shares in Electronic Arts rose 7.7 per cent to $50.12 after beating analysts’ expectations with higher revenue driven by strong sales of its most popular video game titles.Moodys Corporation, owner of the Moody’s credit rating agency, surged 11.1 per cent to $60.11 after it reported an 18 per cent increase in second quarter profit.Casino stocks climbed after Wynn Resorts said its losses had halved to $20m in the second quarter. Wynn surged 8.5 per cent to $66.94 while Las Vegas Sands climbed 6.3 per cent to $65.28. MGM Grand added 7.7 per cent to $38.00.Ford Motor added 5.8 per cent to $6.96 on news reports that it had embarked on a strategic review of its operations, with an eye towards the possible sale of poorly performing units.Mastercard, which made its stock market debut in May, swung to a loss in the second quarter, shedding $311m as it was hit by charges related to its initial public offering. The results were still ahead of forecasts and its shares gained 11.2 per cent to $50.02.
178;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2006-04-25T00:37:28Z;Macao gaming draws new entrants;;A US investment fund and former Las Vegas gambling executive are teaming up to invest in a HK$15bn (US$1.9bn) resort and gaming complex in Macao in a bid to challenge the international casino operators in one of the world’s biggest gaming markets.Silver Point Capital, a Connecticut-based fund with US$5bn under management, and David Friedman, a former lieutenant of Las Vegas gaming magnate Sheldon Adelson, will invest up to HK$2.97bn for a 40 per cent stake in a project controlled by Hong Kong-listed eSun Holdings, the media and entertainment arm of property group Lai Sun Development.The partners plan to invest about HK$15bn in a casino resort on Macao’s Cotai Strip, which will have up to 500 gaming tables, 4,000 hotel rooms, a film studio and other exhibition facilities. The project is expected to open in 2009.Of the HK$15bn, HK$6bn will be paid to the Macao government for the 35-acre site.The partners, which have working capital of about US$800m, will raise the remainder of the fund through a number of ways, such as high-yield bonds.Macao’s gaming market, which had been monopolised by tycoon Stanley Ho, was liberalised in 2001.Gaming concessions have since been awarded to five additional companies including Mr Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands, Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts, MGM and Publishing & Broadcasting of Australia, all of which are building large casino and resort developments in the former Portuguese enclave.In order to operate a casino at its Studio City development, eSun and its partners said yesterday they were in negotiations with Macao’s established concession holders over a licensing arrangement.Such agreements are not uncommon in Macao. In most arrangements, companies pay about 20 per cent of their gaming revenue to the licence-holders in order to operate casinos in the enclave. Mr Friedman said yesterday the companies would seek a different agreement, but declined to give further details.As a top aide to Mr Adelson, Mr Friedman, who quit Las Vegas Sands in 2004, played a major role in the launch of Macao’s first foreign-operated casino, the Sands Macau.Earlier this month James Packer suggested the possibility of an alliance between PBL’s gaming joint venture and Melco, controlled by Mr Ho’s family, and Wynn Resorts.
179;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2006-03-16T01:12:57Z;Hilton bets on operating resort hotels in Macao;;Hilton Hotels has become the latest international hotel chain to bet on a fundamental transformation of Macao’s gaming market from a playground for day-tripping punters into a fully-fledged resort destination.Hilton signed a “non-binding letter of intent” with Las Vegas Sands, controlled by gaming and convention magnate Sheldon Adelson, to operate a 1,200-room Hilton Hotel and a 600-room Conrad hotel and suite development at The Venetian Macao.The Venetian, a giant development under construction on Macao’s Cotai Strip, has signed similar deals with the Four Seasons group, Starwood’s Sheraton and St Regis chains, and tycoon Robert Kuok’s Shangri-La and Traders brand hotels.Macao’s casino industry has been growing at breakneck speed, with gaming revenues last year approaching those of Las Vegas, at about US$5.5bn.But unlike its US peer, the former Portuguese enclave has yet to develop the accommodation and other attractions to draw longer staying visitors.Including the latest Hilton agreement, The Venetian will boast 4,900 hotel rooms, compared with Macao’s stock of just 10,537 rooms as of the end of last year.By contrast, there are more than 134,000 rooms in Las Vegas.Prentice Salter, managing director of Macao-based consultancy Super Resorts, noted that “a majority of [Macao’s existing hotels] don’t come even close to the three-star level” and argued that Sands and other international gaming operators would change the face of Macao’s gaming industry.The Venetian is Sands’ second significant development in the former Portuguese enclave, where it operates the Macao Sands casino. Steve Wynn’s Wynn Resorts and James Packer’s Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd are also building casinos in Macao.According to Kenneth Tsang, head of South China research at Jones Lang LaSalle, visitors to Macao increased 12.2 per cent to 18.7m in 2005. The average stay was just 1.1 days as mainland tourists and Hong Kong gamblers popped in to try their luck at the tables.“Comdex was Adelson’s baby,” Mr Salter said, referring to iconic computer industry tradeshow that Mr Adelson launched in 1979 and sold to Japan’s Softbank Corp in 1995. “That’s his forte and one of the reasons he was invited to the party in Macao. These hotels are definitely needed.”However, Koos Klein, the Singapore-based head of Hilton’s Asia Pacific and Middle East operations, admitted the bet was no certainty. “The short answer is we don’t know [if Macao will change],” he said.
180;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2006-03-06T11:49:54Z;John Fairfax and PBL announce cross-border deals;;Two of Australia’s biggest media companies on Monday each announced a significant cross-border deal, motivated by sluggish performance from traditional TV and newspaper assets.John Fairfax Holdings, publisher of several daily newspapers including the Sydney Morning Herald, is to acquire Trade Me, New Zealand’s largest auction website, for a minimum A$625m (US$465m) stem a loss of advertising revenue to the internet.Meanwhile, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL), owner of Channel Nine, Australia’s biggest free-to-air TV station, unveiled plans to expand its gaming interests in Macao.It has acquired a 16-year licence from Wynn Resorts to operate hotel casino resorts in the Chinese administrative region, although the A$1.2bn cost will be shared by Melco International Development, its joint-venture partner.While the cross-border deals are unconnected, analysts say they highlight the common realisation among Australia’s media companies that new media has all but destroyed their traditional business model.Alex Pollak, a Sydney-based analyst at Macquarie Securities, says: “Technology is forcing structural, not cyclical, change. It is a prudent course of action for media companies to diversify their revenue-generating assets.”News Ltd, the Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire News Corp, has also decided to add fast-growing businesses to its core TV and newspaper operations. Last November it became the majority owner of realestate.com, a property website.Ironically, the rush of non-traditional acquisitions comes as the Australian government is poised to relax the country’s restrictive cross-media ownership laws, which ban a company from owning a TV and newspaper in the same city.John Howard, prime minister, told the Financial Times last month that the government hoped “to have something concrete to say about [media reform] in the next couple of months”.Legislative changes are also likely to sweep away rules that restrict foreign ownership of domestic media. However, industry players have recently started to dampen speculation that changes to media ownership laws would spark a wave of merger-and-acquisition activity.Ron Walker, Fairfax chairman, in January signalled that his company is more likely to focus on acquiring “new age information services” than a trophy asset such as Channel Nine.Analysts said that Fairfax had paid a full price for Trade Me, the equivalent of 15 times forecast 2007 earnings before interest and tax. Fairfax will fund the purchase through debt and equity.Set up in 1999 as an online trading site by 30-year-old Sam Morgan, it is the country’s most visited website and now encompasses car sales, property and jobs.David Kirk, Fairfax chief executive, said: “We are now a significantly more diversified media company.” Mr Kirk recently oversaw the acquisition of a holiday booking website and an online advertising company.However, the Trade Me announcement prompted Standard & Poor’s to cut the outlook for Fairfax’s BBB credit rating because it highlighted the “financial risks from expensive online acquisitions”.News of the Trade Me deal came as Fairfax announced a 4.6 per cent fall in first half net profit to A$119.9m.The Macao deal is not transformational for PBL, the company controlled by the Packer family, as it diversified into gaming several years ago with the purchase of flagship Australian casinos.But is does represent a deepening of the company’s commitment to gaming in Asia and marks the first major business deal completed by James Packer since the death of his father Kerry over Christmas. It will be funded by a combination of debt and equity and comes amid falling advertising revenue at Channel Nine.Analysts said that PBL’s licensing agreement with casino magnate Steve Wynn provided the company with greater certainty and the prospects of higher revenues from its Macao operations.PBL struck a joint venture agreement in November 2004 with Melco, which is run by Hong Kong magnate Stanley Ho. The pair are developing two greenfield casino resorts, Crown Macao and City of Dreams.The Macao subconcession means that PBL and Melco can effectively run their joint gaming operations without the involvement of Stanley Ho’s primary gaming company, SJM, which would have run the gaming operations and paid the joint venture a proportion of revenues.PBL climbed A$0.40 to $17.47 while Fairfax fell A$0.04 to $3.90.
181;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2005-06-01T15:47:48Z;MGM plans Macao growth;;MGM Mirage and its partner Pansy Ho, daughter of Hong Kong gambling tycoon Stanley Ho, on Wednesday signalled plans for a possible expansion of a US$1bn casino joint venture in Macao, despite suggestions that the former Portuguese colony may be in the throes of an unsustainable gaming bubble.“We are making preparations towards looking into our future expansion but there is nothing fixed,” Ms Ho said as MGM Grand Macao, 50:50 owned by MGM Mirage and Ms Ho, began construction of a casino with 300 gaming tables and a 600-room resort hotel.Ms Ho said the venture was close to securing a US$600m syndicated loan from a consortium of investment banks to help fund the US$975m project.MGM Grand Macao's project is the latest in a string of gambling investments in Macao, the only part of China where gaming is legal. Gaming revenues in the tiny enclave rose 44 per cent to US$5bn last year, mainly on the back of spending by tourists from the mainland.Las Vegas Sands, owner of the Venetian casino in Macao, announced plans in March for a US$12bn-US$15bn project that aims to turn Cotai, a reclaimed area in the territory, into Asia's Las Vegas within 10 years.Melco, a Hong Kong company controlled by Mr Ho, unveiled a HK$8bn project for the same area in May, to be built in partnership with Kerry Packer, Australia's richest man. Mr Ho said on Wednesday that Melco would announce another project in Cotai next month. Wynn Resorts is also investing more than US$1bn in Macao.However, some analysts have started to question whether the growth in gaming revenue is sustainable after Las Vegas Sands reported worse than expected first-quarter results recently. Tourism growth in Macao also slowed from 40 per cent last year to 19 per cent in the first three months of 2005.Andes Cheng, analyst at Hong Kong's South China Finance and Management, said he expected the number of casinos to rise from 15 in 2004 to 28 in 2009. Gaming tables are expected to surge from 1,092 last year to more than 4,500 by then.“The growth in tourist arrival is set to drop but the number of gaming tables is still growing very rapidly. That's why oversupply is a big concern among investors now,” Mr Cheng said.
182;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2005-04-19T05:15:41Z;HK tycoon sells Macao casino for $2.4bn;;Hong Kong property tycoon Lui Che-woo has agreed to sell his casino in Macao to a construction firm controlled by his family for HK$18.4bn which will give the gaming business a listing in the territory.K Wah Construction materials, which has proposed to change its name to Galaxy Entertainment Group, will become the first Hong Kong-listed casino operator amid a growing frenzy for gambling businesses in the region. Singapore said this week it would build two casino resorts by 2009.Macao’s gaming revenue, which jumped 44.3 per cent last year to US$5bn, is expected to overtake that of Las Vegas this year or next year following the opening of more foreign-owned casinos in the enclave. Las Vegas’s revenues rose 12.1 per cent to US$5.33bn in 2004.Macao, the only Chinese city where casino gambling is legal, ended local billionaire Stanley Ho’s 40-year casino monopoly in 2001 and awarded three licences to Mr Ho, Mr Lui’s Galaxy and Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts.Galaxy granted a sub-concession in December 2002 to the Las Vegas Sands, controlled by Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson, which unveiled a US$12bn-US$15bn project in the former Portuguese colony last month.
183;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
184;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2005-04-18T11:17:38Z;Singapore bets on casinos to lift economy;;Singapore said on Monday it would build two casino resorts, worth a combined S$5bn (US$3bn), in a controversial move to increase tourism and create jobs.The two casinos, which will be located on the recreation island of Sentosa and a new central property development Marina Bay, will be completed by 2009 and are expected to add S$1.5bn a year to the economy, the government said.The casinos would form the centrepiece of what are expected to be Singapore’s biggest entertainment, hotel and retail complexes and spearhead efforts to double the number of visitors to 17m in 10 years, reversing Singapore’s declining share of Asia’s tourism market.The casino would help create new jobs for unskilled workers as assembly-line manufacturing moves from Singapore to China, said Dominique Dwor-Frecaut, regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore. The “integrated resorts” are also expected to boost the ailing construction sector.The prospect of large profits has already attracted 19 of the world’s leading gaming operators to submit initial proposals to build the new resorts. The government said it would award licences for resort development by the end of this year.MGM-Mirage, Las Vegas Sands, Harrah’s Entertainment and Wynn Resorts are seen as the favourites to gain the casino licences since all four are seeking partnerships with state-owned CapitaLand and Keppel Land or other local property developers.But some analysts are sceptical that the casinos will deliver promised economic gains because of doubts they will attract many foreign gamblers.The risk is that Singapore could remain a secondary gambling destination in Asia behind Macao, which has become the centre of Asia’s gaming industry since opening to foreign operators in 2002.“Singapore’s proposed casino would by itself struggle to attract a critical mass of foreign clientele, thus undermining the economic logic of this project,” said a recent report by Morgan Stanley in Singapore.Another worry is a government proposal to charge Singaporeans a S$100 a day entry fee to the casinos to curb the growth of gambling among the local population.But this threatens to reduce significantly casino revenues since Asia’s gaming industry is “highly fragmented and casinos have to rely to a large extent on local clientele”, said Morgan Stanley.In contrast, Merrill Lynch predicted that Singapore’s casinos will attract gamblers from neighbouring countries and capture 60 per cent of the US$735m that Singaporeans spend on gambling abroad.
185;WYNN;Wynn Resorts Ltd;2004-11-10T16:14:41Z;MGM Mirage plans $4bn Las Vegas ‘metropolis’;;MGM Mirage, owner of the Bellagio and MGM Grand casinos, on Wednesday unveiled a $4bn plan to build a 66-acre “urban metropolis” that will introduce a residential area to the Las Vegas strip.The new site, called Project CityCenter, will match the combined size of Times Square, SoHo and Rockefeller Center in New York.The new complex will consist of a 4,000-room hotel and casino as well as three boutique hotels, 1,650 condominiums and a sprawling shopping, dining and entertainment space.Wynn Resorts also announced a $900m expansion to its new Wynn Las Vegas casino.The news reflects booming real estate prices and the success of Las Vegas in becoming the top tourist destination in the US. The city has announced plans to revitalise its downtown while the University of Nevada Las Vegas plans to develop surrounding neighbourhoods into a new “midtown”.The latest development follows a spate of acquisitions in the gaming industry. MGM Mirage this June agreed to buy Mandalay Bay Resorts in a deal worth nearly $8bn.The deal, expected to close early next year, will make MGM Mirage the world’s second-largest gaming company behind Harrah’s Entertainment, which agreed to buy Caesars for $9.5bn in July.Jim Murren, MGM Mirage chief financial officer, said, “As real estate prices continue to soar on the Strip, we intend to maximise the economic value of this land by making this development the newest icon for Las Vegas.”The company, which is also planning significant investment in the UK following the anticipated overhaul of gaming legislation, did not give details on how it would finance development. But Mr Murren added: “Through the proceeds generated from residential sales as well as the equity contributions of our partners, we expect to rapidly de-leverage while providing significant new high-margin income streams.”Wynn Resorts on Monday evening announced plans for a $900m expansion of its $2.7bn Wynn Las Vegas complex, which is scheduled to open next April. The new 20-acre development, tentatively called Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, is expected to open in 2007 and may include a 1,500 suite hotel, additional casino, spa, retail and convention space.The company expects the project to be funded by new debt or equity financing.Shares in MGM Mirage edged up 1 per cent to $60.31 in midday trade. Shares in Wynn Resorts rose 2 per cent to $62.20.
