0;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2017-07-05T21:02:05Z;O’Reilly leads sell-off in shares of US car part retailers;Indices recover from early dip but energy stocks still under pressure;Shares of car part retailers were hit hard on Wednesday after a warning from O’Reilly Automotive intensified fears about the automotive industry.O’Reilly’s same-store sales climbed 1.7 per cent in the second quarter, far short of expectations of 3 per cent to 5 per cent. The company’s stock tumbled 18.9 per cent to $178.77 in trading in New York.The warning from O’Reilly rattled shares of other car parts retailers, with AutoZone falling 9.6 per cent to $516.83 and Advance Auto Parts dropping 11.2 per cent to $105.21.A warmer winter is one of the headwinds that car part retailers have suffered this year, as more clement weather has meant less wear and tear on vehicles and fewer accidents. However, the sharp reaction also stems from growing concern that ecommerce may begin to encroach on the more traditional bricks and mortar shops, like O’Reilly, according to analysts.“The real investor fear here is that Amazon at some point does take share and multiples have already compressed in response to that,” said Carolina Jolly, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. But she added that the threat has yet to fully materialise.Ms Jolly said that if companies such as Amazon were capturing market share then so called do-it-yourself retailers would be harder hit than “do-it-for-me” retailers. Jobs requiring professional repair, the theory goes, are less easily displaced by online retailing, unlike repairs that consumers can do once they have bought the parts.Yet the pain has been felt across the board, indicating broadly weaker demand. Shares of Monro Muffler Brake, which provides undercar repair services, is down 26 per cent so far this year.“If this was an ecommerce issue then the do-it-yourself business should underperform the do-it-for-me business,” said Ms Jolly. “But this is both segments.”Elsewhere, US stocks recovered from an early dip on Wednesday. The S&P 500 index gained 0.2 per cent to 2,432.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 21,478.17 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 6,150.86.Energy stocks continued their downward trend, with US oil prices falling more than 3 per cent amid persistent concerns about the glut of supply on global markets.West Texas Intermediate dropped 3.2 per cent to $45.57 a barrel in what would be the first daily loss since June 21, according to Bloomberg data. Brent crude, the global marker, fell 2.8 per cent to $48.22 a barrel.“Fear of a supply glut have again hit the oil market. An expected rebalancing of supply and demand is taking longer than we thought,” said Richard Turnill, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist. “We now see oil trading in a range around current levels, as the market rebalances in the second half.”
1;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2017-04-03T20:54:49Z;US car part retailers dip on worries over Q1 earnings;Dip in oil prices drags down energy stocks, and financials also lose ground;Retailers of replacement car parts saw their stocks stall on Monday as pressure from online retailers as well as a warmer than expected winter prompted analysts to warn of weak first-quarter earnings.O’Reilly Automotive, AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts, which sell car parts to professional and “do-it-yourself” customers for repairs and upgrades to existing cars, saw their stock prices fall 4.1 per cent to $258.69, 3.1 per cent to $700.69 and 1.9 per cent to $145.50, respectively.Analysts said the shift lower was prompted by a downgrade from “buy” to “neutral” for AutoZone from Cleveland Research analyst Daryl Boehringer, centred on the company’s exposure to the do-it-yourself market, which is suffering weaker performance numbers than the professional repairs market known as “do-it-for-me”. Mr Boehringer said it was Cleveland Research’s policy not to discuss research with the press.But, like many retail industries, the trend is bigger than one company and other stocks fell in line with AutoZone. Carolina Jolly, an analyst with Gabelli, warned that the quarter is “shaping up to be weaker than expected”.That is in part because of the unexpectedly warm winter weather — good news for consumers who have not had to drive on icy roads with steamed up windows but less good for companies that rely on repairing broken parts.“With the warmer weather, batteries don’t freeze, tyres don’t skid, all that sort of stuff,” Ms Jolly said.Some of the other issues facing the industry are similar to other retail markets with the rise of e-commerce at best offering greater price transparency to consumers who head to a store in person but at worst draining sales away.“You have increasing competition both from e-commerce and between the major brick and mortar retailers,” said David Schick, lead retail analyst at Consumer Edge Research. “Amazon sells everything to everyone so it is clearly a competitor.”Ms Jolly noted that, while there had been little sign of online retailers pulling sales away, lower prices and the lessons learnt in other retail industries such as department stores was cause for concern.“It’s a worry that it might happen in the auto parts industry, even though there is no real indication of that yet,” she said.Elsewhere, the first day of trading of the second quarter of 2017 saw US stock markets fall, with the S&P 500 closing down 0.2 per cent to 2,358.8. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 20,650.2 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3 per cent to 5,894.6.A dip in oil prices in New York dragged down energy stocks. Financials were also knocked in a further sign that the so-called Trump trade is on pause after the failure of the president’s proposed healthcare reform and absence of advancement on tax legislation.The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, also fell to its lowest level in more than a month.Healthcare stocks were less badly affected than the broader market. The S&P 500 healthcare sector dipped just 0.1 per cent, with notable rises among the health insurers affected by Congress’s failure to pass changes to Obamacare.
2;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2015-11-12T23:05:59Z;Advance Auto Parts skids into red;Every US stocks sector in negative territory;Advance Auto Parts skidded into the red on Thursday after the company revealed weaker than expected quarterly results and its long-time chief executive stepped down.The Virginia-based company said third-quarter net profits dipped 1.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis to $120.5m. Excluding certain items, earnings came in at $1.95 a share, well below Wall Street estimates of $2.09. Sales edged higher by 0.3 per cent to $2.3bn, also shy of expectations of $2.33bn.Advance Auto, which sells after-market auto parts such as batteries and windshield wipers, said continuing demands from the integration of General Parts, a 2013 purchase, continued to weigh on results. It also took a hit from currency fluctuations. Meanwhile, chief executive Darren Jackson will step down after eight years at the company’s helm.Advance Auto also forged a pact with activist investor Starboard Value, which revealed a 3.7 per cent stake in the company in late September and has been pushing for “comprehensive operating improvements” and a “substantial” dividend or stock buyback programme.Starboard chief executive Jeffrey Smith will be given a seat on the board and made chair of its nominating and corporate governance committee. Investors sent the shares sinking 15.4 per cent to $164.67 by close of trading. Shares, however, are still up 3.4 per cent for the year.Elsewhere, department store chain Kohl’s revealed better than expected quarterly earnings amid an outperformance by its women’s clothing and footwear businesses.Sales rose 1.2 per cent from the prior year to $4.43bn, while net profits slid to $120m from $142m on the same basis. Adjusted profits of 75 cents a share topped the street view of 69 cents.The shares rallied 6.1 per cent to $45.80. The move came in stark contrast to the 14 per cent dive that Macy’s shares sustained on Wednesday on the back of disappointing quarterly results and a cut to its full-year sales outlook.Meanwhile, the materials and energy sectors faced heavy selling on the back of declines in the prices of several commodities.Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world’s biggest copper miners, dropped 5.8 per cent to $8.77 on the back of a 2.3 per cent fall in the price of copper.On the energy side, ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly traded energy company, fell 2.7 per cent to $79.40. US crude oil futures were down 64 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $42.30 a barrel.US stocks sustained broad-based selling by markets close. Every sector was in negative territory, while nearly 90 per cent of volume on the New York Stock Exchange was in declining shares.The move came as two Federal Reserve officials offered differing assessments on whether the central bank will be prepared to increase short-term interest rates from historic lows when it meets next month.While the labour market has shown continued signs of improvement recently, inflation has remained stubbornly below the Fed’s target.The broad S&P 500 slipped 1.4 per cent to 2,045.97, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.4 per cent to 17,448.07 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.2 per cent to 5,005.08.
3;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2015-11-10T21:02:22Z;Activists to intensify pressure on boards;Investors expected to push harder on return of capital via share buy backs and dividends before rate rise;Activist investors will intensify their pressure on the boards of companies by pushing for strategic disposals and higher capital returns to shareholders ahead of a rate rise, according to a report from Moody’s.Companies including eBay, General Motors and Macy’s are being pushed by investors to spin-off underperforming businesses, buy back shares and lift dividends in a chase for greater returns before the Federal Reserve raises interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.At least 178 publicly announced campaigns have been launched by activist funds since the start of the year, according to the rating agency, a rise of 8 per cent on the same period in 2014 which was a record year for activist drives.Analysts projected that as many as 235 campaigns would be launched against non-financial groups by the end of 2015, to eclipse the record of 222 during 2014.“In recent years activists have become increasingly emboldened to go after larger quarry,” said Chris Plath, an analyst with Moody’s. “Hedge fund activists have been awash with cash as investors continue to chase yield in a low interest rate environment. Even the more traditionally secure targets have become fodder for activist agendas.”Activist targets have underperformed the broader US market, however, with an index calculated by Standard & Poor’s of companies targeted in the past 24 months down nearly 10 per cent year-to-date.Of the 69 companies on the index, share prices of about three-fifths have declined. By contrast, hedge fund performance is roughly flat for the year, according to HFR, the industry data provider.The surge in activist activity was fuelled by “too much capital chasing too few targets”, said Mr Plath, and investors were likely to double down on their efforts to spur better returns as the main US equity benchmark sits less than 1 per cent above where it started of the year.Rising level of shareholder resolutions at annual meetings provokes a reaction from the business lobbyRead moreJim Rossman, a Lazard managing director who advises companies on how to respond to activist investor campaigns, said activists had become an enduring part of the market.“As long as companies underperform there will be activists targeting them,” said Mr Rossman. “More importantly, with fewer large asset manager owning larger portions of S&P 500 companies, they have greater power to influence the way a company is run and being active has become more acceptable even for them. That’s what they believe their 401K investors want.”According to Lazard, on average 44.7 per cent of the equity of an S&P 500 company is owned by its top 10 institutional shareholders and index funds, such as BlackRock and Vanguard.Companies targeted by activists this year include some of the largest names in corporate America, including DuPont, which was locked in a dispute with Nelson Peltz’s Trian Group earlier this year.Food group ConAgra has found Jana Partners at its door, Carl Icahn targeted Freeport-McMoRan, American International Group and eBay, while Starboard Value has launched campaigns against Macy’s, Advance Auto Parts, Staples and Media General.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
4;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2014-07-08T18:29:19Z;The right capital structure for bricks and mortar retail?;;"Lex recently wrote about the hurly-burly around PetSmart, the pet supply chain. An activist or two is keen for the company to sell, and have also made noises about things like returning capital to shareholders. Looking at the numbers, private equity ownership or a big one-time payout don’t look like silly ideas. This is a very stable business that generates a good amount of cash, and it currently has no debt on it.The last point got me thinking, and I ran a company screen on S&P Capital IQ of big retail companies that carry no debt, and a long list came back: H&M; Costco; TJX; The Gap; Ross Stores; Whole Foods; Advance Auto Parts; Bed Bath and Beyond; Best Buy; Williams-Sonoma; Foot Locker; Game Stop; Urban Outfitters. Many more as well.Unscientifically, it struck me that there was an unusual number of companies in this industry with no debt in the capital structure – despite the presence on that list of a number of quite steady, cashy enterprises. I’m wondering if experienced retail leaders are, as a group, nervous about debt, and whether this is rational or not.Any thoughts?"
5;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2011-05-24T21:32:45Z;US financials lose ground;;Shares in AutoZone jumped after the company reported better than expected quarterly earnings, but the wider markets were broadly flat as investors remained wary following the sharp sell-off in the previous session.Shares in the motor parts retailer were up 6 per cent to $293.30 after reporting a 12 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings as sales and margins improved.Analysts had worried that high petrol prices might hurt sales as consumers are driving less and therefore need to replace parts less frequently.Earlier in the month, Advance Auto Parts, a smaller rival to AutoZone, disappointed investors with its quarterly results. Auto Parts is down 5 per cent this month at $62.54.The S&P 500 index closed broadly flat, edging less than 0.1 per cent lower to 1,316.28.Most sectors were slightly lower – following the 1.2 per cent sell-off in the previous session – as sentiment continued to be downbeat over the eurozone debt crisis and global growth concerns.Financial stocks continued to lose ground. Shares in Capital Onewere down 2 per cent to $53.03 while the Bank of New York Mellonfell 1.2 per cent to $27.49. The S&P financial index lost 0.5 per cent.Healthcare stocks were also lower. United Health Group lost 2.4 per cent to $47.96 while Humana fell 1.6 per cent to $78.The S&P healthcare sector was down 0.3 per cent, although it is still up 7.3 per cent since the start of the second quarter as investors have recently been moving from cyclical stocks into more defensive areas.Sentiment across the markets was helped slightly by better than expected housing data. The number of new home sales rose 7.3 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000, ahead of the 300,000 expected.But this was still weak and so did not cheer investors too much.“The outcome was better than generally expected, although still miserable in absolute terms,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The losses in the wider markets were limited primarily by the rebound in energy and material stocks.In the energy sector, a bounce in the oil price helped Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, climb 1.5 per cent to $83.28 while Halliburton rose 2.9 per cent to $47.50.The S&P energy index was up 1.3 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 3 per cent to $48.82 while Consol Energy, the coal miner, added 1.3 per cent to $48.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,356.36 in cautious trading. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,746.16.These larger indices have lost ground for the past three weeks as weak economic data have sparked concerns that interest rate rises globally are beginning to slow economic growth.“This has aggravated suspicions that the US economy may have entered a soft patch, not unlike in the spring of last year,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.Last year the S&P fell 11.7 per cent from the start of April to the end of August on concerns over a double-dip recession.In corporate news, shares in Yandex, the Russian search engine, rocketed on its first day of trading.The Russian group was up as much at 144 per cent in early trading, although it settled at a more modest 55.4 per cent gain from its initial public offering price at $35.20. Yandex was priced on Monday night at $25 a share, valuing the company at $8bn.The jump in price was small compared with LinkedIn last Thursday, when shares in the business-focused social networking site jumped 109.4 per cent to $94.25 on their first day of trading.LinkedIn was up 8.1 per cent to $95.45 on Tuesday, in spite of restrictions having been lifted on short selling the stock, which pared all of the losses seen since the first day of trading on Thursday.Elsewhere, shares in El Paso Corp were up 6.5 per cent to $20.22, the best performing stock on the S&P 500, after the natural gas group announced it intended to separate its exploration and production unit from its pipeline and midstream businesses.Medtronicwas down 0.9 per cent to $40.88 after the medical devices company reported fourth-quarter earnings down 19 per cent on restructuring and other charges. Revenues were up slightly and better than expected, however.
6;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2011-05-19T21:06:02Z;Economic data offset LinkedIn debt surge;;Shares in LinkedIn more than doubled on their first day of trading following the company’s initial public offering, while the wider markets edged a little higher after a mixed set of data on US employment and manufacturing.The business-focused networking website was up 109.4 per cent to $94.25 after pricing on Wednesday night at $45 a share, which was already at the top-end of its projected range.The stock reached an intraday high of $122.69, up 173 per cent.“This is what I would call a speculative frenzy, and it is not going to end well,” said James Dailey, the chief investment officer at Team Financial Managers.LinkedIn has received a huge amount of attention as the first US social networking and web 2.0 company to go public, ahead of its Facebook, retail services company Groupon and social games service Zynga.Many commentators have been asking whether the lofty valuations put on some of these point to the emergence of a technology bubble, akin to the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s.“This is a very rich valuation, which is reminiscent, to say the least, of the year 2000 exuberance,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors, a wealth management firm.But Mr Dailey said it was too early to talk about a bubble in the technology sector. “There has been a bubble in the use of the word bubble,” he said.The strong first day from LinkedIn had little impact on the wider technology sector, however, which was led lower in the session by chipmakers after Goldman Sachs cut its view on the sector from “neutral” to “cautious”.The investment bank’s rating on Intel was reduced from “neutral” to “sell” sending shares in the chipmaker down 1.4 per cent to $23.54.Applied Materials, which was also downgraded, lost 1.2 per cent to $14.33 while Nvidia fell 1.4 per cent to $17.78.That left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 0.9 per cent and S&P technology index up 0.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 added 0.2 per cent to 1,343.50 after better-than-expected employment data outweighed a disappointing number from the Philadelphia Fed on manufacturing.Employment numbers showed that the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits had fallen by 29,000 last week to 409,000, lower than the 420,000 economists had been expecting. But the figure was still above the 400,000 mark, which is the point at which economists conclude the economy is adding jobs.But the Philadelphia Fed’s reading on mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity tumbled to 3.9, indicating very little expansion. This was a sharp fall from the 18.5 reading in April and lower than the 20 points that economists had been expecting.“There is still some worry that labour market gains may be faltering a bit,” said Joshua Shapiro chief US economist at MFR.Separately, data showed that sales in previously occupied homes had fallen slightly in April, in another sign that the US housing market remained depressed.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent at 12,603.81 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.3 per cent higher at 2,823.24.The retail sector was again in focus after another raft of mixed earnings reports and the S&P retail index was down 0.1 per cent.Shares in Advance Auto Parts fell 10.2 per cent to $63.48 after the spare-part retailer’s earnings missed analysts forecasts.The company said earnings in the first quarter were $1.35 a share on $109.6m, short of the $1.38 a share expected.Sears Holdings was down 2.6 per cent to $73.86 after the retailer reported a disappointing loss in the first quarter.The owner of Sears and Kmart posted a net loss of $170m, or $1.58 a share, compared with a net profit of $16m, or 14 cents a share, in the same period in 2010Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, lost 3.9 per cent to $40.80 after reporting slightly better than expected earnings, but giving a current-quarter forecast that fell short of expectations.Dollar Tree, the discount retailer, saw a 59 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, exceeding expectations and sending shares in the company up 2.9 per cent to $63.11.Big Lots, another discount retailer, was down 10.6 per cent to $33.74 following reports that it had decided not to put itself up for sale.
7;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2011-03-01T22:42:07Z;US stocks fall after Bernanke remarks;;Fifth Third Bancorp led financial stocks lower as the bank was subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, while the wider markets lost ground after comments from Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman.The Midwestern bank tumbled 4.5 per cent to $13.95, a 2½-month low, after announcing that it was under SEC investigation for how it accounted for, and reported, some of its commercial loans.The stock led the losses in the wider financial sector, which was down 2.2 per cent.Elsewhere, SunTrust Banks lost 2.5 per cent to $29.41 while BB&T fell 2.1 per cent to $27.02.That helped the S&P 500 fall 1.6 per cent to 1,306.33, erasing most of the 1.7 per cent gains added in the previous two sessions.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 per cent to 12,058.02 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,737.41.The S&P index began the session higher but fell after Mr Bernanke’s testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. The Fed chairman said sustained higher oil prices “would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored”.He also gave no indication of any further measures to stimulate the economy, which some traders had been hoping for.Any positive sentiment was further dashed as oil prices spiked higher on concerns that the unrest sweeping across north Africa and the Middle East might spread to Saudi Arabia.In the first three trading sessions of last week, the S&P fell 2.8 per cent on similar concerns. These worries damped risk appetite in the US and around the world, causing material stocks to dive lower.Titanium Metals was down 6.2 per cent to $17.82 while AK Steel was 4.7 per cent lower at $15.23. The S&P materials sector was down 2.3 per cent.Consumer services stocks were also depressed by the higher oil price and comments by Mr Bernanke.Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, was down 6.1 per cent to $40.08 while Priceline.com, the online travel company, lost 1.9 per cent to $445.29.But promising economic data helped limit the losses on Wall Street.Figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US manufacturing sector had seen strong growth in February.The index rose from 60.8 in January to 61, which is the highest reading since 2004. A number over 50 on the index indicates that the sector is growing.In earnings news, AutoZone, a retailer of car parts, reported earnings up 20 per cent and same-store sales up by 7.1 per cent. The stock added 2.2 per cent to $263.52.But that failed to lift related stocks. O’Reilly Automotive was down 0.8 per cent to $55.15 while Advance Auto Parts was 0.1 per cent lower at $62.63.There were some signs that the tide might be turning for car part retailers, which have profited since the financial crisis on people’s reluctance to buy new cars.General Motors reported that its sales had jumped 46 per cent in February from the same period a year ago due, primarily to a rise in demand from retail customers.The Buick and Cadillac car brands reported sales up by 73 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively.GM shares were down 1.7 per cent to $32.95, however, as the sales figures failed to impress investors.Separately, Ford reported that its sales had risen 14 per cent. Its stock was 2.6 per cent lower at $14.66.Elsewhere, Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company, fell 6.3 per cent to $43.70 after reporting that it was being investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice over its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Lorillard, which primarily makes menthol cigarettes, was up 1.6 per cent to $78.98 after the US Food and Drugs Agency said evidence was “insufficient” that smoking menthol cigarettes is riskier than normal cigarettes.Tower Group, the insurance provider, was down 12.6 per cent to $23.76 after its 2011 earnings view fell short of analyst estimates.Sonus Networks was up 33.3 per cent to $4.16 after the internet telecoms company reported fourth-quarter profit up 11 per cent and issued a revenue guidance that surpassed expectations.
8;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2010-11-11T19:03:08Z;Technology stocks lead Wall Street losses;;A cautious outlook from Cisco sent the technology company’s shares tumbling and dragged down US stocks.Cisco dropped 16.2 per cent to $20.52, pulling down the S&P 500 information technology index by 1.8 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,213.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to close at 11,283.10 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,555.52.The world’s largest maker of computer networking equipment forecast sales and profits lower than analysts had estimated.John Chambers, chief executive, said the company faced a “challenging economic environment” and that it had missed revenue expectations in the quarter because of an unexpected drop-off in spending by the public sector, especially in Europe.It predicted that revenue would grow by 3-5 per cent in the second quarter, much less than the consensus forecast for a 13 per cent increase.Analysts at JPMorgan, who lowered their price target for the stock to $24.50 but kept its “overweight”’ rating, said: “Government spending was a risk but we believe that Cisco guidance indicates that this large part of the global economy, particularly US state and European governments, may be deteriorating rapidly.“Guidance for full-year revenue growth of 9-12 per cent seems ambitious to us considering the speed and severity of this reduction – our new forecast is for 6.4 per cent revenue growth for the full fiscal year.”They added that as Cisco said it was gaining share in seven of its nine largest markets, this was probably an early sign of a wider problem and not Cisco-specific.Brad Thompson, fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors, which owns Cisco shares, said: “We’re taking a pretty close look at it.”“Technology is currently the most consensus trade among institutional investors,” he added. “Everybody is pretty much placing a bet in that space but Cisco is a bellwether with its tentacles in business and government.”Shares in Cisco’s rivals also suffered with Cavium Networks 4.4 per cent lower at $34.53.Mr Thompson said the drop in government spending would affect other parts of the technology supply chain, as well as the money flowing from government to healthcare and defence companies.Among the suppliers, Jabil Circuit gave up 4.6 per cent to $14.40, Altera fell 2.8 per cent to $32.90 and Xilnix was down 3.3 per cent to $26.50.Other technology stocks also slumped with Dell falling 3.9 per cent to $13.93 and Hewlett-Packard losing 2.4 per cent to $43.10.Elsewhere in earnings news, Disney reported late in the trading session. Shares slumped 2.9 per cent to $35.93 after it missed profit estimates in its fourth quarter.Income from pay-TV services for ESPN which last year was recorded in the fourth quarter, came in an earlier quarter this year. This outweighed strong advertising sales and receipts for films including Toy Story 3.Viacom gained 3.1 per cent to $44.59 after it beat analysts’ estimates with its fourth-quarter profit. The owner of MTV Networks and Comedy Central joined other cable operators in reporting results buoyed by higher advertising sales.The popularity of its hit show Jersey Shore helped viewing figures and advertising revenue rose 8 per cent. The company also said it planned to sell Harmonix, the Rock Band music video game developer.In retail, Kohl’s department store chain forecast profits and sales in its fourth quarter that were above some analysts’ expectations. The retailer reported quarterly profit in line with expectations and said it had gained market share. Its shares edged up 0.3 per cent to $52.41.Rival Macy’s reported strong earnings on Wednesday, which buoyed other department store stocks.In financials, Bank of America dropped 1.6 per cent to $12.37 after it said it would sell its right to buy extra shares in a $9.3bn rights issue by the China Construction Bank to the Singapore state investment agency.
9;AAP;Advance Auto Parts Inc;2010-05-20T20:47:28Z;S&P 500 falls most since April 2009;;"A jump in jobless claims and continuing European debt jitters drove US markets sharply lower, sending the S&P 500 to its sharpest drop in 13 months, and more than 10 per cent below last month’s high.At close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 3.9 per cent to 1,071.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.6 per cent to 10,068.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index lost 4.1 per cent to 2,204.01.With yesterday’s declines, US indices joined other global markets in posting losses for the year – but the US benchmarks are still outperforming many of them.Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said this month’s intraday lows were significant indicators to watch, such as 1,065.79 for the S&P 500.If the main indices were to fall past these levels “[it] would be a problematic development” he said.As stocks fell, the Vix, a widely watched measure of volatility, surged 26 per cent to 44.38, the highest level for more than a year.The US labour department said initial claims for unemployment benefits on a weekly basis rose 25,000 to 471,000, seasonally adjusted, for the week ending May 15, highest since early April.“The theme of breaking no new ground on the lay-off front continues,” said Jonathan Basile, vice-president for economics at Credit Suisse.Materials and industrials led the market declines.Alcoa, the global metals group, fell 6 per cent to $11.07. Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, lost 4.5 per cent to $58.67.General Electric’s shares lost 5.8 per cent to $16.26.
