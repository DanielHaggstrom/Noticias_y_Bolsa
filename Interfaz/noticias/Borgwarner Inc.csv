On Tuesday it acquired fellow car engine components manufacturer Delphi Technologies for a whopping 77 per cent premium. The price tag allots Delphi, once part of the venerable General Motors, an enterprise value of $3.3bn.BorgWarner justified its largesse by pointing to cost savings and potential to grow its share of the components market for electric vehicles, the industry’s lone growth sector. Unimpressed, shareholders pushed its shares down almost a tenth.That is short-sighted. BorgWarner wants to play consolidator, a role that brings with it inherent risks. This however is a mild one. The implied price paid for Delphi’s equity is well below the company’s 52-week high struck in April.Delphi Technologies was spun off from Delphi in 2017. It has floundered as a standalone, with shares losing a third of their value last year. It needed the validation bestowed by Delphi with its respected place in industrial lore. Less prestigiously, the company became a ward of Uncle Sam as part of the financial crisis auto bailout, before falling into the hands of hedge funds.Delphi Technologies looks like the runt of the litter from that rescue. The shares have slumped since it listed, following a series of earnings disappointments. Investors’ relief at BorgWarner’s intervention was reflected in a 60 per cent rally in the equity and a jump in the price of Delphi bonds from 85 cents to 110 cents on the dollar.But, the spin-off is a good fit with BorgWarner, Its power electronic modules are complementary and marginally improve its offerings for electric vehicles.By paying entirely in shares, BorgWarner is giving up 16 per cent of its company to Delphi shareholders. The implied purchase price is just over 6 times ebitda. That makes it a cheap by the standards of the sector. Even after the deal, BorgWarner’s leverage is below a modest 2 times ebitda. This looks like a classic bolt-on, an operation that should come naturally to an auto parts maker.Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.

Selling of consumer stocks alongside a renewed concern about the giddy drop in the oil price drove the index down 1.9 per cent lower to 1902.34 in late afternoon trading on Wednesday.Consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, falling 2.7 per cent. Auto-parts maker Borgwarner was the worst performer, falling 11 per cent after issuing disappointing full-year earnings guidance.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent to 16,244.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.8 per cent to 4,556.41.
2;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2015-08-04T17:52:24Z;Continental: smooth ride;Tyres deliver reliable cash for high-tech gadgets;"Reliability is desirable in tyres. It also seems to be what investors want from tyremakers. Continental’s results tend to come in just ahead of expectations, and Tuesday’s first-half numbers were no exception. They were a contrast to more disappointing fare from rivals such as Michelin and BorgWarner, a US car parts maker. The German tyre and parts maker’s reliability was rewarded by a 5 per cent share price rise.That was partly because of good news in its tyre business. The broader tyre market has been a dark place. Although raw material prices (oil and rubber) have fallen, that has helped low-cost Asian competitors more, because raw materials account for half of Asian producers’ costs but nearer a third for European makers, says UBS. Not that such problems troubled Continental. Its tyre sales rose 3 per cent (mostly in Europe) but it held prices, and €150m of raw material savings helped margins before tax and interest to rise 130 basis points to 18.6 per cent. Bravo.Continental’s tyre division is the defensive, cash-generative part of the business; 70 per cent of sales are replacements. Car parts matter more, accounting for three-quarters of revenues. Here Continental focuses on non-commoditised parts that help carmakers meet three big industry demands: increased fuel efficiency (to meet emissions targets), better-connected cars and higher safety requirements. And, unlike tyres, components are complex. Carmakers prefer to deal with suppliers they know and trust as the financial and reputational risk of failure is high.Still, for all its attractive features, the car parts business is cyclical. Continental’s management believes the two parts of the group complement each other well. And despite the whiff of conglomeracy, the market seems to agree. Continental’s shares, at 15 times forward earnings, trade at the top end of the range for both tyre and parts makers. Thank the reliability for that.

Transmissions are gear systems that convert power from the engine to the wheels and lie at the heart of attempts to increase efficiency in the vehicle.The deal comes just days after Michigan-based BorgWarner, a maker of turbochargers, acquired US peer Remy International, a specialist in alternators and start-stop technology, for $950m. It follows ZF’s purchase of US automotive supplier TRW Automotive in September for $11.7bn.Car parts makers expect increasing complexity inside future vehicles— which are having to become more environmentally friendly, and increasingly connected and autonomous — to create more demand for their specialised technologies.“You’ll continue to see a higher percentage of the vehicle being outsourced, particularly as you bring in technologies that the suppliers have a lot of expertise in,” said Don Walker, chief executive of Magna.Chris Guile, analyst at IHS Automotive, said automatic gearboxes, in particular, are becoming more complicated, making it more and more expensive for manufacturers to develop new products.“By buying in these transmissions, they are effectively sharing these development costs, and can opt for more expensive cutting-edge products, or more simple and cheaper products — or a combination of both,” he said.Car parts makers have been steadily consolidating over a decade or more as they seek to bulk up to meet large orders from carmakers that share more parts between vehicles.That process has allowed the biggest suppliers, such as Germany’s Bosch and Continental and Japan’s Denso, to bring down costs and many of them are now more profitable than the manufacturers they count as customers.Getrag has three joint ventures with carmakers in the US and China, including Ford, Jiangling and Dongfeng. It also supplies transmissions to the likes of BMW, Daimler, Renault, Volkswagen and Ferrari.The Magna deal implies an enterprise value for Getrag of about €2.45bn, including €700m in debt and pension liabilities. It forms part of Magna’s plan to focus on areas in which it has the most scale. It sold most of its automotive interiors unit in April to Spain’s Grupo Antolin for $525m.Magna’s shares closed down almost 4 per cent to $53.70 in New York.

Its recent successes include a £59m investment from Canadian automotive manufacturer Multimatic that includes 232 jobs and a £26m investment by US engine manufacturer BorgWarner to create a research and development centre in the UK.Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors, said last week that it had increased its average UK content per car to 50 per cent, thanks to its efforts to convince overseas suppliers to build production sites in the UK near its car factories.The AIO, which operates under the UK’s department for business and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, has a long-term target of £3bn worth of new business in the car industry that could be won by British suppliers and overseas companies setting up facilities in the UK.
5;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2012-07-05T14:14:33Z;GKN: aerospace cadet;Acquisition helps UK engineering group reposition itself;"The industrial revolution continues at GKN. The UK engineering group (founded in 1759) is moving up the value chain in aerospace, confirming on Wednesday its acquisition of Volvo Aero from the Swedish industrial group. The deal extends GKN’s manufacturing capacity in the high-value, high-growth market for aeroplane engines. It adds balance by raising the share of aerospace in group revenue from about a quarter to about a third, reduces the cyclical business mix and strengthens the investment case for GKN.The group looks unfocused but it works on paper. Its four divisions are automotive (with 42 per cent of sales after the Volvo Aero deal); aerospace (31 per cent); components for farming and mining vehicles (13 per cent); and lightweight motor parts (12 per cent). That gives GKN a strong manufacturing presence in everything from aero engine parts to clutches and driveshafts for cars and agricultural equipment. The group has a history of adding niche acquisitions: last year it bought Getrag in the US (automotive) and Germany’s Stromag (components).The Volvo Aero deal is more significant. GKN’s shares jumped 13 per cent on Thursday after it was confirmed on terms that look less onerous than feared. It is financed mostly by debt but the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is just 0.6 and will rise to 1 post-acquisition on 2013 earnings estimates (2 if the pension deficit is included). An equity issue of £140m represents a small dilution for existing investors.Boeing forecast this week that 34,000 new aeroplanes would be delivered up to 2031. So it should pay to be part of that manufacturing bonanza. GKN’s problem is that it is classed as an automotive stock – the only one – in the FTSE 100. Volvo Aero should help to reposition the group, which trades at a discount to most of its peers. GKN deserves more friends.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
6;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2012-01-10T22:12:55Z;Tiffany loses lustre amid sluggish sales;Luxury brands struggle in mature markets;Shares in Tiffany & Co fell 10.5 per cent to $59.94 as the luxury retailer it cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its New York store.November and December sales in Tiffany’s Americas region, which includes Canada and Latin America, were up just 2 per cent compared with 2010, while sales at its flagship Fifth Avenue store falling 1 per cent, despite strong spending by tourists.Asia-Pacific same-store sales climbed 12 per cent but investors had been focused on developed markets since Tiffany forecast “weakness” in European and north-eastern US sales in December, an announcement which had also triggered a big share price fall.The sell-off suggests the rise of an emerging market middle class may not inoculate the likes of Tiffany, Coach and Ralph Lauren against developed market worries. “No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach fell 0.8 per cent to $62.33 while Ralph Lauren fell more than 3 per cent at the opening before recovering to close up 0.7 per cent to $147.32.Elsewhere, US markets were in bullish mood, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,292.08, its highest level since the end of July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,462.47 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent to 2,702.5.“Everything is in place for a big rally,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “If the market doesn’t break out now, I don’t think it’s going to at all this year.”Life Technologies rose 8.3 per cent to $46.17 after unveiling a DNA reader.But BorgWarner, which makes powertrains for engines, had the best performance in the S&P, climbing 12.3 per cent to $72.25 after forecasting record sales and earnings growth.Urban Outfitters, the clothing retailer, said Glen Senk, chief executive, had resigned on Monday. That sent its shares down as much as 11 per cent to $25.91 after hours.Elsewhere, the rally was broadly cyclical. Materials and industrial stocks were to the fore after Alcoa kicked off the quarterly earnings season on Monday. Alcoa reported a first loss from continuing operations in two years but was positive about demand in 2012. Its shares were up 0.2 per cent to $9.44.Alpha Natural Resources, which exports metallurgical coal to China, rose 2.8 per cent to $21.33. Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 4 per cent to $68.82.Bank investors continued to show signs of optimism, with Bank of America climbing 5.7 per cent to $6.63, while Citigroup climbed 3.2 per cent to $30 for its highest close in a month.“Absent new negatives equals a positive?” asked Goldman Sachs analysts, summing up the attitude of investors to large universal banks, which have emerged bruised but intact from big share price falls in 2011.Shares in Goldman climbed 3.8 per cent to $98.33 and Morgan Stanley was up 4.3 per cent to $16.89, although data showed trading levels in capital markets were down as much as 36 per cent compared with 2011 so far this year, which may bode ill for investment banks.Separately, Goldman Sachs warned against buying regional bank stocks, which have appreciated 20 per cent as a group since October lows, arguing price-earnings ratios were still high on a forty-year basis. Investors paid little heed, with Regions Financial up 3.8 per cent to $4.70 and Zions Bancorp up 1.6 per cent to $18.17.Shares in the New York Stock Exchangeclimbed 4.6 per cent to $27.79 on an Financial Times report that European regulators would block its merger with Deutsche Börse. The proposed tie up has weighed on NYSE shares, as Deutsche Börse’s price fell with European financials last year.A new year rally, which had seen shares in Juniper Networks appreciate as much as 10 per cent, came to an end as the wireless network provider said it would miss fourth-quarter earnings guidance. Shares fell 0.9 per cent to $21.50.Credit Suisse analysts said internet service providers would “continue to look to suppliers [such as Juniper] to deliver greater performance at lower cost,” as households consumed ever more bandwidth on unlimited packages, without corresponding revenue growth for ISPs. Shares in internet service provider WebMD fell 28.5 per cent to $26.25 as it pre-announced a fourth-quarter revenue miss and said its chief executive had resigned. Yahoo shares were little affected, up 0.3 per cent to $15.51.Most of the share price action appeared driven by WebMD’s decision to terminate “discussions with several potential acquirers of the company.” Speculation of a takeover by Yahoo had seen the company’s market capitalisation climb more than a third since October 6.
7;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2011-12-13T18:07:44Z;Skills gap hobbles US employers;;Drew Greenblatt has been looking for more than a year for three sheet-metal set-up operators to work day, night or weekend shifts.The president of Marlin Steel Wire Products, a company in Baltimore with 30 employees, Mr Greenblatt says his inability to find qualified workers is hampering his business’s growth. “If I could fill those positions, I could raise our annual revenues from $5m to $7m,” he says.He is offering a salary of more than $80,000 with overtime, including health and pension benefits. Yet in spite of extensive advertising, he has had no qualified applicants. He is trying to train some of his unskilled staff but says none has the ability or drive to complete the training.Mr Greenblatt’s predicament speaks to one of the biggest economic debates about today’s 8.6 per cent US unemployment rate: is it merely a cyclical problem that will shrink as demand recovers? Or is it something deeper and more structural, a “mismatch” between the skills workers have and those companies need?The idea there is something structurally wrong with the US workforce is controversial among economists but has a certain resonance with the public. Since the emergence of Japan as a technology and manufacturing powerhouse in the 1970s, Americans have been anxiousthat they were losing their competitive edge to better-educated, harder-working rivals.Economists trying to figure out whether unemployment is cyclical or structural have turned to what they call the Beveridge curve: the relationship between unemployment and the job vacancy rate.Vacancies, the number of unfilled positions, have risen by 35 per cent since their trough in June 2009 – but the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. If there are jobs but people are not filling them, it may be because their skills are not up to scratch, say those who fear structural unemployment.But a preponderance of economists argue this is a misreading of the data. A recent San Francisco Fed paper finds that vacancies are high relative to hiring across a broad range of industries, including those such as construction, where recent job cuts mean that there is most unlikely to be a skills shortage.The authors suggest companies may not be trying very hard to fill jobs, while workers in receipt of unemployment insurance may not be trying that hard to find them.Policy moves by the US Federal Reserve reflect a view that most unemployment is not the result of a skills mismatch. But even those who believe that today’s unemployment problem is primarily cyclical say closing the “skills gap” noted by Mr Greenblatt will be essential if Americans are to enjoy stable work and rising wages.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, told an audience in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August that the US had to “foster the development of a skilled workforce” if it was to enjoy good longer-term prospects. The US education system “despite considerable strengths, poorly serves a substantial portion of our population,” he said.US companies that are growing say an unqualified workforce is already a significant barrier to hiring.In a September poll of owners of fast-growing, privately held US companies undertaken by the non-profit Kauffman Foundation, the inability to find qualified workers was cited as the biggest obstacle to growth. Some 40 per cent of respondents said they were being held back by the skills gap, compared with just 13 per cent by lack of demand.Advanced Technology Services (ATS), a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron, is finding it tough to fill the 160 job openings it has available for roles such as maintenance and machine technicians.The company’s revenues grew by 35 per cent last year and are on course for 25 per cent growth this year. But Jeff Owens, chief executive, says it could expand faster if it could find qualified workers more quickly. “In other businesses the capacity constraint is buildings, plant or equipment,” he says. “In our business, a service business, it’s people.”US manufacturers have 600,000 unfilled positions because of a lack of qualified skilled workers, according to a report released in October by Deloitte, the consultants, and the National Association of Manufacturers, an industry body.Jill Bellak, chief operating officer of MBX, a company in suburban Chicago that makes computer hardware, says the fast-growing business is finding it tough to find good software engineers, production workers and salespeople to add to its 78-strong workforce.“You hear how high unemployment is and you think it would be easy to hire, but companies have tended to cut their lower performers and retain their best people,” says Ms Bellak. “Meanwhile, talented people are less inclined to leave their current positions than they would be in good times.”In manufacturing, the skills problem dates at least to the 1970s and 1980s, when companies began automating factories and outsourcing production. As a result, manufacturers found they did not have jobs for the people leaving their in-house training programmes, some of which were then scrapped.Some big manufacturers still train in-house, including Boeing, the aerospace manufacturer, which spends $80m a year on training its existing workforce. But not all do. “Technology moves fast and most companies don’t have the money or resources to pay for extensive retraining,” said Sir James Dyson, the British household appliances engineer.Without in-house training programmes, companies have often been left looking for staff with specific skills. “A generation ago, employers would hire and train employees. Now, they demand trained workers,” says Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school.“The skills gap is largely a figment of companies’ imagination,” says Mr Cappelli. “They cannot find workers to do the very specific tasks they want done. That is different from not being able to find capable workers.”Companies counter that today’s jobs require a broad set of skills, and that the US educational system is not producing workers with the flexibility they need.“We have a training programme, but if someone applies for a job and doesn’t have basic math, I don’t have the wherewithal to teach them basic math,” says Charles Cannon, chief executive of JBT, a maker of food-processing machinery and airport equipment.American 15-year-olds ranked 25th among the 34 developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in maths, 17th in science and 14th in reading ability, according to a 2009 OECD study.Many companies are realising they need to take the initiative in collaborating with educational institutions. Martin Swarbrick, chief executive of Bison Gear & Engineering, a Chicago manufacturer with 250 staff that makes industrial motors, says his company has had such a programme in place for years and it has helped him offset the skills gap.“We’ve done a lot of promoting from within,” he says. “A lot of our people started on the shop floor and now they’re completing their Masters degrees.”
8;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2011-09-12T15:40:08Z;Suppliers: Innovators enjoy head-start in parts race;;"Pressure on car parts suppliers around the world to come up with innovative products while keeping a tight lid on prices shows no signs of abating.Many parts makers ran into serious difficulties during the recession, but consolidation and restructuring – often under bankruptcy protection – have greatly improved their financial health and operational efficiency.Even so, just five per cent of chief executives polled recently by the US Original Equipment Supplier Association foresee that the next decade will be “significantly better” than the past. Six out of every ten predict that it will be even tougher.Tim Lieuliette, a former supplier executive and now an adviser to the industry, estimates that more than 50 parts makers with annual revenues of over $500m are still ripe for mergers and acquisitions.The question is what will separate winners from losers.Research by McKinsey, the consultancy, suggests that the most successful suppliers over the past two industry cycles – Canada’s Linamar, Autoliv of Sweden, US-based BorgWarner and South Korea’s Hyundai Mobis, among others – are marked by sustained product innovation, high barriers to entry and sustained cost containment.McKinsey cites numerous products still open to a high degree of innovation: variable valve timing for improved engine efficiency, some electric powertrain components, low rolling-resistance tyres, navigation systems and active driver assistance system, such as adaptive cruise control, driver drowsiness detection and lane departure warning.Many traditional mechanical components have become commoditised, generating razor-thin margins for suppliers who produce them. Much of the production of these parts has moved to emerging economies.“Increasingly we invest our money in understanding and developing new technologies that go beyond the next generation, but rather are two or three generations out, offering new value to our OEM customers and their consumers”, said Han Hendriks, head of Johnson Controls’ global product development and engineering for interiors.“This is clearly the direction Johnson Controls is going, becoming more focused on technology – as opposed to manufacturing – than we were in the past.”Thus, suppliers stand to benefit from the growing popularity of electric and hybrid vehicles, and consumer demand for high-value in-car communication and infotainment systems.Bernd Bohr, head of Robert Bosch’s automotive technology sector, said that “[suppliers] field of expertise is electrical and electronic systems; together, these have a share of value added in today’s vehicles of 40 per cent, but this share will rise to 75 per cent in tomorrow’s electric cars”.Big suppliers can capitalise on these trends with diversified product lines that create significant opportunities for cross-pollination.Bosch’s track record in the power-tool business, for example, gave it a headstart in developing lithium ion batteries for electric cars.A carmaker’s brand identity has historically been closely linked to its mastery of internal combustion engines, so it is likely that some carmakers will want to continue to develop the key motor architecture of an electric vehicle alone.“From our understanding the drive train is more or less the heart of the car … so with this understanding in mind you cannot really outsource the batteries, motors and power electronics,” says Jürgen Leohold, head of research at Volkswagen. “Our strategic ambition is to have the competence for these technologies.”The same may apply for the software that sits at the heart of the car’s telematics and infotainment systems.Stefan Kampmann, executive vice president of electric vehicles and hybrid systems at Bosch, said: “Things that will not differentiate your car to the car buyer will probably go to a tier-one (supplier) because then the tier-one can develop economies of scale across OEMs [original equipment manufacturers]. The things that really differentiate your car will stay at the OEM.”“If you look at many of Apple’s products, what Apple does is the concept, the housing and the software which generates the appearance. But the microprocessors are normally purchased, the batteries are purchased and I think we will see a similar industry structure for these new kinds of entertainment and HMI [Human-Machine Interface] solutions,” he addedHowever, carmakers are also exploring strategic partnerships to share the burden of the high cost of research and development during the slow switchover to electro-mobility.For example, Daimler, the German car and truckmaker, announced a joint-venture with Bosch in April to produce electric engines for battery-powered cars. And last month Volvo, the Swedish carmaker, formed a partnership with Siemens, the German engineering group, to develop electric vehicle technology.“We have to think about partnerships on the manufacturing side and engineering side and we have to develop standardisation much faster,” says Mr Kampmann.McKinsey estimates the average cost of components in a new car in North America at $13,400, unchanged from a decade ago. Yet thanks largely to improved productivity, the industry has been able to meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and safety standards, as well as customer demands for extra bells and whistles.But the consultancy expects that, at the same rate of productivity improvement, component costs will climb to an average of $15,900 by 2020, driven mainly by even tighter fuel-economy standards.“The $2,500 gap relative to the $13,400 norm will be a test for the industry”, says Hans-Werner Kaas, who leads McKinsey's automotive practice in the Americas. “We believe that vehicle pricing will fundamentally remain flat given historic trends and enhanced automaker competition. Design and productivity will need to address any remaining gap.”A recent report on small suppliers by the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland sketches two very different future scenarios for the industry.According to Susan Helper, an economics professor who led the study, ""one is characterised by collaborative relationships between firms at all tiers of the supply chain, where firms share cost savings from identifying and eradicating inefficiencies that they might not have been able to address on their own.""The less promising outcome, according to Ms Helper, is that “firms at each level of the supply chain generate profits by squeezing margins of firms in the tier under them”, Ms Helper concluded. “This path is a recipe for industry-wide stagnation."""
9;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

In recent decades, apprenticeships and workplace training have been gradually downgraded, to the extent that many manufacturers now complain they cannot find the skilled workers they need in spite of stubbornly high unemployment.Mechanics and engineers from the baby-boom generation – born in the two decades following the second world war – formed the backbone of the US’s industrial workforce from the 1960s onwards. However, the first baby boomers become eligible for retirement this year, raising the spectre that the skills gap could worsen sharply in the next few years.Some 55 per cent of industrial companies with annual revenues of at least $1bn expect skills shortages prompted by retirements to cost them at least $100m in the next five years, they said in a survey conducted for Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing equipment maintenance company based in Peoria, Illinois, whose clients include companies such as Caterpillar, BorgWarner, Honeywell, Eaton and Textron.Most of the costs will be accounted for by recruiting, training and overtime costs, said Jeff Owens, ATS chief executive. He said the costs also take into account the likelihood that equipment would not be operated for part of the time because of a lack of qualified maintenance staff. “You’re talking about falling productivity and a shorter life for fixed assets in factories,” Mr Owens said.Rick Stephens, senior vice-president of human resources at Boeing, the aircraft maker, said his company is well aware of the problem. “Like most aerospace companies, we have a workforce that is more on the mature side,” he said.Mr Stephens said Boeing spends about $80m annually in workforce training. “We’ve also significantly increased spending in the past year to train up new employees to ensure they’re qualified to go into the production environment,” he said.The problem of the looming retirement of highly experienced workers, Mr Stephens said, has been aggravated by the fact that new recruits tend to be far less technically skilled than entry-level workers were decades ago. In response, Boeing recently doubled its introductory training course from 6-7 weeks to 13 weeks.Mr Owens said the recession had enabled manufacturers to avoid facing the retirement issue. “Companies have put this problem off for a long time because it’s not been pressing,” he said. “But many companies are starting to discover how urgent it is when they look at the average age of their workforce.”The survey also found that 45 per cent of companies are encouraging older workers to delay their retirements as they face the prospect of losing skilled staff, while employees are keen to rebuild their recession-hit pension funds.“The folks that we expected to retire, the age has been extended a bit because of the economy’s effects on peoples’ savings and retirement plans,” said Mr Stephens.Mr Owens said that could help postpone the problem, but could not overcome it. He also noted that older skilled workers tend to be less productive.“Manufacturers have assumed they can simply hire people when they need them, but when they start to look, they realise how difficult it is to hire.” Half of the survey respondents said they had 11 or more open positions for skilled workers, with one-third having more than 20 unfilled vacancies.
11;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2010-08-06T21:08:55Z;Magna bounces back with sparkling earnings;;Magna International reported a sharp turnround in second-quarter earnings on Friday, joining a growing list of automotive suppliers that have bounced back with unexpected vigour from the 2008-09 slump.While the industry’s dramatic improvement owes much to a recovery in global car sales, it has also benefited greatly from cost savings and restructuring.Magna, based north of Toronto, posted net income of $293m, or $2.59 a share, compared with a $205m loss, or $1.83 a share, a year earlier. It raised its dividend by two-thirds to 30 cents a share three months after reinstating the payment following a year-long suspension.Revenues jumped by 63 per cent, but Vince Galifi, chief financial officer, also pointed to a concerted drive to reduce capacity and cut overhead costs.Magna has closed 69 plants and other facilities over the past four years and shrunk its workforce from a peak of 84,000 to 76,000. On the other hand, it has opened 14 facilities in emerging markets and low-cost regions. Magna shares climbed almost 5 per cent to $78.78 in afternoon trading on Friday.Other big auto parts makers whose second-quarter results have far exceeded analysts’ estimates include Tenneco, Borg Warner, TRW, Dana and American Axle, all based in the US, and Europe’s Valeo. Several raised their 2010 revenues and earnings estimates.Moody’s upgraded Valeo’s credit rating this week, noting that the Paris-based group, whose products range from clutches to windshield wipers, has lowered its break-even point from annual revenues of €8.1bn ($10.8bn) to €7bn.Car parts makers were under pressure even before the recession, squeezed between rising raw material costs and customers’ demands for lower prices.The steep downturn in car sales in North America and Europe accelerated consolidation. The US Original Equipment Suppliers Association has identified 54 companies that filed for bankruptcy protection last year. At least 200 more, mostly relatively small, privately held companies, have gone out of business.Gregg Lemos Stein, analyst at Standard & Poor’s, cautioned that significant risks remained, especially in Europe, where the removal of government car-scrappage incentives has cast a pall over demand.Mr Stein said that the outlook in North America was also clouded by current vehicle production exceeding sales.
12;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2008-11-18T20:19:59Z;Detroit spinners?;;The plant that assembles Chrysler’s Jeep Wrangler near Toledo, Ohio sprawls across four buildings, but Chrysler occupies only one of them. The others house three of the troubled carmaker’s suppliers. South Korea’s Hyundai Mobis builds the Wrangler’s chassis, while Kuka, a German maker of robots and welding machines, puts together the body. The facility’s paint shop is operated by Magna International of Canada, with Chrysler responsible only for the vehicle’s final assembly.The plant, opened in 2005, illustrates the interdependence of Detroit’s troubled carmakers and their myriad suppliers in the US and overseas.Relationships like these lie at the heart of the intense lobbying effort by Chrysler and its two bigger Detroit-based rivals – General Motors and Ford – to persuade US lawmakers to approve a $25bn (€20bn, $17bn) rescue package.Congress began hearings on Tuesday on the plan, aimed at averting the collapse of an industry that accounts for about 4 per cent of gross domestic product but is quickly running out of cash. Were either GM or Ford to go bankrupt, it would mark the biggest business failure in US history. The Detroit carmakers operate 105 US assembly and component plants, with close to 240,000 employees. They provide healthcare benefits for 2m Americans and pensions for almost three-quarters of a million people.Proponents of the bail-out claim that the damage would spread much further. Carmaking, they argue, has one of the largest “multiplier” effects of any industry: for every job, at least seven more people are employed indirectly. Manufacturers, parts suppliers and dealers say the impact of a collapse on the real economy would dwarf that of this year’s bank failures. Nearly all the jobs lost would be blue-collar, with the pain felt largely in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Michigan already has unemployment of almost 9 per cent, the highest of any state.Some draw a parallel with Lehman Brothers, where government’s failure to intervene is now seen as having hastened the collapse of AIG and exacerbated the financial crisis. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic House leader, has said that the impact of the failure of a Detroit carmaker would be “devastating”. Bob McKenna, president of the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents suppliers, describes such an outcome as “catastrophic”.But many lawmakers, Republicans in particular, are hostile to a bail-out that they say would reward Detroit for its failure over many years to build competitive businesses. It could also set a dangerous precedent as recession sends other US industries into the skids, then on to Washington in search of handouts. Rescue funds, if they come at all, are likely to be tied to strict conditions requiring changes to management, union contracts and business models.Less disputed is the risk that, without aid or an extraordinary uptick in America’s depressed car market, one or more Detroit carmaker may not survive through next year. Ratings agencies, equity analysts and credit default swap markets all increasingly point to the likelihood of a failure among GM, Ford and Chrysler. Standard & Poor’s last week lowered the credit ratings of two big suppliers and placed 13 others on review. Even formerly blue-chip companies such as Magna, BorgWarner and Johnson Controls, were on the list.According to CSM Worldwide, the automotive consultancy, three-quarters of suppliers of 68 of the key components and modules that go into cars derive 20 per cent or more of their business from the Detroit companies. About 37 per cent of suppliers generate more than half their business from GM, Ford or Chrysler. Many are already unprofitable and the loss of a single big customer – a Ford or a GM – could push them over the edge, disrupting the supply chain of other customers.Advocates of a bail-out say, therefore, that the failure of one large Detroit company could cause the other two to collapse. “Everything is so intimately connected that if one of these guys goes down, it would probably take the entire industry down,” says David Cole of the University of Michigan’s Centre for Automotive Research.Other large US companies – notably airlines – have filed for Chapter 11 protection and continued doing business for years. But carmakers and industry analysts say that a bankruptcy filing for an automaker would cause a collapse of sales as consumers baulked at buying a car whose warranty might not be honoured or for which they might have trouble getting parts.The carmakers also reject the notion that they are undeserving of a bail-out. GM and Ford are now producing well-reviewed models – the former’s Saturn Outlook sports-utility vehicle is one – that match or beat Japanese rivals’ offerings in consumer rankings. After years of struggling with high healthcare and wage costs, Detroit last year clinched deals with the United Auto Workers’ union to cut its healthcare obligations by billions of dollars and pay new hires more competitive wages.The healthcare savings were due to show up on carmakers’ bottom lines from 2010 – but it is no longer clear whether they will be around to reap them. GM has said its cash reserves may fall below the minimum $11bn-$14bn it needs to keep running by early 2009, while analysts think the finances of privately owned Chrysler, which does not report earnings, are similar if not worse. Ford has more money but burnt through an average $2.6bn a month in June to September.The discussion over whether to bail out America’s carmakers is clouded by the fact that most who know them best, including outside consultants, are based in Michigan and have a vested interest in their survival. Few will speak critically on the record, but some privately say the true picture may be more nuanced than Detroit paints. One thinks the carmakers may be “crying wolf” in the hope of raising the amount of government largesse they get. “If they really wanted to sell assets and raise cash they could,” he says, pointing to lucrative franchises such as Ford of Europe and GM’s joint ventures in China. Indeed, GM this week sold its remaining shares in Suzuki, and Ford on Tuesday sold 20 per cent of its stake in rival Japanese carmaker Mazda.Past industry experience also suggests that the failure of the three carmakers, while widely felt, might in fact come at a cost lower than the sum of their lost parts. At least some of the Detroit companies’ operations would probably survive and employ workers under new owners. Daewoo Motors failed in 2001 at a heavy short-term cost to employment and its local and overseas plants. Ten years later, five of the former carmaker’s plants in Korea have been busy turning out Chevrolets and other cars for none other than GM under its GM DAT joint venture with Daewoo’s creditors and others.When US suppliers such as Delphi or Collins & Aikman filed for bankruptcy in 2005, their European units carried on doing business after being sold or ring-fenced from their parents. The Detroit companies would have a harder time selling their unionised Midwestern car plants but some of their suppliers would probably survive, picking up business from Japanese carmakers and emerging leaner from the process.Indeed, there are signs that Detroit’s overseas arms are preparing themselves for all eventualities, including failure of their owners. Opel, GM’s German subsidiary, is in talks with federal and state governments about lining up €1bn in guarantees to keep it going in case its owner’s troubles deepen.Nor is the past record on state-led rescues of “national champion” carmakers encouraging. Chrysler secured $1.5bn in loan guarantees in 1979 – a bail-out seen today as having addressed the symptoms of Chrysler’s problems rather than their root cause. The UK government poured millions of pounds into trying to save MG Rover, only to see it fail in 2005 at an estimated cost to taxpayers and business of £870m. China’s Shanghai Automotive owns some remnants of the business.Yet politics rather than economics is likely to prevail in Washington, if not this week then after Barack Obama takes office in January. Organised labour is a key Democratic constituency and jobs in several “swing” states that voted Democratic in the presidential election are on the line. “We are determined to pass legislation that will save the jobs of millions of workers whose livelihoods are on the line,” Senate majority leader Harry Reid said last week. “They deserve no less.”GM and Ford, as publicly traded companies, may prove more politically palatable candidates for aid than Chrysler, owned by Cerberus, the private equity firm. Industry insiders say the company is the only one in Detroit that could fail without taking its two rivals down with it. The impact on suppliers would also be comparatively muted.But the reckoning will be costly to Detroit in any scenario. Whatever happens, tens of thousands will lose their jobs in the months ahead. According to S&P, even with financial aid, “US automakers are unlikely to avoid further sweeping changes to their product lines, market focus, or possibly their status as independent entities.”Rod Lache, automotive analyst at Deutsche Bank, says that GM’s predicament “has the potential to set in motion a sequence of events that would be bankruptcy-like”. The company’s market share could continue to fall and finance companies are likely to tighten their terms even further.“I don’t think any enterprise the size of Ford or GM has ever been closer to filing for Chapter 11 before, so it’s uncharted territory on the economic impact it would have,” says one industry consultant.
13;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2008-10-31T03:07:25Z;Smaller orders hit car-parts makers;;Several global automotive parts makers reported hefty third-quarter losses on Thursday, accompanied by belt-tightening measures in response to sagging orders from their carmaker customers.Visteon, BorgWarner, Lear and TRW, all Michigan-based, reported losses well above analysts’ estimates.Visteon, spun off by Ford Motor eight years ago, reported a $188m loss and said that it was axing 2,800 jobs, or 8 per cent of its workforce. It also withdrew 2009 earnings targets.Echoing his rivals, Donald Stebbins, Visteon’s chief executive, described business conditions as “extremely difficult”, especially in North America. But, he said, “we are also seeing slowing production volumes in both western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region”.Several US, Japanese and European carmakers have announced production cuts in recent months.According to Brian Johnson, analyst at Barclays Capital, both Ford and General Motors may need to curb North American output further in the final three months of the year as a result of an unexpectedly steep fall in US sales.Analysts expect that light-vehicle sales in October, to be published on Monday, will reach no more than about 11.5m units at an annual rate, down from 12.5m in September and 16.1m a year earlier.Lear, which makes seats and electrical systems, swung to a net third-quarter loss of $98.2m from a profit of $41m a year earlier. A 30 per cent plunge in North American sales pushed worldwide revenues down from $3.6bn to $3.1bn.Himanshu Patel, analyst at JPMorgan, said Lear was in danger of violating its debt covenants by mid-2009. But the company was confident that cost reductions and delays in a planned restructuring, among other measures, would forestall such a breach.Bob Rossiter, Lear’s chief executive, said the company was seeking acquisitions, in some cases with partners. “We believe there will be further consolidation of the segment,” he said.BorgWarner, widely viewed as one of the sector’s strongest operators, reported a $130.4m loss, compared with a profit of $83.2m a year earlier. It expects a 12 per cent drop in sales in the second half of 2008, with two-thirds of the decline occurring outside the US.Concern among suppliers has been heightened by merger talks between GM and Chrysler. Should a deal be consummated, the combined company is expected to axe numerous models, causing disruption among suppliers.But Mr Rossiter shrugged off the threat, saying that Lear, which supplies both companies, “can adapt to whatever situation they send to us”.
14;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2007-05-28T19:40:43Z;Save lives and make money along the way;;"The other day a friend of mine asked me to do a favour for her. She had just sold a house and had some money to put to work. She asked me to sit with her while the financial adviser at the bank gave her his suggestions.I didn’t really want to do it. First off, I’m too busy writing important columns for the Financial Times. Second, I like to be liked and I knew the instant I walked in that office with her that the financial adviser would hate me. Not fun, but I did it anyway.We got to the guy’s office and “Hank” (not his real name) suggested she put all her money in the AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth Fund. He said that AllianceBernstein was the best, and that Large Cap Growth was where it was going to be at over the next year.Here is my opinion of these things: you have to ask three questions:
●What is it going to cost me in fees, and do they have a similar option with lower fees?
●What is the overall concept on the market (in this case, “Large Cap Growth”) or on asset allocation and diversification?
●What is the best vehicle for getting me there (does anyone have “alpha” or can I just use a low-cost ETF?).So I asked, “is there a load to this fund?” Meaning, do you have to give money out of your pocket for just walking in the door? The answer was: “Yes, 4.25 per cent.”My question then was: “Is there a no-load version?” And he replied with lie number one: “No.” But then, a minute or so later, on further drilling, he said, “Yes, but there’s a lot of other fees.” So we looked at it and there were some fees but not so bad.So I asked: “Can we get a no-fee version by doing a wrap account?” In other words, paying 1 per cent on assets and getting no loads or fees on any of the professional managers recommended by the bank. Then came lie number two: Again, it was at first a big “no” (you had to be “qualified”) but then it turned out my friend was qualified.I have no opinions on large-cap growth. Whatever. But I wanted to see statistics on how AllianceBernstein did relative to a large cap growth benchmark. Such as an exchange-traded fund (DIA, for instance). That led to lie number three: “ETFs are a lot more volatile. You’re better off with professional managers such as AllianceBernstein.”It turns out, on further research, that this particular fund had underperformed fairly consistently over the past eight years. My friend ended up doing a wrap account and being spread out in a diversified manner among various quality funds. I would have suggested one step further, and not waste time or money on the wrap account but, altogether, my friend saved a few percentage points on the load fees and got into a nice set of diversified funds at little or no fees.Now let us move on to more important topics such as solving global warming, bringing clean water to cities and protecting the planet against pandemics. I can help with those things also. There are three problems: the world is getting warmer every day. Heck, I’m sweating as I write this. The supply of clean water on the planet is staying constant but the number of people who need it (by virtue of the increasing populations in the cities of emerging economies) is growing. And every day the risk of a global pandemic increases.Global warming: the best thing we can do is buy the stocks of companies that make clean car technologies. Borg Warner, with technology straight out of Star Trek, makes more than 80 per cent of its revenues from technologies that increase the fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of cars. Magna International, uses its hydroforming technology to make lighter cars. We can also clean up some pollution by investing in Foster-Wheeler, which helps power plants cut sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.Clean water: let’s start off with Calgon Carbon Corporation. Their products are used to get organic compounds (bacteria) from water and any other liquids. They are making the shift to profitability this year. Next, I like Jacobs Engineering and even General Electric – both companies have subsidiaries that help countries and cities with clean water treatment of polluted or potentially polluted areas. Tetra Tech also derives more than 80 per cent of its revenues from clean water treatment and environmental clean-ups.Global pandemics: both Vical and Endo Pharma are developing vaccines for bird flu and other virulent strains of the flu. Let us also throw in Valeant Pharma for working on cures for Parkinson’s Disease (not strictly a pandemic but it affects more people as we all live longer), and also trading at a multiple to earnings of 16.When my friend and I had worked out all the details with her adviser, he politely showed us to the door, shook our hands, and then turned to me and said: “Sir, exactly what is it that you do for a living?”I save lives.james@formulacapital.com"
15;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2007-05-27T20:14:13Z;Diesel could outpace hybrids in US;;Sales of low-emission diesel cars in the US could outpace their hybrid counterparts within five years, a new study claims.If so, Germany’s three biggest carmakers – currently leaders in the technology – could profit, alongside Japan’s Honda and suppliers such as BorgWarner, Denso, and Continental.The US is the world’s largest vehicle market, and purchasing patterns there will have a large influence on the economics of competing clean-vehicle technologies.Ricardo, the automotive technology group that produced the study along with UBS Investment Research, estimates that sales of both diesel and hybrid vehicles will grow in the US as legislators tighten fuel-economy and emissions standards. However diesel passenger vehicles will “prevail by 2012”, the study claims, selling 1.5m units in the US, compared with 1.2m hybrids.“We expect a big increase in diesel and hybrid sales, but ultimately we expect diesel to outstrip hybrids,” said Max Warburton, automotive sector analyst with UBS.While about half of the vehicles currently sold in Europe have diesel engines, the technology is unpopular in America. Many diesel cars sold in the US during the 1970s energy crisis were of poor quality.America’s standards on emissions of particulates and nitrous oxide emissions – which diesel cars have a harder time meeting than petrol or hybrid cars – are tougher than in the European Union.Hybrid cars, powered by large batteries backed up by combustion engines, have sold better in the US than in Europe. The cars – of which Toyota is the leading producer – meet the strict US exhaust emissions. However, Volkswagen, BMW and DaimlerChrysler’s Mercedes brand are all planning launches in the US over the coming year of “clean diesel” cars that comply with emissions legislation in all 50 states.The newest generation of diesel vehicles are comparable or, in some cases, even cleaner than Toyota’s hybrids. VW’s new Polo BlueMotion diesel model emits less carbon dioxide per km than Toyota’s top-selling Prius hybrid.UBS and Ricardo claim that cost considerations will give diesel cars an edge over hybrids, whose batteries are expensive to produce. “The diesel cost penalty is substantially lower than that of hybrids, especially for larger vehicles,” the report claims.Growing concern over global warming and dependence on foreign oil have prompted the US and Europe to tighten fuel economy and emissions standards over the past year.The Bush administration recently began work on stricter fuel economy regulations, and 10 US states, led by California, have regulated CO2 emissions at the state level. The EU is proceeding with legislation that will require a 25 per cent cut in cars’ CO2 emissions by 2012.
16;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Heavy-hitting collector of difficult art;;Samuel Heyman is not a man to shy away from a fight.As a corporate raider who has made billions through takeovers and bid battles, his presence at the heart of the battle for the London Stock Exchange should come as no surprise.Mr Heyman embarked on his career in business in 1969, following a stint in government that left a lasting impression. He took over his family’s real estate development business after his father’s death.As the head of Heyman Properties, he quickly acquired other business interests and became chairman of International Specialty Products, a chemical company he took public in 1991 and private again in 2002.His corporate raider stripes were earned through a series of takeover attempts backed by Michael Milken, the self-styled junk bond king of Wall Street who worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment bank.In the best known of these deals, Mr Heyman acquired GAF Corporation, a building products company, after a protracted takeover battle.Mr Heyman made tens of millions of dollars through the failed takeover attempts on Borg Warner, the US engineering company, and Union Carbide, the American chemicals company that was eventually bought by General Electric.For most of the 1990s Mr Heyman refrained from corporate raids, opting instead to run ISP. But in 2000, he returned to the fray, mounting an unsuccessful bid for Dexter Corporation, the US industrials company, which nonetheless led to its break-up and made him another fortune.In 2003, Mr Heyman secured 9 per cent of Hercules, the speciality chemicals maker, but his takeover attempt was defeated by a shareholder vote.In May this year, it emerged that Mr Heyman had built up a 5.6 per cent stake in Engelhard, the materials company that has since been acquired by BASF.Heyman Investment Associates, the Connecticut-based investment vehicle through which he builds many of his stakes, was also active in the Mittal Steel bid for Arcelor and recently built a stake in ElkCorp, the roofing and building products maker that is considering a buy-out offer from larger competitor BMCA.A keen art collector for almost 40 years, he recently said he was not into what one called “pretty pictures”, but was interested in difficult art that was challenging, sometimes even disturbing and always thought provoking.As a 1963 graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr Heyman began his working life in President John F. Kennedy’s administration as a trial lawyer in the US Department of Justice.The president’s brother Robert Kennedy took a keen interest in young lawyers. So, one Friday afternoon, Mr Heyman was invited to have a beer with the then attorney general.Mr Kennedy had also started at the Justice Department after graduating from law school.He quipped to the assembled young bucks that “if you’re bright, capable, work hard, and your brother is elected president, you too can become attorney general”.Mr Heyman’s dedication to public service has endured despite earning his fortune and, in some cases, notoriety as a corporate raider.Indeed, he has often claimed his period in public service as an assistant attorney general was the highlight of his career.In 2000, the Heyman Fellowship Program at Harvard Law School was established to encourage more graduates to pursue careers in the federal public interest.Mr Heyman is the founder of the Partnership for Public Service.Also, with his wife Ronnie, who is president of American Friends of the Israel Museum, he established the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York.Samuel Heyman: Corporate raider1983: Leads proxy battle against GAF to prevent it selling building products division1989: Takes GAF private in 1989 through leveraged buy-out1991: Takes International Specialty Products public2000: Mounts bid for Dexter Corporation, US industrial company, leads to eventual break-up2003: Secures 9 per cent stake in chemicals maker Hercules – takeover attempt defeated by shareholder vote2006: Builds stake in Engelhard prior to acquisition by BASF.

17;BWA;Borgwarner Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;GM tipped to open a bad week for Detroit;;"Financial markets are bracing for General Motors, the world's biggest carmaker, to report on Tuesday its biggest quarterly loss in more than a decade - setting the stage for earnings disappointments from virtually the entire North American automotive industry.GM's market value has shrunk by 24 per cent since mid-March, when it warned it was likely to post a first-quarter loss of about $850m, or $1.50 a share, before special items.GM is also expected to take hundreds of millions of dollars in one-time charges related to restructuring its European operations and closure of an assembly plant in Michigan. Its shares fell 13 per cent last week, closing at $25.60.Meanwhile, Ford Motor Company, the number two Detroit vehicle manufacturer, which reports on Wednesday, has been hit mainly by sagging demand for large and mid-sized sport-utility vehicles, which are among its most profitable products.Ford shares tumbled 14.7 per cent last week after a warning that this year's earnings would fall about a quarter short of expectations. Ford has also abandoned its goal of $7bn in pre-tax earnings by 2006, centrepiece of a revitalisation plan put in place three years ago.GM and Ford's troubles are rippling through the entire automotive sector.Stephen Girsky, analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects that every listed original equipment parts supplier except Johnson Controls and Borg Warner will report lower earnings compared with last year's first quarter. Tower Automotive, one of several suppliers in bankruptcy protection, said on Friday it was closing three US plants and laying off almost 7 per cent of its workforce.Rod Lache, analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a research note: ""There is mounting evidence that the US auto market is experiencing a sea change. Consumers are shifting away from the traditional SUVs and light trucks that have been at the core of US automakers' automotive franchise …US automakers appear to be structurally uncompetitive in nearly all other segments of the market.""GM's US market share dipped to 25.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year from 27.1 per cent in the same period of 2004. The group is banking on a recovery next year with the introduction of a new series of pick-ups and SUVs. It has also reinvigorated its Cadillac brand.Still, John Casesa, analyst at Merrill Lynch, expects that GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division - smallest and most profitable of the three Detroit-based carmakers - will be forced to shrink production capacity by 12 per cent over five years. By contrast, he projects that Japanese, Korean and European capacity in North America will expand by a third.In the short-run, cutbacks could exacerbate cost pressures on the Detroit carmakers. Under their contract with the United Auto Workers union, laid-off workers are assigned to a ""jobs bank"" where they are entitled to full wages and benefits after 48 weeks on state unemployment insurance.GM's chief executive Rick Wagoner has put his credibility on the line by taking direct control of the company's North American operations, which contribute about three-fifths of global revenues."
