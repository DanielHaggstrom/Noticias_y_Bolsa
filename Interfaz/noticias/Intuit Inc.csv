0;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Intuit’s big bet says a lot about the debt-laden US consumer;Deal to buy Credit Karma for $7.1bn comes as household borrowings break new records;It was hard to tell what investors in Intuit, the California-based financial software company, made of its $7.1bn deal this week to buy Credit Karma, the most successful of the apps built around giving consumers their credit scores for free.Reaction to the deal, announced on Monday, was swamped by fears over the worsening coronavirus outbreak, which had by Thursday led to the most rapid correction in the S&P 500 since the Great Depression.But by then Intuit’s Nasdaq-listed shares were down about 10 per cent on the week, slightly less than the market. That suggests that investors are more excited than alarmed about the 37 year-old company’s biggest ever deal, to be paid in equal parts cash and stock, and its first since Sasan Goodarzi took over as chief executive about a year ago.The acquirer is buying access to a gold mine of data: Credit Karma, which claims to have more than 100m “members” in the US, Canada and the UK, says it has thousands of data points on each of its customers, scraped together from a huge variety of sources. As its new owner, Intuit now stands a good chance of creating the “Facebook for financial services,” said Sheel Mohnot, a venture capitalist who focuses on fintech start-ups.“If Intuit is able to execute on this . . . plan, they will have everything about your financial life,” he said.At the moment Intuit makes most of its money by selling accounting software (QuickBooks) and tax-preparation tools (TurboTax) to consumers and small businesses. If those customers want to know their credit scores, that normally means they are anxious about improving them — and thus susceptible to offers of a new credit-card, a car loan or a student loan. Intuit already owns Mint, a budgeting platform that also pitches individuals financial products.“We wake up every day trying to help consumers make ends meet,” Mr Goodarzi said about the deal.The price looks high: seven times Credit Karma’s revenues last year, which were up 20 per cent from 2018. Then again, to use Facebook as the yardstick, it paid 1,900 times historic revenues to buy WhatsApp in 2014 and $1bn to buy Instagram, a company with no sales at all at the time. Building a community in which you can take a commission for connecting buyers and sellers, as Credit Karma does, does not come cheap.And the fundamental bet — that demand for free credit scores will keep rising — looks like a sound one. The US consumer is in a precarious state. Debt accumulated on credit cards rose to a record in the final quarter of 2019, according to figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with total balances increasing by $46bn to $930bn. That is well above the previous peak seen before the 2008 financial crisis.Moreover, the proportion of that debt classed as seriously delinquent, meaning payments were late by 90 days or more, rose to 5.32 per cent in the fourth quarter, the highest level in almost eight years, from 5.16 per cent in the third. The total household debt mountain reached $14tn: the twenty-second consecutive quarterly increase.With so much debt outstanding and with incomes failing to rise accordingly, it is no wonder that Intuit is not the only company trying to get deeper into the financial lives of ordinary Americans.Just last week, Morgan Stanley, with nearly 15,500 financial advisers and $2.7tn in client assets, said it was buying ETrade, an online brokerage and digital bank, for $13bn. The purchase — the biggest takeover by a US bank since the 2008 financial crisis — underscores a trend among giant Wall Street banks to cater to less wealthy consumers. ETrade’s average account size, at $69,000, is less than half Morgan Stanley’s.Four years ago, Goldman Sachs moved to Main Street with the launch of Marcus, an online bank that began with relatively high-yielding savings accounts and quickly added personal loans.In its annual report, filed last week, Goldman reported that it made a combined pre-tax loss of $700m for 2019 on Marcus, along with a new credit-card business and a fledging transaction banking service. But it is committed. “We’re trying to deliver a retail bank branch through your phone,” said Eric Lane, Goldman’s consumer and wealth-management chief, during an event last month. “This is only the beginning.”Intuit, too, feels like it is just getting started. In the slide deck shown to investors this week, there was excited language about Credit Karma helping to “transform the personal finance industry and power the economy.”There was also a sobering statistic to justify the outlay: half of all Americans live from pay cheque to pay cheque.
1;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Intuit/Credit Karma: the trial;Execution risks loom large for Intuit, which does not have a history of integrating large acquisitions;The downbeat genius of Franz Kafka would be required to describe adequately the misery the US tax system induces in many Americans. Even Intuit, whose software helps them cope, appears alienated by it. With competition ratcheting up in the tax prepping industry, it has mounted a $7.1bn swoop on fintech darling Credit Karma.Intuit, the $74bn group behind TurboTax software, needs to diversify. It also has to do a better job of integrating acquisitions, judging from its track record.Credit Karma started by providing consumers with free credit scores and now boasts more than 100m users — including a large number of picky millennials. Buying the privately-held group gives Intuit access to a huge database of potential customers for Intuit products. A deal would also allow Intuit to absorb and eliminate Credit Karma’s competing free tax filing service.However, execution risks loom large. Intuit does not have a history of integrating large acquisitions well. Digital Insight, acquired in 2007 for $1.3bn, was sold for about a fifth less six years later. Intuit made a foray into personal finance with the purchase of Mint in 2009 for $170m, only to let it languish.Intuit says Credit Karma will operate as a standalone company. Some cannibalisation is inevitable given the overlap between the two companies’ product portfolios. The combined group will also hold a staggering amount of personal financial data. Regulatory scrutiny will be an issue.Credit Karma was valued at about $4bn in a private share sale just two years ago. But the price offered seems reasonable at roughly 7 times Credit Karma’s trailing revenues. That is about average for credit checkers Experian, TransUnion and Equifax. Anyway, Intuit can afford to be generous. An 80 per cent jump in its share price since 2018 has given it additional currency for this share and cash offer. Cash and equivalents stood at about $1.6bn at the end of January.Intuit promises to empower consumers to make smart decisions about their money. Given its acquisition record, shareholders can only hope Intuit took some of its own advice.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline
2;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-02-24T22:08:45Z;Intuit agrees $7.1bn deal to buy Credit Karma;Consolidation sweeps financial technology sector as groups seek to control more data;Intuit, the owner of TurboTax and QuickBooks, agreed to buy credit report provider Credit Karma for $7.1bn on Monday as consolidation sweeps the financial technology industry.The deal highlights the growing appetite among financial services groups for data and its increasing value in the digital age. Intuit is now worth more than $74bn.Sasan Goodarzi, Intuit chief executive, said: “By joining forces with Credit Karma, we can create a personalised financial assistant that will help consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and provide insights and advice.”The takeover is the latest significant acquisition in the financial technology sector, as banks, payment processors, brokerages and other providers seek to bolster their tech prowess by taking over fast-growing start-ups and industry disrupters.More than $200bn of deals involving financial technology groups were agreed last year — a record, according to investment bank Financial Technology Partners.The deals included Fidelity National Information Services’ near $50bn purchase of payment processor Worldpay, Fiserv’s $46bn takeover of rival First Data and Global Payments’ $27bn all-stock buyout of TSYS. This year, Visa agreed to pay $5.3bn for Plaid, which connects fintech companies with their customers’ bank accounts.Shareholders of Credit Karma, which is backed by private equity group Silver Lake and venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, will receive cash and stock in Intuit. Credit Karma generated nearly $1bn in revenue last year and was expected to explore an initial public offering. However, the lacklustre debuts of several tech companies last year pushed it towards a sale instead.Founded in 2007 by Ken Lin, Credit Karma has more than 100m users in the US and Canada, and generates revenue by analysing users’ credit reports to suggest products such as personal loans. It also helps users with tax preparation and price comparisons for other financial products.The company receives a fee from banks when a customer takes out a product it recommends, and says it has been profitable since 2015.The deal would be the largest takeover by Intuit since its founding in 1983, and the biggest deal orchestrated by Mr Goodarzi since he became chief executive last year. In 2019, the group bought data analytics and integration company Origami Logic.The deal would help diversify Intuit’s revenue, which last fiscal year reached $6.8bn — roughly two-fifths of it from consumer offerings.Citigroup analysts said this month that Intuit investors needed to be “wary” of regulatory risks after the Internal Revenue Service last year modified an agreement with private companies that prevented the government from offering its own tax return software or e-filing service.The change followed reports that Intuit and other private tax preparation groups had steered consumers who qualified to use their free tax services towards paid products. An audit by the tax authority found only a very small fraction of people who could file their taxes for free doing so.
3;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intuit reckons on good data karma;Berners-Lee Solid steps, tech week ahead, Huawei’s new folder;"FT subscribers can click here to receive tech news daily by email in the #techFT newsletterI'm a big fan of services that help you budget ahead and track your personal spending with clarity, so I find it disconcerting when some favourites display blurred vision and turn out not to have a financial future themselves.Back in the 1990s, the choice was between Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft Money, with the US justice department blocking a Microsoft buyout of Quicken at one point. I used both before settling on Quicken, but then Intuit dropped its product for UK users after I had moved back home. When I returned to the States in the 2000s, I adopted Mint's superior online service, only for Intuit to stage a buyout in 2009 (the same year Microsoft stopped selling Money) and eventually replace Quicken with Mint. Since then, Mint has suffered from apparent neglect, as Intuit has focused more on its TurboTax tax prep software and QuickBooks accounting for small businesses.In this context, Intuit's latest reported move suggests perhaps a lack of intuition on where the personal finance market has been heading. It is close to buying the fintech portal Credit Karma for about $7bn, according to the Wall Street Journal, in what would be its biggest ever deal.Credit Karma is one of those online credit score companies, but it has also added tracking of personal spending and an online tax preparation service. So there is duplication here and, for an existing Intuit user, this deal would seem to offer few benefits. However, Intuit's move does make more sense for the company, in terms of the aggregation of personal data made possible. “With 100m members and a service built on using customer data to drive targeted offerings, we think Credit Karma can accelerate Intuit's AI efforts and open up new opportunities to build data-powered services,” say UBS analysts.Back in the UK again, I can't use Mint, but I can sign up for Credit Karma here and find out my credit score and get sold lots of financial products. No thanks. We've moved on over here and with Open Banking there are plenty of alternatives. Money Dashboard is my current favourite and I hope Intuit stays well away from it.1.

4;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Intuit names CEO replacement, revenue beats expectations;;Intuit’s chief executive is stepping down at the end of December, the tax and accounting software company announced on Thursday.Intuit chief executive and chairman Brad Smith will continue to lead the firm through 2018, but will be replaced on January 1 by Sasan Goodarzi, who currently serves as executive vice-president and general manager of the small business and self-employed group. Mr Goodarzi will also join the board of directors at that time.Intuit’s chief technology officer Tayloe Stansbury will also step down, effective January 1. The company tapped Marianna Tessel, currently senior vice-president and chief product development officer for the small business and self employed group, to replace Mr Stansbury in the role.The announcement came as Intuit reported revenue of $988m in the company’s fourth fiscal quarter, which ended July 31. That is up 17 per cent year over year, beating average analyst predictions of $952.2m.The company pointed to 43 per cent revenue growth in its online ecosystem division and 20 per cent revenue growth in the small business and self-employed group.Earnings per share were 18 cents for the quarter, short of analyst expectations of 23 cents per share. That included a $79m charge for the sale of a data centre in Quincy, Washington, but the impact of this on net income was offset by recognised tax benefits, the company said. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 32 cents.Intuit said it finished its fiscal year with more than 3.4m subscribers to its QuickBooks Online programme, a 43 per cent increase from the prior year.The board approved a quarterly dividend of 47 cents per share.Intuit projected revenue of $955m to $975m in the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year, which ends October 31, and projected full-year revenue to grow 8 to 10 per cent in fiscal 2019, to a range of $6.53bn to $6.63bn. The company forecast a loss per share of 17 to 19 cents in the first quarter, and diluted earnings per share of $5.25 to $5.35 for the full year.Intuit shares were down 1.9 per cent in post-market trading after the firm’s earnings results were released. Company shares were up 34.6 per cent year to date, as of the close of the market Thursday.Last quarter Intuit got a boost from the gig economy as freelancers and small-business owners drove up sales for its small business and self-employed unit and its consumer group division, as reported.
5;INTU;Intuit Inc;2018-05-22T20:40:51Z;TurboTax maker Intuit gets ‘gig economy’ bump;;Intuit continued to cash in on the rise of the “gig economy”, with demand from freelancers and small-business owners for its tax and accounting software programmes helping the company deliver fiscal third-quarter results that trounced expectations.Revenue at the company jumped 15 per cent to $2.92bn in the three months to end of April, handily topping Wall Street’s forecast for $2.8bn.The gains were driven by growth across both its small business and self-employed unit as well as its consumer group division, where its TurboTax software is used to help individuals file IRS tax returns.QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers stood at 683,000 at the end of the quarter, compared to the 360,000 a year ago, helping to drive a 45 per cent increase in total QuickBook subscribers to 3.2m in the quarter.Net income was up nearly a quarter at $1.2bn, or $4.59 a share, compared to estimates of $4.46 a share.“We achieved very strong results this quarter,” said chief executive Brad Smith. “We are pleased with our momentum . . . and we are encouraged by our strong performance through the tax season, including the successful debut of TurboTax Live, which we’ll continue to scale next season.”Underscoring its confidence, the company also raised its outlook for the fiscal 2018 year. It now sees full-year revenue at $5.915bn to $5.935bn and expects diluted earnings per share to come in at $4.50 to $4.52.It had previously forecast revenue of $5.640bn to $5.740bn and earnings between $4.20 and $4.30 a share.The stock, up 52 per cent over the past 12 months, hit a record high of $194.30 earlier this month. It rose 0.2 per cent in after-hours trading.
6;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Twitter names former Intuit executive as CFO;;Twitter on Tuesday named Ned Segal, a former executive at Intuit, as its chief financial officer, taking the reins from Anthony Noto, who will remain chief operating officer.“Ned’s experience in financial operations as a public company and business unit CFO, along with his background serving technology companies and investors, are an ideal fit for Twitter as we work to extend our positive momentum,” said chief executive Jack Dorsey.Mr Segal, who most recently worked as a senior vice-president in Intuit’s small business group, will report to Mr Dorsey and oversee several areas, including the group’s finance, accounting and investor relations departments, Twitter said in a statement.The 43-year old will earn an annual salary of $500,000, a signing bonus of $300,000 and stock awards, Twitter said in a filing with US securities regulators. Mr Segal is an alumnus of Goldman Sachs, having worked there from 1996 – 2013, which overlaps Mr Noto’s tenure at the New York investment bank.Twitter added that the appointment was unrelated to its first-quarter shareholder letter that was released in April. The second-quarter results are due out on July 27.
7;INTU;Intuit Inc;2017-03-06T17:54:38Z;H & R Block, Intuit: preparer scarer;Trump’s tax simplification will not destroy tax preparation, technology might;It is the season when Americans waste hours assembling 1098s, 1099s, W2s and a myriad of other obscurely-coded documents to complete their 1040s, otherwise known as the US federal tax return.One in seven still take the mess of paperwork to H & R Block. But the tax preparer, which reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday, is in peril. President Donald Trump promises to simplify the tax code.Move to a model like the UK’s and fewer people would be forced to file a return. Most of those that do would use a free and relatively simple government software. Intuit, which makes the popular TurboTax do-it-yourself software, would also be hurt.Simplifying US tax is one of the more complicated tasks Mr Trump has set himself. He is likely to fail. H & R Block, however, faces a more intractable problem. Between the 2015 and 2016 tax seasons, assisted returns fell from 13m to 12.3m. Customers are shifting online. TurboTax users in the same period rose from 30.7m to 34.2m. H & R Block does offer software, too, but those users actually declined last year from 7.6m to 7.4m. In the past 12 months, its shares have fallen by a quarter while Intuit’s have risen by a similar amount. Barring some huge data breach or other own goal, Intuit will continue to advance — though its 9 per cent revenue growth rate is not fast enough to explain its valuation of more than 20 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. H & R Block’s best option is to be a cash cow. But it needs to arrest the decline in profit margins and slow the fall in customer numbers.There is one bright spot. Mr Trump may not bring simplicity but he is likely to deliver a lower corporate tax rate, with an aim of 15 per cent down from 35 per cent. This will be of outsized benefit to both H & R Block and Intuit, which pay effective rates of more than 30 per cent. For tax preparers, they are unusually bad at avoiding it.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
8;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Intuit shares stumble on growth concerns;Energy sector performs strongly as US oil prices approach $50 a barrel;Intuit shares fell on Wednesday, eroding much of their 2016 gains, as worries about slowing subscriber growth for the group’s online accounting software overshadowed stronger than expected quarterly results.The California-based company said the number of subscribers to its QuickBooks Online service, which allows small businesses to keep track of financials through the cloud, rose 44.8 per cent year-on-year to 1.4m in the quarter to the end of April. However, that represented a decline from the 49.5 per cent, and 56.8 per cent, growth in the previous two quarters, respectively.Investors may have been “fixated” on the cooling subscriber growth, and concerned about whether Intuit could meet its target of 2m to 2.2m QuickBooks Online subscribers by the end of the financial year ending in July 2017, said Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS. However, Mr Thill noted that he still saw the group’s goals as “very achievable”.Intuit’s hopes to shift users to its cloud-based software instead of its PC-based applications echoes many other companies in the software industry, such as Adobe, who are working to transition users to an online version of its image-editing suite.Intuit’s success has helped drive the shares about 8 per cent higher this year. However, they declined by as much as 5.1 per cent at one point on Wednesday in spite of overall results topping Wall Street estimates. It later pared some of those losses, closing down 2.1 per cent at $105.02.Net profits climbed in the April quarter to $1bn from $501m in the same three-month period in 2015. Sales climbed 7.9 per cent to $2.3bn, beating expectations of $2.26bn. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes certain items, of $3.43, also eclipsed estimates of $3.21.Tiffany shares retreated early in the day after the jewellery maker reported its steepest sales drop in nearly six years and lowered its full-year earnings guidance range.Weak tourist spending and the strong dollar were once again to blame for the weaker than expected results.“As expected, this was a difficult quarter in terms of both sales and earnings growth. We faced numerous challenges, including continued pressure from foreign tourist spending in Europe, the US and Asia, particularly in Hong Kong,” Frederic Cumenal, chief executive officer, said.For the three months to the end of April, sales fell 7.3 per cent year-on-year to $891.3m. That was the group’s sixth consecutive quarter of revenue decline and was the biggest sales drop since the second quarter of 2010. It was also well below the $915m that the market had expected.Net income for the period fell 16.6 per cent to $87.5m, or 69 cents a share — ahead of forecasts of 68 cents.Still, the company warned that it now expected full-year earnings per diluted share would drop by a mid-single digit percentage from 2015. It had previously predicted earnings to stay flat or fall by up to a mid-single digit.Tiffany shares later regained ground, ending the day flat at $63.89. The shares have fallen 16.3 per cent in the year to date.Looking at the markets more broadly, the energy sector was the top performers as US oil prices approached $50 a barrel. Devon Energy, an oil exploration and production company, climbed 5.7 per cent to $36.44, while oil major Chevron added on 1.6 per cent to $101.77.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,090.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 0.8 per cent to 17,851.5 and the Nasdaq Composite had advanced 0.7 per cent to 4,894,9.
9;INTU;Intuit Inc;2016-04-29T12:09:51Z;Bill Campbell, Silicon Valley executive and mentor, 1940-2016;A coach whose counsel was valued by Apple and Google alike;When Sheryl Sandberg started at Google, she met an older man in the lobby one day who asked what she did there. Still in her first week, she admitted she did not yet really know. “Well, you better figure it out,” he told her.Ms Sandberg rose to be a sales vice-president there before joining Facebook as chief operating officer. Her interrogator-turned-mentor was Bill Campbell, known as “Coach” — a charismatic adviser who, largely from behind the scenes, was deeply influential in shaping Silicon Valley’s largest companies.Campbell, who has died aged 75, spent two long spells at Apple and was among the few to enjoy the simultaneous trust of leaders there and at Google, which he joined at the behest of an investor in 2001. The three-year-old search company was struggling to find a business model in the wake of the dotcom bust but, recalls Eric Schmidt, its chief executive of the time, “I was pretty sceptical of having a coach”.That quickly changed. For 14 years Campbell was a constant presence at the company, attending board meetings and staff gatherings even though he was neither a director nor an employee.“He was colourful and gruff and emotive, a promiscuous hugger. He had a great big hearty laugh and enjoyed beers and board meetings at the Old Pro [a nearby bar],” says John Doerr, the investor who steered Google’s founders towards Campbell. “I thought the Coach would make them more successful. The astonishing thing about it is he ended up coaching the whole company.”William Vincent Campbell had previously been a coach in the sporting sense, leading Columbia University’s football team from 1974-79 after playing for the squad. Born on August 31 1940 in Homestead, Pennsylvania, where his father was a steelworker, he turned football into his ticket out of town.While at Columbia as a student he is also remembered for convincing his fraternity brothers to attend Roman Catholic mass at 7am — a feat for a college jock. Following his gridiron years he joined an advertising agency and then worked for Kodak. The call from Apple came in 1983 when John Sculley, newly appointed as chief executive, asked him to be its head of marketing.Campbell brought a whiff of the East Coast to the casual Apple workplace. “He wore a coat and tie almost every day,” remembers Dave Cote, who reported to him for several years as head of consumer marketing.The team-builder helped to congeal an organisation known for its strong personalities, for example by instituting a Friday beer bash after work. “For a company that was oftentimes about individual effort, this was a way to see your peers, a way to bring people together,” says Mr Cote.Though Campbell did not have a technical background — neither did Steve Jobs, his friends point out — in 1987 he set up Claris, an Apple-backed software company, which he ran for several years before it was absorbed back into the group. After that he led Go, a maker of personal computing devices including an early iPad-like product that flopped. In 1994-98 he was chief executive of Intuit, a provider of financial software.Even more than for his executive record, Campbell is remembered in the Valley for his mentorship and his deep friendships. “I quickly discovered that if I had a problem I should have a conversation with Bill, because he was trustworthy,” says Google’s Mr Schmidt.At Apple he was seen in the same way. A confidant of Jobs, Campbell joined Apple’s board when the founder returned to the company in 1997. “When things got tough for Steve, who did he call? He called Bill,” says Mr Schmidt, referring to the last years of Jobs’s life when he was suffering from cancer. “He knew that Bill loved him and would never do anything that would hurt Steve. It is a very special thing.”Campbell’s influence is still felt at Apple, which this month delayed its quarterly earnings announcement to avoid conflicting with his funeral.Usually refusing to accept payment for his counsel, he was at times critical of what he saw as a culture of wealth in the Valley where, seemingly, “being rich makes you smart” rather than the other way around.In his later years he continued mentoring and coached sports at Sacred Heart Schools even long after his children, Margaret and Jim, had graduated. They survive him along with his second wife, Eileen.“He really cared about people. That was his magic,” says Ben Horowitz, a venture capitalist who was close to Campbell. “There really is no one else in Silicon Valley who cares about other people the way that Bill did.”Leslie Hook

Mr Cruz, who admittedly has some ground to cover but is currently the closest rival to Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, has promised that working Americans will be able to file their tax returns on a postcard.It is far from the daftest policy doing the rounds and many would-be candidates have offered similar fiscal simplification. There are 140m tax returns filed in the US each year. Only a small minority file for free. Most others use either a tax preparer, such as H&R Block, or pay for software, most often through TurboTax, Intuit’s market leading application. The latter category is growing. As an Intuit executive put it last month, Intuit is about “making the pain of taxes go away, making the drudgery of taxes go away, and make it all about the money”.That last bit was supposed to refer to Intuit’s customers picking up their tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service, but it could just as well describe the software company’s business model. It provides a great product that has now embraced mobile and the cloud and that should be redundant for the majority of its customers. Other countries manage to spare a much bigger portion of citizens from filing tax returns. (The UK, for example, although it is getting worse, is still only at 10m returns and most of those file self-assessments for free). Intuit, a big spender on lobbying, has successfully argued that it reeks of big government to allow officials to calculate taxes.What will be the outcome? Is Intuit, which sponsors the English premier league’s bottom club Aston Villa, also heading for relegation? Since the company’s quarterly results in November, where executives said the stock was undervalued, paving the way for big buybacks, shares have fallen 11 per cent. It still commands a taxing multiple: six times sales. More than half of revenues come from small business accounting software, but growth there is lacklustre at best. The slightly smaller consumer tax business is the growth engine that justifies the valuation. To bet against it, you have to be for Mr Cruz and a lobbyist-resistant Congress.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
11;INTU;Intuit Inc;2015-07-22T16:59:34Z;Sage and SAP: software shake-up;Two payments companies face a common conundrum in different ways;"One serves predominantly small businesses, the other large corporations. Both UK-based Sage and Germany’s SAP face a common conundrum. Companies such as Salesforce and NetSuite are winning market share by selling subscription-based software, while users increasingly prefer remotely hosted “cloud” applications that require less internal IT support. Both trends are a threat to licence-based software that users run on their own networks.Sage and SAP are adapting to this new world in very different ways. SAP has spent big, acquiring $18bn worth of cloud-related companies since 2011. This has had a predictable impact on cloud revenues; they rose 130 per cent in the first half. But at a price. Adjusted for exchange-rate movements, operating margins fell 2 percentage points to 28 per cent and net profit dropped too — partly because of interest charges on the €10bn of debt taken on to pay for acquisitions.Sage is pursuing an internal transformation, gradually migrating customers to subscription-based products. A trading statement on Wednesday showed more sedate revenue growth; subscription revenue was up 9.7 per cent and overall revenue grew 7.5 per cent. Operating margins were maintained at 28 per cent.Subscription is the more attractive long-term business model, providing steadier and more predictable revenue and more growth opportunities. The superior growth rates and higher share price ratings of cloud-based software groups attest as much. But business transformations on this scale are tricky and entail short-term pain in return for promises of jam tomorrow.Of the two, Sage is in the stronger position. Small business customers are conservative, giving it more time to complete the transition; meanwhile, it can fall back on other self-help measures such as cost cutting to maintain profitability. It is also small enough to be a potential takeover target.There is hope for SAP, though. Adobe’s push into the cloud was painful at first, but its latest results show sales picking up strongly. Its shares have outperformed both SAP and Sage over the past three years.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Adjusted earnings of 17 cents a share topped forecasts for 12 cents.Newmont has been working to lower costs, as gold prices have fallen more than 35 per cent since a June 2011 peak. Its shares, which have advanced 37 per cent this year, climbed 4.58 per cent on Friday to close at $25.58.Deere underperformed the S&P 500, after it lowered full-year sales forecasts as lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes weighed on demand.The agricultural equipment maker, which is based in Moline, Illinois, said sales for fiscal 2015 would be 17 per cent lower than the previous year. In late November it had projected a 15 per cent drop. Profits are expected to be $1.8bn, just shy of the earlier forecast of $1.9bn.Sales declined for the fourth straight quarter, down 17 per cent to $5.6bn in the three months ended in January. Fiscal first-quarter profits fell to $387m, or $1.12 a share, compared with $681m, or $1.81 a share, in the period a year ago.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 84 cents a share on sales of $5.5bn. “Deere’s first-quarter performance reflected sluggish conditions in the global farm sector, which reduced demand for agricultural machinery, particularly larger models, and led to lower sales and income,” said Samuel Allen, chief executive.Deere shares nudged up to close at $92.43.Luxury department store chain Nordstrom advanced nearly 6 per cent to $81.74, after it said it would increase its capital expenditure plans nearly 60 per cent in 2015 as it attempts to capture consumer spending.The Seattle-based company said it would spend $1.2bn in the year to next January 31 to open more stores. The news came alongside fourth-quarter earnings that fell 5 per cent to $255m, or $1.32 a share, and missed analyst forecasts. Sales rose 9 per cent to $4.04bn, ahead of estimates.Intuit, the company behind TurboTax and QuickBooksOnline, led the S&P 500, climbing 6.16 per cent to $96.72, as it reported growth in its online subscriber base. QuickBooks subscribers rose 50 per cent in the fiscal second quarter, compared with a 43 per cent rise the previous quarter.The company, which is based in Mountain View, California, reported a narrower than expected loss of 23 cents a share, on sales of $808m that topped analyst forecasts.Uncertainty surrounding the Greek bailout crisis weighed on US stocks earlier on Friday, but the S&P 500 recovered to close up 0.61 per cent to 2,110.30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.86 per cent to 18,140.44, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.63 per cent to 4,955.97.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

14;INTU;Intuit Inc;2014-10-20T23:10:26Z;KPMG hopes cloud software will win over SMEs;‘Transformational change’ for firm’s business as it takes on rivals in a crowded market;KPMG, the audit firm that serves 24 of the FTSE 100 companies, is fighting to win business from faster-growing small and medium sized enterprises – by offering a cloud-computing accountancy service for a fraction of its normal fees.It has spent £40m to develop cloud-based software that can allow businesses to go online and prepare their accounts, do their bookkeeping, administer their payrolls, and file VAT and corporate tax returns.Iain Moffatt, head of Enterprise for KPMG, said the new service represented a “transformational change in our business”, and was aimed at the “Googles of tomorrow”. They will be charged a monthly fee starting at £150, rather than the £600 plus per hour charged by senior partners for auditing or advising larger companies.By offering these services, KPMG is attempting to take on the market leading providers of accounting software to SMEs, which include Sage, the FTSE 100 technology business, and Intuit, the US company that relaunched its QuickBooks online service last year.Sage One, a cloud-based accounting software product, costs from £10 plus VAT a month for basic accounting. Sage and Intuit sell products to accountancy firms as well.Traditionally, KPMG has focused on medium-sized and larger companies – leaving the smaller companies to rivals such as Grant Thornton, BDO and Baker Tilly.However, by taking them on directly, it is joining an increasingly crowded market for SME accounting services, as larger firms compete to sign up fast-growing SMEs.Last year, Deloitte established its “UK Futures” programme – its attempt to work with the 1,000 fastest growing SMEs in the country. PwC sponsors the private business awards while EY runs a global entrepreneur of the year programme.Grant Thornton, which has a strong focus on technology businesses, recently published a “mid-market manifesto” detailing policies to help medium-sized businesses grow.Matt Smith, of the Centre for Entrepreneurs, a lobby group, said: “Accountants are certainly moving further down the ladder to engage earlier-stage entrepreneurs.”Part of their motivation has been the slower pace of recovery at their traditional clients, according to Carl Williams, northwest managing partner of Grant Thornton. He said the bigger firms were searching for revenues after their tax and corporate advisory work reduced in the downturn. “The dynamic growth is in the mid-market,” Mr Williams argued. “The Big Four know that and have started looking for it. But they will return to the big businesses when that work picks up.”KPMG said it was hoping to win more lucrative work from SMEs, such as corporate finance advice, as they grow. It is also expanding its middle market private capital business, and plans to hire up to 50 partners and directors across the UK.Chris Hearld, Northern UK chairman of KPMG, said the firm needed to identify high-growth, or “gazelle”, companies early rather than approaching them when already established.These gazelle companies make up about 7 per cent of the UK business base but account for half of all jobs growth, according to the Nesta think-tank.
15;INTU;Intuit Inc;2014-10-20T11:41:27Z;The quiet art of being a good listener;The most persuasive strategy may be to stop talkingand start listening;"Scott Cook spends much of his time coaching and mentoring colleagues as well as overseeing product performance reviews at Intuit, the financial software business he founded. But his biggest contribution to running the business these days, he says, is knowing when to stay silent. “In the past I’d jump into discussions early, now I hold my tongue. I let those who live the product every day talk, so that I can listen.”Mr Cook – who chairs Intuit’s executive committee, and sits on the boards of eBay and Procter & Gamble – is not alone in advocating that leaders listen before they speak. “The single most undervalued and under-developed business skill”, is how Jeff Immelt, General Electric’s chief executive, has described listening – whether it is to customers, employees or others who may affect the business.A study by Columbia Business School published in 2012 found that leaders’ powers of persuasion rest as much on skilful listening as on articulacy. Yet many business people struggle to listen; and the more senior they are, the worse the effect may be. As James Heskett, emeritus professor at Harvard Business School, says: “Unless the leader is good at listening, not much listening goes on, because people watch [the boss] and emulate.”Even organisations that pride themselves on being open to ideas can develop cloth ears. Mr Cook recalls being baffled by a survey that suggested Intuit’s customers were using Quicken, its money management software, for business accounting even though it was designed for ordinary consumers. The finding seemed absurd, so he ignored it, reasoning that respondents meant they used Quicken to sort out their personal finances during office breaks.But when Intuit delved deeper − some four years later − it transpired that small businesses were indeed buying the product because, unlike professional software, it did not assume knowledge of debit and credit accounting. The discovery led to the development of QuickBooks, now Intuit’s biggest revenue generator. “Such is our tendency to find explanations that conform to our beliefs that we’ll often persist in [error] rather than accept data that confronts [our preconceptions],” he says. Mr Cook had been guilty of “confirmation bias”.One way to counteract the temptation to listen selectively is to explore any contradictions. Mr Cook says he now “savours surprises”, meaning he welcomes puzzling aberrations on the grounds that the commonsense view of the world may be telling only half the story.To thwart the mind’s tendency to suppress contradictions, Sheryl Connelly, who runs the global consumer trends division at Ford, writes down opinions with which she disagrees, sometimes adding cartoon illustrations to try to capture underlying sentiment. “The doodles help me understand what people are saying.” Another habit is to transcribe conference talks verbatim for review later. She says it levels the field for presenters who lack the showmanship to wow an audience. “When I read the notes, sometimes a point that didn’t impress me jumps out. Maybe the speaker lacked stage presence, but the notes don’t hold that against them.”Active listening often becomes harder as executives take on bigger roles. One problem is that no one tells them things they might not want to hear. Another is purely physiological: between 45 and 65 years of age, the prime demographic for board appointments, many people experience hearing loss. They may not even be aware of it, but it is forcing the brain to work harder to follow discussions, to the detriment of cognitive performance, says David McAlpine, an auditory neuroscientist at University College London.A hindrance to leadership listening is subordinates’ reluctance to speak outProf McAlpine has some tips for mitigating the effects of hearing loss. Using Skype or videoconferencing is less tiring than talking by phone, as watching people’s lips and making eye contact makes it easier to follow speech. By contrast, speed-reading wordy slides or board papers, while also straining to hear, is counterproductive because it splits the brain’s resources: “If you’re reading, you’re not listening [effectively].” One answer to hearing loss might be a hearing aid, but sufferers may be reluctant because of the potential stigma. “Wearing trendy specs won’t damage your chances in the boardroom, but wearing a hearing-aid, for some reason, is [viewed as] one foot in the grave,” Prof McAlpine laments.Another hindrance to leadership listening is subordinates’ reluctance to speak out – they do not want to appear insubordinate – so the boss ends up dominating the discussion. To counteract this, Simon Hayward, CEO of leadership consultancy Cirrus, recommends stopping to ask “telling questions” that probe for people’s thoughts, before wading in with your own viewpoint. But the tone should be respectful, as people who feel threatened often retreat into silence. Techniques that help put people at ease include “leaning forward to express interest and mirroring what people say to demonstrate understanding”.Organisations that get the point of listening “find ways of bringing people together”, says Prof Heskett. Designing workplaces with social spaces, and encouraging executives to set aside time to chat informally or simply stop and say hello, are all helpful habits that can yield unexpected dividends.That is the recent experience of Jayne Archbold, strategy director at UK software company Sage. For months, sales of some products had been struggling in one market for no obvious reason. During a visit to the regional team, Ms Archbold stopped to ask a glum looking junior manager how things were going. Over coffee, he unburdened himself about a new company policy that was creating untold problems. Formerly, salespeople had specialised in particular products; now they had to sell a whole range. The shift had been pushed through too far and too fast before the salesforce had adjusted − hence the revenue dip. “If I hadn’t said ‘let’s sit down’, the situation might have gone on for another six months, because the root cause was too operational to spot.”Having probed for ideas, how do leaders decide which to take forward?Ms Archbold says she has learnt “not to make decisions in the moment”. Allowing time – even a few hours − for reflection and taking soundings widely avoids bigger problems later.Mr Cook prefers to run small experiments and base his decision on the outcome. On one occasion two engineers proposed that Intuit should host a forum in which taxpayers could put tax queries to each other. In a survey, 80 per cent rejected the concept. The idea had few supporters internally. Yet when the idea was trialled for real it proved instantly popular. “Instead of merely listening to people’s words, we watched their behaviour,” Mr Cook says. What people say, in other words, is not always what they do. As well as listening, it is important to observe.Further reading: How to listen – Hear, hearOutsmart the brain’s biases. Humans are predisposed to listen selectively, but skilful listeners look for ways to neutralise their biases. For example, they might pay particular attention to ideas with which they instinctively disagree.Focus on one task at a time. Attempting to listen and read simultaneously – unless the tasks are synchronous, as in listening and lip-reading – divides the brain’s resources, so you do worse on both.Check your hearing. If you struggle to filter out background noise or to tell, say, an F from an S, you may have hearing loss, which will affect your ability to engage – without realising. Skype or videoconferencing can help: watching facial expression and lip movements makes it easier to follow speech.Use your eyes. Joining observation to listening provides more information and allows you to weigh what people say against what they do"

The company also settled a suit filed by the Department of Justice, agreeing not to enter into any future arrangements limiting others from competing for its employees.The settlement is the last in a string of cases brought against Silicon Valley titans – about 10 companies including Google, Apple and Intel – for suppressing wages by not allowing other companies to make offers to their employees, said Bill Baer, head of the DoJ’s antitrust division. Some civil suits by employees affected by the no poach agreements are continuing.“You can’t innovate your way around antitrust laws,” said Mr Baer. “These companies and the executives who run them are not above the law, and our lawsuits against eBay and others prove the point.”Ebay did not admit wrongdoing in either the state or federal settlement and said in a statement that it “continues to believe the policy that prompted this lawsuit was acceptable and legal”.The investigation into hiring practices revealed the close relationships between leaders of the tech world, turning up emails linking executives such as Google’s co-founders and Apple’s former chief executive Steve Jobs.In one email from 2007 that formed part of the DoJ’s case against eBay, the company’s then-chief executive Meg Whitman complained to Scott Cook, who served as chairman of Intuit’s executive committee and an eBay director, about Intuit’s continuing attempts to hire its employees despite the agreement.Mr Cook wrote in response: “#@!%$#^&!!! Meg my apologies. I’ll find out how this slip up occurred.”Some of the money eBay has paid to California will go to employees who did not receive job offers as a result of the “no poach” pact, while the state will collect $300,000 for harm it caused to the state’s economy.While the string of lawsuits around the no poach agreements had been an unusually wide-ranging investigation into Silicon Valley, they are far from the only antitrust case brought recently against tech companies.In 2012, the DoJ filed a civil suit against Apple for colluding with publishers to set the price of ebooks. While the publishers settled before trial, Apple went to court and lost, in part because of emails sent by Mr Jobs that he was aware Apple’s actions would raise the price of ebooks.The cases send “a clear signal that we’re going to put the resources necessary to bring to justice companies that disregard clear requirements under the antitrust [laws]”, said Mr Baer.
17;INTU;Intuit Inc;2014-02-21T17:14:23Z;Groupon tumbles on extra marketing costs;;Shares in Groupon tumbled at the fastest pace in a year after the company said it expected a loss in its first quarter as it advertises heavily its new online offerings, leading to a flurry of price target cuts and one downgrade.The company, which has shifted its focus away from daily deal e-mails to a service that lets consumers search for bargains online, said it would report an adjusted loss between 2 and 4 cents a share in the current quarter as it lifts its marketing budget for the new service by $25m.Groupon added integration costs for the Ticket Monster business it purchased last November for $260m, as well as investments to drive growth in its Ideeli fashion unit, would lower profits by an additional $20m.Fourth-quarter revenues rose 20 per cent from a year earlier to $768m – however, the company continued to lose money.Groupon reported a loss of $81.2m, or 12 cents a share – little changed from the same quarter a year earlier.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney downgraded the firm to underperform from sector perform and lowered his price target to $7 from $11.Mr Mahaney said he was concerned over weakness in Groupon’s US business, which he views as its key segment.“Our dramatically reduced estimates and our valuation framework point to valuation downside, North America and international billings trends are showing greater weakness than expected [and] active customer and billings per customer trends are softening,” Mr Mahaney said.Groupon shares fell 21.83 per cent to close at $8.04 in New York.Priceline shares advanced to an all-time high before slipping back to close at $1,315.67, a rise of 2.55 per cent, after the company reported a 29 per cent rise in sales in the last three months of 2013, topping Wall Street expectations.Profits advanced 31 per cent from a year earlier to $378m, or $7.14 per diluted share, as bookings of hotel stays and rental cars accelerated in the quarter and the company saw fruits from its marketing investment in Booking.com.The travel booking company said it expected a 23 to 33 per cent advance in total travel bookings in the first quarter, as well as adjusted earnings of $420m to $450m.“With accelerating growth across all segments, an improving macro environment, and the stock trading roughly in line with the group despite faster growth, we continue to believe the risk/reward in owning Priceline is amongst the most attractive in our coverage,” Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry said.Express Scripts was among the worst performing stocks on Friday after the company reported a drop in profits and said it filled fewer prescriptions in the fourth quarter.The largest US pharmacy benefits manager said profits fell less than 1 per cent to $502m, or 63 cents per share.Adjusted claims, a measure of the number of prescriptions filled, declined 12 per cent from a year earlier to 360.7m.The company said it expected to earn $4.88 to $5.00 per share in 2014 compared with forecasts for $4.93. Shares in Express Scripts declined 4.05 per cent to end at $74.00.Intuit, the accounting software firm, rose to a new record high after the firm lifted its third-quarter sales and profit outlook, which includes the crucial tax filing season in the US. The company said sales of its TurboTax software grew 7 per cent to 14m units through mid-February.Intuit now expects sales of $2.33bn to $2.4bn in its fiscal third quarter, ahead of earlier guidance for as much as $2.29bn.“This momentum, along with early-season unit growth, give us confidence we’re off to a good start,” chief executive Brad Smith said. Intuit rose 4.67 per cent to close at $77.30.Overall, equity markets drifted slightly lower, with the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite touching its highest level since July 2000, before ending the day off 0.10 per cent at 4,263.41.The S&P 500 ended 0.19 per cent lower at 1,836.25 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also shed 0.19 per cent to close at 16,103.30.
18;INTU;Intuit Inc;2013-11-28T11:54:24Z;Tech groups tap big data on small businesses to smooth financing;;As the plight of small businesses struggling to borrow money climbs up the political agenda in Europe and the US, a number of technology companies believe the solution lies in helping banks gain better access to companies’ financial data.One such company, Intuit, believes it also provides an opportunity to sell more of its QuickBooks accounting software to small businesses.The Nasdaq-listed company has signed on Capital One and Wells Fargo, two of the top five lenders to SMEs by volume in the US, to a pilot programme designed to help financial institutions get a better sense of their customers’ creditworthiness.The platform, known as QuickBooks Financing, has facilitated 400 loans worth $13m in the eight months that it has been live, and will be expanded to Canada in the next two months.“It’s very new, it’s a test,” said Jim Seitz, a spokesman at Wells Fargo. “We’re always looking for new ways to lend to small businesses.”Potential borrowers can visit the platform for free and answer 15 questions to match them to a lender. If the business is one of the 1.2m QuickBooks customers who have uploaded their back-office data to Intuit’s servers, they can give permission for Intuit’s algorithms to analyse that information. In exchange, they are likely to receive preferential rates from the participating banks.“Most small businesses borrow from their family and they’ve maxed out their credit cards,” says Intuit chief executive Brad Smith.“We’re able to go inside your small business accounting, we can look at how many bills you’ve paid on time, who owes you money, and how your cash flow looks, and we’ve been able to write algorithms that will predict your credit risk.”US banks currently mostly use credit bureaus, the small business financial exchange, as well as FICO and their own proprietary measures to determine credit scores.Richard Preece, director of the QuickBooks business, says that the product makes Intuit’s core software offering more attractive. “We’re using QuickBooks data to reduce the lender’s risk and pass those savings back on to the customer,” he says. “It clearly makes QuickBooks more valuable because it’s only by using QuickBooks that you can use this service.”He notes that the volume of loans that pass through the system may allow new relationships to emerge from the data. For example, Intuit has found that the number of vendors paid in the preceding six months is a good indicator of whether a business can pay down its loans, while the number of customers on its books is not.Intuit’s share price has risen 20 per cent since the end of June, as it has increased its focus on cloud computing and mobile applications. Its revenues grew 9.5 per cent year-on-year to the end of July 2013 to $4.17bn, while net income rose 8.3 per cent to $858m.FT writers dissect the corporate race to turn data into profitThe move is the latest sign that financial institutions and software providers are harnessing the power of cloud computing and data analytics to improve their services and minimise their risk.Earlier this year a North American subsidiary of Sage, Intuit’s British-based competitor, announced a new tool that analyses multiple data points to help businesses cross-sell to customers.But established players such as Sage and Intuit increasingly face competition from start-ups.Kabbage, an Atlanta-based start-up with operations in the UK, takes data from Facebook, Twitter and Yelp pages, as well as transaction information from online marketplaces such as Etsy, eBay and Amazon, to help determine a business’s credit profile. Kabbage worked with Intuit on QuickBooks Financing.ZestFinance, started by a former VP of engineering at Google, Douglas Merrill, says loans made on the basis of its number-crunching algorithms result in 40 per cent fewer defaults than those made using other industry scores.Intuit says it has identified around 145 different data points – such as revenue, number of customers and payments to vendors over time – that help predict credit risk better than the blunter measure of a personal credit score.
19;INTU;Intuit Inc;2013-09-02T16:01:55Z;Coaching can make trainers raise their game;For anything requiring intellectual or emotional sophistication, corporate ‘training’ is easy meat for the eye-rollers;Bill Campbell is probably too sensible to jeopardise his position in the technology sector by writing a book. But there is no guide to management I would rather read.His career began far from Silicon Valley, coaching American football at Boston College and Columbia University. At the age of 38, he switched to business. He was a sales executive and marketer at Apple, chief executive of the software maker Intuit, and for many years has advised top executives at Apple, Google and scores of venture-backed companies. He is known in his industry as “Coach”.Mr Campbell persuades managers to focus on the essential. He advises concentrating resources on a limited set of goals, and treating employees with dignity, especially in times of difficulty. He has witnessed most of the developments that can occur in his field, and can draw on a thick playbook of situations.When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, it was Mr Campbell he turned to for long, ruminative Sunday morning walks around the streets of Palo Alto. It was Mr Campbell who sat with Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and CEO Eric Schmidt, to create a unique organisation with engineers front and centre. Business is awash with executive coaches, but there is only one Coach.If there were some way of replicating Mr Campbell and offering his services at scale it would crack one of the hardest problems managers face: the growing demand for coaching over training.The corporate training industry has only itself to blame for its reputation. “Training” has come to denote whiteboard lists and cringe-inducing icebreaker exercises. It is useful in teaching new or rote skills that employees will use regularly. But for anything requiring intellectual or emotional sophistication it is easy meat for the eye-rollers. Neal Rackham, creator of the Solution Selling method, once analysed the effectiveness of sales training at Xerox and found that after 30 days employees had lost up to 87 per cent of their new skills.Coaches, on the other hand, live in the trenches with those they are trying to help, offering very particular and specific advice. Coaching can occur infrequently, during quarterly performance reviews, but ideally it happens in real time. A managerial coach is there at an employee’s shoulder, asking questions and offering observations as she gropes through live business situations.Atul Gawande, a surgeon, Harvard professor and author, believes the need for coaching increases with the complexity of a task. He uses a coach – a retired surgeon who sits in on his operations observing and taking notes – to improve his skills when he feels they have levelled out.Coaches can break down a task into its parts and find ways to improve how you do each one. John Wooden, a relentlessly winning American college basketball coach in the 1960s and 1970s, would spend the first day of each season teaching his players how to put their socks on. If you did it properly, you got fewer blisters and missed fewer practices and games. Such small things, he felt, were the seeds of success.In their new book, The Effortless Experience, Matthew Dixon, Nick Toman and Rick Delisi argue that customer service and sales managers need to coach, not train. Coaching is ongoing and bespoke, it involves the willing participation of both coach and pupil, and focuses on improvement. It can also be very quick – a probing question or word of advice delivered at the right time.Service reps and salespeople do much better, the authors found, when consistently coached. These are not the kinds of employees who have traditionally been thought to justify the high level of investment implied by coaching. But coaching them has two connected effects. It makes employees work more effectively and it forces managers to scrutinise operations in detail, where they will discover lots of small opportunities for improvement that were otherwise invisibleIf this all sounds like a lot of work, it is. It places another demand on already beleaguered managers. It requires them to reorder how they spend their time. And not all will be as good as Mr Campbell. But if the coaching fad forces the training industry to up its game, it will have served a useful purpose.philip@philipdelvesbroughton.comThe writer is the author of ‘Life’s a pitch: What the world’s best sales people can teach us all’
20;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Intuit launches mobile payments app;;Intuit, the maker of the QuickBooks accounting software, became the latest vendor to enter the UK mobile payments market on Wednesday with a mobile app and device that can take chip and pin payments.The product, called Intuit Pay, joins services from iZettle and Payleven, and will get the jump on PayPal’s new service, PayPal Here, which was announced last month but will not be available until summer.Like PayPal and iZettle, Intuit is offering the service on a pay-per-transaction basis, charging no subscription fee but taking 2.75 per cent commission on each transaction.Intuit’s launch highlights growing competition in the market for mobile payments in the UK as companies target small merchants who cannot afford the fees and commitment of more established services from banks.“Current solutions are either too expensive, demand long-term contracts or simply don’t work where businesses need them,” said Terry Hicks, vice-president of products for Intuit.As with PayPal Here, vendors can apply for the service from within the mobile app, but Intuit is taking the extra step of offering the card reader free for a limited time. iZettle’s chip and pin device costs £49 at present and PayPal has yet to announce pricing for its reader, which it said would be “competitive”.Intuit says its selling point is tight integration with its cloud accounting software, QuickBooks Online, which is popular among small businesses. In the US, the company says it already processes $37bn of payments each year through its desktop and mobile services.At the Mobile World Congress trade show last month MasterCard and Visa both announced new electronic payment systems that include a mobile element, though both companies also support payment through services such as iZettle.But chip and pin system for card payments has remained a barrier to entry for foreign start-ups such as Square, the US mobile payments company that claims to be processing $8bn in payments a year.IZettle, which launched in the UK in November with card and signature services, last month added chip and pin technology through a partnership with Banco Santander.Responding to news of the Intuit launch, Stewart Roberts, iZettle managing director, said breaking into the market would require more than just a chip and pin device.“This business is not about hardware. What makes a difference for users, and what differentiates iZettle from the competition, is we offer an easy, user friendly and secure service overall.”

He advocated the firing of Yahoo’s last two chief executives, Carol Bartz and Scott Thompson, and the exit of several board members. Mr Loeb then lobbied for the right to nominate four board members this year.He chose himself, Harry Wilson, a corporate turnround specialist, and Michael Wolf, a former MTV executive. His fourth choice was Mr Levchin.Yahoo now has 11 board members, all of whom joined this year, except for Sue James, a former accounting executive.Mr Levchin had his Silicon Valley debut as one of the founders of PayPal, the online payments company, after receiving a degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He led PayPal’s technology development through its acquisition by eBay for $1.5bn.Mr Levchin went on to found another company, Slide, which made social applications for Facebook and was acquired by Google in 2010 for $179m. He left Google after a brief stint as vice-president of engineering and is now the chief executive of HVF, a data mining company. He is also on the boards of Kaggle, a company that runs data prediction contests, Yelp, the online review site, and Evernote, the cloud-based note-taking software.Yahoo hopes to take advantage of Mr Levchin’s expertise as it tries to reframe its business to focus more on technology and pleasing products.Ms Mayer has said she will dedicate effort to Yahoo’s mobile offerings .
22;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Companies leave legislative lobby group;;"Some of the biggest US food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola, Kraft and McDonald's, have withdrawn from the American Legislative Exchange Council in protest over the conservative group's promotion of controversial laws.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also announced that it would stop funding of the group, although it will continue with its current $350,000 grant for an education project. ""We have decided that we will not make another grant to (Alec)"" said Chris Williams of the Gates Foundation in a blog post on the organisation's website.The companies are seeking to protect their reputations after Alec, a group that brings together state legislators and corporate representatives to discuss policy matters and draft model bills, supported polemic legislation such as Florida's ""Stand your ground law"" that allows people who feel threatened to shoot rather than retreat.The law is at the centre of the Trayvon Martin case in which a neighbourhood watch volunteer shot dead an unarmed teenager but was not arrested or charged until after an extended public outcry.Alec has also drafted and introduced other controversial bills such as voter identification requirements and the 2010 law in Arizona that set a crackdown on suspected illegal immigrants.Other companies announcing their withdrawals from Alec this week include Mars, PepsiCo and Wendy’s, along with Intuit, the financial and tax software company, and Arizona Public Service, the state's largest electric utility.Coca-Cola said that its membership in Alec “was focused on efforts to oppose discriminatory food and beverage taxes, not on issues that have no direct bearing on our business”. Other departing members issued similar statements.The shooting incident is causing companies to more closely examine the costs and benefits of their affiliations with organisations that take positions deemed to be controversial by consumer segments.The risk of reputational damage is high for publicly exposed companies in sectors such as fast-food and consumer goods, as these companies can make easy targets for consumer group-driven boycott campaigns via the viral world of social media.“Damage control is much more difficult than it used to be,” said Jerome Williams, an expert on consumer marketing at Rutgers University. “Once something hits social media and the genie is out of the bottle, it takes on a life of its own.”A heightened risk exists for food and beverage companies that have invested heavily in expanding their market share among ethnic minorities.Companies should be very concerned about alienating and causing a backlash among the consumers that they have worked hard to acquire, Mr Williams said.“Companies must realise the fact that identifying with a controversial group such as Alec could jeopardise their footholds with minority communities,” he said. “They must realise that they can be held guilty by association and must be more proactive and discerning about who they affiliate themselves with.”Alec’s mission is to “advance Jeffersonian principles” such as free market policies that promote innovation and job growth, and many of the departing companies originally joined the organisation because of its positions on taxation and economic matters.But divergences have arisen as Alec backed legislation strayed from the economic realm into more controversial social issues, debates that companies typically abstain from publicly.Kaitlyn Buss, an Alec spokeswoman, said that an “army of extreme leftwing special interest activists up in arms” had tried to paint the group as a front group for the conservative Koch brothers. The billionaire industrialists have funded several conservative organisations to advance their ideas, notably Americans for Prosperity, a group behind the conservative Tea Party movement.Alec’s “principles of free-market enterprise and limited government have never been more important than they are today”, Ms Buss said."
23;INTU;Intuit Inc;2012-02-23T00:33:39Z;Tech stocks fall on Dell disappointment;;Weak fourth-quarter earnings from Dell sent technology stocks lower on Wednesday.Shares in the computer maker fell 5.8 per cent to $17.15, as the company also disappointed analysts with its forecast for 2012.Richard Gardner at Citigroup downgraded Dell shares from “buy” to “hold”, advising clients not to chase shares that had rallied 24 per cent this year before Wednesday’s losses.“In general, the easy margin expansion related to PC supply chain re-engineering is behind the company, suggesting more volatility in operating margins and earnings going forward,” Mr Gardner said in a note.Dell’s larger rival Hewlett-Packard fell 1.4 per cent to $28.94. After the market closed, HP announced its own results and shares fell almost $1 more in after-hours trading as revenue missed estimates.Hard disc-drive manufacturers, whose main customers are personal computer makers, also fell.Seagate Technology was off 1 per cent to $26.45, and Western Digital fell 1.7 per cent to $39.56.Elsewhere, US stocks lost ground, with the S&P 500 index closing down 0.3 per cent to 1,357.66, as investors continued to pick over the Greek bail-out package.However, the benchmark US index remains 6 points off its post-financial crisis closing high, despite a soft turn in global manufacturing data.“Just three months ago, had such reports of a patchy outlook for growth emerged, the euro and stocks globally would have taken a spanking,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.Banks bore the brunt of the selling, with the financial sector of the S&P 500 falling 1.3 per cent, significantly more than any other.Morgan Stanley was down 2.8 per cent to $18.73, and Citigroup fell 3 per cent to $32.36.Bank of America fell 2 per cent to $7.95, with shares set to lose ground again this week, having suffered their first weekly loss of 2012 last week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 12,914.83.The transportation sector of the Dow fell 0.7 per cent and is now down almost 4 per cent for the month.“Dow theory” suggests the transportation sector is a leading indicator for the rest of the index, as transport stocks tend to feel the effect of rising energy prices first. The Nasdaq Composite index was off 0.5 per cent to 2,933.17, as Apple, which accounts for more than a 10th of the tech-heavy index’s market capitalisation, slipped 0.4 per cent to $513.04.Newfield Exploration fell 12.7 per cent to $36.88 after the oil and gas explorer missed fourth-quarter earnings expectations, and wrote down reserves.Its rival, Chesapeake Energy, fell 2.4 per cent to $24.03 despite fourth-quarter earnings almost doubling from the same period in 2010. Analysts focused on revenue, which did not climb as much as expected.Exploration and production companies are grappling with decade-low prices for natural gas, and Michael Hall at RW Baird warned on Wednesday that prices could fall to as low as $2 per million British thermal units after the mild winter.But Range Resources climbed 2.9 per cent to $66.10 as the natural gas producer saw fourth-quarter production increase 16 per cent compared to the same period in 2010.Homebuilder stocks fell despite a Bureau of Labour Statistics report that showed an increase in employment in construction in December, compared to a year earlier. Investors appeared to focus instead on sales data of existing homes, which climbed less than expected in January.PulteGroup fell 3 per cent to $8.33, and DR Horton 0.1 per cent to $13.93. Netflix fell 4.3 per cent to $112.40 after a report that Comcast will launch a rival video on-demand service.Gannett rose 4.2 per cent to $15.61, as the newspaper owner said it will raise its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 8 cents.Walmart retreated 2.5 per cent to $58.60, as investors continued to react to a decline in fourth-quarter profit for the retailer, which had seen shares fall 4 per cent on Tuesday. Shares have tested, but not broken through their 100 day moving average, which would be a bearish indicator for chartist investors.Mosaic gained 3.3 per cent to $58.80 after the fertiliser producer settled a dispute with the Sierra Club, an environmental campaigning group, allowing Mosaic to resume production at a Florida phosphate mine.Shares in Intuit, which provides business accounting software to businesses, hit an all-time high of $62.33, before closing at $60.92, for a gain of 5.9 per cent, after strong second fiscal-quarter results.Shares in Vivus surged 90 per cent to as much as $20.12 in after-hours trading, after an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted overwhelmingly in favour of approving the company’s weight-loss pill Qnexa, which would be the first new obesity drug in 13 years. The FDA is not required to follow the panel’s recommendation.
24;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T17:59:57+0000;Start-ups need better planning, poll finds;;Banks under constant fire for failing to lend to small business often complain that there are not enough suitable candidates, and a survey indicates they might have a point.The poll of 155 individuals taken during November’s Global Entrepreneurship week found a fifth of recent start-ups and 16 per cent of those aiming to launch a company did not intend to write a business plan and many did not understand basic concepts such as gross profit and turnover.Only 65 per cent of business people surveyed had a business plan while 15 per cent intended to write one. Of those wanting to set up, 37 per cent had a business plan while 47 per cent intended to write one. The poll was taken at an event for entrepreneurs seeking advice, possibly skewing the result towards the less prepared.Nevertheless, the survey also found that many entrepreneurs did not understand basic accounting terms, including gross profit (47 per cent), turnover (31 per cent), margin (19 per cent) and cash flow (16 per cent). Only 30 per cent could define all four.Just 61 per cent were aware that the VAT threshold was £73,000 and 23 per cent did not know the correct definition of VAT taxable turnover. Failing to deal with VAT, paid in arrears, is a big cause of cashflow problems and business failures.The poll was taken by Intuit, a business software provider, of those who attended the Business Startup Show at Earls Court in London on November 17.Pernille Bruun-Jensen, managing director of Intuit UK, said: “Too many businesses run out of cash, manage it badly or just don’t have the time or the skills to help themselves out of financial difficulty. “Aware of the problem, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has backed a campaign by Intuit to train more than 1,000 small businesses across the UK in good record keeping.In Yorkshire, local banks are teaming up with colleges to run short courses for executives, who would receive a certificate to present when asking for a loan, proving they had mastered the basics of bookkeeping and planning.The scheme, launched in January, could then be rolled out across much of the country by local enterprise partnerships, according to Barry Dodd, chairman of the York and North Yorkshire LEP.Take the test here
25;INTU;Intuit Inc;2011-10-26T13:00:19Z;Mint comes fresh to the iPad;;Mint, the browser-based personal finance service, has released an iPad version that takes its product to another level.The iPad seems a natural home for Mint, with the service taking advantage of its tap, pinch and swipe features to make a tour through your financial information a pleasure rather than a chore. Mint’s well known pie charts and bar graphs are displayed to best effect on the iPad’s screen and touch and pinch gestures allow the user easily to drill deeper into charts and graphs for different categories and down to the individual transaction level.Mint has waited for the release of iOS 5 this month to take full advantage of its new features, including Automatic Reference Counting for faster and smoother performance. It has completely rewritten its service for the Apple platform rather than extend it as a web app.A financial news feed has been added, personalised according to how users are spending their money. Offline access is available to downloaded data and financial views will adapt to portrait or landscape orientation. Cash transactions can be entered and geolocation data will show users in future where they are spending cash on a map.For added security, if you lose your iPad, you can visit the Mint website and delete the connection between the device and the web service.Features missing at launch that are in the web service include tracking of investments – nothing more than balances are shown at present. A 1.1 release should add features such as the ability to view financial goals and see the “Ways to Save” advice on better credit card rates and other financial deals.Mint was bought in 2009 by Intuit, maker of the Quicken personal finance software.Aaron Forth, general manager of Intuit’s personal finance group, says the iPad lends itself to families or couples discussing and exploring their finances using the app – something that is not as natural to do on Mint’s smartphone apps or the PC version.I moved from Quicken – the Windows PC client software – to Mint before Intuit bought it, preferring the browser access to my financial information and its better performance in automatically pulling in data from my accounts and saving me manually entering transactions.I still use Quicken for some accounts – it is better on showing investment performance, financial reports, printouts and exporting data.A new version of Quicken was launched this month – Quicken 2012 – with improved budgeting tools and, in a sign of the times, debt reduction planning.It would be nice to see the strengths of Mint and Quicken merged into one product, but, in the meantime, Mr Forth says the two services appeal to different demographics.“Quicken offers a lot of things Mint doesn’t offer in terms of fairly significant investment management, reporting is better and some folks are not interested in having their data in the cloud,” he says.“For Mint, it’s a lot more for newbies coming into personal finance – it’s generally younger users, a little less financially developed than the Quicken crowd – they have had less time to accumulate wealth and debt and will have simpler portfolios.”International versions are still a way off but the Mint iPad app is free and available now in the US App Store, while Quicken 2012 has five different versions, beginning at $30 for the Starter Edition and rising to $150 for Quicken Rental Property Manager.
26;INTU;Intuit Inc;2011-09-22T19:37:16Z;Stopping train to recovery makes tracks;;It is 9am and, as the Entrepreneur Express barrels through the Midlands, the party is well under way. After three rounds of “speed networking” on the 7.55 from St Pancras carrying delegates to the Made festival of entrepreneurship in Sheffield, it is time for the quiz.Oli Barrett, co-founder of Start-Up Britain, a business group that fosters enterprise, poses a question: “What single thing could government do to help entrepreneurs?”It is a good time to be asking. Mark Prisk, the business minister, is on board, working the train as he promotes the government’s attempt to boost enterprise to replace jobs being cut by the public sector.It is not so much George Osborne’s “march of the makers” but the stopping train to recovery.Once in Sheffield, Vince Cable, business secretary, still in grim party conference mood, said entrepreneurs would provide the bullets for the country to win its economic war.But some feel the banks have already spiked their guns.Rupert Lee-Browne, chief executive and founder of Caxton FX, a currency exchange service, was in Sheffield to spread his message that small companies should cut out the banks completely. His company last week launched a £4m bond, paying 7.25 per cent to retail investors annually over four years. With a minimum £2,000 investment, uptake has been “fantastic”, he said.“There is a really good message for SMEs about what we are doing. There is a political message for government to understand. They need to know what it is like at the coalface running a small business. The banks may be – just – hitting their lending targets. It is the way they are doing it is the problem.“Again and again too many businesses are being stifled because of the time it takes to get decisions made. Banks are not prepared to take any risk at all to lend to businesses.”Mr Prisk, effervescent on the platform, refused to be downcast. He said setting up his consultancy business was “one of the most important and best things I’ve ever done”. The banks would be held to rising lending targets, he said. “If you can make it now you can make it any time,” he said. “Now is the time.”However, Peter Jones, the Dragon’s Den star and serial entrepreneur who followed him on stage, was not so sure. “We don’t want to open the floodgates. If you have no experience you will fail. There is no point putting money into things that will fail.”It was important for entrepreneurs to match passion with experience, training and mentoring, he said. A BTEC qualification provided jointly by his academies and Pearson, owner of the FT, would give a good grounding, he added.Evidence to support this came in a report for Intuit, which provides accounting services for small businesses, released at Made. It found many start-ups had lax financial controls and 44 per cent of the 500 companies surveyed had come close to running out of cash at some stage.Intuit also found that 64 per cent of businesses were started with less than €5,000 so the margin for error was small and bank lending key.The festival aimed not just to inspire entrepreneurs but give practical help too. Mac, a 14-year-old business studies student from one of Sheffield’s more troubled neighbourhoods, said: “I am going to be an entrepreneur. I want to do something with organic food.”C. Simone Sutherland, who is studying Health Economics at Sheffield University, had come for advice on setting up her online art sales business. “I’ve been delaying but now I am just going to do it,” she said.
27;INTU;Intuit Inc;2011-09-07T21:35:42Z;Managing finances online;;Britain’s Northern Rock Asset Management and Bradford & Bingley were widely criticised last month [Aug] when they warned some home loan customers to stop spending money on “luxuries”. Objectors saw it as an invasion of privacy for banks to tell people they could not afford a new sofa, car, or kitchen, because such spending might mean they could not meet their mortgage repayments.But a timely reminder about the risk of going overdrawn can help avoid incurring charges, and many banking customers sign up to text message alerts to let them know when there is a danger of this.Realising that people often struggle to control their money, financial institutions are offering customers free budgeting tools. The idea is to make personal finance management so easy that many more of us will start doing it—a useful initiative in today’s climate of financial stringency.Kathleen Smith, a 29-year-old nurse living in Leeds, Yorkshire, uses Money Manager from LloydsTSB. She finds it helps her reduce her spending substantially by highlighting areas where she is frittering money, such as daily trips to the local convenience store.“I knew the monthly mortgage payments were big, but I was shocked to see how much the smaller items were adding up,” she says. Buying food daily was expensive because she was making more impulse purchases she didn’t really want or need.With few schools teaching personal finance, and many young people starting their working life in debt, free budgeting software is an ideal way for banks to make use of information they already capture on payment transactions.It also helps them build relationships with customers at a time when competition is intensifying in financial services and the reputation of banks has been damaged by the financial crisis.Money Manager, which was launched in the UK in March, is a simple to use online application developed with the participation of hundreds of the bank’s staff. It gives users a graphical onscreen dashboard to show where they are spending money and to forecast their finances for the next month.Similar functionality is available in the US from Intuit’s Mint and Pageonce’s Personal Assistant, both also free. These can extract data from your bank, credit card, investment and mortgage accounts. The packages also make suggestions, such as switching to a savings account with better interest rates, and are paid commission.Such services categorise your spending under headings such as rent/mortgage, utilities, leisure and entertainment, charity donations, health and fitness, and pets. You can set goals, track progress and see the immediate impact of splashing out on an expensive treat.Off-the-shelf personal finance software has been available for some time with packages such as Quicken, Microsoft Manager and Mvelopes. However, these require considerably more effort to use, with customers having to input a lot of information manually.This is less of an obstacle in the US, where people routinely handle their own tax, but in the UK, the pay as you earn system means most people are not used to detailed financial accounting.“I always thought I was quite good with money, and the fact that I didn’t have enough at the end of the month was because I wasn’t paid enough,” Mrs Smith says.Once she could see where the money was going, she found it quite easy to cut back, reducing the grocery bills by doing a large supermarket shop fortnightly—with food in the house she was less tempted to pop to the pub.Marketing executive Tom Phillips, 27, who lives in London, was also shocked to see how much he was spending eating out. And, surprised at his total outlay on travel, he has taken up cycling.Mr Phillips finds it useful for calculating how much he can save for holidays. “I’ve recently booked a trip abroad and want to save up to £300 a month. “It helps me make decisions about where to cut back.”Mrs Smith says being able to see the impact of cost-savings graphically illustrated on the screen creates a strong incentive. “It sounds a bit geeky, but it is satisfying to direct your spending and see at the end of the month how well you are doing against the target.” She has persuaded several of her nursing colleagues to start using it too.LloydsTSB reports good response to Money Manager with 10 per cent of online customers using it, while Mint has more than 6m users. Although banks make money when people go overdrawn, they say they have no wish to encourage financial profligacy.Ashley Machin, digital director at LloydsTSB, says: “It sounds trite, but we are trying to help customers stay in control of their finances by seeing where they are spending money month by month and what is likely to come out of their account in the month ahead.”Because of the graphical displays, most personal finance software at present works best on a PC. But smart phones and tablets are rapidly emerging as the preferred method of internet access, particularly among the younger generation.Mint and Personal Assistant are available as mobile apps, and LloydsTSB is believed to be working on one for Money Manager. As financial institutions look for more ways to get close to their customers and recover their trust, we are likely to see more.
28;INTU;Intuit Inc;2011-08-25T21:10:06Z;Wall Street falls despite Buffett’s BofA stake;;Big bank stocks rallied but the broader market sold off as Wall Street reacted to Warren Buffett’s swoop for $5bn of preferred stock in Bank of America.BofA shares, which have swung wildly during a week in which the company has been forced to publicly defend its capital adequacy, were up 9.4 per cent to $7.65.The stock had soared as high as $8.80 soon after the bell, touching levels not seen since early August, before it fell 20.3 per cent in one day, following S&P’s downgrade of US sovereign credit.Mr Buffett said he was impressed with “the profit-generating abilities” of BofA and had initiated discussions with Brian Moynihan, the bank’s chief executive, after the share price lost half its value this year on continuing concerns about mortgage-related losses.Big bank-watchers were emboldened by Buffett’s move. Citigroup was up 4.3 per cent to $29.83 and Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $16.77.Financials was the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 index, down only 0.5 per cent. But, in a reminder of the sector’s ongoing legal problems, Citigroup and Bank of America were both among the 11 banks sued by broker Charles Schwab for manipulating Libor rates by underestimating borrowing costs from 2007 onwards.Apple shares declined 0.7 per cent to $373.72 but still outperformed the market, despite the news that Steve Jobs will resign as chief executive. Mark Moskowitz, analyst at JPMorgan, said “A CEO change had [already] been partly discounted.” He reiterated his “overweight” rating, adding: “We expect the stock to be under pressure but not encounter a downdraft.”Some dissent was offered by Mike Abramsky, of RBC Capital Markets, who said Mr Jobs’ departure added “above-average risk” to his “outperform” rating.“Investors may start to fret ‘what’s next’? Can Apple – now the largest company in tech – keep its ‘cool’ and wow factor? Can they remain unassailable?”The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.6 per cent at 1,159.27, dragged down by worse-than-expected jobless claims data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.5 per cent at 11,149.90.“Bank of America and Apple are just a sideshow,” Canning Smith, manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund, said. “The BofA deal will hopefully put banks on a more even keel but markets are trading on the macroeconomic situation right now and all eyes are on Jackson Hole tomorrow.“A note by Nomura strategists Ankur Mehta and Ohmsatya Ravi predicting an Obama administration initiative to allow government-backed mortgage holders to refinance at low rates, pushed homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.8 per cent to $4.24.Shares in online property search firm Zillow also jumped 15.2 per cent to $30.25, after the company reported a profit in its first quarterly results as a publicly traded company. Zillow defied the housing market slump to post revenue of $15.8m, up 116 per cent year on year.That was welcome cheer for tech investors, after four scheduled tech initial public offerings had been put back in recent weeks due to market volatility. Zillow is now trading well above its $20 IPO price, despite recent market turbulence.But traditional commercial property manager CB Richard Ellis was down 9.2 per cent at $13.76 on the web start-up’s success. Research in Motion was off 1.2 per cent to $28.22 after announcing a new music streaming service for its BlackBerry handsets.Verizon Communications was off 1.9 per cent at $35.77 after it announced the acquisition of CloudSwitch, a cloud software provider. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Verizon also announced it would allow businesses to process credit card payments via smartphones and tablets through an alliance with Intuit. But Intuit shares dropped 2.7 per cent to $44.62.Verizon’s competitor, Sprint Nextel, dropped 6.4 per cent to $3.23, as positive sentiment, stemming from reports the network will offer the iPhone 5 later this year, ebbed.Three companies to report earnings before the bell were among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500.Applied Materials, a manufacturer of semiconductor parts, lost 4.9 per cent to close at $10.81 on quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents, exactly four times the equivalent figure for the same quarter last year, and 2 cents above most expectations.Hormel Foods, which sells ready-made food staples, was down 7.3 per cent at $26.36, despite reporting quarterly earnings per share of 36 cents a share, 4 cents higher than the same quarter last year.Patterson Companies, a medical, dental and veterinary supplies company, dropped 10.2 per cent to $26.87 after reporting quarterly earnings per share of 42 cents, 3 cents lower than the previous quarter.

The shares were down 20 per cent on the day, and off by 27 per cent for the week.Although HP reported that it topped earnings forecasts for its most recent quarter, it revised its full-year profit forecast sharply downward, from at least $4.27 a share to between $3.59 and $3.70. The company cited potential restructuring and acquisition costs, as well as slowing PC sales to consumers.Léo Apotheker, HP chief executive, is considering spinning off the computer manufacturing unit to refocus the company on software. He announced the company will pay $11bn in cash for UK-based software group Autonomy, at roughly an 80 per cent premium.Kulbinder Garcha, Credit Suisse analyst, said the Autonomy acquisition is “the correct strategy, which eventually could unlock value”. However, he said the price was very high, with HP “paying $10bn for a business that will represent between 1 and 5 per cent of revenue”. Credit Suisse reduced its 2012 earnings per share forecast for the company by 11 per cent, to $4.56.Moody’s, the rating agency, downgraded its rating outlook for HP from stable to negative, citing the acquisition, which it expects to be partially funded by debt.Dell also reported disappointing consumer sales earlier in the week. Its shares were down 5.9 per cent for the week at $14.00, though they rallied 1.7 per cent Friday after data showed Dell taking market share from HP.Overall, tech stocks in the S&P 500 index were down 8 per cent for the week, their worst one-week drop since October 2008. The Nasdaq Composite index was off 6.6 per cent for the week to 2,341.84.Positive quarterly results from Salesforce, the cloud computing company, provided no relief. The company reported earnings per share of 30 cents, one cent higher than expected.But its shares slumped 17 per cent on the week to $111. Despite robust revenue growth, Philip Winslow, software analyst at Credit Suisse, cut his 2012 earnings per share forecast for Salesforce from $1.95 to $1.76, citing ”higher expenses related to accelerated hiring, acquisitions and marketing activities”.Intuit, the business software developer, was a rare bright spot after it announced it would pay its first dividend following a strong quarter.Earnings per share at Intuit rose from $1.77 in the same quarter last year to $2. The company will pay a maiden dividend of 10 cents a share. The company was one of the leading gainers on the S&P 500, its shares up 3 per cent for the week to $43.65.After Thursday’s sell-off, on worse-than-expected results from the Philadelphia Fed business survey and a slowdown in home sales, traders were relieved on Friday that the broad S&P 500 index did not touch the year low of 1,101, set last week.Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “There is some support at 1,100. If we reach that level, some buyers will come in, but we don’t know how many. It could prove more of a speed bump than a roadblock to bears.”The broad S&P 500 index closed down 4.7 per cent for the week at 1,123.53. The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.6 per cent at 10,817.95.Although financials did not lead the sell-off this week, the closely watched KBW Bank index reached a new low for the year on Friday, marginally below last week’s low, and its lowest level since July 2009. The index was off 5.9 per cent on the week.Shares in Citigroup fell 10.3 per cent for the week, to $26.77. That is its lowest closing price since July 2009, though not below the intraday low hit last week of $26.25.Bank of America, among the leading decliners last week, outperformed the index this week, finishing the five days down 3.1 per cent at $6.97. The bank has moved aggressively to raise capital, selling non-core units such as Canadian credit cards and announcing a reduction of 3,500 staff on Friday.Merger activity helped some stocks to big gains. Motorola Mobility was up 54.7 per cent for the week at $37.87, a shade beneath the $40-a-share price Google bid for the mobile phone handset manufacturer earlier this week. Google shares were down 12.9 per cent for the week at $490.92.Sprint was up 6.9 per cent for the week at $3.43 on reports the cellular network provider could be subject to a bid too. That helped telecoms shares in the S&P 500 outperform the market, down only 0.2 per cent for the week.Other outperformers included utility shares, up 1.9 per cent for the week, and consumer staples, down only 0.1 per cent.A mixed week for retailers saw discount brands Target and Walmart up for the week after beating revenue expectations in quarterly earnings reports. Walmart rose 5.1 per cent for the week to $52.30, within touching distance of its price at the start of August, before the market slump.Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 were down 5.6 per cent for the week, led by Abercrombie & Fitch, down 19.6 per cent $56.36, a level last seen in April.Cigarette manufacturers were stronger after they announced plans to sue the government over proposed new graphic health warnings on packaging. Lorillard was up 6.9 per cent for the week at $108.62, and Reynolds American up 5.1 per cent at $35.76.

31;INTU;Intuit Inc;2011-02-23T02:20:31Z;Square cuts transaction fees;;Square is zeroing in on the dog walkers and piano teachers of the small business world by removing another price obstacle from credit card processing: transaction fees.The mobile payments company previously charged merchants 2.75 per cent of each purchase, plus a 15-cent flat transaction fee every time they used the tiny smartphone credit card reader. As of today, the company has dropped the extra flat fee.“It’s so hard to understand the fees involved in credit cards,” said Keith Rabois, Square’s chief operating officer. “You shouldn’t need a math degree to calculate your fees at the end of the month.”Square’s price slashing is not only its latest move to simplify credit card processing, but also a clear attempt to win the business of millions of entrepreneurs who only accept cash for their hair cuts and tacos. Both Intuit and VeriFone are trying to woo stylists, food truck vendors, and even girl scouts, into using their mobile credit card payment systems.Credit card fee structures are notoriously complicated, with each credit card charging different rates depending on the type of credit card used and the type of business, plus bank fees that vary depending on the size of the business. About 7 million businesses in the U.S. wade through the rules and accept credit cards, Mr Rabois said. But there are 26 million businesses that never bother.“They’re so frustrated by the financial services sector, they don’t even start,” he said.Square provides a tiny plastic device for swiping credit cards that plugs into the headphone jack of iPhones and Android phones. Customers sign on the touch screen of the phone. Merchants pay a percentage of each sale to Square, then Square navigates the fine print of all the credit card agreements.“We want to allow and enable people to start businesses from scratch,” Mr Rabois said. “That’s the American dream.”Square launched in October last year and has since had almost 300,000 people sign up for the service. Competitor Intuit still charges 15 cents per transaction for its GoPayment system, and VeriFone charges 17 cents per transaction.
32;INTU;Intuit Inc;2011-01-19T22:21:18Z;Wall St sees the light on cloud computing;Investors warm up to software trend;Stock market investors have finally been warming up to a software trend that has been more than 10 years in the making.That’s how it goes with big transitions in the underlying architecture of IT: there are many false dawns in what can appear to be inevitable long-term shifts – in this case, a new approach to information storage and processing, carried out remotely in large datacentres and delivered over the internet. The trick is not necessarily predicting what will happen next, but deciding which horse to back – and when to enter the race.So it has been with something that goes by the ungainly name of software-as-a-service (SaaS). Like many tech trends, this one surfaced under a number of different guises – application service providers was one name given to the early players, on-demand software was another – before taking its current form. Is this finally its moment?The pioneer in this market, Salesforce.com, has seen its shares jump by 70 per cent in the past year. It sells an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data. At nearly $20bn, it is now worth more than software companies such as Adobe, Symantec and Intuit – all of them much bigger and more profitable. Other SaaS names such as NetSuite and SuccessFactors have been caught in the updraft.Entrepreneurs and early investors usually blame accounting for the length of time it has taken Wall Street to get excited about SaaS.The argument goes like this: unlike traditional software companies, which book revenues upfront when they make a sale, these companies sell subscriptions – for instance, $50 a year per employee for a company that wants its sales staff to use an online application that manages their customer relationship data. Since those subscriptions often continue for years but all the costs of selling the service gets booked up front, SaaS companies can look unprofitable for many years, which makes investors cautious.That argument is hard to swallow. Sure, Salesforce only just scrapes out a profit, but its operating cash flow jumped nearly two-thirds in the first nine months of 2010. It doesn’t take a maths genius to understand the economics of this business.A more likely explanation is the length of time it sometimes takes Wall Street to get comfortable with a new market and a new business model. Like all subscription businesses, SaaS companies live or die on a handful of key measures: the money they spend finding new customers, the amount they can extract from those customers in each accounting period, and the rate at which customers fail to renew their subscription agreements and have to be replaced with new ones (known as churn).In a new market, it is not easy to tell how the dynamics of marketing costs, pricing and churn will settle down. Salesforce, which has been at this game for 11 years, spent 47 per cent of its revenues on marketing costs in the latest nine months, a higher proportion than the year before. Does that mean it is ploughing everything into growth, or that it has to spend more on marketing because the business is getting more competitive? What happens to pricing when there is a thriving market of companies vying to outsource the handling of business processes like this?Another factor is the capital investment and operational risks involved in building what amounts to a utility business. Make no mistake, these companies aim to reach huge scale. ADP, the big, boring payroll processing company that has been around for half a century, is the darling that many in this industry look up to.Start-ups, which often lack patient long-term investors and struggle to control breakneck growth, may not seem the obvious entities to which large companies would want to entrust their key data and business processes.That caution points to the other, overriding reason why SaaS has taken time to emerge as a stock market investment story. The early market has been fuelled by small businesses that cannot afford an IT department, along with departmental managers of large businesses who have enough autonomy to make decisions about how to handle non-core processes without involving the CIO. Getting to where the real money is – handling things like the financial processes and supply chains of big corporations – will take years.It’s all in the timing. Wall Street has finally decided that this is a business that’s here to stay – and that, in Salesforce, it has already thrown up at least one company that may emerge to stand alongside the big players in business software (if it isn’t bought by one of them along the way). But to live up to the new expectations they have created, it is time for the SaaS companies to prove that IT managers no longer fear the cloud.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.com
33;INTU;Intuit Inc;2010-12-21T23:54:56Z;Lucasfilm settles recruiting complaint;;Lucasfilm, the production company founded by Star Wars director George Lucas, has settled a complaint by the US Department of Justice after it was accused of agreeing anticompetitive practices with Walt Disney’s Pixar unit that restricted employee recruitment.The two companies had an agreement that “eliminated important forms of competition to attract highly skilled employees”, the DoJ alleged.Lucasfilm and Pixar, the Disney-owned company behind animated films such as the Toy Story series, The Incredibles and Wall-E, “agreed to notify each other when making an offer to an employee of the other company”, the DoJ said.The two companies also agreed, when offering a position to the other company’s employee, “not to counter-offer with compensation above the initial offer”.The naming of Lucasfilm in the DoJ complaint followed a wider probe into hiring practices at high-tech companies by the organisation’s antitrust division. Pixar was not a named defendant in the complaint, having agreed a settlement with the DoJ in September.The probe culminated in Google, Apple, Adobe Systems, Intel, Intuit and Pixar promising to eschew blanket deals not to poach staff for the next five years.The DoJ’s antitrust division on Tuesday filed a civil antitrust complaint in district court for the District of Columbia, along with a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the Lucasfilm lawsuit.“The agreement between Lucasfilm and Pixar restrained competition for digital animators without any pro-competitive justification and distorted the competitive process,” said Christine Varney, assistant attorney-general in charge of the DoJ’s antitrust division. “The proposed settlement resolves the department’s antitrust concerns.”Pixar and Lucasfilm have a long history together: Ed Catmull, Pixar’s president and co-founder, was working for George Lucas when he first met John Lasseter, the chief creative officer of Disney and Pixar.Mr Lasseter, who directed the first Toy Story film, joined Lucasfilm’s computer division in the early 1980s, working on the unit that would eventually become Pixar. The unit was acquired by Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, for $10m in 1986 and bought by Disney for $7.4bn in 2006.Since then it has become Disney’s main creative engine: Toy Story 3 recently became the highest-grossing animated film ever made, passing $1bn in worldwide ticket sales. Disney has high hopes for the film at next year’s Academy Awards and is working on a big marketing campaign aimed at raising awareness among the 6,000 voting members of the academy.
34;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

36;INTU;Intuit Inc;2010-12-01T18:29:02Z;Sage unveils top-level reshuffle;;Sage’s new chief executive said he was eyeing bolt-on acquisitions as he revealed a new management line-up designed to add “vigour” to the business software group as it emerges from the downturn.Speaking as he delivered full-year pre-tax profits ahead of forecasts, Guy Berruyer said that while small and medium-sized companies had been slow to emerge from the downturn, Sage was “seeing some signs of improving markets” for its 6m customers and was “cautiously optimistic” about the outlook for 2011.Newcastle-based Sage has been one of the steadiest UK technology stocks, but growth during the downturn was lacklustre and analysts have criticised the group for being slower than rivals such as UK-based Iris Software and Intuit in moving from selling off the shelf products to a software-as-a-service model.Mr Berruyer, who succeeded previous chief executive Paul Walker in October, said he was focused on improving Sage’s margins and would be investing in higher growth initiatives. Sage would also improve its web offering and drive its North America operations, where revenues had fallen, he said.As part of efforts to “energise” Sage, Mr Berruyer has reshuffled his management, giving two Sage stalwarts, who had been in the running for the job of chief executive, enhanced roles.Paul Harrison, chief financial officer, will be given additional responsibility for mergers and acquisitions. Paul Stobart, head of the UK and Ireland operations, will add Germany, Poland and Switzerland to his existing portfolio.However, Sue Swenson, chief executive of North America, will retire and be replaced by Pascal Houillon, head of Sage France.Sage, whose software helps companies manage their finances and payrolls, has bought South Africa’s Netcash for £8.5m.However, it pulled out of an auction in the summer to buy Italy’s TeamSystem, which went to private equity firm HgCapital for €565m (£475m).Mr Berruyer said TeamSystem was not the right move for the group. He said Sage, which has at least £300m to spend on deals, was focused on bolt-on acquisitions that could take it into new countries, add complementary products or accelerate its web-based solutions.Sage on Wednesday reported pre-tax profits for the year to September of £319.9m, up 20 per cent from £267.4m in 2009, on flat revenues of £1.44bn. On an underlying basis, stripping out the affects of foreign exchange movements, pre-tax profits rose 14 per cent to £356m.Earnings per share were 17.29p, up from 14.46p last time, and Sage said it would propose a final dividend of 5.22p, bringing the full-year pay-out to 7.8p (7.43p).The shares closed up 5 per cent at 271p as investors were cheered by signs of a pick-up in the second half, strong operating cash flow and a better than expected fall in debt levels to £220m.
37;INTU;Intuit Inc;2010-11-19T20:30:37Z;FTSE 100 turns negative for first day in three;Software maker Sage Group leads London lower;Sage Group led London lower on Friday as the FTSE 100 turned negative for the first day in three.The software maker lost 3.1 per cent to 261p after Intuit, its main US competitor, accused Sage of using aggressive discounting.Intuit said its market-leading Quickbooks accounting software was losing market share to Sage’s Peachtree package because it was being undercut on the retail market. Intuit, which has been concentrating on moving customers online, added that its own attempts at discounting had not been successful.The comments raised concern that Sage’s profit margins may disappoint when it posts full-year results on December 1.Sage shares were also hit by gossip that the group’s new chief executive, Guy Berruyer, could be planning a large acquisition. Possible targets might include Ingenico, a French payment processing group valued at about £1bn, traders said.Irish uncertainty remained the drag on the wider market. The FTSE 100 slid 0.6 per cent, or 35.88 points, to 5,732.83, giving the index a 1.1 per cent decline for the week.Miners and oil stocks followed commodity prices lower on Friday after China tried to limit inflation by tightening its banking reserve requirement for the fifth time this year. ENRC fell 1.8 per cent to 910p and Xstrata was down 1.5 per cent to £13.19.BP slipped 0.6 per cent to 435¾p as a weaker oil price countered speculation that the group would reinstate its dividend at its next set of results. DNB Nor analysts forecast an 8 cents a share pay-out at BP’s full-year numbers due February, rising to 10 cents for the following quarter.Asia-focused banks were also hit by China’s tightening, with Standard Chartered off 2.7 per cent to £18.03 and HSBC losing 1.4 per cent to 657½p.Chip designer Arm Holdings rose 3.9 per cent to 385p after management flagged up possible share buy-backs at a Barcelona industry conference.Autonomy rose 1.2 per cent to £14.16 after UBS reported back from a meeting with Mike Lynch, chief executive of the search software maker. “Demand continues to grow for meaning-based solutions and that customer decision-making seems more predictable now after increased volatility at the end of the third quarter,” the broker said.A retread of bid speculation helped lift Reed Elseveier by 1.2 per cent to 535½p in the wake of Thursday’s uneventful trading statement from the publisher. Dutch peer Wolters Kluwer was, as usual, mooted as a possible bidder.Engineer GKN climbed 1.1 per cent to 193¾p, taking its gain for the week to 10.5 per cent. Analysts pinned the strength on car sales data and recent stake-building in Gildemeister, a German competitor of GKN, by Japan’s Mori Seiki.Capita, whose trading update on Thursday showed sales deteriorating sharply in the second half, lost a further 1.9 per cent to 677p.“The prolonged hiatus in revenue growth, coupled with frustratingly poor visibility on the timing and extent of future growth opportunities, suddenly make 16 times earnings look decidedly racy for a business that is in the process of seeing its top line shrink by about 10 per cent,” said HSBC, which moved to an “underweight” rating on Capita shares. “If growth is not restored in coming quarters, the market will begin to pose the uncomfortable questions.”Rolls-Royce lost 1.9 per cent to 592p after Thursday’s investor seminar on its marine business shed no further light on the blowout this month of one of its Trent 900 jet engines. “It does not seem the root of the problem is known, only its location,” Credit Agricole said.Among mid-caps, Lamprell rose 6.4 per cent to 314p as brokers, including Liberum, said the reaction to Thursday’s profit warning had been too severe.Faroe Petroleum dipped 2.8 per cent to 173¾p after announcing a £60m share sale that will see Scottish & Southern Energy emerge with a 5 per cent stake.A large chunk of the cash raised will be used to add further wells to Faroe’s drilling programme in the North Sea and Norway.“The company is putting in place its drilling programme for 2013, which should cover five exploration and appraisal wells,” said Panmure Gordon. “Additionally, Faroe will be in a position where it can take larger interests in wells, allowing shareholders greater leverage.”Lavendon, the equipment rental company, edged up 1 per cent to 80p amid talk that it had rejected a take-over approach of about 90p per share. Analysts said Lavendon would be a good geographic fit for a US-focused group such as Ashtead, down 0.6 per cent to 128p. Frank Timis’s African Minerals improved 2.2 per cent to 424p in spite of a further delay to its $1.5bn investment deal with Shandong Iron & Steel.The Chinese company has yet to complete due diligence on the Tonkolili iron ore project in Sierra Leone, although Mr Timis is confident that the deal will be completed in the next couple of weeks.Regal Petroleum lost 5.2 per cent to 13¾p following Ukraine’s move to raise its royalty tax on oil extraction by 40 per cent starting January 1 2011.Leni Gas and Oil added 1.6 per cent to 3p after the explorer appointed Neil Ritson as its chief executive. Ritson held the same position at Regal Petroleum and founded Vanguard Energy.
38;INTU;Intuit Inc;2010-09-25T00:10:02Z;Tech firms agree to halt anti-poaching deals;;Two of the world’s leading technology companies – Google and Apple – agreed to halt employment practices that restricted each other and additional companies from recruiting their employees, the US Department of Justice said.Google, Apple and four other technology companies settled a DoJ lawsuit by promising to eschew blanket deals not to poach staffers for the next five years. The lawsuit was filed on Friday alongside the settlement, which will need a judge’s final approval.According to the complaint by the antitrust division, senior executives at the companies distorted competition in the high tech sector by agreeing not to recruit each others’ employees by arranging multiple “do not cold call” lists.The DoJ said that “cold calling” – in which a company makes contact with another firm’s employee who has not applied for a job – was a “particularly effective method” of competing for computer engineers and scientists because the employees might not respond to other kinds of recruitment.Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the companies have agreed not to engage in broad no-solicitation deals. Narrower arrangements must be limited in scope and duration and shown to regulators on demand. The settlement does not include a fine.The antitrust division said the agreements between Apple and Google, Apple and Adobe Systems, Apple and Disney’s Pixar, Google and Intel, and Google and Intuit, depressed salaries in theory.According to the DoJ’s complaint, Apple’s agreement with Google began in 2006, when the companies’ executives reached “an express no cold call agreement through direct and explicit communications”.Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich said his company’s deals grew out of technology partnerships that could have been damaged by over-eager recruiting. He said that many employees at the partner companies who sought jobs at Google still got them.The agreements were not limited by geography, time, job function or product group and employees were not alerted to the arrangement, the DoJ said. It alleged that Apple complained to Google in Febuary of 2006 and March 2007 that the internet giant was attempting to recruit individuals and in both cases, Google investigated the matter and reported back to Apple.“The agreements challenged here restrained competition for affected employees …and distorted the competitive process,” said Molly Boast, deputy assistant general in the antitrust division.The DoJ said its complaint arose out of a larger, ongoing investigation into employment practices. Other companies who had been subjects of the antitrust probe, including Microsoft, IBM and Yahoo.,said on Friday that they had been told they were no longer a focus. Genentech said it believed it was also in the clear.
39;INTU;Intuit Inc;2010-07-16T06:54:29Z;Sage names head of Europe as new CEO;;Sage, one of the UK’s largest software companies, has named Guy Berruyer as a successor to Paul Walker, chief executive, who is stepping down after 16 years.Mr Berruyer, a 59-year-old French national, is chief executive of Sage’s mainland European operations, having joined the accounting software company in 1997. He is also responsible for the group’s Asian operations.He was chosen for the position over a number of other Sage executives, including Paul Stobart, head of the UK operations, and Paul Harrison, chief financial officer.There is likely to be some concern among investors that Mr Harrison, who has been a prominent “face” of the company alongside Mr Walker, will not want to stay on at Sage having missed out on the top job.Analysts said that appointing a Frenchman to head up the Newcastle-based company was a natural progression for a group that has become increasingly international through a series of acquisitions over the past 16 years. More than 80 per cent of the company’s revenues come from outside the UK.Mr Berruyer also has a strong background in the IT industry, having worked at US software company Intuit, and Bull, the French software group.“There was some concern that Sage was a company run by accountants for accountants, and was missing the pizzazz of the software sector. Guy Berruyer will be able to strike the happy balance of bringing in some changes while still understanding the Sage culture,” said George O’Connor, analyst at Panmure Gordon.Mr Berruyer takes the reins at Sage at a turbulent time, with investors looking for strategic changes at the business after lacklustre growth since the recession.Sage has long been one of the UK’s steadiest technology stocks, outperforming the market. But in the year to September 30 2009, underlying sales fell 4 per cent to £1.44bn, and recent interim results showed signs of stabilisation but not upturn.In contrast, rivals such as Visma of Norway, a Sage acquisition target in 2006, reported organic growth of more than 7 per cent in the first quarter of the year.Sage has fallen behind rivals in key emerging technology areas, such as offering software as a service to customers rather than the traditional off-the shelf software that customers load on to their own computers. Many shareholders are hoping that new leadership will be able to take decisive action to catch up.In the US, Microsoft and SAP have targeted the top end of Sage’s market while Kashflow and Netsuite have targeted smaller potential customers.Anthony Hobson, Sage chairman, said in a statement Mr Berruyer was well qualified to lead the group with his international experience, market expertise and proven record of delivering innovative software and services.

Research by YouGov for Small Business Britain, which is backed by Intuit UK, an accountancy software company, revealed that 40 per cent want to see a reduction in employers’ national insurance contributions.Over 45 per cent said they wanted banks to offer better rates to smaller companies, and 35 per cent called for interest rate cuts to be passed on in full.Mark Bachelor, managing director of Markman OTW, a business leadership specialist, said: “Small businesses have been recognised by government as the critical force that will drive the UK back to prosperity. However, it will be up to the government to see whether we get the practical support we need.”

43;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T17:05:36+0000;Sage sees flat year for small business;;Sage, the UK’s largest listed software company, sees no signs of recovery among its small business customers and expects revenue to be flat in 2010.The downbeat forecast comes after a year in which its software sales fell 16 per cent as cash-strapped customers held off buying new licences.Paul Harrison, finance director of the accountancy software group, said: “We have seen some stabilisation in the market, but our customers are not talking about green shoots yet. They remain cautious.”With 6.1m mainly small and medium-sized customers, Newcastle-based Sage is a bellwether of small business sentiment.The fall in software sales was partly offset by growth in services – such as help-line subscriptions – but overall underlying revenue was still down 4 per cent for the year to September 30, at £1.44bn. Services account for 65 per cent of sales and have so far helped insulate Sage from the worst of the downturn.Paul Walker, chief executive, said he expected no revenue growth in 2010 and that it could be 2011 before smaller companies started to lift spending. Sage has added 245,000 new customers in 2009, compared with 304,000 a year before.Rivals SAP, Dassault and Intuit have seen similar falls in new licence sales but Sage has been one of the poorer performing software stocks in the FTSE. It is almost 30 per cent below the average for the FTSE 350 software and computer services index. Its shares rose 2.5 per cent to 220p on Wednesday, however, as the results met expectations.Sage cut a further 300 jobs in the second half, bringing its total for the year to 1,000 and creating annual savings of £53.9m.It also said that it was creating more software products to be delivered over the internet. Sage has been sceptical of the appetite for software as a service among its small business clients and withdrew its SageLive product this year after operating problems. However, SageLive is due to be re-released next year.On a statutory basis pre-tax profit rose 11 per cent to £267.4m, flattered by sterling’s weakness. Earnings per share rose from 12.69p to 14.42p. Underlying profit fell 2 per cent to £307.5m after a £26.4m restructuring charge. The total dividend rises 3 per cent to 7.43p via a 4.93p final.
44;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Levinson resigns from Google board;;The close boardroom ties between Google and Apple were loosened further on Monday as Art Levinson, a director of both companies for five years, quit the board of the internet group with immediate effect.His departure comes amid a Federal Trade Commission inquiry of the board-level links between the two companies.Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, resigned his position on the Apple board two months ago, after earlier saying that he had no intention of giving up his seat as a director.In spite of the end of direct boardroom overlap between two of Silicon Valley’s most influential companies, the two still enjoy some un­usual high-level links. Former US vice-president Al Gore and Intuit chairman Bill Campbell both continue to sit on the Apple board while also serving as senior advisers to Google.The competition between the two companies made it inappropriate for them to remain advisers to Google, said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “Their legal obligation is clearly to Apple,” he added. “They have to choose their loyalties.”Google confirmed that both men remain advisers to the company, but refused to comment further on their role.Apple referred questions about their involvement to Google.The abrupt departure of Mr Levinson signals an apparent change of heart at the search company in recent days.Less than two weeks ago, Mr Schmidt said that he did not believe Mr Levinson, a former chief executive of Genentech, needed to give up his directorship at either company.Mr Schmidt argued that the businesses in which Google and Apple have overlapping interests generate revenues that fall below the threshold for antitrust concerns.In a brief statement from Google, Mr Schmidt gave no explanation for the change of direction.“Art has been a key part of Google’s success these past five years, offering unvarnished advice and vital counsel on every big issue and opportunity Google has faced,” he was quoted as saying. “Though he leaves as a member of our board, Art will always have a special place at Google.”Until August, Mr Schmidt had argued that limited competition between Apple and Google should not force the two companies to unwind their close connections, in spite of the regulatory enquiry.He said that he excused himself from Apple board meetings where mobile issues were discussed. He later stepped down from the Apple board after Google announced plans to create its own computer operating system, Chrome OS.News of Mr Levinson’s departure from the Google board came in the wake of the Federal Communications Commission’s decision to launch a further enquiry into the internet company. Last week, the regulatory body asked for more information about the workings of its Google Voice service. That followed a complaint from AT&T, which said that Google Voice did not connect callers to some services which charge a high connection fee, in contrast to traditional telecommunications companies which are required to make connections to all services.Job Leibowitz, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said later that the agency had now ended its investigation, and commended the companies for ”their willingness to resolve our concerns without the need for litigation.”
45;INTU;Intuit Inc;2009-09-16T22:52:06Z;TC50 start-ups are flickering beacons of success;;It gets harder trying to spot the next big thing, especially when you can’t see the start-ups for the upstarts among the hundreds of pitches being made at TechCrunch50 this week.In the end, the judges of this tech jamboree of new ideas in search of funding chose RedBeacon – a local service started by former Google employees to hook up plumbers and painters with customers – as winner of the $50,000 top prize.RedBeacon’s success follows that of Yammer a year ago, although the Twitter clone has yet to reach critical mass, and Mint.com, two years ago. The personal finance service announced on the opening day of TC50 that it had been bought by Intuit for $170m.Other favourites of the judges were Citysourced – a pothole-reporting service, Threadsy and AnyClip, who were named as the three runners-up.Although all have their uses, none of the services struck me as likely to change the world in the way a Google or Facebook has done.I have signed up for Threadsy, which is like TweetDeck in aggregating status updates from Twitter and Facebook, but also integrates email accounts, so users can keep track of all their messages in one window.This unified approach is attractive, but maybe not that desirable in the browser – I prefer having a dedicated email page like Gmail with its greater functionality. Deleting messages in Threadsy did not delete them in my Gmail inbox, so the beta product clearly needs more work.AnyClip won the admiration of the judges with its promise of “any moment from any movie ever made” and it certainly looked a slick site as quotes were typed in from Annie Hall and The BigLebowski and the search engine produced and played the relevant clips.However, AnyClip admitted it had only indexed 300 movies to date and would need to win the support of all the major movie studios to succeed – no mean task.One service that impressed me, but was met with indifference by the judges, was Crowd Fusion. This free content management system could empower thousands of amateur bloggers and transform their designs and content with its elegant structured database.Brian Alvey, chief executive, said his open source model was imitating that of MySQL and if he could achieve the same outcome – MySQL was bought by Sun for $1bn last year – his is likely to have been the most successful start-up on show.On the hardware side, I liked iTwin – a double-ended USB key that someone buys, breaks in two and sends one half to a friend, relative or business associate.When both USB keys are plugged in, files can be shared securely between two computers anywhere in the world over the internet, as if the two halves of the device are joined by an invisible cable.This makes it easy enough for your grandmother to be able to share large files such as videos and family photo collections.The Singapore start-up may be charging too much for the device – it wants $99, while a Best Buy representative at the conference suggested it should sell for $25 – $30.It also faces competition from an increasing number of services that make exchanging large files easier.As well as the YouSendIt and Drop.io web services, Pogoplug allows users to plug in an external USB drive into a router, allowing themselves and others to transfer and even view and play files remotely via its website or through an iPhone app.Seagate announced a dock for its FreeAgent external drives today that is Pogoplug-enabled, with a free one-year subscription to the service.The DockStar has three additional USB ports allowing four drives to be connected at once. It sells for a recommended price of $100, with the Pogoplug subscription renewable for $30 a year.
46;INTU;Intuit Inc;2009-08-21T20:27:50Z;Wall Street surges to record highs for year;;US stocks rallied to new highs for the year on Friday after early optimism from Europe was boosted by signs of a US recovery.An unexpected jump in the sales of existing homes fuelled the market’s best day since late July, which was initially sparked by figures showing the German manufacturing and service sectors expanded.This gave investors further confidence that the recession is ending, after figures earlier in the week showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region and manufacturing in the New York area both rose impressively last month.Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave those hopes further credence when he told a conference: “The prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good,” although he admitted such growth may be sluggish.“We have had good signs this week on manufacturing and housing, as well as in key export markets such as the eurozone,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. “But of course, we are still missing the consumer, and that is the big problem.”The European data helped oil rise to a price not seen since last October.This fed into energy stocks, with Chevron rising 1.6 per cent to $69.73 and ExxonMobil picking up 1.9 per cent to $69.92.Metals stocks also showed strength as they extended recent gains made on the back of firmer commodity prices. Freeport McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, advanced 4.6 per cent to $65.06. US Steel picked up 2.6 per cent to $44.86.Homebuilders then joined those sectors at the forefront of the buying after the housing data, with Lennarrising 3.2 per cent to $14.52 and DR Horton climbing 3.4 per cent to $12.66.Financial stocks continued their recent winning run, with Citigroup building further on the 66 per cent rise in its share price since late July with a gain of 4.9 per cent to $4.70.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $17.46 and Wells Fargo climbed 1.7 per cent to $27.94.The rally took the benchmark S&P 500 to new closing highs for the year, up 1.9 per cent up at 1,026.13.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7 per cent to 9,505.96 and the Nasdaq rose 1.6 per cent to 2,020.90.This put the gloss on what turned out to be a positive week for the stock market, which took the S&P 2.2 per cent higher, the Dow up 2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.8 per cent better off.Friday marked the fourth straight positive session, following a sell-off on Monday after a big drop in Chinese equities.Wall Street soon gained its composure, however, with investors focusing on the positive economic news rather than more worrying data showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits unexpectedly rising.`“There has been a recent acceleration in the economic recovery, said Stanley Nabi, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. “The question is, is this a temporary turnaround and will there be a relapse, or is this for real?”Companies also continued to report encouraging earnings, and clothing retailer Gap rose 3.3 per cent on Friday to $19.48 after investors shook off disappointing sales and focused on rising profits .JM Smucker, which produces jam and peanut butter, also beat estimates, helped by stronger sales and improving profit margins. Its shares rose 4.3 per cent to $54.10.Salesforce.com, which makes software for managing customer data, jumped after reporting stronger quarterly revenues than expected.Its shares rose 16.2 per cent to $53.67.But businesses are apparently less willing to buy tax preparation software, with Intuit, which produces such software, saying continuing economic weakness would mean lower full-year profits than previously forecast. The shares fell 7.2 per cent to $28.62.

The benchmark – which was offline at 1.15pm for about half an hour – had peaked at 4,790.18 in early trading.For the week, the index was down 0.4 per cent.The unexpected decline in US consumer confidence left HSBC among the sharpest fallers on Fridya with the bank losing 2.8 per cent to 650p. Prudential, which also has large US operations, retreated 2.6 per cent to 516p.British Land was the day’s main talking point amid continued takeover speculation. Its shares rose 3.9 per cent to 512½p.A group of investors looking at real estate in the UK was said to have made inquiries to bankers about whether a bid for British Land would be plausible.It is thought the talks were informal and came to nothing. Credit Suisse was reported to be involved.Morgan Stanley, British Land’s house broker, was cautious on the speculation.It said that while take­overs in the sector in the past two decades had averaged 12 per cent below net asset value, the rumoured price tag for British Land would require a premium of 64-92 per cent.Taking British Land private would also cost the group its Reit tax break, the broker noted.Nevertheless, the tale underpinned sector peers. Hammerson was up 1.7 per cent to 414¼p, Liberty International rose 1.7 per cent to 487¾p and Land Securities was 0.7 per cent firmer at 631p.ENRC led the miners lower, losing 5.6 per cent to 807p after chairman David Cooksey stepped down to concentrate on his new role chairing UK Financial Investments, which manages the government’s stakes in rescued banks.The rest of the sector was weak with Xstrata 3.1 per cent lower at 782¾p and Randgold Resources down 2.4 per cent to £35.48.Kazakhmys eased 0.3 per cent to 897½p even after Goldman Sachs added the Kazakh group to its “conviction buy” list as a play on rising copper prices.Platinum specialist Johnson Matthey lost 2.5 per cent to £14.11 after UBS cut its rating to “sell” in a note arguing that valuations across the chemicals sector were looking stretched.Ahead of full-year results next week, Diageo was up 0.8 per cent to 934p on reheated speculation that the drinks group could buy majority partner LVMH out of their Moët Hennessy venture.Dealers were cautious of the gossip, which some linked to a large foreign-exchange trade at the end of last month. Diageo was keen to take control of Moët Hennessy, but LVMH would not welcome any proposal, they said.Carillion, the engineering group, edged up 1.4 per cent to 287½p amid rumours of a large deal with BT to provide infrastructure services.BT, up 0.9 per cent to 134¼p, has long been suspected of investigating ways to slim its heavily regulated Openreach division, which employs about 25,000 engineers.Taylor Wimpey led the housebuilders higher, taking on 6.7 per cent to 43p after RBS added the stock to its “buy” list.Sterling Energy was squeezed higher by 18.6 per cent to 3¼p on short covering after it confirmed plans to raise £62.5m with a share issue at 1.3p apiece, writes Bryce Elder.Michael Kroupeev, the investor said to have played a key role in the sales of Emerald Energy and First Calgary Petroleums, subscribed for stock that will give him a near-30 per cent stake in the group.African Minerals, the Sierra Leone iron ore miner run by Frank Timis, drifted 3.5 per cent to 333p after it posted a narrowing of interim losses. The stock has jumped more than 50 per cent in two months amid talk that a large miner such as ENRC is interested in taking a stake.Findel, the mail order group, rebounded 13.2 per cent to 43p after it completed a placing and open offer to raise £80m. Rumours of takeover potential helped spur investor interest.Takeover chatter also helped Renovo, the biotechnology group developing anti-scarring treatments. It added 8.2 per cent to 29¾p on talk of interest from two parties.Cinema operator Cineworld slipped 0.3 per cent to 149p on caution ahead of its interim results next week, though some dealers believe the figures could be better than feared.Media distributor Dawson Holdings, which recently put its consumer unit into administration, jumped 39.3 per cent to 9¾p on a brighter-than-expected trading update.GoIndustry DoveBid dropped 23.8 per cent to 2p after the auctioneer dismissed takeover rumours and said it was looking at a discounted share issue.
48;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Self-help is key to survival, say businesses;;Many small businesses that have survived the recession so far believe they have done so because of their own grit rather than outside help, according to a study.Three quarters of the companies interviewed by Intuit UK, a business software provider, said their survival was broadly speaking down to them alone.Richard Lacey, who five years ago set up R&A Electrical, an electrical contractor, estimates that he has lost about £7,000 through late or non-payment by customers who have gone bust because of the economic downturn.“I turned to a debt collection agency to try to recover the money and manage my cashflow. However they were unsuccessful,” he said.Lacey was able to keep trading and avoid any redundancies at his Buckinghamshire-based business, by cutting his own pay.Others have found outside agencies useful. Kerry Swinton runs Teeny Beanies, which produces character beanbags and other gifts from its base in Telford.When the credit crunch hit, Swinton was finding it difficult to persuade people to buy her beanbags, which sell for £25 a time. “I had many people saying how nice the designs were and how their kids would love them but just how they couldn’t justify spending that much money on a beanbag,” she said.Swinton sought the help of Business Link and the Federation of Small Businesses, which advised her to keep stock levels low, only turning to hired help when necessary and making items to order.Since then, she has cut costs by bargaining harder with suppliers and buying in bulk. She has also more than doubled sales in the past year. “It shows that there is money out there, it’s just a matter of getting it,” she said.The economic impact of business advisers has been difficult to pin down, partly because companies that seek advice are often different to those that do not.However, research by academics from Aston, Warwick and Kingston University business schools in 2007 found that companies assisted by Business Link had higher employment growth than those that had not used the service.Business Link notes that about 90 per cent of those asked are satisfied with its service.

IBM already offers SSD on its x86-based System x servers.Dell goes to schoolThe Latitude 2100 netbook is Dell’s attempt to crack the education market. It has a ”student rugged” design, a 10-inch screen and is based on Intel’s Atom chip. It comes in a selection of bright colours – Schoolhouse Red anyone? – and with a choice of Windows XP, Vista or Ubuntu operating systems. SSDs and touchscreens are offered as options and so too is a keyboard with antimicrobial protection. Yeugh.

It climbed 8.1 per cent to 31.39, its biggest daily rise since April 20.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.7 per cent at 888.33, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 per cent to 8,292.13 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.9 per cent to 1,695.25.“The uptrend was broken a week and a half ago. It may feel like a major pull back but when you think that we rallied from 660 [on the S&P], it doesn’t look so big,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Regional banks performed particularly badly, with three of the largest selling new shares to boost their capital positions.Regions Financial fell
16.2 per cent to $4.10 after the company priced the stock sale announced on Wednesday at $4, an 18 per cent discount to Wednesday’s closing price.Meanwhile, Fifth Thirdwhich the government said needed an extra $1.1bn to survive a severe recession, filed to sell $750m worth of new shares. The stock lost 9.9 per cent to $6.95.Huntington Bancshares also said it would issue new stock in an effort to raise $675m in “capital actions”. The shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $4.30.Three companies that provide technology to businesses all beat analysts’ estimates, giving a generally positive snapshot of how corporate America is faring compared with expectations.Intuit saw sales of its TurboTax tax preparation programme boost revenues and lift earnings above predicted levels. Its shares gained 8.1 per cent to $27.27.Meanwhile, Computer Sciences saw its profits more than double, even as revenue fell, helped by tax benefits. The shares climbed 7.5 per cent to $39.95.NetApp also beat earnings estimates and the stock rose 3.1 per cent to $17.88. The company also announced it would buy Data Domain, its rival data storage company, for $1.5bn. Shares in Data Domain surged 34 per cent to $24.There were some positive signs on consumer activity as Limited Brands and Hormel Foods reported better earnings than expected.Limited Brands made a surprise profit, and raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 0.9 per cent to $11.76. The company, which owns the Victoria’s Secret underwear line, said cost cuts had mitigated the impact of falling sales.Hormel Foods, which owns Spam and other food products, also beat analysts’ expectations with higher profits. The company said customers were choosing to eat at home rather than restaurants, which helped stabilise revenues. The shares gained 2.1 per cent to $33.65.But Gamestop, one of the world’s largest video game retailers, gave up 15.5 per cent to $22.38 after slumping sales caused the company to miss analysts’ estimates.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned investors should not get carried away with the marginally positive signs on consumer and corporate health. “Economic growth is not as strong as the market is pricing – the retail environment is still tough, and the industrial and technology sectors are uneven,” he wrote.General Motors jumped 32.4 per cent to $1.92 after the United Auto Workers Union agreed to cut its labour costs and changed the terms of $20bn in debt for retiree healthcare."

Standard Chartered and HSBC have been mooted among the potential interested parties.Walking away from cash-hungry operations, such as the US life business, could also help Old Mutual’s liquidity position.Concern over capital levels has pushed the cost of insuring Old Mutual’s debt to record levels, while its shares have lost a third of their value in a fortnight.According to UBS, the stock price is already pricing in $6bn of mark-to-market losses in the group’s US bond portfolio. “We believe this business is ring-fenced, and in an extreme case (such as that being priced in), the company could effectively walk away from the US life business,” it said.Old Mutual is due to deliver results on March 4. The rest of the insurers were helped by Prudential announcing a capital boost through the disposal of its troublesome Taiwanese business. Its full-year results matched consensus forecasts, with solvency well ahead of expectations.Prudential gained 11.1 per cent to 285p, leading the blue-chip risers, while Aviva rose 1.3 per cent to 290½p. But Legal & General continued to spiral lower following a report that ING, the Dutch group, was considering halting coupon payments on some hybrid securities.L&G was down 9.3 per cent to 317½p. The stock is down 45 per cent in a fortnight on concerns about the quality of securities in its bond portfolio.Fear of US bank nationalisations led the FTSE 100 down 3.2 per cent at the close, losing 129.31 points to hit a three-month low of 3,889.06. For the week the index slid 7.2 per cent, the steepest since November.Among the UK lenders, Royal Bank of Scotland sank 11.5 per cent to 19.3p and Barclays was off 5.8 per cent to 95.2p.HSBC was down 4.2 per cent to 477¼p as gossip continued to circulate about a dividend cut and cash call in the run-up to its results next month.Anglo American led the miners lower after scrapping its dividend and delivering 2008 profit that fell short of reduced forecasts. The stock was down 16.9 per cent to £10.27, a six-year low.Anglo also said it had to give De Beers an interest-free loan to help it survive the downturn. Smaller peer Gem Diamonds slid 14.1 per cent to 161¼p in response.Meanwhile, Xstrata lost 10.6 per cent to 643½p and Rio Tinto was down 9.5 per cent to £18.10 amid growing concern that the recent rally in steel prices looks fragile.“Anecdotal evidence indicates that traders in China are becoming increasingly nervous as supply appears to overshoot demand,” said UBS, which blamed “over-enthusiastic anticipation of the impact of the Chinese stimulus package”.Software maker Sage inched higher by 2.1 per cent to 165.8p, tracking a post-results gain for its main US competitor, Intuit.Intuit’s quarterly numbers were in line although the firm cut sales guidance for Quickbooks, its direct rival to Sage’s Peachtree package.Cattles led the mid-cap fallers, crashing 73.6 per cent to 3½p on expectations it will breach debt covenants.The subprime lender, which needs to refinance £500m debt by July, said it was delaying its full-year results pending completion of a review into its impairment provisions.Vague refinancing hopes helped Debenhams put on 4.1 per cent to 37¾p.Ashmore slid 6.8 per cent to 117p on worries Tuesday’s results from the emerging markets fund manager may disappoint.

The sector recovery of 7.9 per cent overall led the market’s bounce.CIT Group advanced 21.1 per cent to $3.45 after the lender increased a swap of notes by $200m due to the amount of tenders it had received.Goldman Sachs faded another 1.2 per cent to $65 on mounting fears over the extent of its fourth quarter loss. Met Life also failed to benefit from the sector gains, down 6.1 per cent to $23.42 after the insurer said it expected to endure its first quarterly loss as a public company.A strong advance in the materials sector helped Mosaic, up 6.9 per cent to $27.16, overcome weakening fertiliser sales.Still, Brian Yu, Citigroup analyst, said that, although the phosphate producer expects a strong recovery in the May quarter, “investors may take a ‘show-me’ attitude so [the] shares could struggle over the next three to four months”.In airlines, Delta climbed 6.4 per cent to $8.47 after the group unveiled plans for capacity cuts of 6-8 per cent, which could involve fresh job cuts. However, UAL lost 1.7 per cent to $9.48 on reports that the parent company of United Airlines was close to finalising a $150m aircraft financing deal.The market’s positive momentum also helped the retail sector, among the big casualties in the previous session. Sears soared 13.4 per cent to $36.09 even after the company disclosed a wider third quarter loss than expected and failed to provide an earnings forecast for the remainder of the year.In technology, bid speculation helped lift Yahoo 7.1 per cent to $11.50. Microsoft added 2.9 per cent to $19.15 after the software group claimed Xbox 360 consoles sales during the Thanksgiving shopping weekend were on track to beat previous years.Intuit, maker of Quicken personal finance software, gained 8.4 per cent to $21.88 after Barclays upgraded its recommendation on the stock from “neutral weight” to “overweight”. “We view Intuit as an attractive defensive play given its strong position in tax,” said Eric Handler, analyst.

But that may soon change. The software giant has announced a free version of Hyper-V Server 2008, its key virtualisation product, in a bid to woo businesses away from EMC, owner of VMware, the leading ”hypervisor” or virtualisation program.Stung by the growing competition in a market it once called its own, EMC has this year cut prices of its VMware offerings and now also offers a free low-end hypervisor.CRM as a serviceIntuit, best known for its QuickBooks accounting software for small businesses, has designs on the mid-market with a new software-as-a-service offering for customer relationship management. Intuit Enterprise Suite will initially cover the core areas of inventory, field service and sales management. Not surprisingly, this online offering is designed to get its customer, vendor and employee data from QuickBooks. Pricing has yet to be decided.Nokia’s mobile e-mailMobile e-mail just got easier, at least if you use a Nokia Series 60 phone. The Finnish giant has extended support for Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync to the entire current range of S60 phones, so making it easier to connect to e-mail accounts on corporate e-mail servers running Microsoft Exchange Server.The deal only covers Nokia devices sporting the latest incarnation of S60 software, so-called 3rd Edition, but that already comprises around 80m users.An adaptable suite from HP”Adaptive Infrastructure in a Box” is not a new name for Meccano but rather for Hewlett-Packard’s latest offering aimed at mid-sized businesses. The suite of products is based on the compact HP BladeSystem c3000 server and Microsoft Windows Server 2008. Needless to say, it is designed to be easily adaptable, so other HP products can be swapped in as business needs evolve. Prices start at approximately $18,000 for a core infrastructure with up to 300 users.Dell keeping it simpleDell also wants to keep things simple for SMEs. Its latest server, the PowerEdge T100 is aimed squarely at businesses that have previously not had dedicated server hardware.

But with investment banks poised to become an endangered species, will IBM find a queue of new customers?It’s good for systems to talkContent management systems of different vendors were never designed to work together, but the need for interoperability grows more urgent as organisations try to break down information silos.EMC, owner of Documentum, a leading CMS, sees the answer in web services and has teamed up with IBM and Microsoft to develop a draft interoperability specification. The aim is to use web services and web 2.0 interfaces to reduce dramatically the effort needed to make different CMSs talk to each other.
54;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Sage’s US unit shows gains;;Sage, the UK’s largest software company, said it was trading in line with expectations in the first quarter and there were signs of improvement at its underperforming US division.In the three months to the end of December 2007, performances at the company’s UK and mainland European businesses were “good”, although growth in European markets was not as strong as in 2006/7. There was strong organic revenue growth in its other markets.In the first quarter, for the most part, the US business performed in line with expectations, “with a modest improvement in organic growth”.Sage provides accounting and other back-office software principally to small and medium-sized enterprises. It has more than 5.5m SME customers worldwide and 13,900 employees.It is the company’s North American operations that have been the focus of attention and significant restructuring in recent months.In October Sage axed Ron Verni and Jim Eckstaedt, respectively chief executive and chief finance officer of its US division due to concerns over poor growth levels at the division and strong competition from Microsoft and Intuit.On Monday it said the search for a replacement chief executive was progressing well.North America accounts for nearly half of group revenues – £508m for the year to the end of September. However, sales growth in the period was just 4 per cent, compared with 7 per cent for the company as a whole.Sage was continuing to refocus Sage Healthcare, which it bought in December 2006 for £297m. The business supplies software for doctors’ surgeries. Management said it expected improved revenue growth over the medium term.Paul Walker, chief executive, said he was confident of meeting his organic revenue forecast for the full year despite an uncertain macro-economic situation.“The defensive characteristics of our business model, including strong cashflows and a high level of recurring revenues through our support contracts, mean that we are well placed to meet these challenges,” he said.Cazenove Software & IT Services Research estimates that in 2008 Sage will have organic growth of about 7 per cent, delivering revenues of about £1.3bn and a £275m pre-tax profit.At the end of December net debt stood at £505m, compared with £586m last time.During the period, Sage also acquired KCS for £20m, which adds to the company’s human resources and payroll product offering, and purchased a majority stake in XRT for £40m, which strengthens its treasury and cash management business in Europe.
55;INTU;Intuit Inc;2008-01-12T01:10:07Z;Tremendous trifles;;I used to be a great works snob and to look down on minor works. When I was 10 or 11 I remember beating time to Beethoven’s Fifth (a major work if ever there was one) and announcing to my mother that I wanted to become a conductor. “What, a bus conductor, darling? How lovely!” replied my distracted parent, juggling shopping bags. I’m not sure I’ve ever quite recovered from this blow to my self-esteem and my fantasy that mothers could intuit sons’ wishes.Lately I’ve been fiddling around with various bagatelles for the piano by Beethoven, self-professedly minor works by a major master. But the title bagatelle (from the Italian bagatta, meaning a little possession, and coming to signify a trifle) might come lightly dusted with irony. If these sketches are so trivial, why did Beethoven bother to publish them and give them opus numbers? After all, he only gave opus numbers to pieces he considered, in the old sense, masterpieces (that is, past the apprentice stage). And of the three sets of bagatelles, one comes just after the superb trio of piano sonatas opus 31, and two are late works, written around the time of the Ninth Symphony, the last three piano sonatas and the late string quartets. Is there any minor late Beethoven?Beethoven’s publishers Peters Verlag certainly considered the set opus 119 very minor indeed: “Your pieces are not worth the money and you should consider it beneath your dignity to waste time with such trivia that anyone can write.” But I feel Beethoven was fond of his bagatelles. He lavished care over them, not just in the writing of the music but in the tempo and expression marks. Many of them – which tend to be short, between half a page and three pages in length – are marked either andante or allegretto or some combination of these two speeds, just on the cusp between slow and fast. One is marked andante grazioso quasi allegretto, another allegretto quasi andante. You can’t imagine a movement in a Beethoven (or Mozart, or Bruckner) symphony not being able to decide if it was an andante or an allegretto. The quirky bagatelles elude conventional categories.One of my favourites, opus 33 number 6, carries the marking “con una certa espressione parlante” – with a certain speaking expression. It’s touchingly imprecise – hinting at something, or encouraging the performer to make the piano speak, in the most human of tones. Not to declaim, to rage, to sing, to lament, but simply to speak.So what might come through in these bagatelles, even more clearly or humanly than in the great works, is the master’s voice, without any rhetorical afflatus, just with a certain speaking expression. They move from the sublime to the silly. If you wanted to define Beethoven’s late style, a sort of easy commerce with divinity, in the space of three minutes, you should go directly to the bagatelle in G, the first of the last set opus 126 (marked andante con moto, cantabile e piacevole: in a singing and pleasant style). At the end of the set comes the ridiculous exuberance of the presto outer sections of the E flat bagatelle.The sublimity, silliness, shortness and apparent triflingness of the Beethoven bagatelles connected in my mind with the most interesting short book on aesthetics I’ve read for a long time, Leonard Koren’s Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers (Stone Bridge Press). According to Koren, for an architect who has lived much of his life in Japan, wabi-sabi is the quintessential but almost indefinable Japanese aesthetic. It describes things of imperfect, evanescent beauty, of a certain roughness, often on a small scale: things that might easily be overlooked, that do not shout from the rooftops but speak in a low, human tone.“Wabi-sabi”, writes Koren, “represents the exact opposite of the Western ideal of great beauty as something monumental, spectacular and enduring …Wabi-sabi is about the minor and the hidden, the tentative and the ephemeral: things so subtle …they are invisible to vulgar eyes.” One example is the wabi-sabi tea-room, modelled on a Japanese farmer’s hut: apparently “a lowly and miserable environment”, but capable, according to Koren, of “exceptional beauty”. It was a glossy travesty of a wabi-sabi tea event in Japan that inspired Koren to write his book, as he began to fear for wabi-sabi’s future even in its own homeland. The aesthetic celebrating evanescence might be on the point of vanishing.Wabi-sabi is not just an aesthetic, but also implies ethics. The ethics of unpretentiousness leads to a lighter footprint on the earth. Perhaps this was why Beethoven felt such affection for certain of his Kleinigkeiten, or smallnesses, preferring his exquisite little sonata opus 78 to the tragic Moonlight, and regarding his bagatelles opus 126 as “probably the best in this line that I have written”. These days, I would rather listen to them than to the Fifth Symphony.harry.eyres@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/eyres
56;INTU;Intuit Inc;2007-10-11T20:31:30Z;Why staid Sage was forced to act tough;;Sage’s decision to axe the chief executive and chief finance officer of its US division on Thursday shocked investors, who are not used to seeing blood in the boardroom of the business software company.Sage, which is the UK’s largest software company and the only one in the FTSE 100, has a reputation for being staid but stable, an uneventful haven for risk-adverse technology investors.The departure of Ron Verni, the US chief executive, and Jim Eckstaedt, the finance officer of the division “with immediate effect” was unusual.However, the North American business has become an increasing concern over the last year. The division accounts for nearly half of group revenues – £508m for the year to the end of September – but is not growing as fast as the rest of the business. Sales growth was just 4 per cent, compared with 7 per cent for the overall company.“We needed a change of style in managing the business,” said Paul Walker, chief executive. “North American performance has not been as good as we would have liked. We’ve done OK, but we could have done better.“This is something I have been considering for a while. The US executives did a good job in building the business but now it needs a different steer.”North America is home turf for Sage’s two biggest competitors, Microsoft and Intuit, who offer accounting and other back office software for the small and medium-sized businesses that are Sage’s key customers. Investors have long been concerned that competition could hold the company back in the region.“Its been an ongoing problem. The US business has lagged for a long time and the competitive forces are increasing,” said Julian Yates, analyst at Investec.“Sage faces far stronger competition in the US than in most other markets. In particular, we see Microsoft Dynamics competing ever more strongly at the top-end of Sage’s market. SAP is also re-doubling its efforts here,” said David Bradshaw, analyst at Ovum.In addition, last year Sage made what was seen as one of its riskiest acquisitions in the US, the £297m purchase of Emdeon, which provides software for doctors surgeries. Some investors feared the move into healthcare was a step too far from Sage’s core strengths.This year Sage reorganised the US business into four vertical divisions to try to accelerate growth – a recognition that its North American plans were not progressing as well as they should.Thursday’s management changes made it clear there was still further to go before US issues are resolved. Last spring, Mr Walker had forecast an acceleration in sales growth but on Thursday he was forced to admit this had not happened. “They needed to do something different to shake up the company,” said Mr Yates. “It is good that they are making changes, although it created near-term instability.”“It feels like they are finally stepping up to the plate and saying these growth rates are not good enough,” said George O’Connor, analyst at Panmure Gordon.The factors holding back recent US growth in fact appear quite minor.There was a delay in the release of a particular software product and Sage’s Timberline business, which provides software to construction companies, has seen a slowdown as the credit squeeze has hit building work in the US.Sage has also been struggling to get its network of resellers to push sales hard enough.“We maintain that Sage’s US issues are transitory, company-specific and not reflective of any change in either competitive dynamics or underlying demand,” said Adam Shepherd, analyst at Dresdner.If Sage can find a new strong US management team, many expect the shares, which are trading at their lowest multiple for four years, to see recovery.However, Sage will have to be careful that it does not build a reputation for management turmoil.

The benchmark notched its seventh consecutive weekly rise and closed at its highest level since setting its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Energy and telecoms stocks were the best performing sectors, while information technology was the laggard among the 10 major groups within the S&P.Higher oil prices and a further rise in bond yields were unable to weigh on stocks.“We are seeing so much consolidation and the market has also shifted its focus to the economy,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The market can absorb higher oil prices and bond yields if the economy is looking stronger.”Blue chips remained the bull’s prime choice this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 13,500 points for the first time and set a series of record closes as its run of strength since the end of March continued.On Friday, the Dow rose 0.6 per cent to finish at 13,556.53, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.A feature of the market’s current rally has been strong buying of large blue chip stocks. This positive sentiment was nurtured this week when high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett, Edward Lampert and Carl Icahn revealed their latest stock selections in regulatory filings.Railroads were a prominent sector, boosted by investment from Mr Buffett and Mr Icahn, and the S&P railroad index rose 3.8 per cent this week. Mr Lampert’s disclosure of a stake in Citigroup helped the bank’s shares rise by 3.6 per cent to $55.By contrast, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was bedevilled by weakness among many semiconductor stocks amid a general rotation out of tech. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.7 per cent this week. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.75 per cent to close at 2,558.45, but slipped 0.15 per cent for the week.The Russell index of small companies fell 0.7 per cent for the week.Leading declines among chip makers was Micron Technology, down 6.9 per cent to $11.47, after the group said it planned to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.One ray of light among chip makers was Advanced Micro Devices, up 6.2 per cent to $15.59 this week, as it rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games.In another week replete with deals, Microsoft said it would purchase Aquantive, the digital marketing group for about $6bn on Friday.It is the largest acquisition yet made by Microsoft, and its stock fell 0.5 per cent to $30.83, while Aquantive soared 77.8 per cent to $63.79 on Friday.“We view the acquisition as a necessity for Microsoft to compete against Google in online advertising, an estimated $40bn market growing at a 20 per cent rate through 2010,” said Jim Yin, systems software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in General Electric rose 1.2 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, as the conglomerate moved towards selling its plastics business for $11bn to Saudi Basic Industries.In other acquisition activity this week, Cardinal Health bought Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn. Viasys rose 38 per cent to $43.53, and Cardinal Health rallied 3.9 per cent to $71.77.Mylan Laboratories, the drugmaker agreed to pay $6.6bn for the generic drug business of Germany’s Merck KGaA.

ADS rose 24.6 per cent to $78.33 and set a 52-week high of $80.30.Acxiom agreed to a $2.24bn buy-out from private equity firms Silver Lake Partners and ValueAct Capital. Shares in the information technology company gained 13.4 per cent to $27.78 this week.There was further selling in Amgen after Medicare and Medicaid Services said it may limit coverage of the drugmaker’s anaemia drugs, which a Food and Drug Administration panel recently said should have new labelling. Shares in Amgen fell 4 per cent to $54.04 as it also received multiple brokerage downgrades.In earnings news this week, Intuit said late on Thursday that its third-quarter profit climbed 23 per cent and the software maker raised its fiscal 2007 profit above analysts’ forecasts. Shares rose 13.85 per cent to $31.56 on Friday, and were up 13.2 per cent for the week.Compuware rose 9.9 per cent, to $11.06 and reached a five-year high of $12.56, as its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results exceeded expectations.Agilent rose 4.9 per cent to $38, after it reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings and raised revenue outlook for the year.Hewlett-Packard, down 1.5 per cent at $44.58, was the worst Dow performer this week as its second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year-earlier period.Home Depot reported a 29.5 per cent decline in profit for the first quarter due to variable weather and a weaker housing market.

First, the alternative asset management firm Fortress Investment Group goes public and trades up to previously unheard-of valuations for companies in the investment arena. Next, the private equity colossus Blackstone files for its own initial public offering, with the potential of generating a huge payout for its chairman, Stephen Schwarzman.These self-motivated, intelligent individuals are trying to tell us something important. The question is: do we have the ability to look beyond their words and actions and intuit motivation? Greed, uncertainty and fear. What are the implications? That the equity markets are in trouble? That the credit markets are on the verge of a sharp sell-off? That we are at the dangerous stage of a private equity bubble?My assessment is that we are in a private equity bubble of sorts. However, it is not one that has ghastly implications for the overall market but, instead, will have negative outcomes for those invested in private equity funds – and certainly for those buying into the public shares of private equity management companies such as Blackstone.Consider this: Blackstone is a great firm. Going public will bring even greater riches to those at the top. That said, great riches have already been captured by those up and down the management hierarchy. This is not the case of a go-go high-technology firm that generates little free cash flow and requires an IPO or a sale to crystallise value for its shareholders. Blackstone has been and will continue to be a cash machine that can distribute substantial sums to its minions every year. Therefore, either an IPO or a leveraging of the balance sheet is simply a means of extracting even more cash from the business. Given the friendly nature of today’s equity markets, going public offers the best risk/reward decision for Blackstone’s existing shareholders. This is an opportunistic step driven by the state of today’s equity markets and other considerations such as the state of the private equity market.Hundreds of billions of dollars of new deal capacity has been created by private equity firms in the past 12 months. This is a classic case of too much liquidity chasing too few opportunities, giving rise to stretched debt-to-cash flow multiples, club deals where multiple private equity firms share risks and rewards and the re-emergence of complex debt instruments that give great flexibility to the private equity issuers but scant protection for debt investors. This cycle we have seen repeated every 20 years or so, the difference here being the scale and number of private equity firms and the leveraged capital at their disposal.As long as the debt markets co-operate, all is well. But when debt investors wake up to the fact that they are systematically underpricing risk, the highly leveraged deal structures simply will not work. Deals will still get done because private equity firms need to deploy their capital to build franchises and justify their fees but leverage ratios will fall and returns will decline. Bad for the overall market? Not really, because competition for doing deals in general will remain strong owing to liquidity considerations. But bad for private equity investors? Certainly, and now there will be one more constituency at the table: investors in the public equity of these private equity firms. Here is the rub.Will Blackstone pull off a wildly successful IPO? It is almost a certainty. Will Blackstone trade at a multiple that implies rapid growth in assets under management and therefore in management and performance fees? Absolutely. What will happen when the debt markets grow less friendly and additional equity is required to get deals done? Returns will fall. What will happen to those who have invested in private equity funds? They will not be happy. And those who have invested in common shares of the private equity management company? Unhappier still.Mr Schwarzman knows this full well, as do his colleagues at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Texas Pacific Group, Apollo and others thinking about following in Blackstone’s footsteps. They understand that the risk/reward calculus of the private equity business (largely being borne by debt holders in today’s frothy environment) could shift rapidly, closing a historically attractive window for them to monetise their franchises. They see the private equity bubble and want to extract value before it pops. But where does that leave the rest of us? Unhappy, indeed.The writer is president and chief operating officer of Monitor110, writes the financial blog Information Arbitrage and was chief executive of DB Advisors
59;INTU;Intuit Inc;2006-10-20T14:41:46Z;Google shares jump as results show ad strength;;Google shares jumped 7 per cent on Friday after the company reported gross revenues of $2.69bn in its third quarter, up 70 per cent on last time, underlining the enduring strength of its search engine advertising business model.The figure beat Wall Street expectations of $2.62bn sales.More than 99 per cent of Google’s revenues come from advertising based on its search technology.Google’s shares on Friday climbed above $457 in morning trade, within reach of their alltime high in January of $475.11.Its latest results showed sales were rising fastest on the more profitable Google-owned websites, up 84 per cent at $1.63bn. Network revenues increased by 54 per cent to $1.04bn, with much of this money being returned to the outside websites that feature its adverts.These “traffic acquisition costs” increased from $785m in the second quarter to $825m and were 31 per cent of advertising revenues – a drop of one percentage point quarter-on-quarter.Google’s strong revenues in a seasonally weaker quarter contrasted with those of Yahoo, which reported this week that revenues had risen grew only 19 per cent year-on-year.Yahoo is far more dependent on display advertising and is facing increased competition from “social networking” sites such as MySpace and YouTube, which is being acquired by Google for $1.65bn.Google captured 44.1 per cent of the US search market in August, according to comScore Networks research, compared with 28.7 per cent for Yahoo.“Business is very very good here at Google and we had an excellent quarter in all respects,” Eric Schmidt, chief executive, told analysts in a conference call.Profits of $812m or $2.62 a share beat the analyst consensus of $2.41 gathered by ReutersEstimates, up and rose from $1.51 last time. a year earlier.Mr Schmidt said the overall growth had been driven by a number of factors.These included strong user growth, improvements in the quality of search, better quality ads and ad products, and “a blizzard of new product launches [that] seems to create new opportunities for us every day”.Google’s international business had also performed well, he said. Revenues from outside the US were now 44 per cent of total revenues, up from 39 per cent a year ago.Its largest markets – the UK and Germany – had performed very well, as had the Netherlands, Spain, France, Italy, Canada and Australia. The emerging markets of India and Brazil were also growing at “very high rates”.Mr Schmidt said partnerships with Dell, eBay, Intuit, MTV and MySpace would prove important in growing revenues and deepening Google’s reach for advertisers.The acquisition of YouTube, the leading online video-sharing site, was a culmination of this strategy and “the ultimate partnership, if you will”, he said.
60;INTU;Intuit Inc;2006-08-23T17:08:50Z;London drifts lower as lull continues;;London’s leading shares suffered a nasty fall on Wednesday after weaker-than-expected US housing data.With traders reporting heavy selling of index futures, the FTSE 100 slid 42.6 points, or 0.7 per cent, to end at 5,860.0.Additional downside pressure came from BHP Billiton, which fell 4 per cent to £10.14 after annual results disappointed. Several stocks also traded ex-dividend. These included Anglo American, down 3.6 per cent to £23.80, and Pearson, 3 per cent weaker at 737½p.Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 shed 38.9 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 9,454.2.Brambles Industries managed to defy the market’s downward trend, however. Its shares climbed 4.7 per cent to 447¼p after annual results impressed and the Anglo-Australian pallet hire company said it expected robust growth in its US operations.Sage, the accountancy software developer, also finished higher, rising 1.8 per cent to 233½p in the wake of better-than-expected fourth quarter results from Intuit, its main US rival.But Rexam, the world’s leading drinks can manufacturer, eased 1.5 per cent to 511p on short selling ahead of today’s results. The talk in the market yesterday was that the figures could disappoint with Rexam blaming high aluminium costs in Europe and weak prices in the US for its woes.If the results do disappoint and the shares fall sharply, traders reckon there is a chance Rexam will loose its place in the FTSE 100 at next month’s quarterly review.Elsewhere, Vodafone closed unchanged at 110½p despite rumours that it might be tempted to acquire the UK business of Hutchison Whampoa’s 3.Xstrata bucked the weak trend in the mining sector, rising 0.7 per cent to £22.65 amid talk that it might not need a massive rights issue to held fund its $16bn acquisition of Canadian nickel miner Falconbridge.According to reports out of Canada, Teck Cominco is interested in buying Falconbridge assets worth $7bn.Lower down the corporate ladder, PayPoint, which operates bill paying terminals for British Gas and the TV Licensing authority, topped the FTSE 250 performance table. Its shares advanced 12 per cent to 560p after UBS upgraded the stock to a “buy”.Analyst Alex Hugh said the 23 per cent fall in PayPoint’s share price over the past three months had created an excellent buying opportunity as the company continues to trade strongly with user numbers rising.Taylor Nelson Sofres, the market research group, enjoyed further gains. Its shares added 5.5 per cent to 190p on takeover hopes and talk that next month’s figures will show the company getting to grips with the problems in the US.Debenhams slipped 1.8 per cent to 179½p amid talk of poor clothing sales at the department stores group.Nikanor, the London’s market biggest play on the huge copper reserves of the Democratic Republic of Congo, improved 3.6 per cent to 611 ½p after Cazenove started coverage with an “outperform” rating and said the shares could be worth over £14 by 2010.Bradford & Bingley, down 1.3 per cent to 437¼p, was in focus on hopes that it could rejoin the FTSE 100 before next week’s month quarterly index review. Due to its takeover by Germany’s Linde, industrial gases group BOC is expected to be deleted from the FTSE 100 on September 4.It will be replaced by the biggest company on the reserve list after the close of trading on August 27. At the moment, that company is B&B, which lost its blue chip status after the September 2004 review.Regal Petroleum, the exploration group founded by Frank Timis, rose 5.6 per cent to 118p, continuing the strong run which has seen its shares rise over 40 per cent since the start of the month.Traders said the move has been sparked by hopes of a resolution of Regal’s legal troubles in Ukraine after it enlisted the help of a local partner, Alberry Limited, to liaise with the Ukrainian authorities to secure its production licences over two gas fields in the country. Regal sold Alberry a 15 per cent stake in its Ukrainian subsidiary for £100,000. If Alberry succeeds in securing the licences, Regal will buy back the stake for $50.9m. If Alberry fails, it gets just $50,000.There was also talk of a positive update from Regal’s exploration project in Egypt. Traders noted Regal had enough cash in the bank to develop it Egyptian assets, while it was sitting on significant tax losses which could be written off against future profits.Monstermob, the mobile phone ringtone group, eased 2.9 per cent to 83½p despite talk that Jamster, the company behind the “Crazy Frog” ringtone, was behind the bid approach announced earlier this month. Although Monstermob did not reveal the identity of its suitor, it was believed Jamster, a subsidiary of US internet group VeriSign, was made a 150p a share cash-and-paper offer.Talk of a bid from a US rival sent Torex Retail, the software group, 9.2 per cent higher to 47½p. Separately, Seymour Pierce upgraded the stock from “hold” to “outperform” on valuation grounds, citing its 36 per cent slide since the start of July.Isoft fell 4.6 per cent to a fresh record low of 41¾p amid fears its full-year results, which it needs to publish this week to avoid a suspension of its shares, will do little to reassure investors in the struggling healthcare software group.Prezzo, the Italian restaurant chain run by Jonathan Kaye, rose 6.5 per cent to 53½p as unusually large trading volume in the stock sparked speculation that the company had attracted bid interest.UK Coal slipped 4 per cent to 199p despite news that David Kirch, the Jersey-based property developer, had taken advantage of Tuesday’s 5 per cent fall to purchase a further 1.5m shares, taking his holding to 5 per cent.Caffè Nero, which last week said it had received a takeover approach from its founder and chief executive Gerry Ford, rose 0.6 per cent to 251p after hedge fund Cycladic Capital raised its stake in the coffee bar chain to 9.1 per cent with the purchase of 3.7m shares at 248¼p
61;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T17:32:33+0000;Fresh rate worries weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street suffered another weak session on Thursday as the prospect of higher US interest rates continued to rattle investors.Stocks initially pushed higher, buoyed by the Bank of Japan’s decision to keep its short-term interest rates at around zero per cent for the time being.But the main indices turned sharply lower in afternoon trading after a fresh uptick in yields on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond rekindled fears about the effect of higher borrowing costs on corporate profits.Hawkish interest rates comments from a Federal Reserve official and news of a record trade deficit further undermined sentiment.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent at 10,972.28, while the S&P 500 lost 0.5 per cent to 1,272.23 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8 per cent to 2,249.72.Worries about rising interest rates prompted sell-offs in financial and technology stocks, although defensives such as Procter & Gamble saw gains.Chipmakers led the retreat on the Nasdaq, with the Philadelphia semiconductor sector index down 1.4 per cent. Sector heavyweight Intel fell 1.3 per cent to $19.75, National Semiconductorlost 3 per cent to $27.18 and Broadcom shed 2.5 per cent to $45.57.Google fell for the fourth consecutive session, losing 3.1 per cent to $343 after it agreed to settle a lawsuit over online click fraud. UBS cut its price estimate on the stock from $425 to $400, saying the settlement would “antagonise” confidence in its ability to communicate with investors.Google’s weakness weighed on internet portal Yahoo and online retailer Amazon. They fell 2.3 per cent to $30.28 and 1.9 per cent to $36.12 respectively.Intuit, the maker of the TurboTax software, was among the few to buck the down trend. Its shares jumped 6.6 per cent to $51.73 after it upgraded its sales outlook, noting a late surge in business as the tax season shifted into high gear.Losses on the Dow were pared by General Motors, which gained 4.5 per cent to $21.34 even after the United Auto Workers union denied reports that it was close to an agreement with GM to cut labour costs.Elsewhere, news of Imax’s proposed sale drove the entertainment technology company’s stock 9 per cent higher to $10.35.Rumours of outside interest also lifted Sharper Image. Shares in the struggling gadget retailer surged 22.6 per cent to $12.21 after an activist shareholder group said it planned to oust incumbent management.Drugmaker Biogen gained 4.5 per cent to $47.54 after its Tysabri multiple sclerosis drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel.After soaring more than 24 per cent in its market debut on Wednesday, shares of shares of NYSE Group fell 4.9 per cent to $76.10.
62;INTU;Intuit Inc;2005-08-25T20:39:37Z;Wall St struggles against turbulent oil price;;Wall Street struggled to hold on to tiny gains made during a short-lived respite to rising oil prices, with retailers leading the pack.The market picked up after oil prices dipped on forecasts that tropical storm Katrina will skirt around oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.The news helped to stall the a record-setting rally in oil prices but late buying of oil pushed crude up 17 cents to a finishing price of $67.49 a barrel.At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent 10,450.63. The S&P 500 also gained 0.2 per cent at 1,212.40, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent up at 2,134.37.The temporary fall in oil prompted a stir among big chains such as Best Buy and Lowe’s. Best Buy, the country’s biggest electronics retailer, gained 2.9 per cent to $46.75 while Lowe’s, a home improvement store, climbed 2.1 per cent to $64.19.Philip Roth, strategist at Miller Tabak, said energy prices would continue to concern investors for the foreseeable future.“For the first time we are beginning to see a divergence between rising oil prices and oil stocks,” Mr Roth said.“We have already seen consumer cyclicals being clobbered but the message of this might be that we have reached a point where expensive oil is actually hurting oil stocks.”The day’s star turn was York International, a heating equipment and air conditioner maker, which found itself the subject of a takeover offer from Johnson Controls, an auto parts supplier. York soared 36 per cent to $56.79. Other ventilation companies climbed too, with Lennox International gaining by 5.8 per cent to $24.46 and American Standard up 2.9 per cent to $44.88.Another dramatic upward move came courtesy of theme park operator Six Flags, which saw its share price jump 11 per cent to $7.26 after it announced it would seek outside buyers. The move came in the wake of an attempt by investor Daniel Snyder to seize control of the company.TiVo did rather less well after the digital video recorder maker warned of “challenges” ahead and a wider quarterly loss than expected. The group, which will lose a partnership in October with DirecTV group that had provided the bulk of its subscriber growth, said it would have to increase spending to attract more customers. TiVo fell 15.4 per cent to $5.18.The sharpest fall on the S&P 500 came from Intuit, which dropped 5.6 per cent to $43.76 after the tax preparation software maker forecast a worse-than-expected loss for the first quarter.It was also a bad session for Ford and GM both of which had their debt ratings cut to junk status by Moody’s after the market closed on Wednesday. GM fell 0.5 per cent to $34.09 and Ford slipped 1 per cent to $9.82.
63;INTU;Intuit Inc;2020-04-24T17:59:57+0000;Paul Taylor: How to tame the digital paper chase;;My first computer was an Apple II and was mainly used for three tasks - creating WordStar documents and MultiPlan spreadsheets, and managing personal finances using an early version of Intuit's Quicken.Since then, the range and type of information that is created by and stored on a computer has changed dramatically. But for home and business users, the basic challenge of keeping track of all these files and documents remains the same.Fortunately, there is a class of productivity software designed just for this task - document-management systems. These are like digital shoeboxes - virtual places for storing and organising photographs, receipts, magazine articles and Microsoft Office documents.Scansoft's PaperPort (www.scansoft.com) helped define the category and continues to be one of the most effective and reliable means of turning disorganised stacks of paper into neatly organised digital documents. Over the years it has evolved into a powerful system that makes it relatively easy to find information quickly, work with the existing documents or acquire, file and organise documents and images from various sources including scanners and digital cameras.The latest version, PaperPort Professional 10 - which costs $199 - has just been launched and adds some interesting features to an already impressive package. Using its new ScannerWizard, scanning documents is faster and easier and the software also includes a set of point-and-click tools to carry out tasks such as enhancing, annotating and assembling documents. These allow users to correct scans or digital images, add sticky notes and highlights and combine scanned documents and digital photographs with Microsoft Office documents.Users who have a scanner with an automatic document feeder can scan more than one document at once - the software will automatically separate a stack of documents into individual files if you insert a sheet of white paper between documents in the scanner.Like some software bundled with many scanners, PaperPort also allows users to send single and multi-page documents directly from a scanner to e-mail, fax or programs such as Microsoft Word.Perhaps most significantly, PaperPort now uses Adobe's Acrobat PDF as its storage format and includes printer drivers that let you create PDF files from any Windows application. You can even extract pages from different documents and reassemble them into a new PDF document.The latest version allows you to see all the pages in a document in thumbnail form rather than just the top-page thumbnail. A new feature means you can quickly find any type of file using a single search keyword or phrase. And the All-in-One Indexer converts scanned documents into readable text so that users can search for any word in a scanned document as well as those created on the PC.However, the initial indexing is a lengthy and processor-intensive process, so it is best to set the program to work overnight. Once set up, the software maintains an index of the text in documents and images (which can be tagged with meta-data keywords), so you can search all your files quickly for a word or phrase.Other features include the Form Typer, a clever utility that will automatically find the blanks in a scanned form. This means you can type the additions on to the scanned form and then print out the whole document.Overall, PaperPort Professional 10 is a flexible and powerful program that, with a little patience, makes it much easier to manage the documents on your PC - particularly if you have a scanner.But PaperPort is not the only option. Microsoft Office OneNote (www.microsoft.com) was introduced as part of Office 2003 and has since been significantly improved with a recent update. OneNote was designed to make it easier for users to capture, organise, and reuse typed or handwritten electronic notes and diagrams - particularly on notebook and tablet PCs - as well as on traditional desktop computers.The central concept is that it provides users with one place to store data and then work with that data in any way they like. As its name implies, it is based on input from electronic pens and keyboards - rather than input from scanners as with PaperPort. Like PaperPort, however, it allows users to pull pictures, text and other information from a website directly into it by dragging and dropping - and it automatically includes the web address so that you can reference it later.Perhaps OneNote's smartest feature is its ability to record audio notes which you can play back later.OneNote is very flexible: it organises information into notebooks, and users can create as many notebooks - which can contain many folders and pages - as they need. You do not have to know exactly where information is stored - OneNote is easy to search. And you can store, combine, format and rearrange notes by dragging and dropping in whatever way makes most sense to you.EverNote 1.0, a free program developed by a California-based start-up, (www.evernote.com) is similar to OneNote but operates more like a digital scrapbook.It is designed to make it easy to store and quickly access scraps of information including handwritten memos, fragments from web pages, e-mails, phone messages, addresses, passwords, sketches, documents on an endless digital roll of paper.The various scraps of information are assembled on a long, scrolling tape down the middle of your screen which you can scroll through to find different entries. Each is date-stamped and the most recent notes are placed at the top of the tape. This tape is neatly laid out: it is framed by the scroll bar and what EverNote calls the Time Band. This runs along the right edge of the screen and makes it easy to jump to a specific time or date to find what you are looking for.You create notes either by typing on to a new note or by dragging information from another application such as Internet Explorer or Microsoft Word, and you can also include other types of files, including images. These can then be printed or e-mailed to someone else. EverNote also tracks changes to notes so that you can always go back to a previous version. To make searching easier, notes can be categorised, and a powerful search engine allows you to look either for whole words or word fragments - the results show up as you type.One warning: this is still in its pre-release, or beta format - although I have found it to be remarkably stable and useful.With all these tools available, you should never lose another piece of information on your computer again.
64;INTU;Intuit Inc;2004-12-01T19:40:25Z;Lex: Sage;;Do software companies reach sedate middle age? Sage’s full year organic sales growth of just 4.7 per cent might suggest so. However, a peep behind the curtains shows that its life is still rather racy.Growth in the UK, where Sage provides accounting software for small companies, was a frisky 8 per cent, despite its mature market share of 35-40 per cent. It dominates distribution channels and is persuading its entry-level software users to upgrade to mid-level packages. Such customers pay high licence fees. They are also twice as likely to buy IT support contracts. Consequently, Sage is achieving strong growth and margins comparable to Microsoft’s - an enticing combination.However, the picture is less thrilling across the pond. The US accounts for 42 per cent of sales but grew organically by just 2 per cent. Saga has a weak market position and must battle potent rivals. Both Microsoft and SAP are venturing down the corporate food chain. Intuit, which dominates accounting software for small companies, is pushing up. Web-based competitors also pose a threat. Salesforce.com is now competing in the customer relationship software segment.Sage’s split persona looks set to continue. However overall trends are improving. Overall organic sales growth in the second half reached 6 per cent. Assuming an 8 per cent discount rate and 3 per cent growth from 2014, today’s share price implies medium-term free cashflow growth of 4.5 per cent. The shares could have life in them yet.
