0;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2016-03-27T12:16:16Z;Western Digital set to test investor sentiment for junk;Looming debt sale may be biggest high yield offering on record as investors question recent rally;A restoration of debt sales in the riskiest area of US capital markets is being questioned by some portfolio managers who say the fundamental backdrop remains considerably uncertain.Sentiment faces an important test with Western Digital, the maker of computer storage, set to sell nearly $10bn of loans and bonds as soon as this week. The bond sale is expected to rank among the largest high yield offerings on record, as the debate over the durability of the recent rally heats up.A dramatic rebound in asset prices and sentiment among investors since mid-February has reopened the US high yield market, a sector hit hard at the start of the year given expectations of rising defaults by speculative rated companies.Renewed investor demand for high yield has helped investment banks clear some of the riskiest deals from their balance sheets, with sales from Solera, Kraton Performance Polymers and LeasePlan — all of which were delayed amid market turbulence — now completed.“You’ve seen a grab with anything for yield on it,” said Jonathan Stanley, a portfolio manager at Newfleet Asset Management.However, there are signs of the recovery fraying and the US high yield bond market weakened last week.Mark Howard, head of US credit strategy at BNP Paribas, said: “This goes hand in hand with people investing on shorter time horizons, where they rush in and race out.”Mr Howard and others have questioned the endurance of the recent rally, which has closely followed the bounce in oil and equity prices. A surge of inflows — Lipper estimates US high yield funds have seen more than $13bn of new capital in the past five weeks — alongside elevated levels of cash positions, has knocked investor discipline.There is fear that another market down draft could close the high yield window again, leaving a number of deals in the pipeline.Bankers and investors estimate that between $10bn and $12bn of so-called hung deals remain in the US. The largest part of the backlog stems from Veritas, a transaction led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which stalled last November. Symantec ultimately agreed a cut-price sale of the data-storage business to Carlyle.The group is expected to bring its debt offering in the second quarter this year, after Veritas releases first-quarter results, two people familiar with the matter said. Investors are also watching for a debt sale from metal and plastic part manufacturer NN Inc, which last year postponed a $300m sale to finance its takeover of Precision Engineered Products.Since merger and acquisition and leveraged buyout activity slowed last year, the number of potential junk bond offerings has dwindled. Dell is expected to raise billions to fund an already agreed takeover. But beyond a few marquee transactions, the picture is murky. Investors say they are being driven to buy new debt rather than overpay for bonds that have already rallied.Investors have recently embraced debt offerings that they would have shirked a month earlier, tempted by attractive yields. Debt deals in March have included Aleris, a producer of aluminium, selling $550m of debt with a yield of 9.5 per cent. YPF, the Argentine state oil company, raised $1bn at a yield of 8.5 per cent while Satellite operator Intelsat, which last year considered selling strategic assets to cut its debt, sold $1.25bn worth of new bonds at 8 per cent.

2;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2013-10-31T07:01:38Z;Share prices are rarely hit hard by cyber attacks;;Investors take it in their stride when companies are breached by cyber attacks in incidents that nine times out of 10 have a relatively minor impact on their share prices, according to new research.Faced with evidence that shareholders appear relatively unperturbed by these new online security risks, regulators are likely to renew efforts to persuade them to take cyber threats more seriously.In the UK, government intelligence agents have recently held meetings with large institutional investors to emphasise that cyber security should be a greater corporate priority.Research by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer shows that in only a quarter of cases did the company’s share price fall by more than 1 per cent immediately after a cyber security breach was revealed. The share price fell by more than 2 per cent during the first trading day in only one in 10 instances.Even so, the cumulative total wiped off market capitalisation on the first post-announcement day’s trading reached $53bn, for cyber attacks from the beginning of 2011 to the end of April this year.After five days’ trading, the average dip in share price values was merely 0.26 per cent, with only 12 out of the 135 cases falling more than 5 per cent.Jane Jenkins, Freshfields partner, said the muted share price reaction to attacks was particularly striking given the widespread harm that cyber crime can cause.“Cyber security breaches can leave a company struggling to manage the fallout on many fronts: loss of competitor advantage, interruption of business operations, impact on revenue and reputational damage,” she said.She added that investors’ apparently casual attitude towards cyber attacks might be a sign that they did not fully appreciate the dangers that a company may face if crucial information was stolen.“If financial directors are struggling to compute the risks and put a value on a company’s information, how can investors be expected to do so, given the information is not available to them?”According to the study, Sony reported six cyber attacks but suffered an immediate share price dip of more than 2 per cent only once – in March last year.Signs that investors are generally not too worried by announcements of cyber attacks were apparent earlier in October when Adobe, the group behind the Acrobat document reader, said that 2.9m customer accounts and its source code had been compromised. The share price closed only 1.4 per cent down on the first day, and regained its previous levels in two weeks.And even when Adobe revealed on Wednesday that the breach was much wider than initially reported, its shares fell only slightly more than the market in early trading.The steepest one-day share price fall detailed in the Freshfields study occurred when Global Payments said in March 2012 that up to 1.5m card numbers in North America might have been stolen in a security breach. The group, which processes credit and debit card transactions, saw its shares fall more than 9 per cent on the first trading day after it revealed the attack.
3;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2012-06-13T00:08:52Z;Credit data breach may be worse than thought;;Global Payments, the payment processor, said that a breach of its systems reported earlier this year may have compromised more information than previously thought.The company, which processes transactions involving Visa, MasterCard and American Express, said on Tuesday that its ongoing investigation had revealed that hackers may have gained access to servers containing personal information from its merchant customers.“It is unclear whether the intruders looked at or took any personal information from the company’s systems,” it said.When Global Payments first revealed the breach in March, the company said that the thieves may have accessed card numbers, but not cardholders’ names, addresses and social security numbers.Global Payments said that its investigation has established that the actual card numbers that may have been stolen did not exceed its previous estimate of 1.5m.Company officials were not immediately available to elaborate on what kind of personal information may have been compromised.Global Payments works behind the scenes in card transactions, serving as the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.The breach has prompted Visa and MasterCard to remove the company from a list of data processors that meet industry standards for security.In the coming days, Global Payments will notify individuals whose personal information may have been hacked and provide them with identity protection insurance at no cost.Paul Garcia, the chairman and chief executive of Global Payments, said: “We sincerely apologise for this incident and are working diligently to conclude our investigation. We are committed to fully resolve any issues arising from this matter and we, of course, continue to provide uninterrupted transaction processing for our customers worldwide.”The company plans to provide information on how much the breach will cost no later than its July 26 earnings call.The share price of Global Payments has fallen about 20 per cent since news of the breach surfaced. On Tuesday, the stock rose 0.8 per cent to $42.19.
4;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2012-05-02T07:50:54Z;Fresh blow for Global Payments;;Global Payments, a processor of debit and credit card transactions that reported a breach in March, said late on Tuesday that “certain card associations” had removed the company from their lists of processors that meet industry standards for security.The company processes transactions involving brands including Visa, MasterCard and American Express.Global Payments reiterated assurances it gave in March that no more than 1.5m card numbers were at risk in the breach and that it was confined to its processing system in North America.Days after the breach was revealed, Visa, the world’s largest payment processor, removed Global Payments from a list it publishes for merchants of data processors that meet industry standards for security.A spokesperson for Global Payments was not available to comment on card associations that may have taken similar steps.Global Payments said it hoped to regain its security status following an investigation into the breach.“We anticipate that we will be reinstated to those lists at the conclusion of the revalidation and any required remediation,” the company said on a website it set up to provide information on the security breach.In April, MasterCard had said it would consider what steps to take based on the findings of an external and independent investigation.Losing the seal of approval on security from Visa or other brands does not preclude Global Payments from processing transactions.Global Payments is the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to the Nilson Report, a payment industry newsletter. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.Global Payments said it continued to work with third parties, regulators and lawmakers to minimise the impact of the breach on cardholders.On Tuesday, Global Payments shares rose 1.1 per cent to $46.92.
5;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2012-04-03T03:17:23Z;Concerns remain over data security standards;;The data security breach at Global Payments, an Atlanta-based credit card payment processor, has highlighted once again that those companies involved in the complex payment processing chain are among the prime targets for hackers and cyber criminals.Global Payments said the breach involved the “export” of “Track 2” data related to about 1.5m Visa and MasterCard-branded cards, but insisted that cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers were not compromised.Global Payments is the latest in a long list of companies including Citigroup, Epsilon Data Management, Heartland Payment Systems and CardSystems Solutions that have suffered data breaches in recent years affecting hundreds of millions of consumers and causing considerable expense for card issuers, banks and others in the payments chain. The Heartland Payment Systems attack alone in 2009 is estimated to have compromised up to 130m credit and debit cards.Despite detailed investigations, the perpetrators of these attacks are often never caught. However the arrest and subsequent conviction of Albert Gonzalez, a former law enforcement informant, who pleaded guilty in 2010 to the Heartland attack, provided a rare insight into the shadowy world of cybercrime.During a five-year cybercrime spree Gonzalez, who was given a 20-year prison sentence for the Heartland attack, is believed to have netted almost $3m which he used to buy an apartment in Miami, a car, Rolex watches and a Tiffany ring for his girlfriend. After his arrest, federal investigators found more than $1m in cash buried in a barrel in his parent’s backyard in Florida. Meanwhile, his crimes cost companies, banks and insurers almost $200m, according to the justice department.So far, Global Payments has made few details about the breach available and has yet to quantify the costs that it might incur though it has acknowledged that it is likely to record a charge once all the costs have been tallied.It may, however, have already suffered what some security experts term a “reputational hit” to its brand. Visa’s decision to drop the company from its registry of providers that meet the PCI credit card processing security standards is an inevitable consequence of security breach.Global Payments executives said they are confident that the company will regain its compliance rating with Visa and MasterCard “as soon as possible”. But the latest breach is likely to raise questions about whether the industry’s security standards are set high enough.As one security expert told a ZDNet blog, “the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is highly prescriptive in nature, but simply complying does not ensure credit card security. Companies that rely on PCI DSS to solely dictate their security measures will continue to remain vulnerable to attack.”It may also reignite demands for a comprehensive review of security breach notification rules in the US – currently a patchwork of mostly state-level laws requiring disclosure to consumers when personal information is compromised.While the Global breach reportedly happened between January 21 and February 25 and was discovered in early March, it was not until Friday after trading of its stock was halted following press reports that the company publicly acknowledged the breach.
6;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2012-04-02T22:35:01Z;Scale of credit card breach revealed;;Global Payments, a processor of credit and debit card transactions involving brands such as Visa and MasterCard, on Monday sought to ease concerns about a security breach that put up 1.5m card numbers in North America at risk of being stolen.Officials stressed that the company detected the hacking itself and Paul Garcia, the chairman and chief executive, said it was “making significant progress in defining and rectifying the event”.That was not enough to convince Visa. The world’s largest payment processor removed Global Payments from a list it publishes for merchants of data processors that meet industry standards for security. The move does not preclude Global Payments from processing transactions, including those involving Visa, but it could be a disincentive for some customers to do business with the company.Global Payments works behind the scenes in card transactions, serving as the seventh-largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. In 2011, Global Payments processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.MasterCard said it would consider what steps to take based on the findings of an external and independent forensic investigation.Global Payments said it was too soon to even estimate the cost to the company, but that it has insurance for these events.“This is manageable,” Mr Garcia said. “We will get through this.”The company also plans to spend more money on security and will work to get back on Visa’s registry.The breach occurred on a small number of Global Payments’ servers. The thieves did not obtain cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers. Company officials said Global Payments was “on the hook” for replacement cards.The three largest consumer credit lenders – Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan – would not comment on whether they had detected any fraudulent transactions. Discover, a card issuer that also owns its own network, said it had seen “some fraudulent activity that we believe is related to this compromise and will reissue accounts as appropriate”. American Express said it was still trying to ascertain any related theft using its cards.Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said that “there is some concern about how much the breach will cost Global Payments in the future and what it says about their technology platform and their franchise”. But 1.5m accounts was “rather small” for a breach of this kind, Mr Brendler said, referring to a 2009 hacking at Heartland Payment Systems, which compromised 130m accounts. “If they can act quickly and get back on Visa’s approved list, the damage could be contained.”On Monday, shares of Global Payments fell 3.7 per cent to $45.74. The shares dropped 9 per cent on Friday before they were suspended from trading.
7;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2012-04-02T21:06:38Z;Groupon shares sink on revenue revisions;;Shares in Groupon sunk by nearly 17 per cent on Monday as investors reacted to a restatement of revenue figures by the offers website as well as the company’s admission of “material weakness” in its internal controls.Revenues for the largest online offers website by sales were lowered $14.3m to $492.2m, the company said late on Friday after trading. Groupon blamed the revision, which wiped out its operating profits for the final months of last year, on its failure to account properly for the increased likelihood of customers seeking refunds in its newest markets.Analysts were mixed in assessing the impact the restatement would have on its shares, which are trading almost 25 per cent below their initial public offer price of $20.“We do not view the restated financials and internal process weakness as indications of fundamental softening in Groupon’s model, as indicated in the [first quarter 2012] guidance affirmation,” said Doug Anmuth, analyst at JPMorgan.“Instead we believe they reflect Groupon’s dynamic deal mix and the company’s extremely rapid growth in a very short amount of time,” Mr Anmuth added, while reducing his price target for the company’s shares to $22 from $24, but maintaining his “hold” rating.Justin Post, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said Groupon has been his team’s most disappointing call of 2012. “While we remain constructive on the local deals opportunity, and we see this accrual change as an estimation mistake in an evolving hard-to-predict business, it should take several quarters for Groupon to gain investor confidence,” he said, downgrading the company from “buy” to “hold” and lowering its price target from $30 to $20.Shares in Groupon finished down 16.9 per cent to $15.28 and have fallen by more than 26 per cent in the year to date.Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, rose 17.3 per cent to $22.70 as it rejected a $10bn cash bid from Coty, the privately owned fragrance group.Avon rebuffed the latest Coty proposal one hour after the fragrance group made the bid offer public. Avon said the proposal undervalued it and that it was “substantially the same as” an offer made two weeks ago, which it had also rejected.Shares in the cosmetics group are now up by more than 30 per cent in the year to date.After a negative start to the day, the S&P 500 climbed 0.7 per cent to 1,418.90 and reached cyclical highs yet again, as the first session of the second quarter commenced.The benchmark index was buoyed by US manufacturing data that showed growth picked up in March on stronger hiring and production.The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.4 in March from the February reading of 52.4, beating economist estimates of 53. Readings above 50 indicate growth in the sector. Elsewhere, the commerce department said construction spending unexpectedly dropped by the most in seven months despite the unseasonably warm weather.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,264.49, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.9 per cent at 3,119.70.Express Scripts, the health benefits manager, climbed 2.4 per cent to $55.50 as the Federal Trade Commission approved its merger with rival Medco Health Solutions. The takeover bid was valued at $29.1bn. If the deal is completed, it would create the biggest manager of prescription-drug benefits for corporate and government clients.Shares in Medco were down 1 per cent to $71.85, having risen nearly 30 per cent in the year to date.Lions Gate Entertainment, producer of the television series Mad Men, fell 4.5 per cent to $13.30 as the company’s latest blockbuster, Hunger Games, dominated box office returns for a second consecutive weekend, grossing $61.1m in ticket sales. The movie has generated more than $250m in the US and Canada in its first 10 days of release.Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, added 3.2 per cent to $618.63 as a report said one analyst at Topeka Capital had set a price target of $1,001 for its shares, with “no end in sight” to its recent gains.Hartford Financial Services Group, the insurance provider, rose 4.1 per cent to $21.95 as the company said it would repurchase $2.43bn worth of securities it sold to Allianz, the German insurer, during the depths of the financial crisis. Under the terms of the deal, Hartford will replace $1.75bn of debt – yielding 10 per cent – it owes to Allianz with lower yielding new debt.Global Payments, a processor of credit and debit card transactions involving brands such as Visa and MasterCard, fell another 3.7 per cent to $45.74 as it updated markets on the security breach of its system. The processing company said on Sunday up to 1.5m card numbers in North America may have been stolen by hackers.Visa and MasterCard, the world’s largest payment processors, were both up however on Monday, gaining 0.8 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively.
8;GPN;Global Payments Inc;2012-03-30T22:52:12Z;MasterCard and Visa warn of data breach;Visa and MasterCard;Visa and MasterCard, the word’s largest payment processors, warned that their cardholders’ account information may have been put at risk as a third-party processor of card transactions reported that its systems had been breached.Both companies said they had alerted card issuers regarding accounts that may have been affected. Visa said card account information from “all major card brands” may have been affected.Global Payments of Atlanta, Georgia, a provider of payment processing services for credit, debit and gift cards, said on Friday that it had determined in early March that card data may have been accessed, and contacted federal law enforcement. It said it identified “unauthorised access into a portion of its processing system” and continues to investigate.Global Payments, Visa and MasterCard all declined to comment on how many cardholders were potentially at risk. Visa and MasterCard said their systems were not compromised.The US Secret Service was investigating the breach, said George Ogilvie, a spokesman for the agency.Global Payments also said it “promptly notified appropriate industry parties to allow them to minimise potential cardholder impact”.Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, the three largest consumer credit card lenders, declined to comment, but people familiar with investigations said lenders were working with payment processors and were preparing to field customer inquiries about suspicious charges on their cards. It was unclear if any fraudulent charges had been made.American Express and Discover also said they were monitoring their accounts for suspicious activity.Global Payments is the seventh largest processor of card payments for merchants, according to The Nilson Report. Last year, it processed more than $120bn of transactions using Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards.Global Payments’ shares fell 9.1 per cent to $47.50 before they were suspended from trading early Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.“This situation speaks fundamentally to questions about how safe and secure our data is with those who have been entrusted with it,” said Denee Carrington, an analyst at Forrester Research.Last year, Citigroup fell victim to a hacking attack that exposed data on hundreds of thousands of credit card holders and raised broader concerns about online protections. This prompted the US Department of Homeland Security to join with federal law enforcement authorities to advise financial institutions on how to protect themselves from online breaches.Ms Carrington said she was troubled by the lack of information that card issuers and payment processors were providing on how the latest breach happened and how many cardholders were affected. She said the timeline of when the breach occurred and how quickly Global Payments detected it will be key for future consumer confidence in these systems.Additional reporting by Kara Scannell in New York
