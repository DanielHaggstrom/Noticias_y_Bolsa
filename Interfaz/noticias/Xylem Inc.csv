None of these claims is entirely true, but they help show why the smart metering business is not always as profitable as might be imagined.Toshiba confirmed this week that if no buyer materialises, it will float smart meter subsidiary Landis+Gyr in Zurich later this year. Valuations of around $2bn are mooted — around 10 times adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That is comparable to US-listed Itron, and what Xylem paid for Sensus, a water metering specialist, in 2016.There are over 200m smart meters installed worldwide (excluding China, a closed market) according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The rollout is mostly driven by legislation, which implies a profit bonanza since companies do not have to spend on marketing to create demand. But in many countries, consumers can choose not to have meters installed and remain sceptical as to their benefits. The hardware is becoming increasingly commoditised, with thin margins. IHS forecasts that revenues from metering and communications will grow just 3 per cent a year from 2016-2022.Landis has grown more rapidly than that, and expects to continue doing so, That is partly because it has already shifted towards related services such as software and communications. As a result, capital spending should not need to rise much above the current $50m-$60m a year even as revenues grow. That may boost free cash flow. The company is courting Swiss investors with a high dividend payout ratio.Smart meters are replaced more frequently than conventional units, so demand will not vanish once the initial rollout has ended. But it may yet be that utilities and grid operators, who stand to reap savings from better network management and billing, and often pass installation costs on to customers, end up the biggest winners.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

The US water technology company has struck a deal to acquire Sensus, a provider of advanced metering technologies to utilities, for $1.7bn in cash.The deal will help transform Xylem in one of the country’s leading provider of smart meters – a technology that is increasingly in demand as frequent droughts and new regulatory requirements force companies and consumers to monitor their water and energy consumption more closely.Xylem is buying Sensus from private equity funds The Jordan Company and GS Capital Partners 2000.“With Sensus, we will acquire a strategically valuable asset that will accelerate our ability to bring systems intelligence solutions to customers across the water and energy industries, establish a foundation for future growth and create significant shareholder value,” said Patrick Decker, Xylem president and chief executive.“This will be an important milestone in our strategy to move Xylem’s portfolio of solutions up the technology curve.”Sensus generated $837m in adjusted revenue and $159m in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in fiscal 2016, which ended March 31, 2016.Xylem expects to achieve at least $50 million in annual cost synergies to be substantially realized within three years of closing.
