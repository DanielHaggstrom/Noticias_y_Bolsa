The former economist says he identifies with the company more than is good for him. “If the company is doing badly, then I show it,” he says, admitting that during the early stages of the recession he was “like a sick dog”.But with this period of irritability behind him, Mr Rea, 56, is now showing plenty of good humour.Thanks to a steady global recovery, he thinks this year AES will for the first time gain annual sales of £100m, with three-quarters of revenues coming from exports and operating profits set for a 30 per cent rise.“We’ve been able to employ a lot of first-rate engineers in the past year and we have some excellent new products coming through the company,” says Mr Rea. “In fact I’ve got so many good people now that I’m beginning to wonder if there’s anything for me to do here any more.”Mr Rea’s company is the world’s fourth-biggest specialist in engineering seals – components in rotating machinery in operations from chocolate works to oil refineries.It has 1,220 employees globally, with 450 in the UK, of whom about half are in Rotherham, and another 450 in distribution operations in countries including the US, Brazil, Germany and Argentina.The company does 90 per cent of its manufacturing in Britain. The rest is done in two plants in China and India, employing 300 between them.While last year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were £12.9m from sales of £84m, Mr Rea predicts ebitda will grow to £17m in 2010.He is feeling more confident today than two years ago, when he says the company’s net debt was too big, pushing it close to breaching banking covenants.But while net debt stood at £32m at the end of 2008, cuts in capital investment – from £10.6m in 2008 to roughly a quarter of this last year – and tighter controls on inventories, brought the figure down to £25m at the end of 2009. By December 31 this year, it should have fallen to £20m, Mr Rea says.“I realised the company was standing on a burning plank and I had to tighten how we operated,” he says. “But we’ve come out [of the recession] as a better business.”Against the trends elsewhere in manufacturing, AES’s global job total has remained static over the past three years. It dipped from 1,230 in 2008 to 1,190 last year, but has since risen again due to higher demand.Mr Rea, born in Belfast, moved into manufacturing out of necessity. Working as a distributor of engineering seals in the late 1970s, he found that the company supplying them had suddenly pulled out, leaving him to find a new source of these items if he wanted to remain in a job.That forced him to start a production operation by finding good engineers and manufacturing specialists. Discussing his approach to recruitment, Mr Rea says: “I take on smart people, spend six months evaluating them and then leave them largely alone. If I take all the decisions, it’s a poor way to encourage people to behave responsibly.”In some ways, AES is an atypical Mittelstand business. It does not have the family structure seen in many such companies: Mr Rea owns 60 per cent of the shares, with the rest held by the 3i investment group. AES’s approach to borrowing has been more relaxed than similar businesses, where net debt is often close to zero.But where the business fits the model is in its emphasis on a narrow area of manufacturing, with few competitors. In AES’s case, its main rivals in seals are three much bigger companies: John Crane (part of Britain’s Smiths Group) and Flowserve, both of which are based in the US, and EagleBurgmann, in Germany.While emulating the global strategy of most Mittelstand companies, Mr Rea shares with his business counterparts an interest in thinking long-term.In 2002, when AES had sales of £35m and 600 staff, Mr Rea set out a goal of achieving £120m revenues in 2010 and doubling the number of employees: given the actual likely numbers, the projections seem robust.According to Mr Rea, half the company’s sales last year came from products that did not exist five years earlier. While the ratio seems small compared with some fields, such as consumer electronics, it is considered high for an area of industrial engineering.Last year, the company sold about 25,000 different types of seal to 2,000 customers – evidence of its skills in making products tuned to specific requirements.“About a fifth of our workforce …talk to industrial groups about the kinds of seals they need. Then they use the know-how in the rest of the company to make the products” says Mr Rea. “This consultancy-type approach is essential if …AES wants to maintain a competitive edge.”
