0;LRCX;Lam Research Corp;2011-12-15T21:47:19Z;FedEx results boost Wall Street;FedEx boosted by strong earnings;Shares in FedEx climbed 8 per cent to $83.47 after the package delivery service reported earnings for the three months ended November 30 that were 76 per cent higher than last year.“It’s good news for the domestic economy, and especially good news for anyone tied to eCommerce,” said Donald Broughton at Avondale Partners. “Management were clear that the incremental volume increase in ground shipping was due to a surge in eCommerce orders.”But sales rose much less than earnings, just 10 per cent year-on-year, and some analysts said there was little read across from the FedEx results to the wider economy.“A lot of investors look at FedEx as primarily a macro-driven stock that’s sensitive to volumes, but since DHL exited the US, the delivery market is effectively a duopoly. What we are seeing is FedEx and UPS pricing rationally to maintain earnings even if volumes are soft,” said Peter Nesvold at Jefferies.FedEx’s performance boosted shares in Amazon, which climbed 0.6 per cent to $181.26, but not Ebay, which fell 2.6 per cent to $29.60, on market chatter that December volumes on the auction site have been disappointing so far.Elsewhere, US stocks snapped three days of selling to eke out gains after new jobless claims fell to a three-year low.The S&P 500 climbed 0.3 per cent to 1,215.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,870.02.

Stephen Chin at UBS was unconvinced by the company’s plans to cut factory utilisation to 80 per cent and concentrate on developing large solar farms for sale to electricity utilities.“We believe First Solar may need to consider shutting down more capacity if it is unable to win more big projects,” he told clients.MEMC Electronic Materials, which manufactures wafers for use in solar panels, fell 5.2 per cent to $3.71. That left the tech sector of the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent, along with energy stocks, the only sector of the benchmark index to close in the red.Novellus Systems popped 16.3 per cent to $40.37 after Lam Research agreed to purchase the company for about $3.3bn in stock.

1;LRCX;Lam Research Corp;2011-12-15T00:39:41Z;US chip tool makers in $3.3bn merger;;Chip tool makers Lam Research and Novellus Systems have announced a $3.3bn merger on the same day the Gartner research firm predicted a 20 per cent decline in spending on semiconductor equipment in 2012.The two Silicon Valley companies said the merger was driven by significant synergies between their areas of equipment expertise: Lam supplies fabrication equipment for the etching of silicon wafers and Novellus is a market leader in enabling surface preparation and thin-film depositions on the wafers.Gartner predicted on Wednesday that worldwide spending on chip equipment would fall the most in 2012 in the area of wafer fab equipment, falling 22.9 per cent to $26.8bn. It predicted spending would shrink 19.5 per cent overall due to a “slowing macro economy, high inventories and a sluggish PC industry”.Lam will acquire Novellus in an all-stock transaction valued at around $3.3bn and the Lam Research name will be retained. Cost savings of around $100m a year are expected by the end of 2013 and the deal is expected to be accretive to Lam’s earnings within one year of the transaction’s close.Lam said the combined company would be well-positioned as the chip industry moves to next-generation technologies – ones that will require considerable investment as chips adopt 3D structures and the size of the circular wafers they are cut from grows from 300mm in diameter to 450mm.Lam also announced a $1.6bn stock buy-back programme. Its shares were down 4 per cent at $37.90 in extended trading on the news, with Novellus shares up nearly 20 per cent at $41.42. The transaction valued Novellus at $44.42 a share, a 28 per cent premium on its closing price of $34.70.

Companies have been forced into savage cost cutting as the effects of the credit crunch have sapped confidence and sent order books and commodity prices plummeting.Almost 30,000 job losses have been announced by British companies alone in the past two weeks.Richard Adkerson chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, which is cutting more than 600 jobs in the US, said: “We’re running our business on the basis of being prepared to live with low commodity prices for an extended period.”More than half the job losses this week, were announced by Citigroup, the US bank, which has increased the number of staff it is making redundant to 52,000.But even without Citigroup, businesses around the world announced job cuts at the rate of more than 5,500 a day. Economists expect worse to come as output falls in developed countries and growth continues to slow in emerging markets such as China and Russia.Carmakers and their suppliers, from component manufacturers to steel producers, have been particularly badly hit, prompting producers in the US to seek a government bail-out.Toyota, Japan’s biggest carmaker announced on Friday that it was cutting its domestic temporary workforce by 50 per cent, or 3,000 jobs. Mazda is not renewing contracts for 1,300 temporary staff while Isuzu, the Japanese truck manufacturer is scaling back production with the loss of 1,400 temporary and contract workers. Temporary and part-time workers account for about a third Japan’s workforce. Asian business centres are also starting to feel the backlash of big job cuts announced by international banks this year. HSBC was reported this week to be cutting 500 jobs, the bulk of them in Hong Kong. Morgan Stanley handed notices to about 100 of its 1,700 Hong Kong staff while Standard Chartered is eliminating 527 jobs at its main office in South Korea.European job losses are also mounting.

Global airline-passenger traffic, according to the International Air Transport Association, dropped in September in the first fall for five years.Air New Zealand announced plans to axe 200 jobs this week while Deutsche Lufthansa is cutting about 500 staff at its regional carrier CityLine.In the US, where the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is highest for a quarter of century, jobs are being cut in almost every sector.In addition to the continuing flow of redundancies at financial services companies, job losses were announced this week at Pepsi Bottling Group (3,150 jobs to go of which 750 are in North America); Lam, the San Francisco chip equipment manufacturer (600); Pilgrim’s Pride, the largest US chicken producer (335); Boeing’s defence manufacturing plant at Wichita Kansas (800); International Game Technology, which manufactures computerised gaming machines (460); and Sara Lee which is closing a kosher hot dog and meat processing facility in Chicago (185).There are thousands of other jobs being cut at small businesses. According to figures from Automatic Data Processing the world’s largest payroll processing company, small businesses in the US employing 49 or fewer people lost 25,000 jobs in October."

There were some bright spots as shares in the transport and retail areas benefited from expectations that consumers would raise their spending as the so-called oil tax of high prices was diluted.Overhanging the market were better than expected economic reports that lowered odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year. “The catalyst for a stronger stock market in 2007 was an easing and right now the Fed is not going to do anything,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.Technology shares dominated activity this week, and their new year surge was ended by earnings that failed to vindicate recent market gains as well as lower guidance on the outlook for the current quarter and broker downgrades.The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 5.3 per cent this week, wiping out its prior gain for the year.Late on Friday, stocks were rangebound, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the notable laggard for the week.

8;LRCX;Lam Research Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
