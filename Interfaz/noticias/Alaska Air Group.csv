0;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2017-10-10T17:30:30Z;Airline stocks rally on improved outlook from United, American;;Shares in US airline operators took flight on Tuesday after United Continental Holdings and American Airlines delivered a more optimistic outlook for the third quarter despite the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that resulted in flight cancellations.American Airlines said it now expects third quarter total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to be up approximately 0.5 to 1.5 per cent, compared to its previous estimates for revenue to be flat or up as much as 1 per cent. The news helped lift American Airlines shares 5 per cent higher to $53.07.The improved outlook came despite the impact of the three hurricanes which resulted in 8,000 flight cancellations and a net negative impact to pre-tax earnings of about $75m.Separately, United Continental Holdings said in a SEC filing that it expects third quarter unit revenue to decline between 3.5 to 4 per cent, which is smaller than the drop of as much as 5 per cent that it had forecast in September. United shares rose more than 5 per cent to $68.17.The updates helped allay fears about the financial fallout from the recent string of hurricanes that have battered southeastern US and Puerto Rico and concerns about a price war among airlines. The news helped lift the wider airline sector higher.
1;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2017-07-12T15:37:33Z;US airlines cruise higher on rosier outlooks from American, United;;It was clear skies for airline investors on Wednesday after both American Airlines and United Continental offered up rosier outlooks for the second quarter.Shares in American Airlines rallied more than 3 per cent to $53.32 after the Texas-based company said it expects its second-quarter total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to be up about 5 to 6 percent from a year ago. That compared to its previous guidance for a 3.5 to 5.5 per cent increase.Meanwhile, United Continental said late Tuesday that it expects second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to be up approximately 2 percent from a year ago — the midpoint of the company’s original guidance for between 1 to 3 per cent. That sent shares of the airline up nearly 4 per cent to $79.87at pixel time.United has been working to improve its image since April when a passenger was violently dragged from one of its flights by Chicago aviation police, leaving him with a concussion, a broken nose and two lost teeth. The airline has since settled with the passenger and worked to improve how it handles overbooking.The upbeat outlook also helped lift shares of rival US carriers.However, the broader NYSE Arca airlines index, which includes global carriers, was down 1.25 per cent for the day.
2;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2017-05-02T18:29:06Z;Airline shares take off with CEOs in the spotlight;;That could’ve been worse.Even as their senior officials lined up before a congressional committee to testify about consumer issues in the wake of the United Continental passenger-dragging controversy, airline shares are climbing higher on Tuesday.A lack of fireworks emanating from the hearing before the House of Representatives’ transportation committee seemed to assuage investors’ concerns about the long-term impact of the incident on United Continental and its fellow airlines, which has underscored fliers’ frequent grievances with air travel.United Continental — whose chief executive Oscar Munoz appeared before the committee to apologise yet again — saw its shares rise more than 4.3 per cent on Tuesday. Other airlines whose officials offered testimony were also enjoying a small bump, including a 3.5 per cent rise for American Airlines, a 1.7 per cent increase for Alaska Air and a 2.7 per cent boost for Southwest.One major airline that was absent from the hearing, Delta, saw the biggest gain of all, rising 5 per cent after announcing earlier in the day that its consolidated passenger unit revenue, PRASM — a key industry metric — was up 1 per cent in April year-over-year, despite a recent storm-fuelled snarl at its Atlanta hub.During the hearing, US lawmakers vented their frustrations over everything from baggage fees to the lack of storage space in overhead luggage bins and said they may consider taking some kind of action to protect air travellers’ consumer rights.It was the first of two congressional hearings scheduled in the wake of the United incident, with a Senate subcommittee set to hear from airline executives on Thursday.

The company said it expects the deal to close “in the very near future,” as it still faces antitrust litigation brought by private plaintiffs in California federal court.

Meanwhile, analysts at BB & T downgraded the stock from “buy” to “hold”.Adjusted National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data, a gauge of gun purchases, rose 16.7 per cent for handguns in March from a year ago, but declined 13.2 per cent from the previous month.Meanwhile, background checks for long guns rose 3.4 per cent year-on-year but fell 8 per cent sequentially.The sequential declines were the “weakest of the past decade and well below 10-year averages”, according to Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen.Handguns account for the biggest share of Smith & Wesson’s firearm sales and the March data could “augur tougher year-on-year NICS comparisons in coming months”, Mr Rumohr said.Smith & Wesson shares have advanced 150 per cent since the beginning of last year as concerns about tighter gun control measures under President Barack Obama drummed up demand for firearms.“The last surge was mainly driven by long guns/[modern sporting rifles] as fears of legislative bans drove demand, while the current period appears focused largely on purchase of handguns for personal protection post recent terrorist attacks in Paris etc,” Mr Rumohr noted.The news also weighed on shares in Sturm, Ruger & Co, which fell 8.91 per cent to $65.24.The sell-off came alongside a modest decline in US markets. The S&P 500 slid 0.3 per cent to 2,066, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.3 per cent to 17,736.80 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.46 per cent to 4,891.19.PulteGroup shares fell 6.57 per cent to $17.21 after the homebuilder said that its chairman and chief executive Richard Dugas Jr would retire in May 2017 as the company accelerated its succession plan.The Atlanta-based company said Mr Dugas’s decision was driven in part by pressure from founder Bill Pulte and his grandson Jim Grosfeld, who was appointed to the company’s board in December.“These individuals recently demanded an immediate CEO change and a different direction for the company,” PulteGroup said in a statement, adding that Mr Dugas offered to accelerate and make public the succession plan in order to “avoid a contested public battle that would not be in the interests of the shareholders”.Mr Dugas joined PulteGroup in 1994 and has served as chief executive since July 2003.Elsewhere, Tesla shares advanced 3.96 per cent to $246.99 as the electric automaker rides the momentum from demand for its mass market Model 3 car, which it unveiled on Thursday.Elon Musk, chief executive of the Palo Alto-based company, said in a tweet that orders for the Model 3 had reached 276,000 by the end of Saturday.Virgin America shares advanced 41.67 per cent to $55.11 after Alaska Air agreed to buy the carrier in a deal that values Virgin America at $57 per share or $2.6bn.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
5;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2016-04-04T10:13:36Z;Alaska Air and Virgin America seal tie-up;;Wheels down.Alaska Air has wrapped up the deal to buy Virgin America – a move that was thought to be circling for a landing soon.The deal values Virgin America at $57 per share, or $2.6bn, above the $55 a share that had been expected. Integration costs are expected to total up to $350m.Alaska Air said the deal will make it the fifth largest US airline, with 1,200 daily departures. It was agreed unanimously by both sets of shareholders, and while the deal is subject to some regulatory clearance, it is expected to conclude by the turn of the year.Virgin America, now the ninth-largest US carrier by passenger traffic, began flying out of a San Francisco hub in 2007 and currently serves 18 US cities and three in Mexico.Alaska, which has a market capitalisation of $10.2bn, operates flights in more than 100 cities in the US, Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico.
6;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2016-04-03T17:55:27Z;Virgin America close to sale to Alaska Air;$2bn bid would value Branson-backed US carrier at large premium to market price;Virgin America is set to announce its sale to Alaska Air on Monday in a deal valuing the US carrier at about $2bn — or about $55 a share, said a person familiar with the matter.Alaska first contacted Virgin America at the start of the year, triggering a sale process and interest from other companies — including JetBlue, one of the largest low-cost carriers in the US.The proposed sale terms would represent a significant premium to Virgin America’s market valuation. The airline went public in a November 2014 listing priced at $23 per share, and its stock stood at $38.90 at the close of trading on Friday.The deal, the first significant airline deal since US Airways and American Airlines combined in 2013 to form the world’s largest carrier, would strengthen Alaska’s position on the west coast, where it competes with the likes of Southwest Airlines.Virgin America, now the ninth-largest US carrier by passenger traffic, began flying out of a San Francisco hub in 2007 and currently serves 18 US cities and three Mexican ones.Alaska, which has a market capitalisation of $10.2bn, operates flights in more than 100 cities in the US, Canada, Costa Rica and Mexico.The two companies could not immediately be reached for comment.Virgin America is operated independently of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic. However, his VX Holdings group owns a 30.85 per cent stake in Virgin America, according to Bloomberg data.The company raised $307m in its 2016 initial public offering, in which Sir Richard’s group sold 13.3m shares.
7;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Earnings at US airlines suffer with rise in fuel prices;;Rising fuel prices hit US airline earnings during the first quarter of the year as energy costs climbed faster than revenues, driving a handful of carriers to report losses and denting profits at others.On Thursday, Southwest Airlines, the low-cost US carrier, reported a rare underlying loss in the period, AMR, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, reported a smaller but still sizeable loss and Alaska Air Group reported a modest drop in profits.Fuel is the single largest expense for airlines and analysts at JPMorgan estimate that to offset a $5 per barrel increase in the price of oil, carriers must successfully boost domestic fares by about $6 per round-trip and international fares by $19 per round-trip.Still, observers remain optimistic about the prospects for US airlines over the full year given the resilient demand for air travel, the growth of bag and other fees and industry consolidation that has increased pricing power and helped to restrain capacity.“The industry continues to face many challenges,” Ray Neidl, with Maxim Group, wrote earlier this month. “At the same time [it] is probably in its strongest position that it has been since deregulation.”While the industry is expected to lose about $815m in the first quarter, typically the weakest of the year, analysts predict the sector will generate profits of about $900m for the full year.At Southwest, during the first quarter fuel costs rose about 17 per cent per gallon while average passenger fares increased only about 5 per cent to $146.44, resulting in lower operating profits. For the three months to the end of March, Southwest lost $18m, or $0.02 per share, excluding certain special items, compared to a profit of $20m, or $0.03 per share. Overall, net income was $98m, or $0.13 per share, thanks to $116m of hedging gains.Revenues jumped 29 per cent to $4bn, as the company benefited from its acquisition of AirTran in May 2011, and management noted that “traffic and booking trends, thus far in April, are solid”.Meanwhile, AMR said that it lost $248m in the quarter, excluding restructuring costs, compared with a $405m loss in the first quarter of 2011. Overall, American reported a $1.7bn loss, up from $436m, as the costs of reorganising the company within the Chapter 11 process continued to mount.Tom Horton, chief executive of AMR, said he was “encouraged by the improvement”, noting that revenues climbed about 9 per cent to $6bn while passenger yields, a measure of average fares, rose 7.3 per cent in the first quarter.For its part Alaska Air Group reported net income of $28.3m in the first quarter, or $0.39 per share, excluding special items, down from $29.5m, or $0.40 per share in the same period a year earlier. Revenues rose 8 per cent to about $1bn. In mid-morning trading on Thursday Southwest shares rose about 4 per cent to $8.23, while Alaska shares held steady at about $35.
8;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2012-04-08T22:47:17Z;Rivals push merger scenario for AMR;;In recent weeks AMR, the bankrupt parent of American Airlines, has made the case to its creditors, customers and employees that it should remain a standalone carrier, using Chapter 11 to restructure its operations and position itself for future success.Behind the scenes, however, rivals have been pushing a different theory to many of the same constituents, arguing that AMR must merge with another US carrier as a way to revitalise its network and smooth the reorganisation process.Advocates present a long list of reasons for a merger. Foremost is the state of AMR’s domestic network, particularly on the US east coast, which appears to have lost traction with lucrative business customers following large airline deals such as the United-Continental tie-up in 2010.AMR accepts that it has work to do but sees organic growth at its hubs as the solution. The company plans to increase departures by 20 per cent in five cities and intends to use bigger regional aircraft and shift more flying to third parties to boost revenues and improve efficiency.Even so, observers worry that AMR may struggle to match its rivals. Unions are opposed to what they see as more outsourcing, and in New York the carrier is hampered by its JFK hub, where capacity constraints make it hard to add domestic flights.All of that, supporters say, points towards a merger with another US carrier with a large domestic network. Both Delta Air Lines and US Airways would fit the bill and are examining a deal, according to people familiar with the matter.Any deal would also have potential financial benefits. Previous large-scale airline mergers have produced revenue and cost synergies of up to $1.5bn. That is money that could be used to pay unsecured claims, boost profits and revamp AMR’s ageing fleet.A tie-up with Delta would give AMR heft in markets such as Los Angeles and Asia where it has a limited presence. But a deal would tear apart one of the three main airline alliances and would likely raise substantial antitrust issues.By contrast, a US Airways deal would alter, but not fundamentally reshape, the industry landscape. JPMorgan estimates that a tie-up would push AMR’s non-hub US domestic market share from fourth position on the eastern and western regions to second.Benefits would trickle down to AMR’s influential Oneworld alliance partners too. The grouping lags behind its peers in terms of scale and securing a defection from the rival Star Alliance would add dozens of new destinations in the eastern region.“US Airways and American, that’s potentially a positive development,” Willie Walsh, head of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, said in February after noting the regulatory hurdles to a potential Delta-AMR deal.“[However], I’m sure American would want to control that,” he added, “and they’re not very enthusiastic about the sounds that have come from Doug Parker [chief executive] at US Airways”.Certainly pulling off a transaction will be tough. In public AMR insists that it will only consider consolidation after emerging from Chapter 11. For now the carrier says it is “laser focused” on its own plans to cut costs by $2bn and boost sales by $1bn.AMR has also moved effectively to box out third parties. In March, the company secured an extended exclusivity period from the bankruptcy court, giving it the right to lead the restructuring until September. AMR can petition to extend that period for up to 18 months.The same month, the carrier offered a major concession to the US pension insurance agency in what observers described as an effort to appease an influential player that might otherwise have been tempted to ally with outside groups to secure a better deal.That may be for the best, says Adam Pilarski, with Avitas, the aviation consultancy. The last thing AMR needs, he says, is additional complexity on top of the challenging bankruptcy process.He adds that US Airways comes with plenty of baggage. The airline is still grappling with the legacy of a previous merger with America West Airlines that left its pilots locked in a protracted internecine court battle.Indeed, US Airways has its own imperatives for pursuing a deal. While the carrier has worked hard to become profitable, industry consolidation has left it stuck in the middle, “neither fish nor fowl”, says Mr Pilarski, “too big to be nimble like Allegiant Air, too small to be a global competitor.”Moreover, it is unclear who would run a combined carrier. “US Airways management would have to quit to make a deal with AMR work,” says one industry banker. “The social issues are solvable but I think they are solvable on AMR’s terms.”Bill Swelbar, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s International Center for Air Transportation, argues that there is something slightly artificial about the drumbeat of stories on consolidation, fostered by well-timed leaks, that imply AMR must merge with US or Delta or perish.“American has other options,” he says. AMR already plans to extend its code-sharing agreements with Alaska Airlines and JetBlue and either of those carriers, with their strengths on the western and eastern regions respectively, could make a handy merger partner.Mr Swelbar sees no reason why AMR can’t wait until it completes its restructuring process – and determines the viability of its new network – before looking for a partner. “The speculation is that this has to happen now, and I am not sure it does.”
9;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2011-12-02T19:23:05Z;American Airlines in search of new horizons;;In 2003 American Airlines was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy when it pulled back. After securing substantial concessions from its workers, American said it would not follow its peers into Chapter 11 but would stand behind its obligations.“We are not out of the woods yet,” Gerard Arpey, the then newly appointed chief executive told his staff. “Working with our unions and all of our employees, together we will put American Airlines back on top.”Eight years later, that co-operative approach is in tatters. American Airlines, once the most prestigious brand in aviation, is working its way through the bankruptcy process it fought so hard to avoid and its workers face dramatic cuts to pay and benefits.“Simply put, their strategy didn’t work,” said Adam Pilarski, with aviation consultancy Avitas. “Certainly people said ‘they are honest while the others are all crooks’ but, while that may reserve them a better spot in the afterlife, in practical terms it didn’t help.”Indeed, hobbled by uncompetitive costs, restive employees and a fleet of gas-guzzling aircraft, American continues to lose money, while its rivals, which used the courts to restructure, have returned to profitability.“We fought the good fight,” Tom Horton, the new chief executive of American, said on Tuesday. “We worked honourably to avoid [Chapter 11] but we have to turn the page. Circumstances have changed and we have to make the company competitive.”In bankruptcy, American and its parent company AMR Corporation, will have greater latitude to rewrite labour contracts and tear up leases for older aircraft that are less fuel efficient.American could even move on the offensive, said Will Randow with Citigroup. He notes that on Tuesday shares in US Airways jumped as investors speculated about an eventual tie-up between the two companies.“US Airways has tried to bid for every US legacy airline either inside or outside of bankruptcy,” he said. “Mr Horton is much more open to the consolidation process than his predecessor, and he might even try to make a bid for US Airways himself.”Still, according to Gordon Bethune, who led a turnround at Continental Airlines in the 1990s, bankruptcy is not a panacea. “Bankruptcy will fix your balance sheet and give you a chance. But it won’t fix your company. If you are a shitty company you need to change.”On Thursday morning, Gerard Arpey, the former chief executive of American Airlines, started his new job: partner in Emerald Creek Group, a tiny, Texas-based private equity company that invests in real estate, particularly Californian farm land, writes Jeremy Lemer.The move is a stark change for Mr Arpey, who spent almost 30 years working for American Airlines until abruptly retiring on Tuesday, just as the company entered Chapter 11 protection.Mr Arpey will find at least one familiar face at Emerald Creek. The group is headed by Larry Kellner, former chief executive of Continental Airlines and Mr Arpey’s long-time business rival.In an interview, Mr Kellner said he had made Mr Arpey an off-the-cuff offer to work together some years back but the partnership had actually come together quickly in the last week or so.Mr Kellner, who has a background in real estate, expects Mr Arpey to take to the business quickly.He said: “Real estate is different from running an airline, but I have always believed in working with smart people with great integrity, and that is Gerard.”In the short term, he expects the biggest beneficiaries to be AMR’s competitors. “There will be some migration to Delta Air Lines and United because of the uncertainty at American. Fairly or not, passengers worry about their frequent flyer miles,” he said.Since Tuesday, shares in United and Delta have jumped more than 15 per cent, outpacing the S&P 500 index.Other beneficiaries may include partners such as Alaska Airlines and regional airline operators such as SkyWest, which will be able to provide more of American’s domestic flights if the company uses bankruptcy to jettison restrictive clauses in its labour contracts.But executives expect the global airline industry to benefit broadly as American retrenches. As supply comes down, airlines should be able to take advantage of limited demand by raising, or at least stabilising, prices.“For the industry, the bankruptcy is probably positive because there will be fewer seats flying around. It is one of these bizarre situations where on average this is a pretty good thing,” said Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of Avolon, an aircraft leasing company.JPMorgan predicts that American will trim as much as 10 per cent of its flying, with cuts focused on markets such as Chicago and New York where rivals are strong.Gary Chase, at Barclays Capital, argues that the American bankruptcy filing, and the pain it is likely to impose on workers, may help other airlines cut better deals with their employees.“AMR is the high bar for labour costs among legacy carriers. If the company aggressively moves to reduce those costs, we believe carriers like United and Delta will experience less pressure on their own labour costs,” Mr Chase wrote to clients.But there are reasons for caution. Despite the sobering developments at American, relations between many airlines and their unions remain contentious. Just this month, pilots at United accused management of skimping on training and compromising safety, a claim the airline dismissed as “baseless”.Vicki Bryan, at Gimme Credit, a bond research company, says her peers may be too optimistic about industry prospects, pointing out that American has already launched cuts in fares to maintain market share.“Given AMR’s size and what will likely prove to be a long, messy restructuring process, its bankruptcy could have a prolonged and depressing effect on already precarious industry pricing and profits as travel demand continues to cool,” she wrote to clients.A faltering economic recovery could overturn any modest industry boost from the AMR bankruptcy. Air cargo volumes, widely seen as a leading indicator for passenger demand, have dropped about 5 per cent since June, according to industry figures.“We cannot ignore the facts. Airline data (has) weakened, and may weaken further, while airline news flow has also deteriorated. It is not all bad, but we would say it is definitely less good,” Rob Stallard of RBC Capital wrote in a note to clients.
11;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2011-07-24T18:35:28Z;Customers forced Boeing’s hand on new engine option;737 decision is a watershed for aircraft industry;At the American Airlines press conference to showcase a huge order for aircraft last week, Jim Albaugh, chief executive of Boeing Commercial, joked about sharing the limelight and the contract with his counterpart at rival Airbus.But the smiles and camaraderie could do little to disguise Mr Albaugh’s discomfort. Not only did the company receive a smaller order than Airbus from a traditionally stalwart customer, but to achieve that Boeing was rushed into announcing an upgrade of its popular 737 aircraft.While overshadowed by American’s near-$40bn order, for Boeing and the aircraft industry the 737 decision is a watershed. It gives the US company a chance to recapture ground lost to the Airbus A320 family in the battle for the lucrative short-haul market.The stakes are high. Narrow-body aircraft like the 737 are the workhorses of the global airline industry and analysts predict airlines will order about 23,000 worth almost $2,000bn over the next 20 years.That the move was publicised in such an unusual fashion demonstrates Boeing’s dilemma. For months the company has been mulling whether to add a new engine to its 737 family or redesign them completely.On the one hand, airlines and some leasing companies have pushed the company hard to find a short-term fix to the problem of rising oil prices by selecting existing engine technology capable of reducing fuel burn by about 15 per cent.On the other, the company’s engineering culture has pushed it to look beyond evolutionary improvements and gamble on a revolutionary approach that could lead to much greater fuel savings and allow it to dominate the market for decades.Caught between those two choices, Boeing has delayed, assigning two teams to rigorously assess each option, promising a decision by the end of the year and hoping that its customers would wait.In the end, they have not. Since Airbus, part of EADS, the European conglomerate, launched a re-engined version of its narrow-body last year, the a320neo has racked up well over 1,000 orders, most recently the sizeable commitment from American Airlines. The American order was particularly painful for Boeing. Since 1996 the group has had an exclusive supply arrangement with the airline. Southwest and Alaska are now the only big US airlines flying all-Boeing narrow-bodies.On Wednesday, Mr Albaugh said technology was available to develop a new narrow-body, but added that the company was not sure how to build 40 to 60 of them a month given the complex carbon composites they would likely require. “Quite frankly, we did not have those answers,” Mr Albaugh said. “And the longer it took to get that answer the more concern we got from our customers about the fact that they needed a more fuel efficient airplane now rather than later.”Still, observers argue Boeing has probably, belatedly, made the right choice. Once Boeing has completed its designs and received board approval, it will have a product to push back against Airbus. The re-engined 737 will enter service with American in 2018.“The only sorry thing about it is that Boeing didn’t wake up in time and messed its customers around for six months,” says Sash Tusa, with Echelon in London.Analysts estimate that developing the upgraded aircraft should cost up to $3bn. Conversely, developing an all-new aircraft could have cost more than $10bn, a huge sum for a company already investing in other programmes. At the same time, Doug Harned, with Bernstein Research, argues that a re-engined 737 will squeeze out new entrants to the narrow-body market, such as the CSeries produced by Bombardier of Canada, who have been nipping at the heels of Airbus and Boeing.Mr Albaugh says the company is already in discussions with partners and expects “quite a number of orders for whatever we call this re-engined 737” once it launches in the autumn.But Robert Stallard, with RBC Capital, argues that Boeing may regret its decision over the long term.“A completely new narrow-body, with [potentially] twice the efficiency savings of the Neo, would probably have been a big threat to Airbus post 2020. Instead, we have status quo at best – as we doubt Airbus will be content to stop with American,” he wrote.

Revenues rose 10.5 per cent to $3.5bn.Alaska Air Group, which runs Alaska Airlines, said that second-quarter net income fell to $28.8m, or $0.78 per share, compared to $58.6m, or $1.60 per share, in the same period in 2010. Revenues climbed 13.7 per cent to $1.1bn.In midday trading, shares in United Continental and Alaska Air were broadly flat at $20.34 and $65.81 respectively, while US Airways slipped about 2 per cent to $6.79.Scott Kirby, president of US Airways, said that, after a bumpy few months, underlying demand appeared to have stabilised and, with capacity set to decline towards the end of the year, airlines should be able to raise prices.“If you had a European sovereign default or that turned into a Lehman-like crisis then all bets are off the table or a US default, but absent an event like that … my guess is there’s probably more upside than most think right now in their base forecast,” Mr Kirby said.While Jeff Smisek, chief executive of United Continental, told investors: “We’re operating in a tepid economic environment in the US with significant uncertainty here and abroad.“[But] we have responded appropriately, raising fares in the face of high fuel costs and reducing our planned capacity to reflect the challenging environment that we face.”On Thursday, the company said it would further trim capacity in the fourth quarter.Mr Smisek said that the integration of United and Continental, which completed a $3.5bn merger last October, was progressing, but admitted that the company was not likely to reach a new deal with its unions this year, as previously predicted.Analysts are expecting a steady if unspectacular earnings season. Michael Linenberg at Deutsche Bank predicts sales at the largest US airlines will rise about 14 per cent to $35.3bn compared to last year, but pre-tax profits will slip 38 per cent to about $1.3bn.Mr Linenberg argues that airlines have been able to pass on higher fuel costs – although recent fare momentum has stalled – but he expects other items such as labour to eat into margins, trimming them to about 6.3 per cent from 10 per cent in the second quarter of 2010.On Wednesday, American Airlines reported a second-quarter loss but the figures were overshadowed by news that the carrier would place a huge aircraft order. American executives suggested they had stolen a march on their competitors by locking up production slots for new aircraft.But executives at United Continental said on Thursday that the order would have little impact on their airline and might even prove beneficial because it had encouraged Boeing to announce a long-awaited plan to re-engine its best-selling 737 aircraft in the next few years.“We are comfortable with the skyline that we have and the availability of the skyline,” Mr Smisek said. “We are more than happy to compete against American and anyone else with our network and our fleet and our product and our people.”
13;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2011-01-31T15:21:17Z;US airlines;Taking off again, but there may be turbulence ahead;After a horrible 2009, US airlines have surged back. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Continental and US Airways have all reported either jumbo profits for 2010, or significantly narrowed losses. And the good times look set to continue. Barclays Capital expects the US airline industry to earn about $9bn in operating profit in 2011, slightly higher than last year’s record.The bad news is that one key cause of the profit boost is not likely to last long. This reporting season, chief executives have been quick to thrust their capacity management capabilities into the limelight. The industry’s revenue per mile rose almost one-third in the past 12 months as 82 per cent of seats on North America’s planes carried paying passengers. That is a higher proportion than in any other region in the world, according to the International Air Transport Association, and was enabled by last year’s meagre 3.5 per cent increase in capacity, measured in available seat kilometres.However, limiting supply growth to drive ticket prices up and costs down creates a prisoner’s dilemma. There are short-term profits to be made by being the first to add seats on busy routes. In this super-competitive industry the temptation will be too great to resist, sooner rather than later.Even before then, fuel price inflation could slash profits. The economic recovery is gradual but – even before Egypt took the headlines – the price of oil has been rising fast. Morgan Stanley estimates that with jet fuel at $120 per barrel (up from the current $110), Delta could lose one-third of its net earnings, United and American more than half, and US Airways significantly more. The least worst off – a 14 per cent drop – would be Southwest and Alaska Air. The latter of these two trades below its peers yet has a robust earnings outlook.

14;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2009-07-26T21:19:25Z;Flying far and wide on the back of airline loyalty;;Another day, another flight. As sales director for Rearden Commerce, a start-up in Foster City, California, Mike Lawrence flies 100,000 miles a year but admits that since the recession, his travel is under greater scrutiny. “Not so much on whether I need to go to a different city for a meeting, but making sure I opt for the lowest cost in all areas of travel – air, car, hotel, dining, parking. All of it matters now,” he says.Yet Mr Lawrence still makes sure he chooses the same airline when possible. “Frequent flyer programmes have always been very important in influencing my choice. With Alaska Airlines, my Gold status means I get automatic upgrade to first class in most cases, better seats if not, pre-boarding, double miles – even a complimentary cocktail even if I’m in the back.”If you are lucky enough to still be in a job with an employer willing to pay your airfare, there has never been a better time to be a frequent flyer as under-pressure airlines slash the miles required by their loyalty programmes for redeeming free flights or doubling the miles that count towards “elite” status.But there is also another reason: frequent flyer miles sit heavily on an airline’s balance sheet as liabilities, until they are redeemed. So, it is little wonder that carriers are giving away more frequent flyer seats than ever. At Delta, the world’s biggest airline, the number of miles earned by customers annually over the past three years has grown 25 per cent, says Jeff Robertson, the company’s vice-president of loyalty programmes.Mr Robertson is behind perhaps this summer’s biggest promotion. Until the end of this year, passengers can earn double frequent flyer miles for all Delta and Northwest flights and in all classes of service. Flyers must hold a Delta SkyMiles credit card to earn the bonus miles, but the tickets do not have to be charged to the card.Other airlines, including American, United, Qantas and Jet Airways have been offering a raft of new deals to members of their loyalty programmes.Is the tactic working? There is some evidence that travellers are using miles now because they are cash strapped – or because they expect troubled airlines to increase reward levels in the coming months.But in this recession, the real value to airlines of loyalty programmes lies in their ability to generate cash rather than loyalty. “Frequent flyer programmes no longer serve to drive brand loyalty alone, but rather to deliver extra cash, mostly through the sale of miles to card-issuing banks,” says Jay Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive and now president of IdeaWorks, a consulting firm.At Delta alone, Mr Robertson says the SkyMiles and WorldPerks programmes are expected to generate more than $2bn (€1.4bn, £1.2bn) in revenue in 2009. United and Continental each raised cash last year from the advance sales of miles to their card partner, JPMorgan Chase.“Tough economic times have encouraged airlines to rely upon this kind of short-term gratification,” says Mr Sorensen, who reckons that when investor confidence returns some of the biggest airlines will try selling off their programmes.Until then, some carriers are trying to generate extra income from loyal customers through charges for priority treatment, such as faster security screening, upgrades and even the processing of miles award tickets.“The most enduring effect of the recession will be the nuisance fees now associated with the loyalty programmes” says Tim Winship, publisher of the FrequentFlier website. “The airlines are imposing them in a desperate attempt to shore up sagging revenues, and they won’t be rescinded in the foreseeable future.”“Frankly, with all the new fees and less capacity and fewer first class upgrades available every day, I’d just be happy to keep things where they are,” says Mike Lawrence, as he prepares for his next flight. “It’s a bit of a lame wish, but with everything happening in travel these days, I’d consider that to be a big step forward.”
15;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2009-07-09T20:39:29Z;Virgin America plans shake-up;;Virgin America, the carrier founded by Sir Richard Branson, is seeking US approval for a new slate of domestic investors it expects will end a rival’s bid to challenge the company’s ownership structure.Under the plan submitted to the Department of Transportation, the airline would receive new capital from a group of investors that includes Cyrus Capital Partners, people familiar with the matter said. Cyrus, a New York hedge fund, was one of Virgin America’s original shareholders.Virgin America began service in 2007 after a battle in Washington over rights to operate domestic flights and its ties to Sir Richard’s Virgin Group, which owns 24 per cent of the US airline.Alaska Airlines, which competes with Virgin America on routes to Seattle and other west coast cities, has questioned the carrier’s “US citizenship” and petitioned transport regulators in February to investigate its ownership structure. Federal laws cap foreign ownership of domestic airlines at 25 per cent.“This is a meritless petition,” Virgin America said at the time. “Nothing has changed in our ownership structure, which was approved by the DoT.“Should our ownership structure change in the future, we will of course notify the DoT in advance, so they can confirm our continuing compliance.”Alaska’s petition came as Black Canyon and Cyrus, Virgin America’s two US shareholders, exercised an option to recall their $150m investment in the company.Virgin America had hired Lazard, the investment bank, earlier in the year to recruit new domestic investors.The new round of capital may be less than $150m, reflecting the steep falls many US airline stocks have endured as demand slumped. Shares of Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest carrier, have lost half their value since the start of the year.People familiar with Virgin America’s structure note that its agreement with the DoT enabled it to keep Black Canyon and Cyrus as stakeholders and remain in compliance with foreign-ownership rules even if the two firms recalled their capital.Virgin Group plans to transfer the two firms’ stakes to its new US investor group once the structure plan is approved.By May, Virgin America was in talks with at least five US funds. Virgin America and Cyrus did not return calls.
16;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2009-05-14T19:27:35Z;Branson hits out at BA/AA tie-up;;Sir Richard Branson warned on Thursday that British Airways’ planned transcontinental venture with American Airlines could imperil Virgin Atlantic Airways, the carrier he founded 25 years ago, if it wins approval from US regulators.In his most searing critique yet of his rivals’ proposal, Sir Richard said the venture would grant these rivals a dominant share of key take-off and landing slots at London’s Heathrow Airport, the world’s most important international gateway, weakening their competitors and leading to higher fares and fewer transatlantic flights.“I cannot guarantee VA’s survival,” Sir Richard said during a speech in Washington. “It will be like competing with our hands tied behind our back.”BA, American and several other peers are seeking immunity from US anti-trust rules that would hinder their ability to share revenue and coordinate schedules and fares. Virgin has filed to contest the application, and plans to make its final submissions to the US Department of Transportation by Monday.BA and American launched earlier attempts to co-ordinate their activities in 1997 and 2001, but regulators required them to divest a large number of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, a price they deemed too high. The companies now argue that the competitive landscape has changed since the landmark ”open skies” accord opened Heathrow to more airlines.Besides, they point out, most of their biggest transcontinental competitors, from Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines to Lufthansa and United Airlines, already enjoy immunised ventures.“Our application is good news for customers,” American said in a statement. “They will gain greater access to discounted fares, smoother connections and more frequent flyer benefits and ultimately more travel choices.”Sir Richard disagreed, noting that Heathrow remains too congested to open slots to new competition.While Virgin Atlantic sought to derail its rivals’ venture, its sister company, Virgin America, awaits word from US transport officials on its future.Alaska Airlines questioned the carrier’s ”US citizenship” and petitioned regulators in February to open an inquiry into its ownership structure. Federal laws cap foreign holdings of domestic airlines at no more than 25 per cent.Earlier this year two US hedge funds, Virgin America’s majority owners, exercised an option to recall their $150m - leaving Virgin Group, which owns a 24 per cent stake, as Virgin America’s sole shareholder, people familiar with the matter said.Virgin America is in talks with at least five US investors and expects to find replacements for the two funds, Black Canyon and Cyrus Capital Partners, within the next two months, the people said.
17;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2009-02-10T19:33:36Z;Rival urges scrutiny of Virgin America;;Alaska Airlines has urged federal regulators to scrutinise Virgin America, the US carrier founded by the UK entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson this decade, and its right to operate domestic flights.The regional airline, which competes with Virgin America on routes to Seattle and other cities along the US West Coast, questioned the fledgling carrier’s “US citizenship” and petitioned the US Department of Transportation to open an inquiry into its ownership structure. Federal laws cap foreign ownership of domestic airlines at no more than 25 per cent.The petition follows a report last month in the Financial Times that Sir Richard’s Virgin Group, which owns 24 per cent of Virgin America, had expected the US investors in its sister company to exercise an option to recall their $150m investment – leaving Virgin Group as Virgin America’s sole shareholder.Keith Loveless, Alaska’s general counsel, said in a statement: “Alaska makes this request to ensure all US carriers are held to the same standard of compliance.”Virgin America began service in 2007 after a protracted battle in Washington over its rights to operate domestic flights and the company’s ties to Virgin Group.Virgin Group hired Lazard, the investment bank, to recruit new investors in the event that Virgin America’s two US shareholders, Black Canyon and Cyrus Capital Partners, exercised their option.Virgin Group would in turn transfer the firms’ ownership stakes to new US investors once they had committed, remaining in compliance with foreign ownership rules.While Black Canyon and Cyrus had yet to put back their investment, Virgin Group was still bracing for the decision, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Virgin America said: “This is a meritless petition. We are a US-owned and controlled airline that is in full compliance with the law and all Department of Transportation regulations.“Nothing has changed in our ownership structure, which was approved by the DOT. Should our ownership structure change in the future, we will of course notify the DOT in advance, so they can confirm our continuing compliance.”
18;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2008-06-05T18:02:35Z;Take-off delayed: America’s airlines are making drastic cuts;;Thirty years ago this October, President Jimmy Carter brought the regulated era of commercial US aviation to a close, opening the domestic market to competition, freeing carriers to set their own fares and paving the way for decades of rapid expansion.Forgive executives if they neglect to uncork the anniversary champagne.US carriers have descended into a crisis that will leave few, if any, unscathed. Fuel costs have surged in the past year, wiping out earnings and threatening to send even some of the largest airlines back to bankruptcy court. The economy’s slowdown has damped demand for business and leisure travel alike, leaving more empty seats on flights already struggling to make money.Irritating fees and frequent delays have tarnished the industry’s reputation with passengers, while recent restructurings and bankruptcies have strained relations with workers. As for airline stocks, their performance this year would make even Wall Street executives blush.Further evidence of the harsh conditions faced by the industry came on Thursday when Continental Airlines said it was cutting 3,000 jobs and taking 73 aircraft out of service. The news came a day after United Airlines announced that it planned to ground a fifth of its fleet.“A durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers,” Warren Buffett, the world’s richest man and a one-time airline investor, wrote recently. “If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting Orville down.”Mr Wright’s safe landing in North Carolina more than a century ago made it impossible for future generations of capitalists to imagine a world without flight, and it seems equally unlikely to many airline executives that the industry will ever return to a regulated era whose rationale, in part, was to help ensure their stability. The carriers that survive the current downturn will offset mounting fuel prices by finding the right balance between trimming unprofitable routes and raising fares, or merging with a peer that makes those choices easier.“We won’t see re-regulation,” says Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta Air Lines. “The marketplace is going to react to supply and demand the way an unregulated market should.”Air travel is more popular than ever. The 1978 measure has largely lived up to its mandate to “encourage, develop, and attain an air transportation system which relies on competitive market forces”. Affordable fares have helped free businesses to reach the rest of the world from practically any sizeable US city, spurring global trade and transforming the professional and personal lives of countless Americans. For those reasons, there is little groundswell in Washington to bring back regulations that would shelter airlines from competition.“No, it was a good idea,” said Representative James Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who, as chairman of the US House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is one of Capitol Hill’s most vocal members on most aviation issues. “Air travellers are still saving compared to pre-deregulation ticket prices.”While cheap fares and intense competition have remained constant since deregulation, financial stability at the airlines themselves has not. “There’s just so many risks to mitigate – it’s energy-intensive, subject to weather, it’s tough to execute a schedule and labour-intensive,” says Gary Kelly, chief executive of Southwest Airlines, the world’s largest low-cost carrier. “It’s a marginal profit at best for most airlines. Any change in the variables can have a pretty dramatic impact.”No single variable looms larger this year than fuel, which for most carriers has surpassed labour as the single-biggest expense. The run-up has forced carriers to take increasingly desperate measures. American Airlines will soon charge some passengers $15 to check a single bag, while US Airways recently banished all free snacks.Most airline executives acknowledge the industry must take more drastic steps to return commercial aviation to the stability it enjoyed, however briefly, before the latest surge in fuel prices. “The simple fact is that the US airline industry, as it is constituted today, was not built for $125 per barrel oil,” Gerard Arpey, chief executive of American Airlines, said last month during the world’s biggest carrier’s annual shareholder meeting. “The industry will not and cannot continue in its current state.”Some industry insiders continue to argue that sweeping consolidation would help carriers shed unprofitable routes and wield enough market power to raise ticket prices without losing a significant amount of traffic to low-cost airlines. When Delta agreed to merge with Northwest Airlines earlier this year, those executives and their advisers predicted other deals would follow.But the window for reaching a deal in time for a regulatory review by Bush administration officials – viewed as being more open to mergers than any of their potential successors – has all but closed. Many other legacy carriers, including United and Continental, have bowed out of the M&A game, at least for now.In conceding that talks with US Airways had ended, Glenn Tilton, United’s chief executive and a vocal advocate for consolidation, said during a message to his employees that the costs of integrating two complex operations would threaten to overwhelm a carrier already burning through its cash reserves to pay for fuel.Should oil prices continue to climb, some battered carriers may have no choice but to return to the table. Indeed, many of the industry’s biggest deals took place when one of the merger partners was under duress, says Andrew Watterson, a partner with Oliver Wyman in Dallas. “You could see some shotgun weddings.”“Mergers are not easy,” says Ilker Baybars, a professor of operations management at Carnegie Mellon. “It is painful. But when an industry is so competitive and margins are so small, consolidation is inevitable.”In the meantime, carriers will take deeper cuts to their flight schedules, trim administrative staff and ground older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. But this may not be enough to counter fuel costs should oil prices remain where they are or climb higher. CreditSights, a debt-research firm, predicted that the 2008 fuel bills of Delta and United would surpass each airline’s current cash position should crude oil remain at $125 a barrel. Of the 11 biggest US carriers, only Southwest, US Airways, Alaska and Northwest would end the year with cash on hand with oil at $150.In past downturns, including the one triggered by recession and the 9-11 terrorist attacks, troubled airlines filed for bankruptcy. Under the court’s protection, US Airways, United, Delta and Northwest reduced their debts, won wage concessions from employees and discarded older aircraft. While they emerged healthier, their revivals did little to confront what some executives see as the industry’s real problem: too many legacy airlines flying too many planes.“If a tree is dead, it should die because it has had its use and can make for new shoots,” says Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic. “In America most of these airlines have gone through Chapter 11 at least once. The quality is dreadful and the old planes stay in the air.” Sir Richard blames the ease with which US companies can emerge from bankruptcy largely intact. “You’re going to get a major carrier going into Chapter 11 again in the next few months, with fuel prices being at these levels,” he says. “Let those who should be dead die. That would be the best shot in the arm for the American industry.”If only it were that easy. The liquidation of a major airline would cost the economy thousands of jobs and dramatically reduce air service to some communities. Politicians would fight it, as may organised labour. “It is the worst scenario for the employees working for that carrier,” says Captain John Prater, president of the Air Line Pilots Association.Large suppliers, which often land influential seats on the creditors’ committees of bankrupt airlines, may seek to ensure that they do not lose customers. “Saving them is almost always the cheaper and easier option, even if it’s a government bailout,” says Peter Walsh, a managing partner at consultant Oliver Wyman who runs the firm’s manufacturing, transportation and energy business.Some executives believe the government can play a role in fixing the industry. They have lobbied federal, state and local officials to modernise US airports and air-traffic control systems, and aim to convince Washington to ease airlines’ tax burdens. Air-traffic delays cost carriers $19bn last year in excess labour, fuel and maintenance expenses as planes circled crowded airports or sat on gridlocked runways, according to a recent study by Congress’s Joint Economic Committee.Airline executives also argue they should no longer be subject to excise taxes generally levied on luxury items, cigarettes or alcohol. Carriers must pay those fees on the fares they sell, no matter how cheap the ticket or how unprofitable the airline, Mr Walsh says. “Flying airplanes is neither a sin nor is it an addictive substance,” he says. “It’s a commodity business.”Also awaiting a resolution from Washington are potential changes to the rules limiting foreign ownership of US airlines. Liberalising the cap of 25 per cent tops the agenda in the US and European Union “Open Skies” negotiations that opened last month in Slovenia.Removing or raising this cap could give carriers another source of potential capital. Germany’s Lufthansa bought a 19 per cent stake in JetBlue Airways, a low-cost US carrier, earlier this year, and Air France-KLM weighed making an investment in Delta while its transcontinental ally negotiated its merger with Northwest.Congress resisted past efforts to change the restrictions, with some members – including Mr Oberstar – concerned that foreign ownership could threaten carriers’ commitment to ferrying military personnel and supplies around the world in times of war. “Why should we let foreign airlines buy up extremely valuable US assets?” Mr Oberstar says. “We’d have to dramatically change the legal structure. And I’m not going to let that occur on my watch.”Mr Kelly, who succeeded Herb Kelleher as Southwest’s chairman last month, is optimistic his industry will rebound. The current challenges of record oil and a softened economy have punctuated what has been a “difficult decade” that began with terrorist attacks and recession and continued with adjustments to heightened security and record congestion at US airports.Most carriers, he says, have shown they can be profitable in more stable times, in the latter half of the 1990s and again in 2006-2007, when the industry enjoyed a fleeting renaissance. As they have in past downturns, the best airlines, large or small, legacy or low-cost, will adjust. “But it takes real resolve here,” he says. “There is not going to be instant gratification. There is very high demand for air travel, and if we can make improvements, demand will be even greater.”Prof Baybars agrees. “Service is not going to go away. Consumers are going to be fine and you’ll have plenty of seats.”But as services are cut, airline executives hope Americans accept they need to forgo a few of those seats, at least until fuel prices stabilise.
19;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2006-05-09T18:07:03Z;US Airways squeezes out $5m quarterly profit;;The rise in airline fares in US east-coast markets was underlined on Tuesday as US Airways reported a quarterly profit driven by sharply-higher revenues.The wave of airline bankruptcies over the past three years has seen the large US carriers withdraw hundreds of aircraft from the domestic market, and given carriers an opportunity to push up fares to counter rising fuel prices.US Airways, formed last year from the merger of its bankrupt namesake and America West, squeezed out a net profit of $5m in the three months to March 31 as it cut costs and lifted average fare levels.The performance surprised analysts, as only Southwest and Alaska had managed a profit in the traditionally weak March quarter.US Airways shares gained more than 8 per cent by midday in New York to reach a record high of $51.59.The old US Airways had struggled through two spells in bankruptcy protection after low-fare rivals such as Southwest, JetBlue and AirTran chewed into its strong position in east coast markets, which attract high levels of premium business passengers.The low-cost carriers are continuing their rapid expansion, but their cost advantage over the so-called legacy carriers has narrowed.The new US Airways is run by the management team at America West, which established a strong low-cost presence in the western US and transferred its strategy to its merger partner and linked the two networks.Revenue per available seat mile – a key industry measure - in the old US Airways’ standalone network rose 27.7 per cent in the March quarter, and by 16 per cent on western-focused America West routes. The performance is expected to continue in the second quarter.While domestic market conditions continue to improve, US Airways is also following the example of rivals by boosting its international network, where fare levels remain relatively high.The airline has forecast a net profit for 2006, but the integration of the two companies is being closely watched as labour and technical problems have blighted other airline mergers in the past.US Airways has transition agreements with its flight and cabin crew to move towards single contract negotiations in the future, though there remains some discontent as staff at the two constituent carriers had very different pay and benefit scales. Ground staff still have to decide on which union will represent them.

It will also defer 12 of the A320s due to arrive in 2007-09 until 2010-12. It has 82 Airbus aircraft on order, and will keep its E-190 deliveries unchanged.“We are going to cut our cost and figure out how our average fares can go up a bit,” chief executive David Neeleman said.Capacity cuts by airlines including Delta, Northwest and US Airways have helped carriers push up fares across the US industry, though only Southwest – which has accelerated its own growth plans – and Alaska Airlines managed to record a profit in the first quarter. AirTran, another fast-growing low-fare carrier, reports on Thursday.JetBlue forecast a profit in the second quarter but would still record a full-year loss. The airline reported a net loss of $32m for the quarter to March 31 compared with a profit of $6m in the same period last year.The loss per share of 18 cents was slightly better than analysts’ forecasts, as a 4 per cent rise in passenger yields lifted revenues by 31 per cent to 490m.JetBlue ended the quarter with $419m in cash and investment securities.

22;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2005-12-21T22:45:42Z;Continental earns $172m from Copa shares;;Continental Airlines on Wednesday said it had raised $172m from the sale of shares in the parent of Panama-based Copa Airlines, highlighting the buoyancy of the air transport equity market.The proceeds for Continental from Copa’s initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange last week were well above the $100m forecast by analysts, with further sales expected after it cut its stake from 49 per cent to around 32 per cent.Continental said it used $50m to fund its pension plan, lifting year-to-date contributions to $354m amid continuing uncertainty about the fate of the industry’s retiree benefits as Congress considers new pension legislation.Copa priced its IPO at $20 a share, ahead of the $15-$17 indicative range, and the share rose as high as $25.60 on Monday before slipping back to reach $23.60 by midday on Wednesday.The Panamanian flag carrier is valued at just over $1bn, compared with $1.68bn for Continental, whose revenues are almost 25 times larger.Latin American airlines have been strong performers this year, with Gol, the fast-growing Brazilian low-fare operator, up almost 100 per cent so far this year. Shares in Chile’s Lan, the largest international operator based in the region, have climbed by almost a third.US airline shares have climbed 30 per cent from their September lows, boosted by lower fuel costs and sharply-rising revenues.Optimism that US carriers can convert the current recovery in average revenues into a return to profitability have reopened the option of equity funding to rebuild broken balance sheets.US Airways raised %565m in equity as part of $1.5bn in funding to take it out of bankruptcy. Continental raised more than $200m in an equity offering in October, and yesterday said it plans to end the year with $1.9bn-$2bn in cash and short-term investments.Alaska Airlines last week priced a $200m equity offering and United Airlines, which hopes to exit bankruptcy in February with a $3bn-plus debt package, also plans to seek equity funding next year.A combination of hedge funds and private equity investors have also stepped forward to back the proposed launch of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin America start-up and the planned exit from bankruptcy protection of ATA Airlines, a small Indianopolis-based carrier.The US network carriers made a collective operating loss of $711m in the first nine months of the year. Low-fare rivals such as Southwest and JetBlue made an operating profit of $89m over the same period.
23;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2005-09-02T21:29:24Z;Katrina ratchets up Northwest bankruptcy fears;;Fears of bankruptcy at Northwest Airlines have increased dramatically in recent days following the sharp spike in fuel prices brought by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.Shares in the fourth biggest US carrier, which has warned repeatedly that high costs and a lack of liquidity could force it into bankruptcy this year, plunged 29 per cent this week as supply fears sparked by the hurricane sent jet fuel prices to record highs.In a filing with regulators on Thursday, the ailing carrier said its window of opportunity for avoiding bankruptcy was closing.Northwest said it faced continuing financial losses and dwindling cash reserves as it struggled to win pensions relief and reduce labour costs. “As a result of the recent spike in jet fuel prices, the time period for the company to resolve these problems has been reduced,” it said.The airline, which is also facing a strike by 4,500 members of its mechanics union, said it was working to restructure debt and aircraft leases to free up additional funds, but warned it could offer “no assurances” as to the success of those efforts.Roger King, an analyst at CreditSights, said Hurricane Katrina had dealt a “body blow to the airline industry at a time when it was already staggering from financial distress”.Airlines and US regulators moved this week to reassure the public that the storm, which shut down about 13 per cent of US jet fuel refining capacity, would not lead to fuel shortages.However, Aaron Taylor at Eclat, an airline consultancy, said high fuel prices were of far greater concern than any temporary regional disruptions. He said that Southwest Airlines, the low-cost carrier, was particularly well-positioned to weather a prolonged rise in jet fuel prices as damaged refineries, pipelines and ports struggle to come back on line.The price of a gallon of jet fuel has risen about 21 per cent in New York, to $2.37, since the storm hit.Southwest, which has hedged 85 per cent of its 2005 fuel needs, will remain insulated from the increase, which could be exacerbated by regional fuel shortages.“The network carriers are going to be paying prices that are north of $2 a gallon for jet fuel, which would be devastating,” said Mr Taylor. “Where other airlines will have to pass through the fuel price increases to their customers, Southwest doesn’t have to do that. It gives them a tremendous pricing advantage.”Alaska Airlines, which maintains a 50 per cent fuel hedge, should also be relatively insulated from price shocks, said Roger King at CreditSights.Northwest, together with its ailing rivals Delta and Independence Air, lacks a significant hedge against rising fuel costs.
24;ALK;Alaska Air Group;2004-10-26T17:05:29Z;Wall St climbs as insurance stocks get boost;;Insurers staged a rally that led Wall Street higher on Tuesday morning amid relief about a wide-reaching probe by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general.By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,853.58 while the broader S&P 500 index was up 1 per cent at 1,105.50. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite put on 0.3 per cent to 1,920.08.The shares of Marsh & McLennan gained 8.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company’s chief executive resigned and Mr Spitzer said he would not pursue criminal charges against the company as part of his wide-reaching probe into the practices of the insurance industry.The ripples of the news gave a lift to the other so-called Spitzer stocks of insurance groups targeted by or involved in the investigation. Shares in American International Group rose 6.4 per cent to $59.73 while ACE gained 6.6 per cent to $37.09. MetLife was 3.4 per cent higher at $36.24 as Aetna put on 4.7 per cent to $88.80.Rob Arancio, trader at Lehman Brothers, said: “A lot of the market action had to do with the relief rally in insurance stocks and decreased concerns about lawsuits there.”Mr Arancio added that there was evidence of a “healthy rotation” of capital into stocks “that have been decimated” recently, such as airlines and homebuilders.The American Stock Exchange Airline index added 3.9 per cent, powered by a 23 per cent rise to $4.65 in Delta Air Lines after JP Morgan upgraded the stock. Also higher were Alaska Air, up 2.7 per cent at $26.31, and Northwest, up 2.8 per cent at $8.50.Among homebuilders’ stocks, Pulte Homes added 5.6 per cent to $54.40 as Lennar put on 2.7 per cent to $44.97 and Centex gained 3.4 per cent to $50.39.On the opposite end of the rotation mentioned by Mr Arancio were technology stocks, which saw selling.Silicon Laboratories saw shares tumble 18.6 per cent to $$28.05 after warning its fourth-quarter results would fall short of expectations, reinforcing bearish views of the semiconductor sector. Hewlett-Packard, down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 and Intel, off fractionally at $21.30 were among the few declining Dow stocks.Bucking the downward trend in technology, Nvidia rose 12.7 per cent to $15.03 after the graphics chip designer reported strong quarterly results.The relief rally in insurers and other sectors helped offset a disappointing reading of the consumer confidence index for this month, which declined more than economists had expected. The Conference Board, the business research group which released the data, said the index was 92.8, its lowest level in seven months.Economists noted the worsening in consumer expectations component of the index and attributed to rising energy costs. While Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics predicted further declines in confidence because of energy costs, Stephen Gallagher at SG Investment Banking deemed that as a “known risk” and dwelled on evidence of increased consumer spending and improving labour markets, “which are key …in the performance of financial markets”.Meanwhile the crude oil price, which had weighed on stocks, retreated after the Norwegian government acted to avoid a strike that could have disrupted production at a time when the markets are jittery about supply-demand imbalances ahead winter.As the third-quarter earnings season continued, Sara Lee, the consumer goods group, saw shares add 2.1 per cent to $22.91 after it reported higher quarterly earnings that investors appeared to dismiss owing to the effect of a fee from an asset sale. Commodity prices and other factors would have caused the company’s earnings to be flat if the fee had been excluded.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin shares were up 1.1 per cent to $54.10 after the company reported a 41 per cent rise in third-quarter profits, raised its 2004 full-year estimate but guided analysts below their forecasts for next year.Halliburton, the oil services group, reported a quarterly loss owing to charges it took to provide for asbestos-related liabilities. Shares were 2.7 per cent higher at $35.28.DuPont shares edged off 2.1 per cent to $41.29 in morning trading after the chemical company swung to profitability for the quarter thanks to growing demand that offset the effects of rising energy prices.
