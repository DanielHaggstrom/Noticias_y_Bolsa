0;CLX;Clorox Company;2016-12-06T04:30:47Z;Legal teams are paying their way;The impact of company lawyers is growing as they achieve measurable effects;"Chief executives and their general counsel have often struggled to put a value on what a legal team does for the business. When asked, their response is usually a laugh or a sigh, and comments such as “it’s difficult and imprecise” or “it’s downright impossible”.They can quantify budget cuts and money saved, but few have the numbers or the means to measure accurately a legal team’s contribution.At least, that used to be the case. Chief executives and general counsel of the most innovative teams who took part in this report had no trouble describing precisely where their legal departments contributed to the overall success of the business. Many also talked in depth about the data they are now collecting and analysing to measure that value.Pat Gelsinger, chief executive of VMware, the technology company, says: “While any legal department has to guarantee that risk is minimised, ours also creates value. There are metrics associated with everything they do.”It is not all about measuring costs. For example, the detailed metrics that the legal team collects on new customer contracts are used by the business to understand how well it is meeting the needs of its customers.Data showed VMware’s legal team how to simplify every step of the company’s contract drafting, negotiations and approval process. The team then replaced complex agreements with simpler language. They also reviewed and analysed terms that had been used in previous contracts and removed those where the company always made concessions, saving hours of costly and time-consuming legal negotiation.The time it takes to sign a new customer contract has halved, helping the business do deals more quickly and improving the customer experience.Drawing on the experience of her parents running their own business, and also on her time serving on active duty in the US Navy, VMware general counsel Dawn Smith tries to bring a business mindset to her role. “Unless we run ourselves as a business, are in charge of our own destiny, and can keep costs under control, then in five years someone will come and slash our budgets,” she says.A legal operations team that Ms Smith created five years ago started by improving how it allocated work, outsourcing, e-billing and its management of outside law firms. But over time, the focus has moved to developing a strategy on collecting details of workloads, outcomes, cycle times, responsiveness and other useful information from the various new technologies the company has implemented.Legal operations may not be the first place to look for eye-catching innovation, but it is arguably where the most important changes in the industry are happening. The proportion of North American companies with legal operations personnel — the staff assigned the task of managing the people, process and technology aspects of lawyers’ work — doubled to 48 per cent in 2015, according to a survey by the Association of Corporate Counsel. That figure is expected to jump again this year.Driving transformation in business and industryInnovative in-house legal teamsInnovation in unlocking and delivering valueNew products and techniquesGreat legal ideasManaging complexity and scaleSuch operational roles are likely to become even more important and influential as advances in technology affect almost every aspect of legal services.Aine Lyons, VMware’s head of legal operations, says that “although we all recognise that the nature of legal service delivery has fundamentally changed, we are still figuring out what the implications of these changes are and how to respond to them”.The legal team at publisher Hearst Corp­oration is currently training and coding a machine learning tool named Charlotte. Eventually, it will be able to create non-disclosure agreements with a few simple instructions and support the in-house team to take on complex litigation and M&A deals.These kinds of operational innovations will have far-reaching effects on the legal industry by enabling in-house departments to handle more complex work more efficiently instead of using law firms. They also free in-house lawyers to concentrate on more complex strategic work.For instance, Nasdaq’s legal and regulatory team has long invested in technology and process, and this year it tops a new ranking in the report, on driving transformation in business and industry more widely.Led by general counsel Edward Knight, Nasdaq’s legal and regulatory group not only supports the business, but is an architect of many of its successes.The team, which includes a market surveillance arm, provides consulting services to regulators and exchanges around the world.Recently, it worked with Nasdaq’s technology team to develop the proposal for its new dark pool hosting business, Ocean.Nasdaq signed Goldman Sachs as Ocean’s first client in October.Individual winner:

1;CLX;Clorox Company;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
