0;EQR;Equity Residential;2012-11-26T23:41:45Z;Lehman to sell Archstone for $6.5bn;;Lehman Brothers has agreed to sell Archstone, the apartment business it bought at the height of the US real estate bubble, to Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities in a $6.5bn cash and equity deal.The sale brings to a close one of Lehman’s biggest gambles on US real estate and comes amid signs of an improvement in the US housing market. It also replaces Archstone’s plans to raise about $3.45bn from what would have been one of the biggest initial public offerings this year.The companies would pay $2.7bn in cash, $3.8bn in common stock, and would also take on Archstone’s $9bn worth of debt, Equity Residential, part of Chicago mogul Sam Zell’s business empire, and AvalonBay said in a statement.The investment bank, under the leadership of its former head Dick Fuld, bought Archstone and its portfolio of luxury apartments in a leveraged buyout in 2007. The purchase helped add to the bank’s $30bn worth of illiquid property assets and edged Lehman into bankruptcy the next year. The company has been selling off securities and businesses in an effort to repay its thousands of creditors ever since.Lehman this year bought the final 26.5 per cent of Archstone that it did not already own in an effort to pave the way for a public float or sale.“The sale of Archstone to Equity Residential and AvalonBay is a very positive outcome for our creditors,” Owen Thomas, chairman of Lehman’s board, said in a statement. The failed bank’s shareholdings in Equity Residential and AvalonBay will also provide Lehman with “the potential for further appreciation and substantial liquidity for our remaining investment”, he added.The deal will be one of the biggest in the US real estate sector this year and comes as the country’s housing market is recovering. The Case-Shiller house price index turned positive on an annual basis in the second quarter of 2012 and there has been a recent pick-up in sales and housing starts.“Archstone’s assets will fit perfectly into the Equity Residential portfolio, further improve the overall quality of our assets and add scale to our operating platform in our core markets,” said David Neithercut, Equity Residential’s chief executive.Tim Naughton, CEO of AvalonBay, said: “This is a rare opportunity to acquire a high quality portfolio of apartment communities concentrated in our markets.”Equity Residential will receive 60 per cent of Archstone’s assets and liabilities, including 23,110 apartments. AvalonBay gets the remaining 40 per cent, or 22,222 apartments plus six apartment sites under construction.Equity Residential said it would issue 19m common shares to help fund the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. AvalonBay will sell 14.5m shares.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in New York
1;EQR;Equity Residential;2012-05-24T23:28:35Z;Lehman buys rest of Archstone for $1.6bn;;Lehman Brothers Holdings is buying the final 26.5 per cent stake in property company Archstone it does not already own from Bank of America and Barclays for $1.58bn, according to people familiar with the deal.The deal, expected to be announced soon, would give Lehman full control of Archstone, paving the way for a possible initial public offering.Lehman bought Archstone with BofA and Barclays in a $22bn leveraged buyout in 2007, a year before Lehman filed for the largest-ever corporate bankruptcy. Lehman emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year and agreed to start paying out creditors.But Lehman and the banks repeatedly clashed over how best to unwind the group’s Archstone property holdings. Lehman wanted to hold out for a public offering, while the banks pushed for a quick sale.Last year BofA and Barclays agreed to sell a 26.5 per cent stake, or about half their holdings, to Equity Residential for $1.3bn. That deal valued Archstone at about $16bn including debt.Equity, headed by Sam Zell, is a competitor to Archstone, which owns more than 50,000 apartments in the US and Germany.Lehman exercised its right of first refusal on the stake and sought approval from the bankruptcy court to use the estate’s cash to buy the stake, eventually purchasing it for $1.3bn.As part of Equity’s initial deal, it received exclusive rights to buy the final 26.5 per cent held by the banks. But Lehman exercised its right of first refusal on that stake as well, triggering the latest deal.Equity will also receive an $80m break-up fee and an additional $70m as part of the transaction. The deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday concluded a probe into possible financial fraud at Lehman and indicated it would not recommend any enforcement against the firm or its executives.
2;EQR;Equity Residential;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Lehman to repay creditors at a faster pace;;Lehman Brothers, the defunct investment bank, announced it would begin repaying creditors at a faster pace than anticipated, fuelling hopes that the recovery from the world’s biggest-ever bankruptcy may be better than expected.Creditors have been waiting almost four years to begin to get money back from Lehman, which went bankrupt in September 2008 with some $600bn in assets against $1tn in initial claims, and have spent more than $2bn globally on lawyers and advisers globally to manage the bankruptcy process.Lehman officially emerged from bankruptcy last month, estimating that it would raise $65bn from its remaining assets, such as a stake in Archstone, the property management group, and use it to repay some $300bn in claims, or roughly 18 cents on the dollar.On Wednesday Lehman announced it will payout an initial $22.5bn to creditors beginning on April 17, far more than the $10bn it estimated back in December for its first distribution.The higher amount reflects several sooner-than-anticipated sales of assets, such as preferred shares in Neuberger Berman, Lehman’s former asset management arm, for $850m, plus the sale of its 25 per cent stake in Wilton Reinsurance for $390m. Lehman had also lobbied the court successfully to allow it to fund its loss reserves with assets, rather than cash, freeing that money up to be paid to creditors.The faster recovery has also driven up bond prices, suggesting that creditors are expecting Lehman to further improve on its estimate of $65bn in recoveries. Lehman would not comment on whether that was an accurate assumption.The bankruptcy plan calls for a 21.1 cent payout per dollar of bonds, but Lehman’s benchmark 2013 bonds are already trading at almost 30 cents on the dollar.On Wednesday their price rose to 29.625 cents, up 0.31 cents versus the previous day, and just short of their all-time high, reached last week, of 29.75 cents. Their recent low was 23 cents in October last year.Traders said the higher payout could spark more trading in Lehman bonds and claims. “The fact that they are paying more than originally considered may not drive pricing much higher, but it may drive volume. People who were considering selling after the first distribution might now definitely want to sell,” said Andrew Gottesman, head of bankruptcy claims trading at SecondMarket.The remaining staff of the bank are dedicated to selling its final assets, such as stakes in two subsidiary banks and properties in California.The process is slow going. Lehman is locked in a court battle with Bank of America, Barclays and Equity Residential over control of Archstone, and has been shopping the banks since last year.
3;EQR;Equity Residential;2012-03-06T23:27:23Z;Lehman emerges from bankruptcy;;Lehman Brothers has ended the largest-ever corporate bankruptcy, emerging from Chapter 11 and announcing it will begin making its first payouts to clients next month.However, many disputes surrounding the defunct investment bank remain, including the bankruptcy of Lehman’s UK subsidiary, to which billions of dollars of customer cash were funnelled, and multibillion-dollar lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.Though Lehman as it once was no longer exists, with its core broker-dealer businesses sold to Barclays Capital and Nomura in 2008, Lehman’s parent holding company remains in business to manage the sale of assets. The creditors agreed to this plan to give the estate time to maximise value rather than liquidating in a fire sale.These efforts include wresting full ownership of Archstone, the property management group, from co-owners Bank of America and Barclays. The banks have agreed to sell their remaining one-quarter stake to Equity Residential, the property group controlled by Sam Zell, but Lehman is objecting to that transaction.The reorganised Lehman’s board of directors includes top banking executives such as Owen Thomas, former chief executive of Morgan Stanley Asia, who is expected to become chairman. Its offices remain across the street from Lehman’s one-time Manhattan headquarters, now occupied by Barclays Capital, with some 430 staffers.Lehman’s managers had at one point hoped to spin out an asset management company, called Lamco, that would give equity to employees who had remained with the estate. But creditors rejected the plan, citing its cost.The estate has so far collected $28bn in cash by selling assets such as artwork by Takashi Murakami, via a Sotheby’s auction, and stakes in ski resorts. Lehman projects to have some $65bn once Archstone and other assets, including two deposit-taking banks, are finally sold, to cover over $350bn in claims. That would enable the estate to pay roughly 18 cents on the dollar.Some investors that bought Lehman debt at distressed prices will probably have turned a profit. For example, Paulson & Co, the hedge fund, may make a profit of some $550m in the final tally. Bondholders are set to receive 21.1 cents on the dollar for their debts.Other winners include the managers of the bankruptcy process. There were a record $1.6bn in fees racked up for lawyers and other professionals, including $512m for Alvarez & Marsal, the restructuring firm that has run the Lehman estate.The fees attracted criticism by creditors, who appointed Kenneth Feinberg, the former Wall Street “pay tsar”, to monitor the payments.However, at around 0.2 per cent of Lehman’s $691bn in assets at the time of its bankruptcy, the fees were small compared to the 1 to 2 per cent spent in the Enron and WorldCom cases, according to the UCLA-LoPucki Bankruptcy Research Database.Additionally, despite its size and complexity, Lehman’s bankruptcy ended relatively speedily, at just under three-and-a-half years. Delphi Automotive, for example, spent four years in Chapter 11.
4;EQR;Equity Residential;2012-01-06T19:53:22Z;Judge allows Equity to bid for Archstone stake;;A US bankruptcy court judge has cleared the way for Sam Zell’s Equity Residential to bid for a stake in Archstone over the objections of the Lehman Brothers estate, which is vying to take control of the property management group.Archstone, among the largest apartment companies in the US, was acquired by Lehman in a $22bn deal with financing by Barclays and Bank of America in 2007. Its fall in value was among the precipitating events of Lehman’s bankruptcy in 2008, the largest in history.Archstone is now among the estate’s largest remaining assets as it seeks to begin making pay-outs to creditors this year. Many creditors would like to see the estate take control of Archstone then hold an initial public offering for the company.But in December, Barclays and BofA, who now own equity in Archstone but do not want to manage it long-term, agreed to sell half of their 53 per cent stake, or 26.5 per cent, to Equity Residential, the property group run by Mr Zell, the Chicago real estate mogul, for $1.3bn. That would value Archstone at some $16bn, including debt.Lehman then sued Barclays and BofA, arguing that they struck an unfair deal with Mr Zell’s firm to agree to sell the second half of their stake if Lehman exercises a previously agreed ‘right of first offer’ to match Equity’s bid for the first half.However, Judge James Peck of the US bankruptcy court in Manhattan on Friday denied Lehman’s request for an injunction, though he did acknowledge that Lehman could later seek damages from the banks. Lehman will now have to top $1.4bn for the second half of the banks’ stake, which includes a break-up fee.The parties all declined to comment.The estate will go to court next week for a hearing on the exercise of its right of first offer and on whether it will have to meet a January 23 deadline to match Equity’s bid for the first half of the banks’ stake.For its bid, Lehman can use its own cash at the court’s approval. It may also pursue previous talks with Blackstone and Brookfield Asset Management about joining forces to buy Archstone.In conjunction with its most active creditors, Lehman has assembled a board of directors it believes is equipped to manage Archstone and other investments, such as the SunCal property projects in California, for several years.Lehman has said Equity would destroy value in Archstone by seeking to replace management, but Equity said it was focused on Archstone as an investment.Equity told the court it is presently focused on Archstone as an investment and that Lehman’s valuation is unrealistic. People familiar with Equity’s thinking said that it considers an IPO to be risky, given the volatility of property prices.
5;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-12-15T23:01:58Z;Lehman estate sues for control of Archstone;;The estate of Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt investment bank, is suing Bank of America and Barclays Capital as it seeks to win control of Archstone, the apartment company now owned by the three groups.Archstone, which was bought for $22bn in 2007 by a joint venture of Lehman and Tishman Speyer, owns more than 400 apartment complexes with a total of more than 70,000 units, including those under construction.The Lehman estate, BofA and Barclays, which together stumped up about $6.4bn in secured financing in the 2007 deal, have been left holding Archstone’s equity after a series of restructurings. BofA owns 28 per cent of Archstone, while Barclays has 25 per cent.Earlier this month, BofA and Barclays agreed to sell a 26.5 per cent stake in Archstone, or half their holding, to Equity Residential, the real estate company headed by Chicago mogul Sam Zell, for $1.325bn. The deal valued the company at about $16bn including debt.But on Thursday the Lehman estate, which believes Archstone is worth about $1bn more in equity value than the Equity Residential deal reflects, said it had exercised its right of first refusal to match that offer.The estate will have to seek approval from the bankruptcy court by January 23 for the use of the estate’s cash in buying the 26.5 per cent stake in Archstone. The Lehman estate is also asking the court to block any deal with Equity Residential and force Barclays and BofA to provide them with more information on their deal, as well as for unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees.The estate claims the two banks withheld information as they “conspired to sell their combined approximately 53 per cent interests in Archstone to Archstone’s largest competitor”, according to the complaint filed on Thursday.The estate argues that the banks failed to include in their official notification of the Equity Residential deal the existence of an option promised to the real estate company. The banks have granted Equity Residential the option to buy their remaining stake in Archstone, should the estate exercise its right to match the original deal.Barclays and Bank of America declined to comment.“Bank of America and Barclays’ conduct related to their marketing efforts has put the value of Archstone itself in peril,” the complaint adds. The Lehman estate claims that the banks have refused to complete retention agreements with key members of Archstone’s management team.As it rushes to seek approval from the court and the creditors’ committee for its matching bid, the Lehman estate cannot bring in partners at this stage, according to people familiar with the matter.The estate has talked to Blackstone and Brookfield Asset Management in the past, both of which expressed an interest in the banks’ Archstone stake, about joining forces in an effort to buy the apartment company.Partners could be brought in at a later stage should the estate pursue purchasing the remaining 26.5 per cent owned by the two banks.
6;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-12-14T21:53:53Z;Solar stocks lead Wall Street down;;First Solar fell 21.4 per cent to $33.45, its lowest level in four years, as the company announced its second restructuring in six weeks.The solar panel manufacturer will shed 100 jobs and focus on building comprehensive large solar utility plants, such as the Topaz farm in Southern California, which it sold to a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway last week, instead of selling standalone solar panels.First Solar’s market capitalisation has fallen by almost 75 per cent this year as a global supply glut of solar panels pushed down prices.“It’s been clear for years that this company would suffer margin compression as global supply rose,” said Theodore O’Neill, solar analyst at Wunderlich Securities. “The bigger problem is that the new strategy is not much different from the old strategy.”First Solar’s competitors sold off as investors feared an intensification of price competition in the sector. Yingli Green Energy fell 7 per cent to $3.61 and SunPower Corp fell 16 per cent to $5.30.Elsewhere, markets fell sharply for the third day running as investors once again took fright at newsflow from Europe.The S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent to 1,211.82, now down 3.5 per cent for the week and at new lows for December.“Eurozone leaders simply haven’t done enough to provide any finality for investors,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment strategist at Federated Investors. “If you’re an investor looking ahead to 2012, it’s difficult to focus on domestic data, when there are so many potential eurozone landmines.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 1.1 per cent to 11,823.48, although the index at least remains in positive territory for the year. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,539.31 as Apple slumped 2.2 per cent to $380.19.Apple was knocked by Intel’s plans to expand production of “ultrabook” computers, which do not use hard disk drives. That could cut into MacBook Air’s market share, and take away customers from the tablet market.Retail brokerage Charles Schwab fell 4.9 per cent to $10.97 as weak equity trading volumes led the company to slash its guidance for fourth-quarter earnings by 25 per cent.But the financial sector of the S&P 500 was down just 0.3 per cent, outperforming every sector of the S&P 500, as big banks unusually recorded gains in a falling market.Wells Fargo climbed 0.3 per cent to $25.86 and JPMorgan was up 0.7 per cent to $31.51.Financials were helped by gains for residential real estate investment trusts.AvalonBay Communities rose 2.1 per cent to $125.25 and Equity Residential c limbed 1.9 per cent to $54.72 after Goldman Sachs put out a bullish note.“Apartment landlords can push rents [higher] despite minimal job growth. In fact, rents are up 4.9 per cent in 2011 despite just 1.4 million jobs created,” Goldman analyst Jonathan Habermann told clients.Higher capital spending knocked several shares in the oil and mining sectors.Pioneer Natural Resources fell 4.8 per cent to $82.84 after subsidiary Pioneer Southwest Energy said it would sell 2.6m new shares to fund new drilling.Mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global slumped 10.8 per cent to $75.44, despite matching analysts’ expectations on third-quarter revenues.Investors balked at plans to raise 2012 capital spending to $200m, up from the $150m previously budgeted and the $111m spent in the most recent fiscal year.“Management used the earnings call to rein in any expectation that order growth in 2012 will be anything like the 20 per cent plus we’ve seen in 2011,” said Robert McCarthy at Baird. “The worry was that large miners may delay major orders next year because of the weakening macro environment.”Shares in Groupon fell to $21.10 in early trading, barely above their $20 IPO price as analysts began publishing research on the discount offers website.Of the 11 banks which worked on Groupon’s IPO, only five recommended clients buy the stock.Citi analysts told clients: “Material upside valuation from here requires success in new segments that we believe could take significant time to prove out.” The shares closed off 3.3 per cent to $22.55.Avon was the standout performer in the S&P 500, up 5.1 per cent to $16.96, the day after the company parted ways with chief executive Andrea Jung.Broadcom climbed 0.9 per cent to $28.45 as the chipmaker bucked the semiconductor industry trend and raised fourth-quarter guidance.
7;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-12-06T23:10:39Z;Court approves Lehman pay-out plan;;"A US bankruptcy court has approved Lehman Brothers’ pay-out plan, paving the way for the difficult work of selling the defunct investment bank’s remaining assets to begin.Tuesday’s approval comes three years after Lehman filed the largest bankruptcy case in history in September 2008. More than $1.4bn in fees for advisers in the US and some $1bn globally were incurred in hashing out agreements among the thousands of creditors that initially sought to recover over $1.2tn.The work is hardly finished, however, as the final liquidation of assets such as Lehman’s stakes in Archstone, the property group, and Neuberger Berman, the funds management group, could take years to complete.The court’s decision – reached during an emotional session as Judge James Peck and Harvey Miller, Lehman’s attorney, reflected on the crisis that prompted the bankruptcy – was anticipated after more than 95 per cent of creditors voted to approve the final plan last week.With the court’s confirmation of the plan, consummation of the bankruptcy is expected within a month or so, allowing some initial pay-outs to begin in the first quarter of next year. The estate expects to have some $65bn in assets to cover $370bn in claims.The plan was a settlement negotiated by Alvarez & Marsal, the firm overseeing Lehman’s bankruptcy. It shifted some of the money originally set aside for banks such as Goldman Sachs and foreign affiliate creditors to bondholders such as Pimco and Paulson & Co, which had filed a competing plan in an attempt to wrest control of the bankruptcy last year.In the final accounting, bondholders will receive 21.1 cents on the dollar, representing a profit for some firms such as Paulson & Co, which acquired bonds at a discount just after the bankruptcy, but losses for pension funds such as Calpers, which bought them at face value years before.Most of the companies that were counterparties on derivative contracts unfulfilled by Lehman will receive 39 cents on the dollar. Deutsche Bank dropped its final objections to the plan; it had been claiming that its debts should be treated as more senior claims. In exchange, the estate agreed to allow the banks to hold on to money they believe the estate still owes.There are still some outstanding disputes to be resolved, including claims filed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage giants, and Lehman’s Switzerland-based affiliate, according to people familiar with the bankruptcy.The estate this week named a board of directors who will oversee the liquidation, including former investment bankers specialising in derivatives and private equity, as well as prominent real estate investors.Presently, Lehman is engaged in tense discussions on how to dispose of its stake in Archstone, the property group whose declining value played a large role in Lehman’s bankruptcy,Last week, Equity Residential, the group controlled by Sam Zell, bid to take over a 26.5 per cent stake in Archstone for $1.325bn.But the estate said on Monday that it “believes better alternatives exist for maximising value”, such as taking Archstone public, and that its stake in Archstone is worth $1bn more than the $5bn value implied by Equity’s bid."
8;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-12-04T19:27:56Z;Lehman estate could scupper Archstone deal;Equity value in apartment company questioned;The estate of bankrupt Lehman Brothers believes that Archstone – the apartment company that Bank of America and Barclays have agreed to sell part of their stakes in – is worth $1bn more in equity value than the price at which the two banks have struck their deal, people familiar with the matter said.The estate is considering mounting a matching bid to derail the banks’ deal with Equity Residential,the real estate company headed by Chicago mogul Sam Zell.EQR said late on Friday that it had agreed to pay $1.325bn in cash for a 26.5 per cent stake in Archstone, which was taken private at the height of the property boom. The deal values it at about $16bn including debt.However, the agreement with EQR triggers a right of first refusal for the estate of the investment bank, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, to buy the stake. People familiar with the matter said that should Lehman exercise its right to match the offer, the banks have also agreed to grant EQR an option on their remaining 26.5 per cent stake.The estate has repeatedly clashed with Bank of America and Barclays about how to unwind the group’s holding in Archstone.While the estate is focused on maximising value and could seek an initial public offering for Archstone in the future, Barclays, with 25 per cent of the company, and Bank of America, which owns 28 per cent, have been pushing a quicker sale.People familiar with the situation said that the estate sees another $1bn in Archstone’s equity value over the $5bn valuation reflected in the EQR deal.The purchase price agreed by Equity Residential represents a capitalisation rate – the properties’ net operating income relative to the total value – of 5.3 per cent. That is slightly above where listed peers such as AvalonBay and Equity Residential itself trade, with some analysts arguing that Archstone could command a premium to rivals because of the rare opportunity to buy a nationwide portfolio of prime apartment properties.The estate has 10 days to mount a matching bid for the stake. It has for months been talking to potential backers, including Blackstone and Brookfield Asset Management who both participated in the auction for the banks’ stakes, about helping finance a bid to consolidate Archstone’s ownership.While the bank’s stakes are purely financial, striking a deal with the estate could win an investor such as Blackstone or Brookfield more control over Archstone’s portfolio of prime residential property.However, it is not clear under the terms of the original agreement whether the estate can bring in a partner at this time, said people familiar with the matter. The estate must also agree with the creditors’ committee in order to mount a bid.Archstone’s portfolio includes 48,922 apartment units as well as 1,332 apartments under construction and land sites for future development. Morgan Stanley advised Equity Residential on the deal, while Barclays and Bank of America advised themselves. Gleacher & Company are advising the Lehman estate.
9;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-10-12T03:19:03Z;Franklin leads fall in US money manager stocks;;US money manager stocks fell on Tuesday after Franklin Resources, parent of Franklin Templeton Investments, revealed an unexpected decline in fixed income assets under management during September.Overall assets under management at Franklin Resources fell from $716.4bn at the end of August to $659.9bn at the end of September – principally due to falling asset prices, with Barclays Capital estimating investor outflows from equity funds were only $2.4bn and outflows from fixed income funds less than $1bn.Equity withdrawals had been expected, but the fall in fixed income assets under management from $314.6bn to $297.7bn worried some analysts.“We had previously factored in a much lower growth rate in global fixed income [but] now we expect negative flows [in the last quarter of 2011],” Chris Spahr, an analyst at CLSA wrote to clients. Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62. Fears that Europe’s financial crisis could herald a spike in unemployment, and lead to pay-outs on the policy, have weighed on Genworth’s stock price.Lincoln National rose 1.9 per cent to $16.34, and MetLife was up 0.6 per cent to $30.58, as the insurance sector rallied on hopes that European equity assets may recover in value.Derivative exchanges sold off, with CME Group down 3.4 per cent to $257 and IntercontinentalExchange off 2.3 per cent to $123.10, though analysts struggled to explain the moves.The New York Stock Exchange was up 2.3 per cent to $26.46, tracking its potential merger partner, German exchange Deutsche Börse, which rose 1.4 per cent while German markets were open.Fashion group Nordstrom was down 2.8 per cent to $49.26, after a filing showed executives had sold shares last week.Video streaming service Netflix continued its downward momentum, falling 2.7 per cent to $108.66. On Monday the company reversed a previous decision to hive off its DVD delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster, but did not row back on a 60 per cent price rise for the joint DVD and streaming service.Fertiliser maker Mosaic Company rose 4.3 per cent to $55.77 after Credit Suisse increased its estimates for fertiliser prices, citing strong demand for grain.Reits fell, with Equity Residential down 3.1 per cent to $52.91 and AvalonBay Communities falling 2.2 per cent to $118.50.Store chain 99 Cents Only Stores rose 4.4 per cent to $21.39 after agreeing to a $1.6bn cash takeover by alternative asset manager Ares Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

That followed a 4 per cent surge in the last 40 minutes of trading on Tuesday, after the Financial Times broke news of European government talks about co-ordinated bank recapitalisations.Wednesday’s gains left the benchmark up 1 per cent for the week and 50 points clear of the bear market territory it had traded in for much of Tuesday.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, warned: “It’s still difficult for retail and institutional investors to commit to this market. With volatility still elevated, it’s a day trader’s market.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent to 10,939.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 2,460.51.Bank of New York Mellon fell 2.9 per cent to $18.28 after the bank was hit by government lawsuits for allegedly systematically mispricing forex transactions for clients over 10 years. That briefly pushed down shares in all the major US trust banks as investors absorbed further reputational damage to the industry.But State Street, which is subject to a separate $54m civil lawsuit for forex mispricing, closed up 1.3 per cent to $32.47, and Northern Trust, which is not subject to litigation, was also up 1 per cent to $36.37.Brad Hintz, trust bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the financial implications of the lawsuits facing State Street and BNY Mellon were manageable.“Fraud is hard to prove. And although this will encourage more civil lawsuits, the dollar amounts involved aren’t large,” he said.Residential real estate investment trusts suffered in the morning session.Equity Residential fell 1 per cent to $51.70 and AvalonBay Communities was off 1.2 per cent to $111.55.Reits have attracted flows from yield-seeking investors because they are required to pay out any profits in dividends. They have been able to take advantage of a recovery in the rental market faster than commercial reits, because tenancies come up for renewal more frequently. But their dependence on short-term funding from the repo market is worrying some investors.Sectoral movements in the S&P 500 hinted at positive sentiment.Cyclical materials and energy stocks were up 4.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, whose share price has been hit by concerns over Chinese demand, jumped 12 per cent to $19.70.

11;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-09-14T20:53:34Z;Residential REIT declines blight Wall Street gains;;Residential real estate investment trusts took a tumble on Wednesday, after Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rod Petrik told clients to expect “much more pedestrian” performance, following a strong run so far this year.Residential Reit stocks have strongly outperformed commercial Reits this year. The short duration of residential leases relative to commercial leases, means residential Reits can immediately take advantage of a strengthening rental market, as contracts come up for renewal more often.But, according to Stifel’s research, residential Reit stocks are now over priced, with share prices valuing residential Reit 34 per cent higher than other Reits with similar earnings.AvalonBay Communities fell 2.5 per cent to $130.40. Apartment Investment and Residential fell 0.9 per cent to $26.48 and Equity Residential fell 2.2 per cent to $58.79.Reits have significantly outperformed most other equities this year, as low interest rates have eased financing costs, and made dividends, which Reits are legally obliged to pay, attractive to yield-seeking investors.Bloomberg’s Reits index, which is dominated by commercial property funds rather than residential funds, was up 0.8 per cent Wednesday and is only down 1.7 per cent for the year.The broader S&P 500 index jumped 1.4 per cent, leaving it up 5 per cent for the week.That was despite disappointing retail sales data, which showed consumption stagnated in August.Timothy Speiss, vice-president of EisnerAmper Wealth Planning, said the retail figures were not unexpected and that “markets are pricing in hopes of getting to a master agreement on the European crisis,” where talks between the German, French and Greek governments continued Wednesday.Financials were up 1.2 per cent led by life insurer Hartford Financial Services, up 4.8 per cent at $18.18, and Ameriprise Financial, up 2.1 per cent at $43.80, as Credit Suisse analyst Thomas Gallagher upgraded both companies to to “buy”.Low interest rates and a weak equity market have raised questions about whether life insurers can generate returns on the premiums they take in from customers. But Mr Gallagher told clients, “low interest rates will have only a minor impact” on 2012 earnings.Bank of America rose 0.7 per cent to $7.05, but RBC Capital Markets became one of the first research shops to suggest BofA may offer fair value under $10.Analyst Paul Miller cut his BofA target price from $12 to $8, telling clients, “There seems to be no end in sight for [BofA’s] litigation expenses, and there is little clarity into what the company will look like two to three years down the road.”Most buy-side analysts have “buy” ratings on the stock, which has almost halved in value this year.Reaction to Cisco’s analyst day on Tuesday was mixed. Analysts greeted the company’s restructuring, which involves significant cost-cuts, but were divided on whether it can now deliver sales growth given the weak macroeconomic environment. “Three-year revenue growth rate guidance of 5-7 per cent appears conservative to us especially as year on year comparisons get easier. This new target is well below the recent 12-17 per cent target,” Jason Noland of Baird wrote to clients.But Rod Hall at JPMorgan told clients: “The good news is that [Cisco] has finally reduced its targets to levels that are achievable. The bad news is that those targets boil down to earnings per share growth of just 7-9 per cent.”Cisco’s shares fell 0.1 per cent to $16.33. The stock traded as low as $13.30 in August, and is still down almost 20 per cent for the year.Micron Technology was again among the top performers in the S&P 500, up 5 per cent at $7.20. It has now gained more than 13 per cent this week.Statistical research by JPMorgan suggested Micron, Nvidia, and other semiconductor stocks are in an “accumulation” cycle, with investors piling into the sector as it recovers from an oversell.Nvidia rose 5.2 per cent to $15.28 and the Philadelphia semiconductors index was up 2.6 per cent on Wednesday, and 5 per cent for the week.Cablevision rose 7 per cent to $17.83 on reports of a deal with Time Warner that will allow Cablevision subscribers to watch Turner Networks programming on tablets.Shares in Sears, the department store, rose 6.2 per cent to $58.48 on reports its Kenmore brand may be made available for sale through other outlets.Some investors were cheered by analysis of Tuesday’s sectoral movements in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Transport stocks outperformed the broader index by almost 3 per cent.“This kind of outperformance by the Transports has happened 177 times over the last 50 years, and the average performance for both the Transports and the Dow in the near term has been very positive,” according to a note from the Bespoke Investment Group.On Wednesday transport stocks in the Dow were up 2 per cent, while the wider index was up 1.3 per cent at 11,246.73. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent at 2,572.55.
12;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-08-09T20:43:42Z;Lehman estate eyes disposal of Archstone;;The Lehman Brothers estate is pushing ahead with plans to sell or list Archstone, the apartment company that it took private for $22bn near the zenith of the property boom, even as market ructions complicate discussions about how to proceed with Bank of America and Barclays, owners of sizeable stakes.People familiar with the matter said the banks were working on documents for an initial public offering, which could be filed by the end of the month. JPMorgan Chase has been retained to assist with a possible float.The group has also started discussions about a potential sale of Archstone, which could be valued at as much as $20bn including debt, or just a stake, with a select group of potential buyers, those people said.Possible buyers include EQR and AvalonBay, the publicly listed property companies, as well as Blackstone and Brookfield Asset Management, they said.Blackstone, EQR, AvalonBay and Brookfield declined to comment, as did Archstone’s owners and JPMorgan.Lehman led the $22bn leveraged buy-out of Archstone in 2007, as part of the investment bank’s ill-fated foray into commercial property. The estate of the bankrupt bank now holds about 47 per cent, while BofA owns 28 per cent and Barclays 25 per cent.While the Lehman estate is focused on maximising value regardless of timing, say people familiar with the matter, Barclays and BofA are leaning towards a faster solution, suggesting a sale rather than a lengthy IPO process.However, the market turmoil has the potential to shift the dynamic, those people said, as it makes the prospect of achieving a full IPO valuation more challenging.The banks invested about $4.8bn in common equity and provided more than $5bn in financing as part of the original deal, most of which was converted to preferred equity as part of a debt-for-equity restructuring last year.Archstone has sold assets since 2007, making it hard to put a value on its portfolio.“Assuming they have taken care of the assets, this is a very high quality portfolio,” said Andy McCulloch, senior analyst at Green Street Advisors. “The rebound in apartment values has been fairly dramatic, with values for some areas back to, or even past, their peak.”Toronto-based Brookfield is a substantial investor in real estate but has rarely bought residential property. The fund manager prefers distressed situations and tends to avoid auctions, potentially limiting its interest in pursuing Archstone.Blackstone also has a history of large property transactions. The private equity firm made a string of profitable sales after its $36bn buy-out of Equity Office Properties in 2007.EQR and Avalon Bay are residential-focused real estate investment trusts, with market values of about $16bn and $10.7bn respectively.
13;EQR;Equity Residential;2011-02-06T19:58:50Z;Resale fears undermine US housing market;;US house prices are now fairly valued, and in some cases undervalued, according to two measures, but analysts expect declines this year because so many buyers remain skittish about the economy.“In some markets it would be cheaper to own a house than to rent, but people are continuing to rent because they are worried about the resale value,” said John Perry of Deutsche Bank.As a percentage of consumer income, houses are undervalued, both at the national level and in many states, including Nevada, Michigan, Ohio, Florida and Arizona, according to Paul Dales of Capital Economics. As a percentage of rents, home prices are also far below recent highs.Both measures would suggest that home prices should be ready to rebound. Yet many analysts are predicting price declines in 2011 of 5-10 per cent.“For the next several years the more important determinant of single family housing demand, and thus house prices, will be the rent-buy decision and not whether single-family housing is affordable,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.Historically, about a quarter of those who moved out of a rental were doing so to buy a home, Mr Perry said. Today that figure is in the low teens. As a result, apartment vacancies have been falling, to 6.6 per cent at the end of 2010 from 8 per cent a year earlier. “We are seeing a shift away from an ownership to a renting culture,” Mr Perry said.The biggest beneficiaries of this shift are apartment landlords like Equity Residential, Avalon Bay and Camden Property Trust, each of which reported sharply higher earnings last week.“People are a little gun shy right now,” said Rick Sharga, a senior vice president with RealtyTrac. “They aren’t willing to make a long term financial commitment with unemployment levels where they are.”The backlog of foreclosures is also acting as a deterrent. About 300,000 foreclosed homes are currently up for sale and another 700,000 are held by banks, according to Mr Sharga. That is on top of about 6m homes in some stage of default.A foreclosed home typically sells at a 30 per cent discount, which drags down the values of other properties in the neighbourhood. In markets like Las Vegas, where two-thirds of the homes up for sale are foreclosures, the impact has been dramatic.According to the Case-Shiller home price index, Las Vegas was one of eight markets to see November homes prices fall below their previous lows set in spring 2009.
