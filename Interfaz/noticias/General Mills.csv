0;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T02:56:01+0000;Processed foods back on the menu amid panic-buying spree;Cheerios-maker General Mills says sales surged in the past two weeks;Americans who have shifted away from processed foods in recent years in favour of fresher and hipper alternatives appear to have turned back to old staples in the rush to stockpile food during the coronavirus pandemic.General Mills, maker of Cheerios cereals and Green Giant canned vegetables, on Wednesday said its US retail sales had jumped by a “low double digits” percentage in the first week of March and that sales last week were “many times higher” than that.The panic buying — which US authorities have been trying to discourage — began with people stocking up on staples such as cereal, flour and soup, yet more recently there had been “broad-based demand” for a wide range of foods, Minneapolis-based General Mills said.Jonathon Nudi, the company’s head of North America retail, said the crisis would allow it to showcase an improved product line-up and “hopefully drive penetration for the long term”.In a call with Wall Street analysts, he said: “We do believe it’s an opportunity, perhaps as consumers come back and try our products again after several years to see the products and the improvements that we’ve made. We’ve worked hard over the past few years to renovate the majority of our product lines.”He was speaking after posting quarterly financial results on Wednesday that showed once again how General Mills, in common with much of the packaged food industry, has been finding it hard to win over consumers.The group produced net sales of $4.2bn in the quarter ended February 23, before panic buying began, unchanged from the same period a year ago. Net income ticked up 2 per cent to $454m. Jeffrey Harmening, chief executive, said the company had so far been able to meet the recent demand surge. It has told workers who were sick to stay home and that they would be paid.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereDespite “pictures of store shelves being empty”, he said, “food continues to flow. Our retailers continue to stock as quickly as they can.”He also discussed the company’s advertising, saying he wanted to ensure that General Mills struck an “appropriate” tone. “Our message has to be appropriate for the time,” he said, adding it would aim not to encourage stockpiling.Shares in General Mills were down 7 per cent by lunchtime in New York although they are still up 7 per cent for the year, compared with a 21 per cent slump in the S&P 500 index.

1;GIS;General Mills;2019-06-26T16:56:07Z;Snack attack for General Mills as revenue misses guidance;;General Mills tumbled more than 9 per cent in morning trade, dragging share prices of its peers along for the ride, after declining snack sales in its main North American market and poor performances from its international divisions saw the food manufacturer fall short of Wall Street’s revenue expectations.Adding to the disappointment, the company forecast a range of adjusted earnings growth that implied no improvement on its 2019 result that managed to come in ahead of its own and Wall Street’s expectations thanks to the boost provided by last year’s acquisition of fast-growing luxury pet foodmaker Blue Buffalo.The Minneapolis-based foodmaker reported a 7 per cent rise in net sales to $4.16bn in the three months ended May 26, which fell short of the median estimate of $4.24bn in a survey of analysts by Refinitiv.In particular, net sales for North America retail fell 2 per cent in the fourth quarter to $2.34bn, with declines in US snacks and Canada, and flat performances for its cereal, yoghurt and meals & baking operating units. Net sales in the Europe & Australia unit were down from a strong performance a year ago and owing to challenging operating conditions in France and slower ice cream sales, while a strong dollar weighed down sales from the Asia & Latin America division.Organic sales, which strip out those from newly acquired or divested businesses, fell 1 per cent overall in the fourth quarter from a year ago.In its pet segment, which has been propped up by last year’s $8bn acquisition of natural pet foodmaker Blue Buffalo, pro forma net sales rose 38 per cent to $406m in the fourth quarter. Like many food industry rivals, General Mills is betting the fast-growing pet food segment will offset declining sales for their more traditional, human-focused, packaged foods businesses.Diluted earnings of 94 cents a share were up 59 per cent from a year ago and ahead of Wall Street forecasts for 75 cents a share, while adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share were up 5 per cent from last year and six cents above analysts’ expectations.For the 2020 fiscal year, General Mills forecast organic net sales would increase between 1 per cent and 2 per cent, compared to the “flat” result it had in the 12 months ended May 26. Three months ago, the company said it expected 2019 organic net sales to rise at the lower end of its initial flat to up 1 per cent range.The company expects constant-currency adjusted earnings to rise between 3 per cent and 5 per cent from the $3.22 a share it reported it 2019. The midpoint of that range would match its growth rate of the fiscal year just completed, but a touch higher than the $3.31 a share forecast among analysts.General Mills shares fell as much as 9.6 per cent in morning trade to their lowest level this month, before trimming that decline to 4.6 per cent.Among packaged goods peers, Campbell Soup fell 1.8 per cent, Kellogg and Mondelez were each down 1.5 per cent, while Post Holdings dropped 1 per cent.
2;GIS;General Mills;2019-03-20T16:57:31Z;Pet foods and price increases help General Mills buck packaged food gloom;;General Mills has become that rarest of beasts — a packaged food company that is raising, rather than cutting, its guidance.The company behind Cheerios cereal, Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Yoplait yoghurt is boosting its profit outlook for the year as it reaps the benefits of price increases and the addition of higher margin pet food sales following its acquisition of Blue Buffalo last year.Shares rose as much as 4.8 per cent to a one year high of $49.50 as General Mills also delivered higher sales and margin gains for the fiscal third quarter.The Minneapolis-based group said on Wednesday it now expects adjusted profit growth for the fiscal 2019 year to be between flat and 1 per cent, compared to its prior forecast that ranged from no growth to 3 per cent decline.“Our year-to-date performance and fourth-quarter plans give us confidence that we will meet or exceed all of our key fiscal 2019 targets,” said chief executive Jeff Harmening.Like other packaged food companies, General Mills has been wrestling with higher transport and commodity prices that have been driving up its operating costs. That has come even as growing consumer preference for fresh and healthier offerings has heaped pressure on sales at its core cereal and yoghurt businesses.In response, General Mills has been cutting costs and raising prices. It also made a bold bet last February with a $8bn deal for Blue Buffalo — the self-described “Whole Foods of dog food.”While critics have pointed to slowing sales momentum at the business since the acquisition as a source of concern, General Mills said on Wednesday it expects growth at the unit to “accelerate meaningfully” in the fourth quarter as it works on getting the brand into more stores.“We remain on track to deliver double-digit top and bottom-line growth for Blue Buffalo in fiscal 2019,” Mr Harmening added during a call with analyst.For the three months to February 24, sales came in at $4.19bn, a 8.1 per cent rise from the year ago period. Within this, organic sales rose 1 per cent while gross margin increased by a hefty 200 basis points to 34.4 per cent of net sales.Adjusted net income, which strips out the effect of last year’s tax gains and other one offs, was 83 cents per diluted share and topped analysts’ expectations for 69 cents a share.General Mill’s stronger guidance stands in contrast to Kraft Heinz, which last month revealed a $15bn writedown, a one-third cut to its dividend and an SEC investigation into its accounting. Kellogg, the company behind Cornflakes, Pop Tarts and Pringles chips, flagged an expected decline in its 2019 underlying earnings.
3;GIS;General Mills;2019-02-19T15:46:29Z;Foodmakers General Mills and Mondelez reaffirm 2019 outlooks;;General Mills and Mondelez have both stuck to their full-year financial forecasts, with both foodmakers pointing to the fruits of recent strategic plans that have been introduced there.The two companies, like others in the food & beverage industry, are scrambling to reinvent themselves as consumer tastes shift towards more health-conscious snacks. They both raised prices within the past year for their North American products in an effort to claw back rising costs for raw commodities and freight.The pair separately reaffirmed their targets at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference on Tuesday, but investors appeared nonplussed and pushed shares in the two companies lower in morning trade.Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury chocolates and Oreo cookies, reiterated its expectations for organic revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, to increase by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent in 2019.The company said it expected adjusted earnings per share at constant currency to increase 3 per cent to 5 per cent. Foreign exchange effects would decrease net revenue by 3 per cent, Mondelez said, or a 7 cent a share impact on adjusted earnings.Mondelez had adjusted earnings of $2.43 a share in 2018, and analysts polled by Refinitiv expect that to rise 2 per cent to $2.48 this year.“I’m encouraged by early results as we implement our new strategy, which enabled us to meet or exceed our financial commitments in 2018,” Dirk Van de Put, chief executive, said in a statement. “We have entered 2019 with strong momentum, a new commercial structure that is closer to the consumer and clear investment priorities to accelerate growth.”General Mills reaffirmed its suite of forecasts, including organic net sales being flat to up 1 per cent and currency-adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to be flat to down 3 per cent. It reiterated that currency translation effects might shave 1 to 2 percentage points from net sales growth in fiscal 2019, but “is not expected to have a material impact on full-year adjusted operating profit or adjusted diluted EPS.”The company said it was competing effectively through consumer marketing and in stores, as well as accelerating growth across its major product categories including Häagen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, Old El Paso Mexican food, and its portfolio of natural and organic food brands. “Growth-enhancing acquisitions”, namely that of upscale pet foodmaker Blue Buffalo last year, are also tilting it towards fast-growing segments, General Mills said.Mondelez shares were down 0.6 per cent, while those in General Mills were off 0.3 per cent, versus a 0.1 per cent decline for the benchmark S&P 500.Correction: This post has been amended to reflect Mondelez’s 2019 guidance, and not its long-term growth targets.
4;GIS;General Mills;2018-12-19T16:37:58Z;Higher prices help General Mills beat on earnings;The maker of Cheerios and Haagen-Dazs has raised prices to boost profits;General Mills booked stronger quarterly earnings than expected on Wednesday as the food giant benefited from its move to increase prices.The Minneapolis-based company, known for its grocery store staples such as Cheerios cereal and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, said in March it would raise prices for some of its products to combat higher freight costs and commodity costs. Rivals including Mondelez and Kraft Heinz have also moved to increase prices amid worries that inflationary pressures would drag on profits.General Mills said its adjusted gross margin expanded 10 basis points to 34.5 per cent in its fiscal second quarter ending on November 25, citing improved price realisation and mix as well as cost savings. Chief executive Jeff Harmening also noted the acquisition of premium pet-food brand Blue Buffalo, a higher-margin business.Price gains helped offset weaker demand in North America, where retail sales were down 3 per cent year-over-year at $2.68bn. General Mills said reduced merchandising activity such as promotions impacted sales during the quarter.“Our cost and capital discipline drove profit growth ahead of our expectation in the first half of our fiscal year,” Mr Harmening said during an earnings call with analysts. “Our job to do for the second half is very clear and that is to accelerate our sales growth in our North America retail and Pet segments while we maintain our cost discipline and we’re confident in the plans we have to do just that.”General Mills has sought to expand its organic foods and pet products at a time when consumer demand for cereal has cooled off. For Blue Buffalo, the company said it plans to double distribution and increase the assortment of products in stores during the second half of its fiscal year.In the latest quarter, Blue Buffalo’s operating profit fell 20 per cent to $71m on a pro forma basis amid lower sales volume. General Mills completed its $8bn purchase of Blue Buffalo in April.General Mills said overall net earnings slipped 20 per cent to $343m, or 57 cents a share. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share climbed to 85 cents from 82 cents. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were looking for earnings of 81 cents a share.Total sales were up 5 per cent at $4.41bn, missing a consensus estimate of $4.51bn.Shares rallied 6.1 per cent to $38.92 in recent trading. General Mills is down 34 per cent year-to-date.
5;GIS;General Mills;2018-09-18T12:12:27Z;General Mills earnings top expectations but sales fall short;First quarter net sales climbed 9 per cent from a year ago;General Mills on Tuesday issued upbeat first-quarter earnings that were overshadowed by a drop in its gross margin and sales that turned up just shy of Wall Street estimates.The Minneapolis-based company behind Cheerios cereal, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Yoplait yoghurt, said first quarter net sales climbed 9 per cent from a year ago — aided by its acquisition of Blue Buffalo — to $4.09bn, just shy of analyst expectations for $4.12bn.Net sales slipped 2 per cent in North America, while sales in its convenience stores and food service segment increased 4 per cent. Organic net sales increased modestly and climbed for the fourth consecutive quarter, the company said.General Mills and other consumer goods companies have been working to revive sales growth amid a broader shift in how Americans eat. Earlier this year, the company moved into the fast-growing pet food market with a $8bn acquisition of Blue Buffalo— a move it said represented a “significant milestone” as it reshaped its portfolio.The company added that net earnings in the first quarter slipped to $392.3m or 65 cents a share, compared with $404.7m or 69 cents a share in the year ago quarter. The drop reflected lower after-tax joint venture earnings. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 71 cents a share, topping analyst expectations for 64 cents.The company’s gross margin slipped 200 basis points to 32.8 per cent of sales. Adjusting for one-off items, the company said gross margin slipped to 33.6 per cent as a result of higher prices and impact of its Blue Buffalo acquisition.Looking ahead, the company affirmed its outlook for fiscal 2019 organic net sales to be flat or up 1 per cent. Net sales are projected to rise between 9 and 10 per cent, including results from its Blue Buffalo acquisition.General Mill shares, which are down nearly 20 per cent year to date, slipped 4 per cent in pre-market trade.
6;GIS;General Mills;2018-07-08T04:01:25Z;‘A good living but a rough life’: trucker shortage holds US economy back;Some 70 per cent of goods are transported by road, but a shortage of drivers and soaring demand could put a brake on growth ;"The Miracle Mile in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, is a vital capillary in the US freight transport system. Linking interstate highway 81 to the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the road is just an overnight drive away from half the country’s population. Thousands of trucks shuttle along it daily carrying everything from lumber to fizzy drinks. Their drivers are well served. Three truck stops offer showers, burgers, video games and diesel fuel. Stores sell tail lights and hub caps. The lonely can visit the Carlisle Truck Stop Ministry, its biblical tracts stacked in a white metal trailer, or a pornography emporium called Mature Fantasy in a red building behind a stockade fence. These days the mile also acts as a recruitment ground for desperate employers seeking new talent. The magazine rack inside the Petro truck stop is piled with brochures listing scores of openings for people with commercial driver’s licences. Roadside signs plead for applicants outside the offices of Knight Transportation, Keen Transport and ABF Freight. At the Flying J truck stop, driver Alvin Perry, taking a break before continuing his journey to North Carolina, says he has been poached four times in two years. “People change jobs all the time,” he says with a grin. “I just changed this week.” If the US economy — growing at about 2 per cent a year — is approaching maximum velocity, the trucking industry is a force governing its speed. Trucks move 70 per cent of goods in the country by tonnage, but fleets are nearing full capacity. The constraint is not equipment; it is a lack of drivers. Autonomous vehicles may one day rule the roads, but in 2018 every truck still requires at least one human in the cab. With the US unemployment rate at 4 per cent many workers have the option of a different livelihood and carriers report a shortfall of 51,000 drivers. The effects are rippling through the supply chain. Consumer and food companies ranging from Kraft Heinz and 3M to Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble have identified rising freight costs as a drain on business, and some are raising consumer prices to compensate. General Mills last month partly blamed rising transport costs for 625 redundancies it will make this year. Energy companies in Texas complain that difficulties in finding truckers are creating an obstacle to drilling for and marketing crude oil. “Transportation clearly is a big inhibitor to the expansion of the US economy,” says Tim Fiore of the Institute for Supply Management, a research group. “There is no short-term end in sight because driver labour is hard to find.”The tightness in the trucking market is attracting scrutiny as the economy shows flickers of inflationary pressures. The national average rate for hiring a “dry van” box trailer increased 30 per cent in the year to June to $2.32 per mile, the highest on record, according to DAT Solutions, an online trucking service. The Federal Reserve’s latest snapshot of regional economies lists truck driving as first among the jobs facing worker shortages. One North Carolina trucking company quadrupled rates in an attempt to curtail demand, “but found that some customers were willing to pay the new rates”, the Fed reported. It represents a remarkable turnround from 2015 when carriers bemoaned a “freight recession”. In the first five months of 2018, truck tonnage has raced 8 per cent higher year on year, according to the American Trucking Associations. Shares in listed trucking companies have risen twice as fast as the wider US stock market in the past year. Wages are also pushing upward after years of lagging behind inflation. Between December and June, median per-mile pay increased 8.2 per cent to 39.8 cents, according to the National Transportation Institute, a data group. Jumping ship can be lucrative. In February US Xpress, a carrier based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, announced that $50,000 bonuses and four weeks of holiday awaited two-driver teams. The median salary for drivers hauling fully loaded trucks on irregular routes across the US was $53,000, an ATA survey showed, relatively good pay for a job that does not require a university degree.The offers have led to plenty of job-hopping — employee turnover was 94 per cent among large truckload carriers in the first quarter, ATA says — but little recruitment from outside the industry. The 1.29m truck drivers identified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in May was up 15,000 from April but still fewer than the number in the summer of 2015. The retail trade, a sector perceived as dying, has added more than 300,000 positions in the same period. “I don’t really see any solution to the driver problem, unless the economy slows and the unemployment rate rises,” John Steele, chief financial officer of Werner Enterprises, a Denver-based carrier, told a conference in June.Trucking has actually fallen as a share of total US employment, says Rob Martin, economist at UBS. He says that while the tight market has raised freight costs for shippers, competition between online and traditional retailers has so far kept a lid on consumer prices. Driving a truck across America has never been an easy job. Spending weeks on the road can be solitary, dull and, federal statistics show, more likely fatal than service as a police officer. Sleep often comes in the bunk of a cab bathed in the fumes of other idling vehicles. It is not the first time drivers have been scarce. In 1999, at the height of the dotcom bubble, the Financial Times reported an “acute” shortage during the festive season rush. The squeeze reappeared during the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But this is different, industry veterans warn. “It’s probably the tightest driver environment that I’ve seen,” says Eric Fuller, US Xpress chief executive. Not just anyone can walk in to a job. Big-rig drivers need to first earn a Class A commercial driver’s licence after a training course that can take six weeks and cost several thousand dollars. To cross state lines a driver must be at least 21 years old, putting long-haul routes off limits to recent school graduates and dropouts as they start their careers. New drivers must also pass drug tests, a significant hurdle as companies dip deeper into the labour pool. Carriers are increasingly testing hair follicles as well as urine, enabling detection of substances used months earlier. This makes it harder for those who are only recently drug-free. JB Hunt, a large national carrier, recorded 1,213 job applicants who tested positive for drugs using the hair test in 2017, according to Trucking Alliance, an industry group. Nine out of 10 of them had passed urinalysis.John Snyder admits the career is not for everyone. In his 42 years on the road he has driven millions of miles through 46 US states. He was often out of town during his family’s Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. “I missed both my kids’ graduations,” he says over a late lunch of ketchup-covered eggs and coffee at a Denny’s restaurant. His children are now in their 30s. Neither drives a truck. Mr Snyder is on his third marriage. “It’s a good living, but it’s a rough life. It takes a great deal of personal sacrifice and commitment to do the job. That’s why there’s a shortage,” he says. Observers say the trucking shortage reflects a loss of union representation across much of the industry, irregular pay often based on miles driven and the results of inflated promises to recruits. The male-dominated and peripatetic nature of the industry has made it difficult to attract women. Only 4 per cent of drivers are aged under 25, according to ATA, suggesting the industry is struggling to lure younger workers who have plenty of options in construction, energy and other blue-collar sectors. The country music star George Strait recorded a tribute to long-haul truckers. “Freedom’s your best friend,” he sang to them, calling drivers “brothers of the highway, children of the wind”.If freedom was ever a selling point, it is gone now. Truckers describe a life of increasing surveillance. The most recent constraint came in April when a grace period ended for enforcing the use of electronic logging devices, or ELDs. The gadgets track whether drivers are following a daily limit of 14 hours on duty, including a maximum of 11 behind the wheel, removing the opportunity to cheat — and make more money — with the use of paper logs. ELDs may make highways safer. But they have also effectively removed truck capacity just as the strong economy demanded more cargo loads. In the first quarter, enforcement of the rule created demand for another 80,000 drivers, above and beyond that from the strong freight market, says Noel Perry, a consultant with Transport Futures. Veteran drivers such as Ted Hendrickson believe the devices impinge on his liberty. “ELDs seem to think they know when I’m tired,” says the 66-year-old driver from Texas, smoking a cigarette during his 10-hour break. Dante Staciokas, a driver relations manager for a Pennsylvania-based carrier, says the job began to change in the 1980s, when the industry was deregulated. As carriers competed on price and sharpened their focus on costs a “meat in the seat” mentality took hold, he says.“Driving a truck went from being a profession in which to aspire to one of the most stressful occupations in the country. Truckers found their jobs had become very much like that of the products they hauled: a disposable commodity,” says Mr Staciokas. Truck customers, known as shippers, no longer have the whip hand. The ratio of loads requiring transport to available truck vans has surged 80 per cent in the past year to 10 to one, according to DAT Solutions. Shippers must now pay higher rates for prompt service. Even then, there is no guarantee a truck will arrive. “There is freight for which we can’t take a big enough rate increase to deal with the inefficiencies that our drivers experience. So we just say that’s business we’re not doing,” Chris Lofgren, chief executive of Schneider National, a leading carrier, told a New York conference. Warehouses are putting on a beauty pageant in the hope of building a reputation as a “shipper of choice”, says Josh Brogan of AT Kearney, a consultancy. This means quicker loading times, cutting penalties for tardy truckers and treating drivers with respect. Load skidded steel coils in Franklin, Ohio.

Avoid coming here at all costs.” America’s loading docks may become further strained as retailers stock up for the winter holiday shopping season. Mike Regan, whose consultancy TranzAct Technologies advises shippers on logistics, warns it will last well into 2019. “Call it the freight-pocalypse,” Mr Regan says. “It’s not going to change any time soon.” Autonomous vehicles could eliminate as many as three in five heavy and tractor-trailer truck driver jobs starting in 2030, according to research from Securing America’s Future Energy, a Washington-based advocacy group that backs the technology. If that proves to be the case it will turn a shortage into a glut and leave Silicon Valley and Washington grappling with the social costs and benefits. Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, chief executive of Starsky Robotics, is developing trucks that drive themselves along intercity highways and operate by remote control. He calls the process of filling cabs a chronic problem for the sector. “You can’t solve that problem if you still need a person in a truck,” he says. “We’re making trucks that operate without people.”McKinsey, the consultancy, estimates that self-driving vehicles could eventually reduce trucking labour costs by as much as 90 per cent. Carriers may use the threat of an automated future as a “hammer” to suppress driver wages, warns Sam Loesche, legislative representative at the Teamsters union. In June companies including Daimler, FedEx and Uber launched a lobbying group, the Partnership for Transportation Innovation and Opportunity, to address AVs and jobs. And Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas congresswoman, introduced a bill to fund the retraining of workers displaced by self-driving vehicles in a sign of the growing concern. “The issue is not if new jobs will arise eventually in the wake of AV displacements (they most certainly will),” says the Safe survey. “But whether AV adoption will impose very high costs on displaced workers, their families and communities.” "
7;GIS;General Mills;2018-05-18T17:48:34Z;Campbell Soup woes knock wider packaged food stocks;;Campbell Soup is on track for its worst one-day drop in over 19 years on Friday following a profit warning and the abrupt departure of its chief executive.But the comments from the food and snack giant on higher transport and commodity costs are also weighing on the wider US packaged food and beverage sector.Here is a rundown of some of the moves in midday New York trade:Companies from tyre maker Goodyear to trash bag and bleach maker Clorox to airlines have all sounded the alarm bell on rising cost pressures this earnings season.But for big food companies, the squeeze is being felt on multiple fronts — with higher crude and metal prices driving up packaging costs while the rebound in agricultural prices is driving up input ingredient costs. Rising fuel prices and a tighter labour market are also running up the amount companies are having to shell over for transport and logistics.All this is coming at a time when many of the companies are struggling with declining sales of their mainstay brands. This in turn makes it harder for them to pass on the price increases to bargain savvy consumers, especially given the ever growing number of new entrants in the food and snacks market.Anthony DiSilvestro, Campbell’s chief financial officer said in a call with analysts, that he is expecting costs for everything from carrots to cardboard packaging to go up this year.“We’re seeing and expecting an acceleration on the rate of inflation across a number of ingredient and packaging items,” he said. “For example, we expect double digit increases on steel and aluminum. A lot of that driven or all of it’s driven by the impact of anticipated tariffs.”“We’re also expecting higher inflation on wheat and vegetables and resins and corrugated,” he added. “So this is a meaningful shift in the inflation outlook.”
8;GIS;General Mills;2018-03-21T17:42:27Z;Truck driver shortage squeezes General Mills profits;Historic lack of road freight and higher material costs hit Cheerios maker;"General Mills shares tumbled on Wednesday as the processed food giant warned its profits this year would be squeezed by cost pressures including a historic shortage of truck drivers.The woes of the maker of Cheerios cereal have become common for consumer goods companies. With the US economy heating up, freight, shipping, and commodities costs are rising. But the discounting strategies of retailing powers Amazon and Wal-Mart are making it difficult for goods makers to raise prices.General Mills said it was slashing its earnings forecast for the year as a result. Jeff Harmening, chief executive, said he was ""disappointed"" and promised the company is ""moving urgently to address this increasingly dynamic cost inflation environment"". The company’s response includes changing its modes of transportation and increasing the number of freight carriers it works with, but the measures are not expected to meaningfully improve profits until the 2019 fiscal year.""Like the broader industry, we're seeing sharp increases in input costs, including inflation in freight and commodities,"" Mr Harmening said. General Mills now expects its adjusted earnings in 2018 to rise up to 1 per cent for the fiscal year, a downgrade from its previous guidance for a rise of up to 4 per cent.In the US, rates to hire long-distance trucks have soared as truck utilisation has reached 100 per cent and an improving job market has made it hard to find drivers. The producer price index for truck transportation is up 5.3 per cent year on year, and some carriers are offering $50,000 bonuses for new drivers.The makers of snacks and packaged food are also paying more for ingredients. Shares in General Mills fell 9.7 per cent in morning trading to their lowest level in more than five years. The stock of the company based in Minneapolis has dropped more than 20 per cent in the past year.In the three months to the end of February, gross margins fell 2.2 percentage points to 32.3 per cent, which the company attributes to freight and logistics costs, and commodity inflation.Sales in the quarter climbed 2.3 per cent to $3.88bn, outpacing consensus forecasts for $3.78bn. Adjusted earnings per share were 79 cent. Analysts were looking for 78 cents.Last month, General Mills announced it would acquire luxury pet foodmaker Blue Buffalo, in an $8bn deal RBC analysts called “surprising and pricey”. The company is trying to pivot away from products like cereal, which are suffering from slow or declining growth, and towards faster-growing items, like natural pet treats. Companies ranging from Hershey to Clorox have also felt the pinch from rising commodities and logistics costs in recent months."
9;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;GIS;General Mills;2018-03-21T15:40:43Z;Cereal killer? Food stocks fall on General Mills forecast;;Wall Street has lost its appetite for big consumer food companies after General Mills — the US-based maker of foods ranging from Lucky Charms cereal and Nature Valley granola bars to Yoplait yoghurt — trimmed its forecast citing “sharp increases in input costs” affecting the broader industry.Just ahead of lunchtime in New York, shares of rival breakfast cereal maker Kellogg were down 3.5 per cent to $63.90. Other consumer food giants were also weaker:•JM Smucker down 4.2 per cent to $120.40•ConAgra Foods down 3.8 per cent to $35.03•Campbell Soup down 2.9 per cent to $41.84•Hershey off 2.15 per cent to $98.18•Kraft Heinz down 1.4 per cent to $62.29General Mills itself is down 9.6 per cent to $45.12, putting it on track for their steepest one-day decline since March 2009.Many of the largest US food companies have been grappling to adapt their portfolios to account for shifting consumer tastes, both in terms of a preference for fresher, healthier offerings and a cost-conscious approach to how they fill their shopping carts. That has left investors worrying about how the companies will be able to trim costs to fortify their bottom line while still finding new ways to expand their share of grocery store shelves.
11;GIS;General Mills;2018-03-21T14:45:34Z;Unlucky charm: General Mills shares fall 10% on weaker outlook;;Trouble at Mills. General Mills, that is, after the food manufacturer cut its outlook for the full year largely owing to cost pressures.The Minneapolis-based company, best known as the maker of Cheerios and Lucky Charms cereals and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, was “seeing sharp increases in input costs, including inflation in freight and commodities” as well as higher operational costs, chairman and chief executive Jeff Harmening said.Initiatives to reduce the company’s long-term cost structure and efforts to improve productivity are not expected to meaningfully effect the bottom line until the 2019 fiscal year. Last month, General Mills announced it would acquire luxury pet foodmaker Blue Buffalo in a bid to pivot away from products like cereal, which are suffering from slow or declining growth.All up, General Mills said it expected constant currency operating profit to be down 5 per cent to 6 per cent this fiscal year, compared with previous expectations of between flat and down 1 per cent. That should feed through to earnings per share being flat to up 1 per cent from $3.08 a share in 2017, and down from previous guidance of a 3 per cent to 4 per cent rise.Organic growth in net sales is expected to be in line with last year, which was down 3 per cent to $15.62bn.In the third quarter ended February 25, General Mills saw net sales rise 2.3 per cent year-on-year to $3.88bn, which was slightly ahead of the median forecast of $3.77bn in a Thomson Reuters survey. Net earnings fell 10.5 per cent to $11.1m.Shares were down 10 per cent to $44.93 in morning trade on Wednesday.
12;GIS;General Mills;2018-03-19T00:01:19Z;Multinationals fail to name palm-oil producers;Greenpeace surveyed 16 consumer goods companies about the origins of the raw material;Leading consumer goods companies including Kraft Heinz, Johnson & Johnson and Carex soap maker PZ Cussons have failed to disclose the producers of their palm oil supplies, despite pledging to achieve traceability in one of their key ingredients.A report published by environmental group Greenpeace on Monday asked 16 companies to publish the names of their palm oil producers, but half — Ferrero, Hershey, Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo, PZ Cussons and Smucker’s — did not.The other half — Colgate-Palmolive, General Mills, Mars, Mondelez, Nestlé, P&G, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever — have disclosed producer lists, although all eight revealed that their supplies still included palm oil from producers that destroy rainforests.Many consumer goods use palm oil, from ice cream and nut spreads to soap and shampoo, and environmentalists have blamed the clearing of land for its production for destroying vast tracts of forest in south-east Asia over the past few decades.Some 24m hectares — an area almost the size of the UK — of Indonesia’s rainforest was destroyed between 1990 and 2015 according to government estimates, while a recent study from academic journal Current Biology revealed that more than 100,000 Bornean orang-utans were lost between 1999 and 2015.Western consumer goods groups have been under pressure to ensure that their raw material is purchased from sources with sound environmental and labour practices.But Greenpeace said unless palm oil users traced the source of the products, deforestation would continue. “We can’t end deforestation by box-ticking,” said Richard George, forests campaigner at Greenpeace.Of those that failed to disclose their palm oil producers, PepsiCo and Ferrero confirmed that they would do so in the near future. PepsiCo reaffirmed its commitment to using 100 per cent certified sustainable palm oil by 2020 and said it would publish its list of producers “in the coming days”. Ferrero said it would be producing a full list of the mills from which it sources palm oil in May.Hershey said it had mapped more than 99 per cent of its palm oil supply chain to the mills, and identified 14 per cent of the plantations where its palm oil comes from but would not publish the names due to confidentiality agreements.Other companies emphasised transparency over confidentiality.Marc Engel, chief supply chain officer at Unilever, which was the first consumer group to publish its producer list earlier this year, said: “Due to traditional commercial sensitivities and the complexity of the palm oil supply chain, it has required perseverance to get to where we are now.” He added that “complete transparency is needed for radical transformation”.Nestlé said its ambition remained that, by the end of 2020, all of the palm oil it used would be both traceable and responsibly sourced.Alastair Child, vice-president of global sustainability at Mars Wrigley Confectionery, said the company would use its influence to push for further changes while Jonathan Horrell, director of sustainability at Mondelez, acknowledged that the company’s work was not over and pledged to speed up progress on the ground. Reckitt Benckiser said more needed to be done with the entire industry.Kellogg’s said it had shared its list of suppliers with Greenpeace, but did not challenge the group’s report. Kraft Heinz, Johnson & Johnson, PZ Cussons and Smucker’s did not respond to requests for comment.
13;GIS;General Mills;2018-02-23T18:05:27Z;General Mills/Blue Buffalo: Pet sounds;Pet food has gone hipster and its price tag reflects that;Selling packaged food to humans has become a dicey proposition. For cereal purveyor General Mills that means it is time to pivot to cats and dogs. On Friday, the Cheerios maker announced that it would acquire listed hipster pet food upstart, Blue Buffalo for $8bn in total consideration.Blue Buffalo has taken advantage of a “humanisation of pets” trend by offering such fare as “grain-free chicken” options for Fido. The problem is that turning round a stagnant business via M&A is rarely a success.Between 2010 and 2017, Blue Buffalo revenue increased from $200m to $1.3bn. Trends have been less rosy for General Mills. Organic sales growth in fiscal 2017 was down 3 per cent. That trend reflects millennial consumers shunning the processed and packaged foods that their parents devoured. Millennials favour natural and fresh foods.The big consumer companies that had been accustomed to steady growth across economic cycles have seen healthy valuations, often above 20 times net earnings, erode and their marketing budgets become unsustainable. General Mills shares are down more than a quarter since mid 2016.Rivals like Campbell’s Soup and Hershey have made acquisitions of natural foods groups recently to jump-start growth.But the big prices paid will not translate into fundamentally different businesses for years. The $8bn price tag for Blue Buffalo is about a fifth of General Mills’ enterprise value. However, its revenue contribution will be less than a tenth of General Mills pro forma sales.The Blue Buffalo purchase price implies a cash flow multiple of a whopping 25 times. Even with General Mills’ investment grade rating and an all-cash purchase price, the transaction will be dilutive to upcoming earnings. Unsurprisingly, General Mills shares fell 3 per cent on Friday. Dogs might be man’s best friend. Investors are less generous.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

14;GIS;General Mills;2018-02-23T12:56:01Z;General Mills offers $8bn for luxury pet food maker Blue Buffalo;Says that ‘in pet food, as in human food, consumers are seeking more natural products’;General Mills is making a foray into the fast-growing market for natural pet foods after announcing it will buy luxury dog foodmaker Blue Buffalo Pet Products in a deal worth about $8bn.Described around the time of its 2015 initial public offering as the “ Whole Foods of dog food”, Blue Buffalo is one of the fastest-growing major companies making natural pet treats for dogs and cats within the $30bn US pet food industry.The Minneapolis-based company, best known as the maker of Cheerios and Lucky Charms cereals and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, will acquire Blue for $40 a share in cash, representing a 17.2 per cent premium to the target’s closing price on Thursday of $34.12. That gives the target an enterprise value of about $8bn, taking into account the total debt of $471m and cash of $283m the company had on its balance sheet as of December 31.In pre-market trading on the Nasdaq on Friday, Blue shares were 17.4 per cent higher to $40.05 while General Mills was down 0.4 per cent at $54.75. General Mills’ offer is double Blue’s 2015 initial public offering price of $20.General Mills Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Harmening said in a statement on Friday the acquisition of Blue represented a “significant milestone” as the company reshaped its portfolio in an effort to drive growth and shareholder returns.“In pet food, as in human food, consumers are seeking more natural and premium products and we have tremendous respect for how attentive Blue Buffalo has been to the needs of their consumers, pet parents and pets, as they have built their brand,” Mr Harmening said.“[W]e expect to help Blue Buffalo by leveraging our extensive supply chain, R&D and sales & marketing resources. We will in turn benefit from their experience building one of the strongest pull brands in the CPG world,” he added.Blue on Friday announced a 10.9 per cent increase in annual sales to $1.28bn in the 12 months ended December 31 and 24.3 per cent jump in adjusted net income to $195m.Analysts at Susquehanna said the deal made sense for General Mills and was not unexpected. “We think there is potential for counter bids, either from companies like [J M Smucker] (trying to bulk up their pet food portfolio), Nestlé (pet food is a priority), or from [consumer packaged goods] companies not in pet food at present trying to diversify into faster growth categories,” they wrote in a note on Friday morning.
15;GIS;General Mills;2017-12-20T12:38:55Z;Cereal helps feed General Mills sales growth;;General Mills saw sales edge up slightly versus a year ago over the last three months thanks to a boost from sweet cereals, despite a continued slide in US yoghurt sales.The Minneapolis, Minnesota-headquartered consumer food giant said on Wednesday that net sales for the three months ending November 26 were up 2 per cent compared to the same period a year earlier at $4.2bn, slightly beating out analysts’ estimated for $4.08bn.Growth in its largest segment, North America, saw a boost from a 7 per cent increase in US cereals — including its new Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, as well as sweet classics including Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Coco Puffs. However, US net yoghurt sales were down 11 per cent, with new offerings like Oui by Yoplait failing to fully offset continued declines for Yoplait Greek and Yoplait Light.Net earnings attributable to General Mills fell to $430.5m in the quarter, a 10 per cent decline from the same period a year earlier, amid a retail environment that has seen heavy discounting throughout grocery store aisles. The company attributed the year-over-year drop to higher input costs, currency-driven inflation on imported products and higher advertising and media expenses, among other factors.Analysts had been looking for net income of $480m. Diluted earnings per share of 74 cents missed estimates for 81 cents, but adjusted for one-time items came in at 82 cents, in line with expectations.After results from the quarter — the second of its fiscal 2018 — General Mills said it is now looking for organic net sales to stay flat or fall as much as 1 per cent over the year, a boost from its previous forecast of declines between 1 and 2 per cent. Adjusted operating profit margin, however, is seen at coming in lower than last year, versus its previous anticipation of year-over-year improvement.General Mills shares are down 6.7 per cent so far this year, as the company looks to remain its toehold in the fiercely competitive packaged food landscape. Those competitive pressures were underscored earlier this week, when two rivals — Campbell and Hershey — both gobbled up smaller snacking rivals.After the results, the company’s shares were trading up 2 per cent in pre-market trading.Photo: Getty
16;GIS;General Mills;2017-09-20T20:37:50Z;Best Logistics shares gain ground on New York debut;Apple fall pushes technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slightly lower;Shares in Alibaba-backed Best Logistics climbed as much as 19 per cent after the company’s stock began trading in New York on Wednesday, despite the Chinese logistics group scaling back the size of its initial public offering this week.The company, known and listed as Best Inc in the US, priced its shares at $10 apiece on Wednesday, at the bottom end of the more muted range of $10 to $11 a share. That was down from the initial indicated range of $13 to $15 a share. It sold 45m shares rather than the 53.6m initially planned.The scaled-back IPO size and pricing appears to have enticed some investors, with Best Inc climbing to $11.73 a share in the first hour of trading in New York. Its shares later lost steam, closing the day 5.2 per cent higher at $10.52.The post-IPO performance of fellow Chinese logistics operator ZTO Express — which went public at $19.50 last October but is trading at $14.99 a share — was a headwind to Best Inc’s IPO. But even at the reduced size, Best still ranks as the largest flotation from a Chinese company in the US this year, according to Dealogic.Despite the first day rise in Best’s share price, investors were less sanguine on the prospects for technology stocks on Wednesday. The tech sector was the third-worst performing on the S&P 500, falling 0.5 per cent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent, under pressure from Apple shares. The iPhone maker dropped 1.7 per cent to $156.07 as a number of less than glowing reviews for the newly launched Apple Watch were published.The drop took the Nasdaq to 6,456. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, by contrast, rose 0.2 per cent to hit a high of 22,412, as did the S&P 500, which ticked up 0.1 per cent to 2,508. The declines in technology shares were offset by an uptick in the stock prices of energy and industrials companies.Analysts with Rosenblatt Securities also warned on Wednesday that iPhone 8 pre-orders were “substantially lower” than iPhone 6 and 7 levels.“We understand many customers could be waiting for the iPhone X, but we are concerned iPhone 8/8 Plus sell-through could bring some headwinds,” said Jun Zhang, an analyst with Rosenblatt.The declines on the S&P 500 were led by General Mills, the cereal maker, after it reported a drop in sales and profits in its fiscal first quarter.Shares of the maker of Cheerios and Yoplait yoghurt fell 5.8 per cent to $52.17 on Wednesday. The company said net revenues in the three months to August 27 fell 4 per cent from a year earlier, while profits slipped 1 per cent.“Our number one priority in fiscal 2018 is strengthening our top-line performance,” said Jeff Harmening, the company’s chief executive.
17;GIS;General Mills;2017-09-20T17:05:55Z;General Mills hit by souring yoghurt sales;;Souring yoghurt sales and shrinking US appetite for breakfast cereals prompted revenues at General Mills to slide for a ninth straight quarter, sending its shares down by the most in over eight years.The $30bn company, whose brands include Cheerios, Yoplait and Häagen-Dazs, saw revenues for its fiscal first quarter ending in August drop 3.5 per cent to $3.77bn. The drop comes amid a sharp decline in its all-important North American business, which generates nearly two-thirds of total group sales.A breakdown of the unit’s numbers make for grim reading. Net sales were down double-digits for its US yoghurt business, driven by continued declines for Yoplait Greek and Yoplait Light products, while US cereal and snack sales were down 7 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.Net income for the quarter was 1.1 per cent lower at $404.7m compared to the prior-year period. The result was flattered in part by a much smaller restructuring charge compared to last year.Like many of its rivals, General Mills has seen its sales squeezed as consumers increasingly choose fresh, organic products over packaged and frozen food. Competition from smaller start-ups making healthier, less sugary versions of its main products has also put pressure on sales.Jeff Harmening, chief executive, said improving the company’s top-line performance was its “number one priority” this year and that he expected sales to improve later this year.“We’re encouraged by the improvement we saw in first-quarter retail sales trends, and we’re confident that improved momentum will translate into stronger organic net sales results in the rest of the year, beginning in the second quarter,” he said in a statement.The company also reiterated its fiscal 2018 guidance, with organic net sales expected to decline between 1-2 per cent and constant-currency adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow between 1-2 per cent.Shares in General Mills traded 5.8 per cent lower at $52.20. The decline is the stock’s biggest since March 2009 and takes its losses over the past 12 months to more than 19 per cent.
18;GIS;General Mills;2017-08-03T20:26:55Z;Kraft Heinz sales fall amid shift to healthy eating;;Kraft Heinz reported earnings that topped expectations in the second quarter but said sales fell, as the packaged-food company behind Jell-O and Heinz ketchup deals with an industry-wide adjustment to more health-conscious customers.*The company’s shares were little changed in extended trading after it reported adjusted earnings of 98 cents a share, topping analysts’ estimates of 95 cents a share. Sales fell to $6.67bn, from $6.79bn a year ago in the three months to the end of June. Wall Street had forecast sales of $6.73bn.Organic net sales fell 0.9 percent versus the year-ago period.Across the industry, consumer goods giants have seen sales hit amid a pivot to healthier foods. Kraft has made moves to adapt, removing artificial colours from its namesake packaged macaroni and cheese.Chief executive Bernardo Hees said the results were “as expected…better than our first quarter,” adding that he expects “momentum to continue into the second half of the year”.Sales in the US, its biggest market, fell 1.2 per cent to $4.6n.Kraft Heinz –which came together in a $100bn deal devised by Warren Buffett and Brazil’s 3G Capital in 2015 — has been cutting costs to offset sliding sales. It aims to cut costs by $1.7bn annually by 2018.Two years on from the Kraft-Heinz megamerger, analysts have speculated over the next target on 3G’s shopping list, pointing to Mondelez and General Mills as candidates. Shares in Kraft Heinz have fallen about five per cent since a failed attempt to buy Unilever for $143bn in February.* Article amended from original publication to reflect a bigger-then-expected drop in sales.
19;GIS;General Mills;2017-07-19T17:20:21Z;McCormick: some like it hot;Management teams are paid to make bets like the one on buying Reckitt’s food unit;When it comes to Frank’s RedHot sauce, “you can pour it on a lot of stuff”, says the finance chief of McCormick & Company. The shareholders of the US food group, best known for spice brands including its eponymous line and Lawry’s, seem less convinced about Frank’s versatility.On Wednesday, McCormick’s confirmed it would acquire Reckitt Benckiser’s food unit for $4.2bn in cash. The business includes French’s mustard and Cattleman’s barbecue sauce as well as Frank’s fiery gloop. The US group’s shares fell 5 per cent.Sentiment on the packaged foods sector has soured of late due to the continued price assault by Amazon and weak profits at bellwether General Mills. McCormick, to pay for the Reckitt unit, will stretch its debt to a pungent five times cash flow while its revenue will expand by more than a tenth.McCormick has been open about its M&A ambitions. Condiments is a natural extension of its existing strength in spices and flavourings. The deal comes a year after McCormick abandoned its pursuit of another UK group, Premier Foods. That would have come with a traditional, UK-focused stable of brands, few cost savings and a hefty pension deficit. The Reckitt stable is US-focused and has more appeal to millennials, who have shunned traditional packaged food but are avid consumers of hot sauces.But to get the RB unit, McCormick had to win an auction. The purchase price reflects an enterprise value of 20 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The Premier deal would have been at 10 times forecast ebitda. McCormick itself trades at 15 times. The group says the purchase will add 10 per cent to earnings with all synergies. But that excludes one-time costs and given the scale of the deal, the earnings benefit is modest. McCormick will also have to curtail its share buybacks to preserve cash.Sometimes, eaters pour a sauce on their quinoa bowl without knowing what taste will result. Dealmaking can be risky in the same way. Shareholders should hold McCormick’s managers accountable for this spicy wager.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

20;GIS;General Mills;2017-04-27T16:39:42Z;Trump cuts through the thickets of Obama’s rules;President has made progress on pledge to deregulate US economy in first 100 days;"The ditches leading to Stumpy Lake are a banal part of the woodland where a housing developer wants to build in Chesapeake, Virginia. But in a move that would draw condemnation from Donald Trump, the Obama administration in 2015 thrust the long arm of government into the trenches’ muddy depths.Officials expanded their authority over ditches, ponds and streams to clamp down on discharges of soil and rock into US waterways. For ESG Companies, the developer, the perceived land grab made it harder to get building permits.“Every piece of information we give the regulators seems to bring additional new requests,” says Valerie Wilkinson, ESG’s chief financial officer. “We’ve felt for a long time we’ve got caught up in some kind of infinite loop.” Mr Trump has promised to change everything.In his rocky first 100 days, a bright spot for the president has been efforts to eliminate what he has called “every job-killing regulation we can find”, including the water rule. Stephen Bannon, a White House adviser, has framed the push as a “deconstruction of the administrative state”.Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said last week. “It’s not as sexy as tax reform or healthcare reform, but what the president wants us to do [on regulation] is probably the most dramatic piece of the agenda that he’s rolled out so far.”For five straight years, the chief executives of the Business Roundtable, a lobby group, have cited regulation as the top cost pressure facing their companies. Now they are trooping to the White House for “listening sessions” and expressing delight at the end of the rules-laden Obama era.Jeff Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, has said the White House is “stripping away years of bad regulatory and economic practices to promote competitiveness”. Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase, has blamed regulations for slowing job creation. “It always makes sense to look at them in the clear light of day, look at the facts, look at cost benefit studies, make sure you have the transparency right,” he said last month.Mr Trump has already handed Ford, GM and other carmakers a win by reopening an evaluation of US fuel efficiency standards, a move that creates a chance to relax them.A lot of executives used to see government as an alien world, a place they didn’t understand and one that didn’t understand them. Trump has changed that.With a hand from Capitol Hill, he has also signed 13 bills to reverse regulations from the final months of the Obama administration. Several repeals sparked howls from the left, including one that lets internet service providers sell their customers’ search histories without having to ask permission.Overall, however, Congress has been more of a hindrance in Mr Trump’s first 100 days and one attraction of cutting red tape is that he can do a lot without lawmakers.The White House is flexing its muscles across the government bureaucracy, championing its cap to stop the regulatory budget increasing this year and its requirement that agencies identify two rules to be eliminated for every new one they issue.It has also started to appoint political enforcers to agencies to ensure its directives are being implemented. Another tactic is neglect: institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency are being weakened as jobs are left unfilled.A senior White House official says the bigger ambition is to change the mindset of regulators, so instead of seeing themselves in a cops-and-robbers contest with companies they find “collaborative” ways to reduce costs.Visions of coziness worry Democrats, who are cognisant of recent corporate scandals such as Volkswagen’s emissions cheating and Wells Fargo’s fake bank accounts. But the official says: “We’re not blurring the roles.”Despite Mr Trump’s slash-and-burn rhetoric, eliminating most rules requires more than a hasty stroke of his pen.The EPA’s ditch regulations, known as the Waters of the US rule, are emblematic. Supporters said they were a reasonable attempt to end confusion over its powers. But companies including ExxonMobil and the miner Barrick Gold warned that they would hurt businesses that had to move around rock and dirt.Mr Trump vowed to repeal the regulations on the campaign trail, but that process takes months. In February, he took the first step by signing an executive order directing regulators to review the rule.Reviews of other targets he vowed to dismember are also under way: the Clean Power Plan, Barack Obama’s attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants; and financial rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank post-crisis reforms.The path to deregulation is not obstacle-free. Environmental and consumer groups will seek to block specific moves with litigation. And a Democratic aide on Capitol Hill says his party views career bureaucrats in government as a line of defence against extreme moves.Still, business people say the change in tone is vital. “A lot of executives used to see government as an alien world, a place they didn’t understand and one that didn’t understand them,” says Henrietta Fore, a director of ExxonMobil and foodmaker General Mills. “Trump has changed that. Now they feel like they’ve got someone who sympathises with them on the inside.”Further proof came with his approvals of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, coupled with an executive order to speed up permitting for all large infrastructure initiatives.In the Virginia woodland, the ditch water rule is just the latest chapter in Ms Wilkinson’s long wait for a permit. With regulation “out of control” she says Mr Trump’s reset was long overdue. “I would say that I am cautiously optimistic that we start moving back to a more reasonable place. How quickly that will happen or exactly what form that will take, I’m not smart enough to know.”"
21;GIS;General Mills;2017-03-21T17:14:32Z;General Mills slides on poor meal and yoghurt sales;;As the grocery store’s yoghurt aisle gets more crowded, General Mills’ Yoplait brand is having a hard time standing out among lower-priced and more innovative options, and plummeting sales of one of its core brands underscore its struggle to adapt to changing consumer tastes.General Mills shares fell 1.1 per cent after it reported a wider-than-expected drop in revenues during the quarter ending February 26. While the Minneapolis-based company slowed the decline of cereal sales to just 1 per cent, deep losses in its yoghurt and meals and baking divisions led to a 5 per cent net sales decrease to $3.79bn. Analysts had expected sales of $3.8bn.The maker of Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereals has sought to overcome consumers’ changing tastes by shifting into protein-rich foods and grain-based snacks. However, greater competition and gaps in pricing and promotions hampered sales in the quarter.Yoghurt sales declined a staggering 20 per cent after a lack of promotional activity against its top competitors, said chief operating officer Jeff Harmening. “As previously discussed, we have work do to,” he told investors.The company has seen double-digit growth within its natural and organic yoghurt offerings. However, losses in its core Yoplait division offset gains elsewhere, despite its redesign and new Greek product line.Overall, North American retail, which makes up two-thirds of revenue, shrunk 7 per cent in the quarter, compared to the period in the previous year. Sales in Europe and Australia fell 3.4 per cent, though its operating profit there increased 25 per cent.Chairman and chief executive Ken Powell said: “We’ve added support in the fourth quarter to strengthen key business lines, and we’re pursuing global growth priorities that will further improve our sales trends beyond fiscal 2017.”The company now expects revenue for the full year to slide roughly 4 per cent, compared to its previous forecast of a 3-4 per cent decline.
22;GIS;General Mills;2017-02-24T18:58:38Z;Unilever defends rebuff of Kraft Heinz deal;Consumer industry ponders which group might be next on the menu for 3G;"Unilever said on Friday that Kraft Heinz’s aborted $143bn bid had been a “trigger” for it to work harder and faster on delivering better returns to investors.It was the Anglo-Dutch group’s first public remarks since Kraft Heinz — backed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital — revealed its approach a week ago.Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever finance director, told attendees at Cagny, the consumer industry’s annual gathering, in Florida: “It has certainly been a trigger for Unilever and we will not waste it. It showed us the challenge to unlock value quicker in the shorter term.”He blamed Unilever’s vulnerability as a takeover target on poor communication of its midterm plans and slow growth in emerging markets, which had contributed to its share price underperformance.Mr Pitkethly defended Unilever’s rapid rejection of the Kraft Heinz approach by highlighting the difference in business strategies between the two groups.Unilever would generate higher returns “indefinitely” and “sustainably” over the long term, while Kraft Heinz’s depended on “repeated portfolio change”, he said, in a reference to 3G’s serial dealmaking.Mr Pitkethly was tight-lipped on the details of a sweeping business review to boost profits that Unilever announced on Wednesday. But he indicated that the company would be sharper on driving down costs. “It’s clear we can go harder and deeper,” he said. The outcome of the review is expected in April.The big question dominating — but not directly addressed — at the conference was which company would be next on the menu for 3G.This made Kraft Heinz all too present — despite its absence at Cagny — though some delegates said they had spotted Alexandre Behring, Kraft Heinz chairman and 3G partner. It was Mr Behring who first mooted the idea of a deal for Unilever with its chief executive Paul Polman, last month.“They have a list of targets, A, B, C,” said one person who knows 3G well. “If A doesn’t work out, they’ll move quickly on to B.”Some of the industry’s biggest names — Mondelez International, Danone, Kellogg’s, General Mills and Procter & Gamble — showcased their strategies on cost-cutting, growth and ecommerce at the conference.We’ve been . . . rumoured to be a takeover target and I’ve lived with that for past 20 years and expect it to be [that way] for next 20 yearsMany of these sounded like “a defence against a possible bid”, said one analyst.Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever — which makes 60 per cent of its sales in home and personal care products such as Surf laundry and Sunsilk shampoo — has broadened considerably the spectrum of the food group’s potential targets.Cedric Besnard, analyst at Citigroup, said that food, home and personal care companies “with [an operating profit] margin below 20 per cent and a market cap below $140bn — and with no controlling shareholder — could feel the urgency to work on their portfolio and/or cost structure to avoid an unsolicited offer”.Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, said US companies such as Mondelez and General Mills still seemed the most logical targets for Kraft Heinz as “Europe may be resistant politically to a takeover at least in this environment”.PepsiCo could not be ruled out, she said, given the potential to pass on the beverage business to Anheuser-Busch InBev, in which some of the 3G principals are shareholders, while retaining the Frito-Lay snacks business.Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Mondelez, attempted to bat away the attention, insisting that “the macro environment was hanging over a lot of presentations. I’m hopeful we distinguished ourselves with great hope and optimism”.Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of Danone, the French dairy and nutrition company, was asked whether he felt vulnerable, given the company’s recent underperformance. “We’ve been . . . rumoured to be a takeover target and I’ve lived with that for past 20 years and expect it to be [that way] for next 20 years,” he said.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive — which leads consumer companies in terms of profit margins — said he “doesn’t want to be distracted by chatter”. Some Unilever investors have said privately they would like it to acquire some of the US company’s businesses, funded by disposals in its food units that include Flora margarine and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.“When you look at the bath and shower market shares of both companies, or oral care, body care, facial care, shampoos — there’s a lot of synergies available from putting those two businesses together,” said one investor who did not wish to be named.The industry’s sluggish growth and 3G’s voracious appetite are likely to spur deals between companies to forestall a 3G approach.Kevin Dreyer, co-chief investment officer at Gabelli, which has $40bn assets under management, said: “The industry isn’t in a steady state right now. The cost of capital is very low. We’re going to see consolidation in both [household products and food]. 3G is clearly looking for a deal, but others could look for M&A as a defensive move.”But fresh from Kraft’s unwanted advances, Mr Pitkethly said: “It’s certainly been a busy old week. When Paul [Polman] and I announced earnings [in January] we said we expected volatility — but certainly didn’t expect a bid for the company.”———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for UnileverRobert Armstrong: Hyena capitalism receives a swift kick from the Unilever giraffe

23;GIS;General Mills;2017-01-29T05:00:05Z;Big food groups take healthy approach in battle of the snacks;With upstarts eating into market share, companies are responding to backlash against sugar;"Teff is a gluten-free, high-fibre “ancient” grain native to Ethiopia. It is an ingredient more likely to crop up in the vocabulary of Hollywood stars than executives of big packaged food companies.But Kellogg, the US food group, is rolling out teff-based snacks based on Ethiopian recipes as part of a drive to turn round its snacks business and become what it calls “a global snacks powerhouse”.A consumer backlash against sugar, salt and artificial ingredients has altered the contours of the food industry. “There’s probably more change today than at any time in my history in the industry,” John Bryant, the 51-year-old Kellogg chief executive, told an investor conference in September. “We’re seeing consumers’ beliefs around food change rapidly.”Many small upstarts have emerged to cater to consumers’ new tastes, and big food groups such as Kellogg, General Mills and Mondelez are seeking ways to respond.Alexia Howard, analyst at Bernstein, says: “It’s hard to believe that in the space of a few short years the sector has been transformed from being a safe, sluggish, defensive haven beloved by long-term investors into a roller-coaster ride where disruption threatens at every turn.”New entrants are driving almost all the industry’s growth, according to Nielsen, the market research company.While the biggest 25 food and beverage companies accounted for 45 per cent of industry sales in the US in 2015, it says, they drove only 3 per cent of growth from 2011-15. That equated to a compound annual growth rate of just 0.1 per cent.Nielsen says “a long and mighty tail” of 20,000 companies drove 49 per cent of growth in the industry — a compound annual growth rate of 6.3 per cent. The rest came from private-label and medium-sized companies.One of the most fertile areas for growth is in healthy snacks.“Snacks used to be biscuits, confectionery, crisps and soft drinks,” says Jack Skelly, food analyst at Euromonitor. But the category is being “redefined [to] include yoghurt, savoury snacks, energy bars and nut-based snacks”.Traditional snack sales have a retail value of $505bn and rose at a robust 5 per cent in 2015. But healthier, protein-based snacks are growing faster, with sales up 40 per cent since 2011 and 7 per cent last year, to a retail value of $140bn.Growth in these markets is being driven by entrepreneurial companies such as Chobani in yoghurt, Meatsnacks (the maker of Wild West jerky), Kind Snacks in nutritional bars, and Graze in boxes of nuts and seeds.Chobani’s share of the US yoghurt market increased fourfold in five years, from 5 per cent in 2010 to 20 per cent in 2015, while that of General Mills, producer of Yoplait, fell from 35 per cent to 20 per cent.But Big Food is fighting back. Kellogg sells its teff snacks under its Kashi brand, a Californian natural food company it acquired in 2000. And the company is renewing its efforts in the category of healthy snacks.We are not constrained by a legacy of sugary products, so we can focus on premiumThis month Kellogg’s recently launched venture capital arm, 1894, made its first investment, leading a $4.25m funding round for Kuli Kuli, a start-up that sells drinks and snacks focused on moringa, a plant protein considered a superfood.General Mills, too, is ramping up its efforts in healthy snacks. This month the maker of Lucky Charms cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream made a second investment in Rhythm Superfoods, as part of a $6m financing round for the maker of kale crisps. It has also announced better-for-you products including gluten-free Very Berry Cheerios and Nature Valley Granola Cups.Ms Howard says: “General Mills learned its lesson and reacted very well to the rise of Kind snack bars by doubling down on innovation in its Nature Valley brand. But Kellogg’s sales in this sector have bent to the might of this new entrant.”Kind, launched by entrepreneur Daniel Lubetzky, has taken a 12 per cent share of the US snack bar market from almost nothing in 2011. Over the same period, Kellogg’s share has fallen from 30 to 20 per cent, according to Bernstein.Mr Lubetzky says Kind bars — which cost roughly three times more than a Kellogg equivalent — sell well because they taste good, contain little sugar and are stuffed with nuts, fruit or wholegrains.“We’re lucky that we are not constrained by a legacy of sugary products, so we can focus on premium,” he says. “A company whose number-one ingredient in many processes is sugar has a harder time convincing consumers to trust them that they are going to give them a nutritional product.”Kind hopes to make a similar impact in the UK, where it is sold in 3,000 stores having entered the market a year ago. Eventually it wants to manufacture in the country.Mr Skelly says health-oriented companies will eat further into the market share of the big packaged food groups. “Snack companies such as Mondelez may think their biggest rivals are Mars or PepsiCo but the reality is different. Brands such as [China’s] Yili and [France’s] Lactalis may be the real future competitors.”He cites Danone’s acquisition of WhiteWave of the US as “a sign of the French company’s direction towards more nutritious products”.Mr Lubetzky is undaunted. “Every large conglomerate has tried to copy us and yet they cut corners because they need to achieve a price that’s more affordable. We can command a premium for a premium product.”The healthiest snacks really do use less sugar and fat than their conventional counterparts, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.In place of high levels of flour, fats, cocoa and sodium they favour more protein, including nuts and milk derivatives, such as skimmed-milk products and probiotic cultures, as well as grains.“The demonisation of sugar has inevitably created a change in the types of ingredients used in snacks,” says John George, ingredients analyst at Euromonitor.In 2015, 15.5m tonnes of sweeteners were used in conventional snacks globally but new, healthier, snacks contained less than a fifth — 3m tonnes, according to Euromonitor.Marcia Mogelonsky, director of Insight at Mintel, the market research group, says: “The overarching trend is a concern that heavily processed foods are not as nutrient-dense or healthy as ingredients that are in a more natural state. Teff and farro may have seemed exotic in past decades but they are becoming more familiar to those whose food experiences have become more extensive.”Between 2014 and 2015, the percentage of new food and drink products containing chia seeds rose by 70 per cent; those containing teff by 31 per cent and quinoa 27 per cent, according to Mintel.The demand has also pushed up prices for on-trend ingredients. Quinoa prices peaked in January 2014, according to Mintec, the commodity data group, after almost doubling in the previous six months. Prices then dropped off, as both Peru and Bolivia increased production and other countries also started growing the grain.Kale, the superfood brassica, has become such a popular ingredient, including in crisps, that, “it has definitely transitioned from fad to trend,” says Mintel.Launches of food and drink products containing kale grew seven-fold between August 2011 and July 2016, according to Mintel, which found that the US was the biggest market for launches of kale-based snacks."
24;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;General Mills earnings spoiled by yoghurt sales slump;;Yoghurt troubles continue to sour sales and profits at General Mills.The food giant saw its shares slide 3.5 per cent on Tuesday after it announced quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street’s estimates, as demand for its Yoplait yoghurt slumped.The company – known for a range of food products from cereal to tortillas – said that net retail sales in its largest market, the US, were down 9 per cent during the quarter ending November 27. Improving sales for its Annie’s natural and organic products, Old El Paso line of Mexican food and Totino’s frozen hot snacks were not enough to offset the 18 per cent fall in sales of Yoplait yoghurt products, and declines in Pillsbury refrigerated dough and Progresso soups.International sales were also down by 4 per cent from the same period a year ago, General Mills said, with the strong dollar cutting into the value of its overseas sales.General Mills reported an overall 7 per cent decrease in net sales compared to a year earlier, to $4.1bn, short of analysts’ expectations of $4.22bn in revenue. Net income for its fiscal 2017 second quarter came in at $481.8m, a 9 per cent fall year-on-year and shy of the $523.16m that analysts had expected. That translated to diluted earnings per share of 80 cents, 8 per cent lower from the year-ago period and also short of Wall Street’s forecast of 85.8 cents per share.During a conference call with investors, General Mills executives said they hoped to stem the declines by focusing on its “consumer first” strategy of identifying and catering to shoppers’ shifting preferences for more natural meals and snacks. General Mills’ chief executive Ken Powell blamed in part “weakening food industry trends” for the lacklustre results, and said the company was making “targeted adjustments” to its plan for the second half of fiscal year 2017 to improve its topline performance.In particular, chief operating officer Jeff Harmening said that the company has “a good deal of work to do to turn around our yoghurt business,” and while some improvement is expected in the back half of the year, it’s unlikely to return to growth. “We believe the key to success will be fundamentally shifting our portfolio through renovation and innovation to give consumers what they want from their yoghurt, and that’s the essence of ‘consumer first,’” he said.General Mills is in the midst of efforts to streamline its global operations and supply chain network. By the end of fiscal year 2018, the company plans to have closed 11 plants and reduced approximately 5,000 positions worldwide. On Tuesday it said it was lowering its target for organic net sales growth, from its previous range of a 0-2 per cent decline to 3-4 per cent decline over the full fiscal year 2017.From a year ago, General Mills shares have gained about 6.15 per cent.
25;GIS;General Mills;2016-09-07T21:27:35Z;Apache buoyed by Alpine High discovery;S&P 500 and Dow flat on the day but Nasdaq reaches new high;Apache shares rallied on Wednesday after the US energy group announced a “significant” oil and gas discovery.The company said it found a resource called the Alpine High, located in Texas’s Delaware Basin. Apache believed that its acreage in there contains some 3bn barrels of oil and 75tn cubic feet of gas.Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie, the research company, said the discovery was important both for Apache and for production in the Permian Basin region of west Texas.However, he cautioned that the development of the reserves was still in its early stages with only 19 wells drilled.For large-scale production, the area would also need investment in infrastructure such as processing plants and pipelines to transport the gas.“There is a lot of work to be done both below ground and above ground,” said Mr Shattuck.Houston-based Apache said it planned to increase its 2016 capital spending by about $200m to about $2bn as it accelerated the development of the region.The price of crude oil rallied sharply in early August, but then pulled back later in the month as the US dollar strengthened and concerns rose that higher prices could prompt companies to bring more production online.West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, traded at $46.14 a barrel on Wednesday, up from $26.21 in mid-February, but far off the high of $107.26 it struck in June 2014.Apache shares climbed 6.7 per cent on Wednesday to $55.13.Elsewhere, Western Digital zipped higher after it lifted its current-quarter outlook.The maker of data storage devices such as computer hard disc drives said it expected its revenues in the quarter to the end of September to come in at $4.45bn-$4.55bn, from a previous estimate of $4.4bn-$4.5bn.It also forecasted adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of $1-$1.05 a share, from 85-90 cents.Wall Street analysts had forecast adjusted earnings per share of 89 cents on sales of $4.46bn.Western Digital shares rallied 12.1 per cent to $53.30. The advance trimmed the group’s year-to-date decline to 11.2 per cent.On the other side of the spectrum, General Mills shares were in the red after the maker of Cheerios and Jus-Rol said it expected to report a decline in an important sales metric in its last quarter.The company said organic net sales growth in the quarter ended August 28 will be below its full-year guidance range of flat to down 2 per cent.The shares were off 4.3 per cent to $67.85 but are still up 23.5 per cent over the past 12 months.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 was flat at 2,186.2 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 18,526.1. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.2 per cent to a record high of 5,283.9.Additional reporting by Ed Crooks in New York
26;GIS;General Mills;2016-07-07T00:10:48Z;Danone nears $10bn deal for health-focused WhiteWave;;Danone, the world’s biggest yoghurt maker, is nearing an agreement to acquire WhiteWave Foods, the natural and health-orientated beverage group, in a deal that is likely to value the US company at about $10bn.A deal may be announced as early as Thursday, according to two people informed about the talks, and would be Danone’s largest acquisition in a decade and the first major transaction by Emmanuel Faber, the company veteran who took over as chief executive in late 2014, write Arash Massoudi in London and James Fontanella-Khan in New York.Those informed about the deal cautioned that the timing of an announcement could slip and that the transaction was still being finalised.A takeover of WhiteWave Foods would add a series of upmarket grocery store products such as milk brand Horizon Organic and the plant-based soy milk label Silk.WhiteWave Foods, unlike many of its rival US food companies, has been enjoying strong sales growth in recent years, as it has focused on the lucrative organic and health foods segment. The Denver, Colorado-based company has long been considered a potential takeover target for rivals such as Campbell Soup, Kellogg and General Mills.WhiteWave Foods’ share price closed at $47.43 on Wednesday, giving it a market value of $8.34bn. Applying a typical deal premium of 30 per cent, the value of a takeover may be in excess of $10.5bn.WhiteWave Foods and Danone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
27;GIS;General Mills;2016-06-26T11:59:34Z;Week Ahead Corporate Diary: June 27 — July 1;Monsanto investors hoping for update on the next step in Bayer’s attempted takeover bid;"Diary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.Nike, the athletic apparel maker, is expected to have stretched to solid increases in sales and earnings in the past year when it releases fourth-quarter results.Bloomberg’s consensus of analysts’ estimates puts the year’s revenues at $32.48bn, compared with last year’s $30.6bn, while pre-tax profits are estimated at $4.63bn, up from $4.21bn in 2014-15. EPS for the year is forecast to be $2.16, compared with $1.85.The improvement comes after Nike in March disclosed a cautious outlook and weaker quarterly sales growth than Wall Street forecast.Oregon-based Nike — which boasts more than 90 per cent of the basketball shoe market, though rival Under Armour has made recent inroads — reported revenues up 8 per cent to $8bn on a year-on-year basis in its third quarter, missing expectations of $8.2bn, when it said strong consumer demand drove revenue growth across the brand portfolio.Mark Parker, chief executive, said: “Nike delivered robust and balanced growth across our expansive, powerful portfolio.”But the company said in March its sales took a hit due to a strong dollar, which makes the price of US goods more expensive abroad and reduces the amount that groups earn when foreign sales are converted back into dollars. On a currency-neutral basis, sales advanced 14 per cent.Nike also expects its revenues to rise at a “high single-digit rate” in the fiscal year to May 2017, while analysts were looking for fiscal 2017 sales growth of about 10 per cent. Nike expects EPS to rise in low single-digits, against a consensus estimate of 15 per cent.Nike’s shares, which surged by almost a third in 2015, have added about 2 per cent in the past year to $54.36.Global demand for athletic goods remains high, but Nike continues to face margin pressure, mainly in the US. Simon GreavesEarningsNike Q4 $0.48 ($0.49)Ocado FY 2.63p (1.91p)Electricals retailer Dixons Carphone is expected to report a slight dip in revenues but a healthy boost to profits when it delivers its full-year results.Last month the high street retailer, which sells a range of electrical and telecommunications products, said it expected full-year profits to be near the upper end of its guidance after a decent quarter in which like-for-like sales grew 5 per cent.Revenues are expected to dip 3 per cent to £9.6bn, following the closure of 134 UK stores, but pre-tax profits are expected to jump 17 per cent to £447m.Dixons has been boosted by a rise in sales of 4K ultra high-definition televisions and cordless vacuum cleaners, and Seb James, chief executive, rubbished the excuses of rival retailers when unveiling the group’s quarterly results in May.“There has been much commentary about the state of mind of UK consumers. Our view is that consumers are ready to spend but have rightly become more canny, and so need to be tempted with great deals and exciting new products,” he said.Dixons Carphone is also rolling out a new store format, combining its three major brands, Carphone Warehouse, Currys, and PC World, in one store. It currently has well over 250 stores in the new format, and is looking to add more.The company was created from the merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in 2014, and continues to defy critics — when the merger was unveiled there were predictions of boardroom bust-ups and big store closures. Its share of the mobile phone market has grown while other retailers, such has Phones4U, have fallen. Paul McCleanFor the maker of Cheerio’s the fiscal fourth quarter was not a particularly happy one.General Mills is being squeezed in several key product areas: yoghurt, cereals and meals. Like the rest of the food industry in the US, the company has been cutting costs and diversifying into healthier fare through acquisitions of smaller brands as consumers increasingly opt for more wholesome foods.But the landscape is competitive, particularly when it comes to yoghurt, and the competition has not always been pretty. In an increasingly crowded market, General Mills, which makes Yoplait, earlier this year won an injunction against Chobani, halting the broadcast of a commercial it said made false claims that Yoplait Greek 100 was laced with a pesticide that is “used to kill bugs”.Cereals, which have been on a downward slide for years, are not expected to return to strong growth any time soon, while prepared meals are mainly selling in the fresh segment.As such, in the company’s final quarter of its fiscal year, due to its divestiture of its Green Giant frozen vegetables brand, the group probably posted a 10 per cent decline in revenues to $3.86bn, and a 23 per cent decline in adjusted net income to $355.2bn, or 59.6 cents a share, according to consensus analyst estimates from Bloomberg. On an unadjusted basis, EPS probably nearly doubled to 59 cents.Analysts have said they expect the company to make further acquisitions as the consumer shifts further towards healthier food, including overseas. Some have also highlighted the company as a potential target of KraftHeinz, as speculation rises over which company in the industry could be the next target for the 3G-Warren Buffett team that has transformed the industry with its forceful cost-cutting techniques. Lindsay WhippWhen Monsanto announces third-quarter earnings the company’s results will not necessarily be top of investors’ minds. Instead they will be hoping for an update on what is the next step in Bayer’s attempted bid for the controversial maker of genetically modified seeds.It has been a month since Monsanto rejected the Bayer board’s $122-a-share offer for the St Louis-based agrichemical company.Monsanto said the offer was too low but said it was open to further talks. Bayer, whose investors have been wary of the potential of the combination, has yet to raise its offer, saying it believes the existing one is fair.This leaves the potential combination of the two in limbo. Monsanto has said before that even in a landscape of fast consolidation it can thrive as a standalone company. But it is not without its problems.It has already cut its forecast for full-year earnings against a backdrop of a strong dollar hitting exports and is cutting its workforce in a sluggish agricultural economy where farmers’ incomes have been hit by low prices.In the quarter ended May 31, Monsanto’s revenue is estimated to have fallen 1.8 per cent to $4.5bn, with adjusted net income dropping 6.2 per cent to $1.07bn, or $2.43 a share, according to consensus analyst estimates from Bloomberg. On an unadjusted basis it probably posted EPS of $2.34, a 1.6 per cent increase.

28;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Senators propose GMO labelling compromise;Food industry fears ‘chaos’ if Vermont sets precedent of state-by-state regulation;Two US senators have introduced a compromise bipartisan bill for the federal labelling of genetically modified foods, just weeks before the introduction of a state law in Vermont that Big Food claimed would cause “chaos” in the industry.The labelling of GMO ingredients has become highly contentious in the US, where the food industry is estimated to have spent more than $100m last year lobbying on GMO-related issues in a race to prevent mandatory on-package labels and a state-by-state approach to regulation.Big food companies argued that on-package labelling would create stigma around ingredients they said had been scientifically proven safe, and would force companies to reformulate their products, hurting farmers. State-by-state laws would create confusion for consumers and would be prohibitively disruptive for company supply chains, the industry said.Under the bill, fought out by Democrat Debbie Stabenow and Republican Pat Roberts, companies could either provide voluntary on-package labelling of GMO ingredients using words or a symbol, or use smart labels such as a QR code that links to online information about the GMO ingredients.“The compromise looks as though it’s a pretty big win for the food companies,” said Alexia Howard, a food industry analyst at Bernstein. She added that the smart label option would be less transparent for consumers but would allow those interested to find information if they wanted.“How many people will have the appetite for going through that search rigmarole is clearly anyone’s guess,” she said.The full Senate is expected to vote on the new bill next week where it appears likely to succeed. But to become law it must still pass the House of Representatives, which is in recess until July 5.The Senate compromise is likely to face more scrutiny there. Michael Conaway, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, blamed Democrats for the failure of Congress to act before the Vermont labelling law went into effect. The House last year passed a bill that would have banned state labelling laws and established a programme for voluntary labels, but it failed to get the 60 votes needed in the Senate.The compromise looks as though it’s a pretty big win for the food companiesThe Grocery Manufacturers Association, which had been pushing hard for a bipartisan agreement that allowed for off-package labelling, welcomed the deal. But it warned that it was “critically important” that Congress approve the legislation swiftly “because Vermont’s mandatory labelling law is already having negative impacts”.Vermont, which has just 600,000 residents and for which Bernie Sanders is a senator, last year became the first state to introduce mandatory labelling of GM products in legislation to be introduced on July 1. If this federal compromise passes Congress it will override Vermont’s law.Mr Sanders said in a statement that — unlike the claims of the GMA — GMO labelling on food packages was not controversial. “People have a right to know what is in the food they eat. I am going to do everything I can to defeat this legislation,” he said.Activists were disappointed with the Senate deal, warning that smart labelling was “inadequate” and “inherently discriminatory” against the third of Americans without smartphones.“We are appalled that our elected officials would support keeping Americans in the dark about what is in our food,” said Rebecca Spector, West Coast director for the Center for Food Safety.The compromise also faces some scepticism from the agriculture community. The American Farm Bureau, the country’s largest agriculture lobby group, said “the mandatory feature holds significant potential to contribute to confusion and unnecessary alarm” about products containing GMOs.The battle for GMO labelling has happened amid a sea change in US attitudes towards healthy eating that has upended the industry. Not only are more consumers eating organic and wholesome foods, they are demanding far more transparency about what they are eating and where it has come from.Bernstein’s Ms Howard said that activists’ response to the agreement would be worth watching to see if it helps them raise awareness among consumers.Amid the uncertainty around a federal agreement before Thursday’s deal, a number of leading food companies such as Campbell Soup, Mars and General Mills earlier this year said that in light of increasing demands for transparency over ingredients they would move ahead with nationwide on-package labelling of GM foods — in a shift away from the GMA.In light of Thursday’s deal, both Campbell Soup and Mars said they were sticking with their plan. General Mills said it would look at the language of the bill before deciding on its next step.“It does not change our decision and we remain committed to on-package labelling disclosure,” Campbell Soup said. “We are already working with the FDA and USDA on labelling language that is comprehensive, clear and informative.”Industry experts will be watching closely to see how consumers react to companies’ labelling strategies to see whether on-package labelling creates the stigma the GMA fears or whether companies are rewarded for their transparency.
29;GIS;General Mills;2016-06-20T23:15:05Z;Food brands hunt for their next meal;Multinationals seek prestige names to swallow;Grupo Bimbo of Mexico, Latin America’s second-largest food company in terms of revenue, is one of a club of emerging market food companies that are diversifying into developed markets in search of upmarket brands to swallow.Bringing in some $13.7bn in revenue (about 219bn pesos) from sales of sliced bread and carb-fuelled treats in 2015, Grupo Bimbo is a sizeable presence even compared to its more established Anglo-Saxon peers, such as Premier Foods in the UK and US-based General Mills.In fact, the Mexican baker’s revenues are 12 times those of Premier and General Mills — at $1.1bn and $1.2bn respectively in 2015.Food companies tend to be the fastest-growing of the corporate giants in emerging markets and Grupo Bimbo has plenty of international counterparts. Brasil Foods (BRF) and JBS of Brazil are conglomerates whose main business is processed meat, with BRF specialising in halal-certified cuts. Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand focuses on fish and poultry. Indofood of Indonesia is famed for its instant noodles, while Turkey’s Yildiz Holding owns McVitie’s biscuits, Godiva chocolates and Jacob’s crackers.These five food companies — four of them listed, while the privately-held Yildiz controls publicly traded companies — between them generated about $79bn in annual revenues during 2015, four times more than US heavyweight Kraft Heinz (with $18.3bn).Their competitive advantage is the low cost of production at home combined with an extensive distribution network. But they have compounded these benefits by snapping up brands abroad. Back in 1945, Grupo Bimbo’s baked goods were delivered to corner shops in Mexico City by five trucks. In 2015, the group serviced 2m points of sale across 22 countries.Cheaper lines of credit available to emerging markets corporates over the past decade have facilitated this voracious spending spree.Grupo Bimbo has added 40 brands to its portfolio in the past 10 years, while BRF has acquired 13 additional businesses in the past two. The average interest rate on cash borrowed to secure Grupo Bimbo’s acquisitions, 4.4 per cent, is historically low.“Bimbo has a very good record of balancing their level of debt, gradually paying off their loans before borrowing to buy something new,” says Rogelio González, part of the Mexico corporate ratings team at Fitch, the rating agency.40Brands Grupo Bimbo has acquired in past 10 yearsHowever, these companies are not immune to rising levels of debt in emerging markets and the falling price of commodities.In Brazil, for example, record-high corn prices in 2016 are forcing poultry processors to close plants and making pork producers slaughter animals they cannot afford to feed. BRF, the world’s largest poultry exporter, and beef exporter JBS raised local prices for the second time this year to try to contain feed costs.“The price of drumsticks in the supermarket is 5 reals [$1.40] a kilogramme: that barely pays for water to produce the meat,” Mario Lanznaster, president of Aurora Alimentos, Brazil’s third-largest pork and poultry processor, told local press in June.What sets Grupo Bimbo apart and maintains its investment grade status, according to Filipe Alves da Silva, senior Latam adviser at Indosuez, a Switzerland-based wealth manager, is that 53 per cent of its total revenues derive from its North American operations. “They sell bread in dollars and buy ingredients in dollars . . . so their growth margins have been remarkably stable,” he says.13Brands Brasil Foods has acquired in the past two yearsGrupo Bimbo runs 89 production plants north of the US border. Recent additions to the group’s portfolio include Canada Bread and Sara Lee’s North American bakery business. Should the deal go through, in the second half of 2016, Panrico in Spain and Portugal will be a further acquisition.Thanks to diversification, only 35 per cent of Grupo Bimbo’s total revenue comes from Mexico, where the currency has fallen about 6.5 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year, making the Mexican peso the worst performing emerging market currency against the dollar in 2016. Revenues at Grupo Bimbo in the first quarter of 2016 rose 13.2 per cent over the same period last year to 56.64bn pesos, above market expectations.For Yildiz, buoyant sales from its confectionery segment (of about $4.5bn last year) have led to consolidation of its confectionery operations into a new UK-based company named Pladis.
30;GIS;General Mills;2016-05-23T18:29:55Z;Coca-Cola latest group to face Venezuela setback;;Coca-Cola has become the latest company to face a setback in Venezuela as the protracted slump in crude prices has weighed on the Latin American economy.The fizzy drink maker will stop production of sugar-sweetened beverages in Venezuela as local sugar suppliers are temporarily ceasing operations due to a lack of raw materials, a spokesperson for Coca-Cola said. The situation will not impact zero-sugar beverages like bottled water and Coca-Cola Light, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.Coca-Cola is the latest multinational to face disruptions in Venezuela. The country’s economic recession, triple-digit inflation, rolling blackouts, punishing price controls and shifting foreign currency policy have pressured operations of multinationals.General Mills, the company behind Cheerios and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, incurred a $35m charge when it sold its subsidiary in the country earlier this year. Meanwhile, Clorox, incurred a $60m to $65m charge to shutter its operations last year, blaming the surge in inflation and the price freeze instituted by the government.And Venezuela’s largest privately owned company, Empresas Polar, said in April that it would stop producing beer until it can get access to foreign currency to procure necessary materials.And it isn’t just consumer companies: Oilfield services provider Schlumberger said last month that it would cut back on its activity in the beleaguered country, citing insufficient payments. And companies like Goodyear, AT&T, General Motors have all had to take write-offs in recent years.As the list of privations in Venezuela continues to grow, the IMF projects that the nation’s economy will shrink 8 per cent this year, following a 5 per cent contraction in 2015.
31;GIS;General Mills;2016-03-23T11:21:28Z;Cheerios maker General Mills exits Venezuela;;General Mills, the company behind Cheerios and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, has called time on its operations in Venezuela.The US company said it has sold its subsidiary in the country to an unnamed third party in a move that will leave it with a $35m charge.General Mills’s exit follows that of bleach maker Clorox, which took a charge of more than $600m to end its operations there. Venezuela’s controls and the government’s frequently shifting currency policy has proved a headache for US multinationals, who have struggled to take cash out of the country.Venezuela, which is grappling with runaway inflation, a weak oil price and crumbling tax revenues, accounted for less than 1 per cent of General Mills’s net sales, the company said in its annual report.
32;GIS;General Mills;2016-01-19T14:45:20Z;Investors shun riskier European bonds amid global market turmoil;Only highly regarded companies such as Daimler and Nestlé are able to sell debt in Europe;European bond markets have been open only to the most highly regarded companies in 2016, as global market turmoil has compelled investors to shun riskier assets.Only nine deals have been priced for a total value of €6.2bn in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters, and bond sales have largely come from such household names as carmaker Daimler, food company Nestlé and US-based baker General Mills.“It is fair to say the corporate space has been in less supply due to the volatility from China and the fact that many corporates are turning to blackout periods now,” said Armin Peter, global head of debt syndicate at UBS, referring to regulations that prevent companies from selling new securities while they are preparing their quarterly results.Pointing to strengthening stock markets on Tuesday as a positive sign, he said “what the market clearly needs is a couple of positive trading sessions to regain confidence”.Recent weakness has not been limited to the so-called primary market. Prices for outstanding corporate debt have suffered as well, resulting in higher yields.Spreads — the premium that corporate borrowers have to pay over underlying government bond yields, known as the risk-free rate — have climbed to their highest levels since 2012 for high-yield and investment grade-rated companies, indicating an increasing investor aversion to risk.Both debt bankers and investors attribute lower prices to an increase in risk aversion generally and not to specific problems with the European debt market.The European Central Bank’s programme of quantitative easing as well as the region’s current economic recovery are seen as supporting prospects for companies and their debt securities. Investors are said to be taking a “wait and see” approach due to the falling commodity and equity prices.Jeff Mueller, a high-yield portfolio manager with Eaton Vance, said while the most heavily affected sectors are those with high exposure to China and oil and commodity prices, unrelated industries are also seeing their debt priced lower. He added that there has been a flight by investors to high-quality names.“What you have in the market, you’ve got this bifurcation where you’ve got the top bench, the higher quality, the stuff that people want to own, that hasn’t done badly.” he said. “There are some opportunities but you really need to do your homework and pick the credits that have been sold more than they deserve.”
33;GIS;General Mills;2016-01-14T06:02:26Z;Mergers on the menu for food and drink industry;Rivals left playing catch-up after $62bn ketchup maker deal between Heinz and Kraft;"For those who like putting ketchup on their macaroni and cheese, the $62.6bn takeover last year by Heinz of Kraft — purveyors of the American pasta staple that comes in a blue box — will have been a winning combination.But for the growing number of consumers who are turning away from packaged food, the merger was a defensive one, aimed at addressing low sales growth by cutting costs in order to make two of America’s best-known, but ultimately tired, brands more profitable.Saving $1.5bn a year, the merger will shed 5,000 jobs, or 10 per cent of the combined workforce, and close seven manufacturing plants.Kraft Heinz, as the combined company is known, has already made financial sense for some of its investors, notably Warren Buffett. In November, the head of Berkshire Hathaway investment group, reported a $4.4bn windfall from the deal.He worked with 3G Capital, the private equity group co-founded by Brazil’s Jorge Paulo Lemann, the driving force behind the growth of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, on a buyout of Heinz in 2013. The two then moved on to consolidate Kraft in March 2015.The merger was one of the largest M&A deals last year and the biggest in food, signalling a trend towards greater consolidation among large, legacy food brands, especially among companies in the US such as General Mills or the Campbell Soup Company.“For the US, M&A activity will continue to be robust as companies continue to look for sales growth and margin improvement,” says Diane Shand, senior director at Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency. “Moreover, the Kraft and Heinz merger sets a precedent for larger cost-cutting programmes and further consolidation in the industry.”Within developed economies, food M&A is being driven primarily by the changing tastes of younger consumers, who are shunning processed food in favour of natural, healthier and more local products. The growth of this segment of the market has been fast, in contrast to that of most large packaged food companies.According to OC & C, a consultancy, revenue growth of the world’s 50 biggest food companies slowed to 1.7 per cent in 2014, from 2.9 per cent in 2013 and from 5.6 per cent in 2012.As FX (François-Xavier) de Mallmann, global co-head of consumer retail and healthcare at Goldman Sachs, says: “We expect consolidation to accelerate, especially in the US, where a number of legacy brands and categories are growing less fast. Capital markets and, in selected cases, activists, are putting pressure on these companies to manage their cost base more efficiently and increase cash flow generation, which many believe can be better achieved through greater scale.”The Kraft and Heinz merger sets a precedent for larger cost-cutting programmes and further consolidation in the industryA second driver of M&A activity is larger food companies’ appetites for innovative start-ups, as the former forage for faster-growing revenue streams in the grocery aisles. The demand has made younger companies highly sought after and pushed up their valuations sharply.General Mills, best-known for Cheerios breakfast cereal and Pillsbury dough, bought Annie’s, a packaged food group that uses organic and natural ingredients, in 2014; Coca-Cola last year took a minority stake in Suja Juice, an organic juice-maker, and Hormel, the producer of Spam, paid $775m last year to acquire Applegate Farms, an organic processed meats producer.In Europe, Unilever, which makes Lipton tea and Flora margarine, has developed a taste for premium ice cream to add to its Magnum and Ben & Jerry’s brands. It made two recent purchases: Talenti, a Minneapolis-based upmarket sorbet maker, and Grom, the Italian ice-cream maker that says it does not use flavouring, colouring, preservatives or emulsifiers.Akeel Sachak, global head of consumer at Rothschild, says that the changing preferences of the millennial consumer explain this new-found enthusiasm on the part of multinationals to enter the natural and organic food market. “This has hitherto been mainly the preserve of hippy-type entrepreneurs from California and a select band of visionary larger consolidators such as Hain Celestial and WhiteWave,” he says.Companies such as Hain, which owns the Linda McCartney vegetarian brand, and WhiteWave have been growing partly through acquisition of organic and natural food companies. Hain, a New York-based group with a market value of $4.1bn, last year acquired Mona Group, a European company that makes soy and nut-based drinks. This followed its acquisition of Rudi’s Organic Bakery, a Colorado-based producer of gluten-free products.WhiteWave Foods, based in Denver, has followed a similar strategy. The owner of the Silk and Alpro plant-based milks, paid $550m last year to buy Vega, which produces plant-based snack bars and powdered shakes.Food is still relatively fragmented compared to beverages or homecareA third M&A driver is specialisation — becoming bigger in one category — a strategy being pursued in coffee by JAB Holding, the billionaire Reimann family’s investment group. JAB, which also owns the Coty cosmetics business, offered $13.9bn in December 2015 to acquire Keurig Green Mountain, maker of coffee systems, in the US. The deal will make it the main challenger in the coffee capsule market to Switzerland’s Nestlé, which owns Nespresso.Low interest rates, economic recovery and still buoyant stock markets suggest that 2016 will be another strong year for food deals. These factors made 2015 a record year for global dealmaking, with $4.6tn of activity across all industries.Michael Collinson, managing-director of European consumer and retail at William Blair investment bank, sees no reason for M&A activity to taper off, especially given the appetite among private equity groups for food assets.“Food is still relatively fragmented compared to beverages or homecare,” he says. “It’s a much more accessible market to private equity, partly because of the size of the companies and the valuations paid.”"
34;GIS;General Mills;2015-11-10T05:03:51Z;Bloated US food and beverage sector needs a new bliss;US food and beverage companies are facing tremendous upheaval as consumers shun processed products;In his book Salt, Sugar, Fat, Michael Moss recounts a food industry meeting in 1999. A room full of chief executives listened to a speech on how their companies were being blamed for their contribution to rapidly rising rates of obesity in the US and what they could do to alleviate the problem.Fast forward a decade and a half from that meeting, at which the executives apparently chose to ignore the speaker’s recommendations, and the industry is experiencing tremendous disruption in the face of consumers who are increasingly shunning processed foods and carbonated drinks in favour of healthier fare.This upheaval has forced many food and beverage companies, from Kraft and Heinz through to General Mills, Campbell Soup, Kellogg’s, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, to reassess their place in corporate America. This quest sometimes comes with a shove from private equity firms or activist investors, eyeing such companies’ vulnerability and ripeness for reducing excess costs.Nearly three years ago, 3G Capital, the Brazilian cost-cutting king, took over Heinz, which was established in 1876. Earlier this year Heinz merged with Kraft to create Kraft Heinz. Activist investors have been circling the industry, pushing, and often achieving, intense efficiency targets. The message is clear: find new relevance or say goodbye to your independence.This is where longevity comes in. US companies may not be as old as some European or Japanese companies, but this does not mean they do not deserve the badge of longevity.Some have been around since the early 1800s. They have endured tremendous tumult: the civil war, the Great Depression, two world wars and numerous developments in technology and consumer behaviour, globalisation, oil shocks and the recent global financial crisis. The very fact that they still exist means there is a tremendous amount to learn from them.Campbell Soup’s roots go back to 1869, the same decade as the abolition of slavery in the US. Coca-Cola was invented in 1886. McDonald’s, though established at the much later date of 1955, is still considered a company with history. That is particularly true when considering that the “characteristic” age of a company listed on a US stock exchange is just eight years, according to research by Credit Suisse, the bank.But as Jim Collins, author of best-selling books such as Good to Great and Built to Last, says, you cannot really have longevity without greatness. “It is about enduring at a high level. Just hanging on isn’t any good,” Collins says.He argues that it is not enough for a company to have a long life because it is winning financially. It needs to be missed if it were to disappear, and the company’s raison d’être should not vanish when the founder leaves. To achieve this it has to be able to continue innovating by constantly challenging itself and setting intimidatingly lofty goals to withstand the sands of time and not drown in them.Mars has managed what many family-owned companies have not: it has reached the fourth generation. Victoria Mars, the current chairman, is the great-granddaughter of Frank Mars who, with his son Forrest, invented the Milky Way — the chocolate bar, that is. Succession planning is a serious matter at Mars, starting 15 years in advance. Every member of the family, with or without direct business involvement, is engaged in the process. Victoria Mars said in a recent interview: “[It is about] getting the whole family to understand what this legacy is that we have and what is the responsibility that comes with that. [In general] it is not the business that is going to be the problem, it is the family that causes those problems.”Financial success and innovation are inextricably linked. Without innovation it is difficult to keep the consumer on board and, as a result, profits will be elusive. Apple is a classic example. The late Steve Jobs took Apple from near bankruptcy to being the most valuable company in the S&P 500, thanks to inventions such as the MacBook and the iPhone that convinced shoppers across the globe they could not live without them.It is harder to do this in the food business. Technological advances that remove food further from its natural state are unlikely to grab the interest of consumers who want to buy healthy and fresh products. The push in the US for labels that identify genetically modified organisms is a case in point. And the bigger and more diverse the company, the less of an impact inventions have on profit.When food companies started out, they were hugely innovative, launching an era of processed meals that claimed to free up mothers’ time, while snacks and fizzy drinks claimed the hearts of children and adults across the nation. Advertising helped make brands such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, M&M’s, Oreo, Campbell Soup, Oscar Mayer and Cool Whip household names.With McDonald’s, Ray Kroc managed to give Americans the ultimate fast-food experience from the mid-1950s, with an attention to detail and an insistence on freshness that is hard to imagine as the company struggles with its current image of serving unhealthy food.A lack of in-house innovation coupled with a shift away from core products has left many older companies looking for acquisitions, buying what they do not have: organic and fresh products. General Mills has been buying companies such as Annie’s, which makes organic food for children. Other companies end up just merging with each other.Looming over the industry is the shadow of 3G, whose unsympathetic cost-cutting has become an industry benchmark, and whose thirst for acquisitions appears unquenchable. This has left many chief executives with an uncomfortable dilemma: face a takeover bid from 3G or face it as competition.Either way, it is a difficult choice. And while cuts are needed at many companies, it is doubtful that they and bolt-on acquisitions alone can propel a company far into the future, particularly if the most innovative people are let go in the name of saving money.Deere is a Midwestern company that transformed US agriculture through innovation in tractors and ploughs, and stands today as one of the world’s largest manufacturers of farm machinery.The company’s roots go back to 1837 when blacksmith John Deere developed a polished-steel plough. He quickly expanded into retail and based his business in Moline, Illinois, which is still its base and which is now reliant on the company for much of its economy. John Deere gave Moline its first bank and was mayor for two years, but was also at pains to understand its customers. An article in a 1936 Fortune magazine says Deere’s salesmen “not only speak the farmer’s language but speak it with his twang”.It is people that make the business, and part of feeling valued and motivated is the understanding that one’s employer wants to create something previously thought unattainable. It is about being given the freedom to try, fail and hopefully succeed.Good communication from the top is paramount. “Communication with the employees, making sure they know why they and the company are valued and the realisation we can be great together, that is when a company sustains,” says Mary Kier, who has written on corporate longevity and recruits top executives as a managing director of ZRG Partners, a headhunting firm.Without the inspiration of innovation, a company will struggle to be significant. For better or worse, many of America’s biggest and oldest food companies grew out of tremendous innovation in the field of processing, and finding the so-called “bliss point” of the ultimate combination of sugar, salt and fat to create cravings.Innovating around moderation and health instead of excess is no easy task. But for more and more companies, including some US corporate survivors, this is the path to not only remaining relevant, but deciding what is relevant.
35;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
36;GIS;General Mills;2015-03-16T19:01:46Z;Marketing: Satisfying a craving for authenticity;Food companies need to tell an interesting story;In this time of Twitter and stories told in no more than 140 characters, there is something curious about the marketing materials of Annie’s Homegrown, an organic food maker based in Berkeley, California. They go on and on.They tell the story of the actual Annie — Annie Withey, who co-founded the company in 1989 “with the goal of making a healthy and delicious macaroni and cheese for families”. They show Ms Withey’s farm and discuss her pet rabbit Bernie. They feature annual sustainability reports attesting to Annie’s commitment to doing business “differently and with a purpose”.They are also very successful. General Mills, maker of Betty Crocker baking products and Cheerios and Chex cold cereals, paid $820m in cash for Annie’s last year as a means of climbing aboard the organic food bandwagon.The deal demonstrated how important it has become for food companies to tell consumers an interesting story, replete with details about their products’ ingredients and health benefits. Such narratives give brands the coveted — and elusive — quality of “authenticity”.“People want to know what they are eating,” says Brian Yarbrough, consumer research analyst at Edward Jones, the US brokerage. “I don’t know that there has been another time where you seen such a shift — a shift in so many ways.”Even established companies are trying to tell new stories. Campbell’s Soup is responding to declining sales of condensed soups by creating organic and low-sodium offerings and encouraging the use of its broths and other products by home cooks — including by food aficionados the company has dubbed “passionate kitchen masters”, or PKMs.“Have you tried balsamic?” asks a headline on its website, which leads readers to recipes including one for pork chops with cranberry balsamic sauce, made with a Campbell’s broth.“Total soup eating is increasing,” says Mark Alexander, president of Campbell’s simple meals and beverages unit in the Americas. “How people are consuming their soup and how we are making it has shifted.”
37;GIS;General Mills;2015-03-15T18:02:17Z;Week ahead: Fed looms large;UK Budget, Israeli election and Iran talks expected to dominate the week;"The US Federal Reserve looms large over a busy week ahead.Investors will be scrutinising the next statement from the Federal Reserve as debate rages over when the central bank will raise rates. While investment banks for the most part expect an increase in June, markets continue to wager that it will not arrive until September or October.Outside Washington, attention will centre on the UK budget, Israeli elections and the next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. Below are a few of the main events to watch in the week ahead.Federal ReserveThe US central bank will hold a critical meeting this week after laying the groundwork earlier this year for the first rate rise since the financial crisis. Economists on Wall Street expect the Fed to remove the word “patient” from its policy statement on Wednesday, signalling that the first increase could come in the next few months. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed will testify following the release.UK BudgetGeorge Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his final budget of this parliament on Wednesday; the country’s general election takes place in May. The budget may include tax cuts in an attempt to soften austerity measures before voters go to the polls in an election whose outcome is hard to predict.Israeli electionIsraelis head to the polls on Tuesday in a hotly contested election between Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Isaac Herzog, the centre-left opposition leader. Mr Herzog is the frontrunner and recent polls showed his alliance, the Zionist Union, three or four seats ahead in its attempt to lead the next coalition government in the Knesset.IranThe next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme begin in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday and are expected to last at least five days. Mohammad Javad, the Iranian foreign minister, will meet John Kerry, US secretary of state, and policy makers from the six world powers to seek an agreement before the self-imposed June deadline.EarningsThe US fourth-quarter earnings season has largely drawn to a close, with just three S&P 500 listed companies yet to report. In the coming week one of the remaining multinationals, Tiffany & Co, will report. First-quarter results will also start to trickle out, with figures due from FedEx, Nike, Oracle, Lennar and General Mills.Outside the US, BMW, Enel, Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Finmeccanica and China Mobile report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsThe slide in the euro accelerated against the US dollar in the latest week, prompting some investment banks to forecast that the two currencies will go to parity, as the European Central Bank unleashed its bond-buying programme. On Friday the euro dipped below 1.05 to the dollar, a 12-year low.The slide in the euro has provided a fillip for European corporates exposed to the US market; these groups must convert earnings abroad back into the bloc’s currency. That, coupled with the start of quantitative easing, has sent investors piling into European stocks as they exit the US.US equity markets found some comfort from the heady pace of buybacks, which when coupled with dividends surpassed the $900bn mark last year for the first time.

38;GIS;General Mills;2015-03-05T22:16:05Z;Businesses push to combat California drought;General Mills and Coca-Cola back plans to conserve water supplies as drought hits companies;General Mills and Coca-Cola, makers of some of the world’s best known snacks and drinks, have called for bold measures to conserve California’s water supplies as the state enters its fourth year of drought.The pair is among a group of businesses in the US’s most populous state that are backing a plan to ensure the successful implementation of two water management strategies approved last year.A $7.5bn water bond to fund infrastructure projects and measures aimed at improving the management of the state’s groundwater supplies both need to be kept on track, said Kirsten James, a senior manager at Ceres, a non-profit environmental group behind the plan.“It is critical for a diverse group of stakeholders to demand aggressive action from our state leaders in order to secure California’s water future,” she said.More than 90 per cent of California is in a severe, extreme or exceptional drought after a year in which the state’s agriculture economy is estimated to have lost more than $2.2bn. In some areas, people have lost water in their homes.A number of the businesses backing the new campaign say the drought has already had an impact on their operations.“What’s different now is that our reality has changed,” said Kelley Bell, vice-president of social and environmental impact at Driscoll’s, a berry company that relies on supplies from some of the most drought-affected parts of the state.“The water we thought we had just isn’t there any more, so we need to operate in a new environment.”While the companies have signed a public declaration that calls for “bold solutions” to improve water conservation, it is unclear what they want lawmakers to do precisely.The fact that businesses were willing to join forces on the issue was still important, said Jon Radtke, manager of sustainability for Coca-Cola North America, which has 53 facilities in California.“I think it’s somewhat unique to get the business community together and to have a voice promoting broad stakeholder engagement,” he told reporters on Thursday.An investigation into how businesses are having to adapt to rising water costs around the world“By working together with other businesses, government and civil society, we hope to make a much greater impact than any one organisation or sector could hope to achieve alone.”Jerry Lynch, chief sustainability officer at General Mills, makers of Cheerios cereal, said the drought was obviously a concern for a company that relied heavily on agricultural production, especially if it led to more limited supplies and higher prices.The declaration, which has also been signed by Symantec, the cyber security company and other businesses, says signatories will “make and implement business commitments to support the state’s action plan for water conservation”.Larry Gotlieb of KB Home, a homebuilder, said water availability was crucial to California’s house construction industry, and his company was developing a house so water efficient it uses less than half the water of an average home.
39;GIS;General Mills;2015-01-21T12:32:24Z;Review: Mindful Work;A timely history of how businesses adopted meditation;"Mindful Work by David Gelles, Profile Books; Eamon Dolan Books, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt £12.99 ($27)Is the practice of mindfulness and meditation ultimately compatible with the cut-throat ethos of capitalism? This is the dilemma at the heart of David Gelles’s intriguing, timely, and enjoyable new book, a fascinating account of the increasing adoption of these ancient oriental disciplines by western businesses as means of improving corporate efficiency, reducing employee stress, and, directly or indirectly, boosting the bottom line.Gelles is a reporter for the New York Times and former Financial Times journalist who is also a long-time practitioner of mindfulness meditation — “the ability to see what is going on in our heads, without getting carried away with it”. It is a useful combination: he has both an initiate’s appreciation of how meditation works, and a journalist’s objectivity and ability to tell a story.In a potted history of mindfulness in the US, Henry David Thoreau gets Gelles’s vote as the earliest New World proponent and an inspiration for the Beat generation Dharma bums Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg.More recently, Jon Kabat-Zinn, a molecular biologist who pioneered mindfulness based stress reduction at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, takes centre stage. His willingness to downplay the spiritual side of meditation, Gelles argues, helped make mindfulness acceptable to mainstream science and medicine.The core of the book concerns the adoption of mindfulness by corporate America. Using expertly crafted anecdotes and case studies, Gelles illustrates the benefits of meditation that companies from General Mills to Aetna are seeking to harness. Arianna Huffington sums up the rationale for all this corporate interest: “Stress reduction and mindfulness don’t just make us happier and healthier, they’re a proven competitive advantage for any business that wants one.”The data seem to bear this out. Aetna employees who took a Mindfulness at Work course saw their healthcare costs fall by $2,000 a year relative to a control group. On an Orwellian note, it also improved their productivity, “resulting in more than an hour’s gain in work time per employee per week”.But is it not the case that the more one practices mindfulness, the less interest one has in competition, profit, and all the other commercial imperatives that underpin capitalism? Is mindfulness really a neutral instrument that can be used for any end — or is it inextricably bound up with the elimination of selfishness, the cultivation of compassion and the rejection of materialism? And might not promoting mindfulness among one’s employees be a bit risky as a result — because if one succeeds, they might stop bothering with anything so trivial as profits?Gelles certainly does not dodge this central question — indeed he devotes a whole chapter to it — but he does not really resolve it either. The most revealing answer comes from the chief executive of Prana, one of the “mindful” businesses he visits. Challenged by Gelles on his claim to combine compassion with capitalism, Scott Kerslake responds: “We’re still crappy at this. But we’re less crappy than a lot of people.”The reviewer is a bond fund manager and the author of Money — the Unauthorised Biography——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Swiss workers focus on the job in hand / From Bruce Mathers"

Cold ham, boiled eggs, hot toast, homemade marmalade, creamy butter and scalding hot coffee . . . Miss Pepper looked at the table with much approval.” Enid Blyton, The Ragamuffin Mystery, 1959It has been a case of the incredible shrinking breakfast since this 1950s ideal, not only in Britain, but in the US and beyond. Today, only one-third of British families eat breakfast together, and the number of times they do so has halved since the 1950s, according to Warburtons, the UK’s biggest bread manufacturer by market share.The traditional “full English” is more likely to be eaten at a business breakfast or on holiday than at home. But even its much-diminished substitute – a bowl of cereal or two slices of toast – is also in decline as more people eat breakfast on the go or seek alternatives to carbohydrates.“Consumers have been switching away from traditional breakfast towards more practical, portable products, such as biscuits, cereal/porridge pots and breakfast yoghurt pots,” said Pinar Hosafci, food research analyst at Euromonitor. “Lack of time, rise in single-occupant households, increase in the number of working women and flexible working hours have combined to play a large role in the success of portable breakfast products.”Soggy sales of mainstream breakfast cereal have eaten into the profitability of companies such as Weetabix, the UK company acquired by China’s Bright Food in 2012, and of Kellogg and General Mills in the US.They have been fighting back with bars, pots and liquid breakfast drinks to address the change in demand.“The traditional UK cereal market declined in volume for the fourth consecutive year,” Weetabix said in its 2013 annual report, published this week. “More breakfasts are being eaten during the commute, on the school run or at the desk.”The 82-year-old company said it expected the mainstream cereal market to continue its decline this year.Governments remain alert to the threat of food price volatility as unpredictable weather patterns have led to an increase in droughts, floods and hurricanes

Further readingIn the US, ready-to-eat cereal is still the largest breakfast category, but sales have fallen 5 per cent year-on-year, according to Nielsen, the market research group. Kellogg has been especially hard hit, reporting a fall in its US cereal sales each quarter for the past five quarters.Some cereal segments have been growing well – especially those perceived as healthy, such as oat-based cereals and granola. Associated British Foods, the UK food and retail conglomerate that owns Kingsmill bread and Primark stores, bought Dorset Cereals this year, to capitalise on the growth of granola cereals and complement its Jordans muesli.“The habits are changing out there and those changes are affecting our category in the near term,” said Paul Norman, Kellogg’s chief growth officer, at an industry conference last month. “It’s up to us to adjust to the changing habits to change the trend.”As Alex Sloane, analyst at Société Générale, points out, the US traditional cereal market has not only been hit by the convenience and lifestyle trends – single Americans now make up more than half the adult population – but also a bigger appetite for protein over carbohydrates.This is manifest in the resurgence of diets, such as the “Caveman,” and the astounding rise of Greek yoghurt, which since 2007 rose from 2 per cent of the US dairy market by value to 50 per cent, although its growth appears to have stalled.“A bowl with milk and cutlery doesn’t lend itself to food-on-the-go and in the US there has been an additional headwind of a massive shift towards higher protein products and lower carbohydrates,” said Mr Sloane. “General Mills and Kellogg have been relatively slow to adapt their brand offering. It is likely to be a long road back and require heavy investment.”It’s less about deprivation. It’s more about nutrient density and a focus on our food and less of a focus on the challenges and ways to lose weightThe companies are fighting back in an increasingly crowded market as snacks-producers have also piled in, such as Mondelez International with its successful BelVita breakfast biscuits.General Mills launched Nature Valley protein bars in 2012, which grew by 25 per cent in their second year, and has since extended the line with breakfast biscuits and Greek yoghurt protein bars. It hopes to renew interest in its traditional cereals with a protein-enriched Cheerios, launched earlier this year.Kellogg, which has been reducing its dependence on breakfast by acquiring snacks such as Pringles crisps, is grappling with a turnround of its Special K diet cereal. Though people want to lose weight, attitudes towards dieting have changed.“Perceptions of diet and wellness have evolved,” said Mr Norman. “It’s less about deprivation. It’s more about nutrient density and a focus on our food and less of a focus on the challenges and ways to lose weight.”Kellogg plans to launch a protein-enriched Special K cereal and a gluten-free version next year, while in the UK Weetabix recently launched a milkshake drink, called Weetabix on the Go.The majority of breakfast is still eaten at home. But as James Russo, Nielsen’s senior vice-president of global consumer insights, points out, the variety is broader and not necessarily healthy. Frozen waffles, pancakes and breakfast sandwiches have also been on the rise.“Overall consumers are still eating breakfast. They’re just eating differently than in the past,” he said."
41;GIS;General Mills;2014-09-09T17:12:25Z;Mobileye jumps as analysts climb aboard;;Mobileye shares advanced after brokerage Morgan Stanley lifted its expectations for the company on the view that it will continue to win new business and maintain its leading market position.Analysts with the investment bank say the company, which makes software, chips and other applications that process visual data to stop cars from colliding, is exposed to two of the “most powerful and fastest growing trends” in the auto sector: autonomous cars and software.“Mobileye’s superior technology and early start in the vision space mean that it has a five- to 10-year lead over rivals today,” said Ravi Shanker, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.“Management’s top priority should be capitalising on this lead to lock up as many large platforms as it can, without sacrificing pricing and margins.”Mobileye’s products are currently in use in roughly a fifth of vehicle models produced currently, Morgan Stanley said, and its customer base includes Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan and BMW.Gains are contingent on wins from automakers including Volkswagen and Toyota, Mr Shanker said, which will fuel global growth.He noted that competitive threats were “not lurking around the corner” and the company was steadily outpacing rivals.“We believe this will be even harder to achieve for the competition as Mobileye continues to add new features on the same hardware including semi- and fully autonomous driving capability,” he said.Mr Shanker increased his target price on Mobileye from $46 to $65. The company has been buoyed by an optimistic analyst community.Three-fourths of analysts who cover the company recommend Mobileye a buy, according to data from Bloomberg.Shares in the company climbed 7 per cent to $56.60, taking its advance since its debut this year to more than 52 per cent.McDonald’s said on Tuesday that the safety scare at one of its suppliers in China will cost the company between 15 cents and 20 cents a share in the quarter because of lost sales and the costs of “recovery efforts”.Sales in Asia-Pacific were down 14.5 per cent in August from a year earlier.The safety scare in China, which also struck Yum Brands, adds to headaches for chief executive Don Thompson.Sales in the US continued to fall last month, McDonald’s said. Same-store sales declined 2.8 per cent in the country, adding to a 3.7 per cent drop in comparable sales globally.McDonald’s shares fell 2 per cent to $91.09 while rival Burger King declined 1 per cent to $31.85 and Yum slipped less than 1 per cent to $72.07.Organic food company Annie’s soared 38 per cent to $46.10 after it said General Mills would purchase the company for $46 a share.The deal, worth $820m, is expected to close later this year. Executives with Annie’s said the combination would allow it to expand its reach and increase efficiency.General Mills shares fell less than a per cent to $53.17.Home Depot confirmed that its payment data systems were breached, leaving customers who shopped at US and Canadian stores potentially exposed.Home Depot, whose shares have dropped since disclosing last week that it was investigating a possible breach, said on Monday that it will offer card monitoring services to anyone who used a payment card at a Home Depot store from April.The company’s shares fell 2 per cent to $88.93.Barnes & Noble, the US books retailer, climbed 3 per cent to $24.09 on Tuesday – its highest level since 2009 – after it said its quarterly loss was narrower than Wall Street expectations.The company reported a loss of $28.4m, or 56 cents a share, on revenues of $1.2bn. Analysts had forecast a loss of 63 cents per share.Same-store book sales, which exclude the Nook, fell 0.4 per cent in the quarter from a year ago.The figure was better than the 1.9 per cent decline recorded in the prior quarter, when severe winter weather crimped February traffic.Overall, US equity markets slipped on Tuesday ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting. The S&P 500 declined 0.7 per cent to 1,988.44 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 17,013.87.

42;GIS;General Mills;2014-06-06T16:00:11Z;Weetabix eyes Chinese breakfast tables;;When Weetabix announced its launch into mainland China at a recent Shanghai trade show, its stand was topped by a cardboard canopy in the shape of a huge, gold crown.The display – trading on the British breakfast cereal-maker’s royal warrant – sent out a simple message: if Weetabix is good enough for the Queen of England, what better guarantee of safety and quality?That was in the back of the mind of executives at Bright Food when the state-backed group acquired a controlling stake in the 82-year-old cereal brand two years ago.Bright also hopes to exploit growing domestic demand for health-oriented foods, and Weetabix owns Alpen muesli and Ready Brek porridge. “Chinese consumers have the chance to have authentic, healthy and British-style breakfast cereals,” said Bright at November’s launch of Weetabix into 4,000 outlets in the Shanghai region.Giles Turrell, Weetabix chief executive, said: “Food safety is a big issue, and the middle class in China, particularly in cities such as Shanghai, aspire to western brands.”But adapting a western brand to local tastes takes time and research. While British consumers usually pour cold milk on to cereal, and often sweeten it, the Chinese prefer a hot, savoury – often rice-based – breakfast.“We’ve gone into Chinese homes and eaten breakfast with families. We’ve been on breakfast safaris – following consumers to work to study their breakfast habits,” said Mr Turrell. “The traditional Chinese breakfast can take a lot of time to make. So we believe there is a role for western-style breakfast, which is much quicker to prepare.”The Chinese ready-to-eat breakfast market is dominated by Switzerland’s Nestlé and General Mills of the US, according to data from Euromonitor.Torsten Stocker, partner at consulting firm AT Kearney, says: “If Weetabix can create its own version of Chinese cereal, for breakfast or other ‘ready-to-eat’ occasions, it should be able to get good traction, given Bright’s distribution network, as well as rising consumer demand for healthy and convenient foods.”PepsiCo’s Quaker Oats adapted by offering “sweet and savoury congee [rice-based cereal] containing . . . wolfberry, white fungus or red dates”, he added.Mr Turrell is considering green tea flavours, cranberries and sesame seeds to appeal to a savoury palate. He says the group’s muesli and cereal bars are selling well, partly because of China’s snacking culture. “Alpen bars and porridge will be easier to adapt. Weetabix will take time.”
43;GIS;General Mills;2014-05-19T22:59:19Z;Food groups under fire from Oxfam over carbon emissions;Top 10 companies fail to keep supply chain in check;The world’s 10 biggest food companies emit more greenhouse gases than the whole of Scandinavia but are failing to tackle the risks of climate change adequately, according to Oxfam, the campaigning charity.Erinch Sahan, Oxfam policy adviser, said that apart from fossil fuel producers, the food and drinks industry contributed more carbon emissions than any other industry.Although companies including Nestlé, Unilever, Danone, Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Mars had all committed to reduce carbon emissions, they had understated the extent of the problem by excluding emissions in their supply chains, he said.Moreover, the companies were “standing on the sidelines” by failing to use their influence to put pressure on governments and other industries over climate change action, the group said. The big 10 food companies collectively have annual sales of $1.1bn a day.“The big 10 are silent accomplices to this unfolding crisis. It is a serious charge because these companies should be fully aware of the impact that climate change is having on the planet’s food system, given their dominance and reach,” according to the report.Only Nestlé, Unilever and to some extent Mars and Coca-Cola were vocal in urging policy makers and other business to act on climate change, it said.About half of the companies’ total emissions derived from agriculture but were not covered under their reduction targets. “It is with these agricultural emissions that Oxfam finds the companies being particularly negligent,” the UK-based group said.Sally Copley, director of UK campaigns and policy, said: “They need to look at the whole picture from how their ingredients are grown to how their goods are produced to cut emissions.”Oxfam calculated that emissions from agriculture account for between 50 and 60 per cent of the global emissions of the big 10.Only Unilever – producer of Lipton tea, Magnum ice cream and Dove soap – and Coca-Cola had commitments addressing emissions in their supply chain but none of the large 10 companies required suppliers to set targets to reduce emissions, nor had reduction targets specifically for their agricultural emissions.Oxfam identified Kellogg and General Mills as the laggards among the 10 with their failure to address emissions in their supply chains. However, it said most of the biggest companies had committed to ending deforestation for palm oil.Kellogg said it was pleased Oxfam had recognised its pledge to source palm oil suppliers sustainably. “We are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions – along with energy use and water use – by 15-20 per cent at our manufacturing facilities by 2015,” the US-based group said.“We value continued engagement and discussion with Oxfam, and other external stakeholders on the important issues of environmental and social sustainability,” it added.General Mills brushed off the criticism, saying: “As a food company, we are very aware of the impact that climate change could have on agriculture and the world’s food supply. General Mills has been actively engaged in positively influencing climate policy and has been taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations for many years.”The UK’s Associated British Foods, which also came in for criticism, said it was tackling the issues raised in the report.Oxfam calculated that, if the big 10 were an individual country, they would rank as the world’s 25th most polluting by being responsible for 264m tonnes of emissions.
44;GIS;General Mills;2014-04-28T13:49:09Z;Why must financiers meditate in secret?;There is no reason for the industry to be coy about embracing ‘mindfulness’;Iam sitting in a packed conference room, somewhere in the heart of London’s financial centre, in an office I have sworn not to identify. It is quiet for a midweek lunchtime. In fact, it is silent. Along with the ex-chairman of a blue-chip company, a handful of executives and board members, a former senior central banker, a Buddhist software engineer, a Benedictine monk and 60 others, I am meditating. Or trying to.The main thought I am attempting to ignore is this: if the benefits of such “mindfulness” are as clear as science and millennia of human experience suggest, why is the financial services industry not boasting about the practice and rolling out the meditation mats across the sector?Individuals including Lord Myners, currently working on reform of the governance of the UK’s Co-operative Group, and Bill Gross, founder of Pimco, have talked publicly about how meditation helps them clear their minds and set priorities. A number of big US groups already host mindfulness sessions. They include General Mills, of Cheerios fame, and Google, whose people development expert Chade-Meng Tan is addressing this audience of financial folk about how mindfulness encourages compassionate leadership.At the global financial group hosting last week’s event, about 1,200 out of 10,000 staff tune in to regular updates about mindfulness, with 150 or so taking part in weekly meditation sessions. The participation rate has “increased dramatically”, says a senior executive. Yet high finance remains a bastion of corporate conservatism: fear of ridicule and industry scepticism means even enlightened institutions such as this one are coy about publicising such initiatives.Half a century ago similar misunderstanding prevailed about the value of physical exercise for executives. I dug out an FT column from 1957 headlined “Keeping Managers Healthy” that is full of delicious anachronisms (tip no. 5: “Never travel over weekends except for pleasure and then never more than 100 miles”). The main concern at the time was that bosses refused to attend medical check-ups. Even then, the article cited a company doctor’s view that executives “generally have a better-than-average bill of health – or else they would not get to the top”. Only when CEOs kept keeling over from strokes and heart attacks did it dawn on them and their shareholders that the fitness “fad” might mitigate the problem.In finance a 1950s-era presumption survives that success is, to quote the same article, “a tribute to [executives’] constitutions and physical and mental make-up”. Standing in the way of mindfulness is the worry it may be seen as quirky or “New Age”. Yet brain-imaging research suggests meditation can alleviate anxiety and depression, which still plague Wall Street and City of London executives.You do not have to believe mindfulness will lead to world peace to agree it is an obvious and relatively cheap way to reduce a growing business risk.How, then, should companies go about introducing it? Not by compulsion. The biggest successes – including the nascent programme at our anonymous host – start at the grassroots and only later get endorsed by senior staff. Treating mindfulness as a productivity tool is unwise, too. “This should not just be about making us better performers,” says the executive cited earlier.Forcing God into corporate mindfulness programmes would also be counter-productive. Buddhist Chade Meng-Tan culls language that may be thought religious from his talks to Google engineers. But, as Laurence Freeman, the Benedictine monk, says, meditation is common to many religions. If it brought some sense of the spiritual to secular institutions, that would be a bonus even bankers’ critics could applaud.Meditation must take a winding route to the workplace, much as physical fitness did. It should get there. Aspiring masters or mistresses of the financial universe would never neglect their physical wellbeing. Yet most gym regimes make disciples look far more ridiculous than a mindfulness workout would.Even the FT’s 1957-vintage tips for men managing multinationals advise some physical exercise (“gardening and fishing recommended”). Where meditation and mindfulness will prove their worth, however, is in helping modern executives implement tip no. 10 – still the most relevant and most elusive goal: “Learn to relax.”andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill
45;GIS;General Mills;2014-03-16T15:30:43Z;General Mills: unappetising environment;Food group feeling the effects of a frugal US consumer;General Mills has served up some unappetising news. The maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yoghurt and Häagen-Dazs ice cream warned on Friday that earnings per share for the third quarter (which ran through February) would be 61 cents to 62 cents a share, 4 per cent below a year ago and 10 per cent below Wall Street estimates. Negative foreign currency translation and investment in the company’s US yoghurt business were a drag in the quarter, but, like other food producers, General Mills is feeling the effects of a frugal US consumer.Last October, for example, Tony Vernon, the chief executive of rival Kraft, said shoppers were “using stores as their pantry”. In a product of the tentative economic recovery, cautious consumers are shopping more pay cheque-to-pay cheque rather than stockpiling food with big trips to the grocer. There is another problem. According to research from Credit Suisse, big US food companies are losing share to private-label and middle-tier companies such as Chobani and Green Mountain. Even with consumers reducing their spending, smaller groups may be accounting for a bigger portion of it. Total food and beverage spending is up 12 per cent since 2009, but the top 25 manufacturers have grown only 4 per cent, CS finds. (That is one reason behind General Mills’ investment in yoghurt in the US.) With large food companies distracted by efforts to grow in emerging markets, in the US organic foods are challenging them in the high end and private label in the low end.Heightened competition is a worrying long-term threat. The economy, on the other hand, should eventually turn (let’s hope). Earnings at General Mills are expected to increase by between 7 and 8 per cent this year – and over the next couple. At $50, shares of General Mills trade at 16 times next year’s earnings. Given the backdrop, that does not look terribly tasty.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
46;GIS;General Mills;2014-03-14T20:57:31Z;US teen retail takes hit as sales fall;;Aéropostale, the struggling US teen retailer, lost more than a tenth of its value on Friday as the company reported mounting losses and said it would accelerate its store closure programme.The casual clothing company reported a net loss of $70m, or 90 cents a share, as net sales fell 16 per cent to $670m. Wall Street analysts expected the retailer to report a loss of $25m on sales of $685m.Aéropostale’s woes have been somewhat more acute than those of its peers as the retailer caters to less affluent consumers, a demographic whose spending power remains depressed amid the uneven economic recovery.Executives said the company would close 50 stores this year, while opening fewer shops than it had anticipated.The company’s results follow lacklustre figures from Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Urban Outfitters, all of which reported sharp same-store sales declines at their namesake shops.“The results we generated in 2013 are not acceptable, nor are they a reflection of the progress we believe we have made in transforming our brand,” said Thomas Johnson, chief executive of Aéropostale.Separately, Aéropostale said it signed a commitment letter with Sycamore Partners and its affiliates for a strategic partnership and $150m in senior secured credit facilities. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the retailer would probably have to draw upon the facility soon as its cash burn accelerates.“Aéropostale occupies the weakest competitive position in teen retail, and continues to cede market share to cheap fashion retailers and other teen retailers,” said Morgan Stanley’s Kimberly Greenberger. “We think it is a structurally challenged business.”The retailer’s market capitalisation, which at its peak eclipsed $3bn, sunk below $500m. Shares in the company closed down 20.1 per cent to $5.83, taking its year-to-date decline to more than 32 per cent.General Mills weakened after the company forecast adjusted earnings between 61 and 62 cents a share for the quarter ended February 23, shy of Wall Street expectations.The performance for the quarter, according to General Mills, includes a jump in spending to promote its yoghurt business and is “consistent with recent food industry trends in developed markets”.General Mills noted operating profits in its retail segment would decline as much as 11 per cent in the third quarter.For the full-year, the maker of Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Cheerios cereal said it would earn between $2.87 and $2.90 a share, roughly in line with expectations.General Mills shares fell 2.4 per cent to $49.77.Liberty Media advanced after the company said it had pulled its bid for full control of Sirius XM and would split its media holding company into two separate tracking stocks.Investors will now be able to invest in Liberty Broadband Group, which will hold the company’s interest in Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable, as well as Liberty Media.The company added it would sell a portion of its shares in Sirius XM, although it would remain “enthusiastic owners”. Shares in the media group rose 7.2 per cent to $135.25.Ulta Beauty, the hair salon and make-up retailer, climbed 6.4 per cent on Friday to $95.26 as the company topped fourth-quarter sales expectations and forecast continued same-store sales growth.The US retailer reported a 14 per cent rise in sales from a year earlier to $868m as comparable sales quickened. Profits rose 10 per cent to $71m, or $1.09 per share.Management said sales would grow as much as 21 per cent in the first quarter to $704m, with earnings between 70 and 75 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of 80 cents.Overall, US equity markets trended higher despite a weakening of consumer confidence at the start of March.However, the benchmark S&P 500 ended down 0.3 per cent to 1,841.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lost 0.3 per cent to finish at 16,065.67. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 0.4 per cent at 4,245.40.
47;GIS;General Mills;2014-03-14T12:35:47Z;Companies trade focus groups for social media;;Social media is replacing the clipboard, the focus group and the pencil-chewing designer, as companies listen in on consumers’ conversations in the hope of creating the products they really want.Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest – as well as a whole host of community message boards – are being scoured for ideas for new products from cars to wine, in an attempt to cut product development costs and boost sales.From Kraft Foods to carmaker Nissan, via French supermarket Groupe Casino and Australian clothes maker Lorna Jane, companies are getting excited about using social media for much more than marketing.Michael Lazerow, chief marketing officer of Salesforce.com’s ExactTarget Marketing Cloud, which helps companies monitor customers on social media, said the challenge is turning ideas from hundreds of millions of sources into products on the shelves.Nissan, for example, decided to use social media to create a buzz around its 370Z sports car. It waded through Facebook comments and wall posts to choose fans’ suggestions for a special, souped-up version of the vehicle, nicknamed ‘Project 370Z’, one of which was manufactured three months later.The carmaker is now looking to repeat the trick with its Titan pickup truck. But sales of the 370Z have fallen about 15 per cent since the crowdsourcing effort.Mr Lazerow says local businesses have always relied on instant customer feedback but global ones had struggled until social media. “All of a sudden the community, the town square, is global and connected,” he said.“It is the end of the focus group as we know it,” he added. “The new focus group is collaborative, an always-on conversation between you and your customers.”Businesses have embraced social media for marketing – sending profits at Facebook soaring– but are now looking for other ways to mine this large and ever-changing set of data. Analytics companies are plugging the fire hoses of every tweet or post ever made into sophisticated computer programmes to find what customers are looking for.Each generation of new products and services developed by listening will be a lot sooner, quicker, fasterMore than half of the almost 300 global consumer product companies surveyed by EY said social media was changing the relationship between the manufacturer and the consumer. Respondents from companies with more than $1bn in revenues were even more likely to think social media is shifting control of brands to consumers.A report by Kalypso, product development consultants, said companies using social media to create new products were cutting the length of the time it takes to get to market and cutting product development costs. Compared with products not designed using social media, they saw faster adoption rates among consumers, a 6 per cent higher market share on average and improved revenue from the products by 5 per cent.Stuart Ogawa from Marketwired, a social media research firm, said decades ago companies could never have imagined the impact of feedback at this scale.“I think each generation of new products and services developed by listening will be a lot sooner, quicker, faster,” he said.But most companies are still experimenting with using social media in their product development, dipping their toes in with specific projects and competitions. Unilever held a competition for the next Cup a Soup flavour on Facebook, while General Mills removed high fructose corn syrup from its Yoplait yoghurt brand because of a social media post.Tesco, the UK supermarket, ran an online competition last year for a social created wine using the hashtag “#tescosocialwine” and inviting wine bloggers and a random selection of social media followers to a tasting. Shiraz and Chardonnay varieties of the Enaleni’s Dream brand are now available.Paul Banas, director of consumer insights and strategy at Kraft Foods, has become an evangelist for so-called “social listening”. In a blog, he describes listening for sources of “tension” in the conversation, problems consumers are having that could be solved by new products, be it feeding picky children or searching for snacks low in salt.For those whose ideas are being borrowed, it could be good – they get the product they want – or bad, as they usually don’t share in the intellectual property. Edison Nation helps consumer and health companies run online competitions for ideas while ensuring the inventor shares in the proceeds.Louis Foreman, chief executive of Edison Nation, which is also a US television show, warned sharing ideas on social media meant the clock started ticking for inventors to file for a patent.He warned mining social networks for information may be good business for the company, but not the consumer inventor. “Bringing patented products to market can prevent others from selling it for a 20-year period – that’s the real value of intellectual property.”

A breakfast bar is easier to eat while Twittering or having a video conference. It makes sense, then, that Kellogg reported a drop in sales in North America on Monday, with the US morning foods segment – which contributes a quarter of operating profit – down 2 per cent year on year. Sales of US snacks also fell and the company now expects this year’s earnings to be at the low end of its old target range.Kellogg has decided not to waste time crying over spilled (or rather unspilled) milk. The US foodmaker plans to slash 7 per cent of its global workforce by the end of 2017, including consolidating its supply chain. The restructuring plan, dubbed “Project K”, is expected to generate annual cash savings of up to $475m in 2018, most of which will be reinvested in the business.Kellogg’s margins could surely use some work. In the third quarter, its operating margin was about 14 per cent. That compares badly with 2002, when it was slightly more than 18 per cent, and to rival General Mills, which had operating margins of 17 per in its most recent quarter.At $63 – up about 2 per cent on Monday – shares of Kellogg trade at 16 times forward earnings. That represents a small discount to the 10-year average (16.6 times) and to General Mills (17 times). If Kellogg is successful in the implementation of Project K, its shareholders stand to reap at least an upside from multiple expansion. But the efficiency plan is not without risk. Kellogg has had a few product recalls in recent years. As the company seeks to make its supply chain more efficient, it needs to make sure quality does not suffer.Kellogg also needs to invest in new products that fit its customers’ lives.

49;GIS;General Mills;2013-09-12T00:03:31Z;Meet Brian McAndrews, Pandora’s new CEO;;Pandora has just appointed a veteran of Microsoft’s advertising technology business as its new chairman, president and chief executive.Brian McAndrews left his role at Seattle’s Madrona Venture Group, once a seed investor in Amazon.com, to join the internet radio service as it braces for new competition from Apple’s iTunes Radio. He replaces Joe Kennedy, who is retiring after leading Pandora since 2004.Mr McAndrews has experience in the advertising and entertainment industries but has not worked for a music comapny before. After stints at General Mills and broadcaster ABC, Mr McAndrews joined digital advertising agency Avenue A in 1999. The Seattle agency went on to become adtech group aQuantive and was bought by Microsoft for $6bn in 2007, where he stayed until 2009. Microsoft wrote down almost all of the value of aQuantive in July last year and later sold part of the business to Facebook.In a telephone interview from Pandora’s headquarters in Oakland, California on Wednesday afternoon, Mr McAndrews told the FT about his plans for the company, why he isn’t worrying about Apple and his love of Elton John lyrics. The following is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.FT: What attracted you to Pandora and what did Pandora see in you?BM: I was working at Madrone Venture Group working with entrepreneurs and startups. It’s a great firm and I was having a good time but I am an operator at heart. I guess I always knew in the back of my mind that if a really compelling opportunity came along, I’d want to throw my hat back in the ring. I remember distinctly the day I learned Joe was retiring as CEO and I said to myself, I hope I get a call about that.I’m a listener, I love Pandora as a customer, I think the product is really high quality. I follow the industry to a degree – Pandora is clearly a leader, it invented and is growing a new category, transforming the way that people listen to music. I had met Tim [Westergren, Pandora co-founder] and Joe before but I didn’t know them real well. After the recruiter called, I re-engaged and was really taken by how successful the company has been, the path it’s on and the opportunity – and also feeling really good about the people and the culture and that this could be a really good fit for me.Why they were interested in me, you’d better ask them. I’ve been a CEO of a successful company before and scaled the company to a certain size. I have leadership and organisational operating abilities in the entertainment and technology industries – this is a cross section of the two. I think they sensed my enthusiasm for the company and the product.FT: What do you want to change at Pandora?BM: I want to keep it on the path it’s on and continue to accelerate the growth – basically continue doing the types of things Pandora has done in the past: really understand the space, really understand your listeners and then innovate the offering to delight those listeners and keep them coming back…On the revenue side, I want to continue to invest in advertising infrastructure. The company has done a great job of building out a salesforce and building relationships with key players and platforms in the advertising space, and continue to ride that growth of mobile from the listener and advertising standpoint.FT: Do you see any immediate ways to increase advertising yields?BM: I’ll need to dig in deeper to understand more about specifically what types of targeting and technology Pandora is using. My sense is they have done a lot of smart things and are a leader in the advertising space here. I don’t have any sense that anything is not working but there may be additional things that they could be doing.FT: A lot of Pandora’s executives have a musical background, do you?BM: I played guitar as a kid and took lessons and then became one of the many who gave it up and regrets it. I can play a few songs but I have always loved music and I probably have way more lyrics in my head than I should. My favourite artist through the years is Elton John and [his long-time lyricist] Bernie Taupin. Other artists I like are Bruno Mars, Maroon 5, Madonna, and I just saw the Eagles in concert. I know people like my wife who really just focus on the music but I really listen to the lyrics, it’s the whole experience for me. I love artists who write interesting lyrics.FT: Pandora is in a long-running argument with some parts of the music industry about artists’ remuneration from internet radio. How can you change the record on the royalties debate?BM: I definitely share Pandora’s longstanding belief that musicians must be fairly compensated for their art. The existing system was created piecemeal over many years and doesn’t serve anyone really well.In terms of specifics, Tim and Joe have been very involved in that and are far more expert than I am. I will bring myself up to speed. We have some time in the [royalties] negotiations [the US statutory system is up for renewal next year].The goal is to make sure that artists are fairly compensated and that also people like Pandora and others who bring value to the party also receive some compensation for that as well.FT: Apple’s iTunes radio launches with iOS 7 next week, and other services such as Google Music, Spotify and Rdio are building out their internet radio services. How do you view the competitive landscape?BM: I view it as a really, really big marketplace. There are lots of different ways for people to consume music. While I respect all competitors, I don’t view any one in particular as going to win or lose. It’s certainly not a winner-takes-all business. At Pandora, our goal will be to focus on our business and our listeners and on continuing to delight them with innovation and the product. We can continue to grow and invest in advertising and continue to make monetisation work and we will then have a very successful business. If we focus on our customers and don’t spend too much time worrying about competitors, we will be more successful.
50;GIS;General Mills;2013-07-02T08:57:54Z;India: hot prospect for frozen yoghurt, with or without peanut butter;;"The mere mention of frozen yogurt evokes images of weight-conscious US college students, unable to resist the temptation of a sweet, queuing up at frozen yogurt shops for the so-called healthy alternative.I should know: as a student, I permitted myself a daily decadent treat from Yoghurt Park – top favourite flavour: peanut butter. It was something I would never have allowed myself with ice cream, though in reality the yoghurt probably carried the same amount of calories.Living in India years later, frozen yogurt has seemed like a memory from another lifetime. But that may now be set to change. On Tuesday, Pinkberry, the US-frozen yogurt chain (from my hometown, Los Angeles!) opened its first three new outlets in India, in the cities of Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.On the occasion of Pinkberry’s debut, New Delhi-based retail market consultancy Technopak has released a presentation predicting that frozen yogurt will be India’s next big thing – and that India could be the next big thing for frozen yogurt.India’s 1.2bn people are notorious for their love of sweets, including – for the urban middle class – ice cream. India’s ice cream sales have been growing at around 14-15 per cent a year since 2010, and the market for ice cream is expected to reach $1.2bn in the next financial year. International ice cream brands like Baskin-Robbins, Swensen’s, Haagen-Dazs, are already scaling up their presence, vying with popular local brands like Amul and Vadilal.But with obesity, diabetes, and heart disease sharply on the rise, many affluent Indians – like dieting US college students – are being forced to curb their consumption of the sweet stuff. Enter frozen yogurt, the so-called healthy alternative.The country already has a locally-owned frozen yogurt chain with 30 outlets, Cocoberry. In the last few years, US-based Red Mango, South Korea’s Yogurberry, and Canada’s Kiwi Kiss have also set up shop in the country.Technopak says frozen yogurt currently accounts for 10 to 12 per cent of all ‘frozen desert sales,’ but is growing faster – at rates of 15 to 16 per cent – than ice cream, with the market expected to more than double in size in the next five years, as more international yogurt companies are expected to enter the market.But it will not be all smooth sailing, Technopak points out. Many Indians are still hardly understand the concept of frozen yogurt, despite Cocoberry’s helpful explanatory slogan of “100% Sin. 0% guilt.” As in every other area of retail, finding suitable real estate will be a challenge, as will be finding suppliers, including local companies that can supply flavours beyond standard fruit flavours. That will mean imports – pushing up prices.Still, the long-term prospects in a huge market, with a notorious craving for sweets and increasing concerns about weight, are obviously tempting.And I for one am optimistic. Dear Pinkberry, when you finally expand and set up your first shop in New Delhi, please, please be sure to bring the peanut butter!Related reading

51;GIS;General Mills;2013-03-28T20:27:27Z;BlackBerry jumps on strong earnings;Utilities, healthcare and transport among gainers;Wall Street wrapped up the holiday-shortened week on a more upbeat note after the S&P 500 rose through its all-time closing high, buoyed by an improving outlook for the US economy.A scrambled bailout for Cyprus, fears of contagion in the eurozone and mixed corporate results in the US weighed on benchmark stock indices for most of the week, as investors favoured the perceived safety of Treasury bonds and the dollar.But on Thursday, the S&P 500 finally broke through its previous closing high at 1,565.15 to end the session at a record 1,569.19. For the week, the index rose 0.8 per cent.Since hitting an intraday low of 666.79 in March 2009, the broad measure of US stocks has rallied 135 per cent, boosted by aggressive monetary easing by the Federal Reserve and record US profits from the 500 constituents in the index.This week’s push came in the aftermath of mixed government data that showed US economic growth slowed less than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, but jobless claims rose to their highest level in one month.The blue-chip Dow Jones also advanced and traded 0.4 per cent higher on the week to 14,577.69. The index first surpassed its 2007 all-time high on March 5.The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.6 per cent on the week to 3,267.52. US markets were closed for Good Friday and will resume trading on Monday.US growth data for the fourth quarter of 2012 was revised up again to an annualised rate of 0.4 per cent, providing evidence that the economy did not take a dip at the end of last year. The revision came after an initial estimate that the economy shrank by 0.1 per cent.But in another report on Thursday, the Labour Department said first-time jobless claims rose by 16,000 to 357,000 in the week ended March 23, the highest level in a month.Christopher Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said: “Net, net, GDP is old news with consumers revised down a little and business capital expenditures and commercial real estate construction stronger. Unemployment claims revised upward the last few months, but with a stronger trend of improvement. Things are better than we think.”Throughout the week, utilities and healthcare stocks were among leading gainers, while companies in the basic materials and energy sectors lagged behind.Some of the highlights came from companies such as Best Buy. The stock initially jumped on news the company founder and largest individual shareholder, Richard Schulze, will be returning to the company as chairman emeritus. Analysts said the move could be viewed as an endorsement of the company’s turnround plan. But a “sell” recommendation from S&P Capital IQ weighed on the stock, which traded 2.7 per cent lower for the week to $22.15.Dell was also in focus this week. Blackstone and investor Carl Icahn both tabled competing offers for the PC maker, which Michael Dell and Silver Lake plan to take private in a $24.4bn deal. Blackstone made an offer of at least $14.25 a share for the whole company, while Mr Icahn is looking to pay $15 a share for 58 per cent of the company.Both offers are superior to the $13.65 a share offer from Mr Dell and Silver Lake on a per-share basis, and helped push the stock 1.3 per cent higher on the week to $14.33.In earning news, BlackBerry initially jumped more than 4 per cent to $15.20 after reporting fourth-quarter results, but the stock ended the week 3.1 per cent lower at $14.44. Red Hat fell almost 3 per cent after sales missed estimates, but it pared some of its losses to trade 0.3 per cent lower on the week to $50.58.Apollo Group, the private education provider, beat estimates with second-quarter earnings of 34 cents per share. Shares ended the week 2 per cent higher to $17.39.Elsewhere, shares in Pinnacle Foods, which is owned by Blackstone, rose on its first trading day on Thursday after raising $580m in its initial public offering. Shares were up 11 per cent to $22.21. And American Express rose 1.8 per cent to $67.39 on the week after the company’s board authorised the repurchase of up to 150m shares.
52;GIS;General Mills;2013-03-22T20:24:29Z;Wall Street higher on robust earnings;;Robust earnings from Nike and Tiffany and a stellar listing from Marin Software boosted Wall Street on Friday, but the gains failed to prevent major benchmarks from registering their first weekly losses this month.Shares in Nike surged 11.1 per cent to $59.53 after it reported net income rose 16 per cent to $662m in the quarter to February 28 compared with expectations of $610m.Revenues were up 9 per cent to $6.2bn, in line with Wall Street forecasts.Tiffany & Co reported that fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose to $179.6m, or $1.40 per diluted share, beating a forecast $1.36 and up from $178.4m, or $1.39 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier.Shares in the luxury retailer rose 1.9 per cent to $69.23.Solid earnings propelled shares in Micron Technology 10.7 per cent higher to $10.04 with sentiment buoyed by analyst upgrades.Shares in Darden Restaurants rose 1.4 per cent to $49.62 after an 18 per cent drop in its fiscal third-quarter net income still beat expectations.The company said combined sales for its Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants that have been open at least a year declined 4.6 per cent.The listing of Marin Software on Friday saw its shares climb 16.1 per cent to $16.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.The ad tracking company listed at $14 a share and surged to a peak of $19.95.The S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,556.89 with the session’s earnings reports helping to offset gloomy results from FedEx and Oracle earlier this week. For the week, the S&P registered a decline of 0.2 per cent, breaking a run of three consecutive weekly gains.FedEx incurred a weekly loss of 9.7 per cent to $98.48 after the package delivery company cut its full-year forecast in the wake of third-quarter net income dropping 31 per cent.That weighed on the Dow Transportation Average after it touched a record intraday peak on Tuesday.Transports slipped 1.5 per cent this week, trimming their 2013 gain to 16.4 per cent, still handily beating the major US indices.Oracle dropped 12 per cent to $31.98 for the week after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts.The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.Among the major S&P sectors this week, consumer staples led with a gain of 2.1 per cent while financials lost 1.5 per cent while materials dropped 2 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 0.6 per cent higher at 14,512.03, having touched a new intraday record high of 14,546.82 earlier this week. That left the blue-chip barometer a fraction lower on the week, its first such loss in five weeks.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7 per cent to 3,244.99, for a loss of 0.1 per cent since Monday.The first-quarter earnings season kicks into gear next month and could determine whether the S&P 500 can break its 2007 closing high of 1,565.15.The estimated earnings growth rate for S&P 500 companies during the first quarter is minus 0.7 per cent, according to FactSet.“While analysts expect little if any earnings growth for the first quarter of 2013, they do predict earnings growth will rebound to double-digit levels in the second half of 2013,” said John Butters, analyst at FactSet.James Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel, said the S&P remains on track to break its 2007 high, citing the momentum of money coming into the market for dividend paying and value stocks.“People that need income are looking for stocks that provide them with an actual cash flow yield,” he said.But with uncertainty swirling in the eurozone over Cyprus and with fiscal policy in the US, equities could struggle for momentum in March.“These increased risks are likely to cause stock markets to struggle in the near term and prompt profit taking after the strong gains thus far in 2013,” said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investment Advisors.Among other shares in the earnings spotlight this week, weaker guidance from Guess saw its shares drop 7.5 per cent to $25.09.A strong fiscal fourth-quarter and higher dividend for Williams-Sonoma boosted its shares by 10.7 per cent to $49.83.Adobe booked a weekly rise of 3.8 per cent to $42.97 after its first-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share exceeded a forecast of 20 cents.Shares in General Mills rallied 4.1 per cent to $48.15 on the week after its fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat a forecast of 57 cents.
53;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Food stocks: stay overweight;Given slim pickings elsewhere, investors should refill their plates;Lardy, distended, porcine, obese. Or is the right word full-figured, voluptuous, Rubenesque? With food stocks, it’s hard to say. Their owners are undoubtedly looking prosperous around the middle. The S&P 500 food producers index has returned 22 per cent in the past 12 months, besting staples stocks generally (18 per cent) and the wider market (13 per cent). Hormel, ConAgra, Campbell, Smucker, General Mills, Kellogg, and, in Europe, Nestlé have all managed to outperform.The case for remaining overweight in the sector is familiar. The stocks are defensive, at a time when an ageing stock market rally, combined with an unsteady economy, is making investors nervous. For those suffering from central bank-induced paranoia, they should be good inflation hedges too – inelastic demand for their products translates to pricing power. And they tend to be good dividend payers, for those on the run from terrible bond yields. In short, food shares are a bit like other shares in the era of quantitative easing, only more so.Those who still honour the first rule of valuations – that they can’t remain inflated for ever – will be tempted to slim down. Multiples of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation across the sector are at or near historical highs, data from Capital IQ show. Warren Buffett’s recent display of appetite, when he paid an unheard-of 14 times forward ebitda for Heinz, may be encouraging. But when smaller investors shell out, say, 10 times for Hormel or 12 for Nestlé, they will not enjoy the risk-reducing 6 per cent overall yield Mr Buffett gets with his Heinz stake. The sad fact is that for those who are prevented from holding cash by the need for returns or fear of inflation, there may be few options better than food shares.

54;GIS;General Mills;2013-02-15T20:29:58Z;Relish the lessons in Buffett ketchup deal;;"Warren Buffett has a strange effect on people. One grizzled veteran of mergers and acquisitions was practically giddy this week to find himself on an email chain with the 82-year-old investor known as the “Sage of Omaha”.Spend any time with value investors and you will find them quoting him as a reflex, like pilgrims touching the statue of a saint as they pass. “Our favourite holding period is forever”, from the 1988 letter to shareholders in Berkshire Hathaway, for example, or the old saw “be fearful when others are greedy”.He is the deus ex machina of the stock market, a constant background presence who could decide from his bathtub in 2011 to rescue confidence in Bank of America with bags of cash. Or he can appear, as he did this week with Heinz, with a $28bn deal to extract an iconic US company from public hands all but signed and sealed.What lesson, though, should mortal investors draw from Mr Buffett’s purchase of the maker of ketchup and baked beans?It comes as merger and acquisition activity has started to pick up, providing real excitement for investment bankers for the first time since the financial crisis. Speculation that other food companies could be taken out provided a boost to the share prices of companies such as General Mills this week.Yet looking for more dealmakers to follow in the footsteps of Mr Buffett is the wrong conclusion. His last big purchase was the $34bn he spent on the railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe in 2010, and while that was a sign of his long-term confidence in US economic revival, it didn’t set in motion any great round of consolidation for the sector.This time the economic message is less encouraging in a week where the US stock market has skirted an all-time high. Mr Buffett, with his private equity partner 3G Capital, has bought a solid and dependable business that will withstand all but the worst economic environments.The billionaire is famously an optimist on the US in the long term, but he has also shown a preference for big, solid and dependable companies with strong brands: Coca-Cola, Gillette and Johnson & Johnson for instance.For investors nervous about the outlook, consumer staples yielding 3-4 per cent would seem a good idea. Follow the Buffett long-term mantra and let the cash flows from the business slowly compound over time.Yet, again, simply to follow in Mr Buffett’s footsteps would be to miss a fundamental point. The investor has developed a peerless record over four decades by choosing where to invest capital. He takes cash thrown off from reliable businesses, for instance See’s Candies, and puts it to what he sees as more productive use.So to pay a 20 per cent premium for Heinz, he will not just want the cash to invest elsewhere; there must be better opportunities to invest the cash within Heinz’s own business, for instance in emerging markets.It is the difference between invoking the long term, and actually investing for it, as Mr Buffett has done; a choice between profits now and profits in the future, and investors looking at stocks should question where this choice is likely to be on offer.The giant goods consumer Procter & Gamble, for instance, has a large emerging markets business, but it also has an activist shareholder, Bill Ackman of Pershing Square, lurking in the background. It is under pressure to show results now.Consider the family-controlled Brown Forman, by contrast. Thomas A Russo, of Gardner Russo & Gardner, says when he first became a shareholder in 1987 the company sold around 5m cases of Jack Daniels in the US, and just 50,000 in the rest of the world. The company took the profits from the mature US and with a Buffett-esque patience used them to invest elsewhere. So today it still sells around 5m cases of bourbon in the US, but 6m cases of “Uncle Jack” abroad, and looks set to reap the benefits of that time spent building.So the point is not to rush to follow in public what Mr Buffett can do in private; it is to spot that a failure of public markets is what gives him the opportunity to do it in the first place.dan.mccrum@ft.com"
55;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rate fears spark floater revival;;Investor demand for corporate debt that pays floating rates is running at record levels in 2013, as the markets prepare for the risk of rising rates.Walt Disney was expected to sell floating rate debt by the end of Tuesday, joining some of the world’s largest corporations that have sold the securities so far this year, including General Electric Capital, AT&T, Vodafone, Toyota Motor Credit, IBM and General Mills. Their sales have pushed 2013’s total volume to an all-time high of $7.9bn, surpassing a previous record set in 2007 ahead of the financial crisis, according to Dealogic.The rebound in offerings of the so-called floaters comes as US interest rates have been kept low for several years by the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing programme. But better economic data recently has raised the prospect of an end to the central bank’s programme, increasing the allure of securities offering income that will climb along with rates.“The greater interest in the floating rate space is due to the fear of rising rates,” said Ashish Shah, head of global credit at AllianceBernstein.Investors seek protection on floating rates paper as rising benchmark rates can hurt the value of debt holdings that pay a fixed rate, an outcome that has already caused a sell-off in bonds in recent weeks.“Demand is very high for floaters and we have a big appetite for them,” said Michael Kastner, a principal at Halyard Asset Management. “It looks like issuers are willing to accommodate floaters as they are being packaged with fixed rate debt.”In two of this year’s largest deals, GE Capital and AT&T each sold $1.25bn in floating-rate notes as part of multi-tranche debt offers that included fixed-rate debt. GE Capital’s two-year note was priced at 38 basis points over three-month Libor, and AT&T’s three-year note was sold at 38.5bp over three-month Libor.Later on Tuesday, Disney was expected to sell two-year floating-rate notes, marking its first new US dollar-denominated floaters since 2007.While selling floating rate debt is more expensive for companies, short-term borrowing costs were still low enough to offset the higher expense, analysts said. All of 2013’s floaters have maturities of three years and below.“Companies at this stage are basically filling a request from investors for the floaters,” said Adrian Miller, director for fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.“It is still cheap enough for them to do it as the sales are coming with two or three-year maturities. But we have yet to see a five-year floater. Market conditions will have to turn a bit more dramatic before we get to that point.”
56;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;P&G joins forces in search for start-ups;;Procter & Gamble is joining forces with a young Silicon Valley crowdfunding company in a hunt for promising consumer product start-ups.The owner of personal care products including Crest toothpaste and Pampers nappies will join General Mills in partnering with CircleUp, the San Francisco-based online finance start-up for food and personal care products, to find potential investment or acquisition targets at an earlier stage in the entrepreneurial cycle.P&G has been struggling to focus its product innovation efforts, after admitting last year that a dearth of radical ideas contributed to mediocre profit growth. Drawing on the knowledge of Silicon Valley, as well as the eco-friendly product development of the Bay Area, is one of the strategies it has adopted to correct this.“With each passing year, the internal venture groups at the P&Gs and General Mills’ of the world are getting larger and more important,” said Ryan Caldbeck, chief executive of CircleUp. “They have mandates to go out and identify innovation.”CircleUp believes its collection of food and personal care start-ups are of particular interest to these multinationals.CircleUp provides financing to early-stage companies with annual revenues of about $10m, which are typically too big for angel investors, but too small for private equity funds. CircleUp aims to fill that funding gap by pooling small investments of about $1,000 each from individuals into one large investment of about $50,000. With this approach, they have cut the typical fundraising time down from 12 months to two, Mr Caldbeck said.P&G and CircleUp declined to comment on the financial details of the partnership, though P&G makes company experts available to mentor start-up founders to help them solve problems.“On the P&G side, it’s really about looking for access, not only to those companies and what they’re working on, it’s really access to their founders,” said Andrew Backs, manager of new business creation at P&G.Mr Backs is part of a three-person team based in San Francisco to keep an eye on the latest digital, mobile, and big data trends coming out of the technology industry. P&G has already partnered with ShopKick, a mobile app that delivers discounts and ads for P&G products to shoppers when they walk into a retail store, and is working on securing partnerships with several more start-ups.The company is also attracted to the eco-friendly and organic movements rooted in the Bay Area, and is looking for new household cleaners, beauty care and pet products that reflect that trend.General Mills is also looking for more natural, organic food products and healthy snacks to invest in and add to its product line, said Meredith Schwarz, manager of General Mills Ventures.Ms Schwarz travels all over the country, visiting grocery stores and tasting local products. When she finds a company that is too small to meet the funding criteria for General Mills, she refers them to CircleUp. She also monitors how investors respond to other companies trying to raise money on the platform.“I’m very curious to see some of the brands that raise capital on CircleUp,” she said. “I want to stay in touch with them as they grow.”
57;GIS;General Mills;2012-10-25T16:59:08Z;Genetically modified label may not stick;;Arran Stephens, founder of Nature’s Path, pays a premium for the “certified organic” and “non-GMO verified” labels he puts on the boxes of puffed rice cereal and cinnamon raisin granola made by his company, the largest organic breakfast food producer in North America by sales.Now he wants to level the playing field, by requiring the likes of Kellogg’s and General Mills to add labels to their products that say “Partially Produced With Genetic Engineering” and forbidding them from labelling them “natural”.“People have a right to know what’s in their food,” he said.Mr Stephens is the largest corporate donor behind Prop 37, a proposed law in California that would require all foods made with genetically modified organisms to be labelled as such. If passed in the November 6 election, California would be the first state in the US to have a GMO-labelling law.More than 35 other countries already have such laws, including the European Union, Russia and China.The consequences of those laws, particularly in Europe, have inspired a harsh backlash in California from agricultural and pesticide companies in the US and Europe that sell genetically modified seeds.Together, they have raised more than $33m for a rebuttal campaign against the California proposition.Backers of the proposition have said that GMO labels are the equivalent of putting “a skull and cross bones” image on foods, frightening consumers out of buying such products.“And it’s kind of true,” said Kathy Fairbanks, a spokesperson for the No on 37 campaign. In Europe, food companies altered their products to contain less or no genetically engineered ingredients rather than comply with the label requirement, she said.Her group believes a similar outcome would be likely in California, which would result in an estimated $1.3bn cost to the agricultural industry.Other states are closely watching the fate of the voter initiative in California.Several, including Vermont and Connecticut, have attempted to pass their own GMO labelling laws in recent years, but failed owing to internal disagreements over enforcement and fear of litigation from the agricultural companies.Labelling proponents say they cannot make headway in the US because of the immense lobbying power of Monsanto, a global agribusiness group that produces genetically engineered seeds and farming products.European-based companies, who fear losing their US market for GM products, are involved in the California battle. Syngenta, BASF and Bayer joined US companies Dow and Dupont in contributing to a TV advertising campaign against the measure.“They have to send their money half way around the planet to tell moms and dads they don’t have a right to know what’s in their children’s food,” said Gary Ruskin, the campaign manager for Yes on 37.It is not just the business interests of large multinationals that motivate the opposition efforts.Michael Steel, an attorney at Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco, said the vague wording of the proposed law leaves small grocers, farmers, food processors and distributors vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits. Any individual would be able to sue for damages equal to the sales of the unlabelled retail product, say a bag of potato crisps, for three years.In addition to labels for GMOs, the proposed law would prohibit any food from carrying the label “natural” if it was processed in any way, including cooking, freezing or canning.“So, if I have almonds I knock off a tree in the backyard and I roast them and sell them, they can’t be called natural,” said Mr Steel.
58;GIS;General Mills;2012-10-21T21:04:30Z;Growth in beer sales to Hispanics;;"Growth in sales of imported beers, especially popular with Hispanic and African-Americans, is surging ahead of mainstream ale – suggesting to brewers that some of those worst-hit by the downturn are now bouncing back.US beer sales slumped alongside the broader economy as stalwarts of the bars found themselves jobless and sitting in homes worth less than they paid for them.Minorities were hit especially hard. Many Hispanics worked in industries such as construction, blacks were hit by cutbacks in the public sector, and both groups were under-represented in professional jobs where there were fewer lay-offs.Unemployment rates generally are marginally better this year, but remain skewed at 14.2 per cent for blacks, 9.9 per cent for Hispanics and 7 per cent for whites, according to government data.But the brewers’ read suggests confidence – manifested in willingness to spend – is rapidly strengthening. Imports, half of which are sold to non-whites, show “the biggest trend reversal”, according to Dolf van den Brink, who heads up the US operations of Heineken, the number three brewer by sales.“No other segment is skewed so much to those most affected by the crisis in terms of unemployment,” he said. “As things get a bit better, those consumers are starting to spend again resulting in the huge trend in import beers.”Imports make up around one-tenth of the overall beer market, according to Nielsen, the global market research consultancy. Last year sales were broadly flat; so far this year, sales are up 6.5 per cent. Overall, beer sales dipped 1 per cent last year and are up about 2 per cent year to date.Other food and drink companies are also eyeing growth in these markets, with the likes of Kraft, General Mills and PepsiCo of the US increasingly targeting their advertising efforts at the US Hispanic population and tailoring recipes to cater to their tastes.Tony Vernon, Kraft’s new chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier this year that the US grocery company will increase its spending on Hispanic advertising by “double-digits” this year, after tripling its investment in 2011.Analysts say that Hispanics’ incomes are growing and that the group tends to spend a greater amount of their disposable income on food and groceries.“In many ways, Hispanics are the ideal staples consumer: they spend more time and money per trip to the grocery store than the national average, they bring more family members with them to shop, and they tend to be more brand loyal,” Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a recent report on the subject.For brewers – and the host of food and beverage manufacturers wooing these groups – the appeal lies beyond rising employment among today’s workers and their children."
59;GIS;General Mills;2012-09-19T16:58:12Z;General Mills looks to India for deals;;General Mills, the US food company, is seeking acquisitions in India as it looks to bolster sales in emerging markets to make up for sluggish domestic demand.Strong growth in China and its recent acquisition of Yoki, a Brazilian food company, have given General Mills a foothold in two of the world’s fastest-growing markets, making India the natural next step, Don Mulligan, the company’s chief financial officer, told the Financial Times.“We’ve been looking for a while,” Mr Mulligan said. “We’re looking at categories where our capabilities can play and looking for a company that can provide infrastructure for us.”General Mills bought Yoki for $875m in May and last year acquired half of Yoplait, the French yoghurt manufacturer, for $1.15bn. The company said it is also open to deals in the US, where it hopes to become more active in the fast-growing market for healthy snacks.Mr Mulligan’s comments came as General Mills, which makes Cheerios cereal and Progresso soups, reported first-quarter earnings that were stronger than Wall Street analysts expected. International sales rose 27 per cent year-on-year to $1.09bn, while US retail sales slipped 1 per cent to $2.49bn.“The benefit from an aggressive new product pipeline is not yet fully apparent,” said Matthew Grainger, analyst at Morgan Stanley.General Mills said that it was seeing slow improvement in its US retail division, but that the US economy continues to be sluggish.Overall, net earnings rose 35.3 per cent from the same quarter a year ago to $548.9m, or 82 cents a share. Net sales rose 5.3 per cent year-on-year to $4bn because of contributions from the company’s recent acquisitions.Shares of General Mills were up 2.1 per cent to $40.14 in midday trading.
60;GIS;General Mills;2012-08-24T16:15:55Z;The mind business;Yoga, meditation, ‘mindfulness’ – why some of the west’s biggest companies are embracing eastern spirituality;"General Mills, the company behind Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice cream, is headquartered on a leafy expanse outside Minneapolis, Minnesota. Enclosed walkways connect a network of modernist buildings, protecting Midwestern workers from heat and humidity in the summer, and bitter cold and towering snowdrifts in the winter. Inside the halls, some 3,000 people work on everything from product development and marketing to litigation, regulation and mergers and acquisitions. The employee base is generally reflective of middle America – predominantly white, casually dressed and possessing a genial, if hard-working, disposition.Yet there are signs that in some significant ways, General Mills has a distinctly unusual corporate culture. Open the right door on a Tuesday morning and you might find a few dozen team leaders and executives meditating silently together on cushions, steeling their minds for the work week ahead. Enter a conference room later that afternoon and witness more than 50 senior employees from across the organisation standing on one leg in the tree pose as they practise yoga. Note that in every building on the General Mills campus there is a meditation room, equipped with a few zafus – or cushions for sitting practice – and yoga mats where, day after day, employees duck in to grab a few minutes of equanimity in between their meetings. These are the most obvious signs that, as an organisation, General Mills has something resembling a collective spiritual life.This isn’t some passing fad sweeping middle management, or a pilot programme dreamed up by human resources. For seven years now, a growing number of General Mills workers have been practising meditation, yoga and so-called “mindfulness” in the workplace. And what began as a side project by one executive has transformed the culture of a Fortune 200 multinational.“It’s about training our minds to be more focused, to see with clarity, to have spaciousness for creativity and to feel connected,” says Janice Marturano, General Mills’ deputy general counsel, who founded the programme. “That compassion to ourselves, to everyone around us – our colleagues, customers – that’s what the training of mindfulness is really about.”The General Mills initiative is at the vanguard of a movement that is quietly reshaping certain corners of the corporate world. With meditation, yoga and “mindfulness”, the foundational tenets of Buddhism, Hinduism and other pan-Asian philosophies have infiltrated the upper echelons of some of the biggest companies on earth.William George, a current Goldman Sachs board member and a former chief executive of the healthcare giant Medtronic, started meditating in 1974 and never stopped. Today, he is one of the main advocates for bringing meditation into corporate life, writing articles on the subject for the Harvard Business Review. “The main business case for meditation is that if you’re fully present on the job, you will be more effective as a leader, you will make better decisions and you will work better with other people,” he tells me. “I tend to live a very busy life. This keeps me focused on what’s important.”Though the combination of mysticism and capitalism may seem incongruous, this interplay has found fertile ground at some of the best-known companies in the US and Europe. It is a mash-up of ancient insights and modern-day management theory, and it is happening at Target, Google and First Direct, among others. Today, in organisations large and small, eastern wisdom is changing western business.…These influences have been at work for decades. A generation exposed to “Beat” culture, hippies and eastern mysticism produced a flock of business leaders, including George and one Steve Jobs. Apple’s founder and former chief executive was a Zen Buddhist and spoke openly about how his time meditating in India shaped his world view and, ultimately, Apple’s product design.of large US companies have now launched ‘stress-reduction’ initiatives“If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is,” Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. “If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there’s room to hear more subtle things – that’s when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It’s a discipline; you have to practise it.”There are no reliable statistics on how many companies offer meditation in the workplace, but a quarter of large US employers have launched “stress reduction” initiatives, according to the HR and outsourcing consultancy Aon Hewitt, and that number is growing steadily.Here I must disclose an interest. I began meditating more than a decade ago. What began as an academic pursuit in college led me to spend a year studying in India, sitting with meditation teachers from the Tibetan, Zen and south-east Asian traditions. While I haven’t achieved any higher states of consciousness as a result, meditation and mindfulness come in handy on a near-daily basis, helping me maintain equanimity in a high-stress job. Moreover, in the course of reporting on technology, media and mergers and acquisitions, I’ve found like-minded meditators at a surprising range of companies.Google’s “Search Inside Yourself” programme has introduced mindfulness to more than 1,000 employees. Pioneered by Chade-Meng Tan, an early Google employee, its popularity has been buoyed by Tan’s book of the same title. Tan turned to General Mills for inspiration when he began Search Inside Yourself in 2007, and is now bringing the training to other technology companies.Indeed, Silicon Valley is a hotbed for mindfulness at work. An annual conference called Wisdom 2.0 draws together thousands of spiritually minded technologists from, among others, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, who trade tips on how to stay calm in the digital age.Aetna, one of the largest healthcare benefits companies in the US, began rolling out mindfulness and yoga programmes to its employees in 2010. The initiative was dreamed up by Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, himself a meditator. After attracting 3,500 employees, Aetna this year began offering workplace meditation and yoga as a service it sells to customers. “Every morning I get up and I do my asana, pranayama, meditation and Vedic chanting before work,” Bertolini told Yoga Journal. “That’s my wellness programme. It’s helped me be more centred, more present.”of General Mills senior executives said they had become better listeners as a result of ‘mindfulness’ trainingAt the retail giant Target, based, like General Mills, in Minneapolis, a group called “Meditating Merchants” was set up in 2010. The training is open to all employees and has so far attracted 500 participants, who meditate once a week at lunch time. Mikisha Nation, a 33-year-old Jamaican woman who works in human resources, helped pioneer the Target group and says the practice complements her own work. “Happy, healthy, engaged team members create an environment that is a great place to work,” she says, “even though it might seem weird to sit on a mat in the middle of a conference room.”Green Mountain Coffee Roasters offers monthly day-long retreats to employees, their family and friends and the community at large. Led by Shinzen Young, an American Buddhist teacher, the sessions are held inside Green Mountain’s engineering offices in Waterbury, Vermont. And in London, James Muthana runs YogaAt.com, a company that teaches yoga and meditation to corporate clients including First Direct, Taj Hotels and West Ham United football club. Muthana, a former banker who left the City after 10 years, says his practice is growing. “There’s a lot of uncertainty in the world today,” he tells me. “Our clients are aware that it’s not enough to attract talent – you’ve got to retain and look after that talent.”Within this growing constellation of mindful businesses, General Mills has one of the most sophisticated programmes, with compelling, if nascent, research behind it.Known as Mindful Leadership, the General Mills programme uses a mix of sitting meditation based on Buddhist practice, gentle yoga and dialogue to settle the mind. The idea is that calmer workers will be less stressed, more productive and even become better leaders, thereby benefiting the entire organisation.Mindfulness can sound deceptively easy. Practitioners sit in a comfortable position, close their eyes and simply notice the physical sensations in their body and the swirling thoughts in their brain. Using moment-to-moment, non-judgmental awareness, the aim is to observe these sensations without reacting to them. By doing so, meditators gradually recognise the fleeting nature of sensations, including pain, anger and frustration. In time, this allows practitioners to quiet the mind. If it all works as intended, this results in individuals who are less agitated, more focused and easier to work with.This may sound like New Age mumbo-jumbo, but a growing body of academic research provides a scientific explanation. Meditation is shown to reduce levels of cortisol, a hormone related to stress. When cortisol levels drop, the mind grows calmer and gains the stability to become more focused. “Mindfulness is an idea whose time has come,” says Google’s Tan. “For a long time practitioners knew, but the science wasn’t there. Now the science has caught up.”That the practice delivers consistent results has led to its popularity not only with spiritual seekers, but also with psychoanalysts, health and now business professionals. At General Mills, several hundred executives have taken part in the programme, which has gained national renown and is being exported to other multinational companies. But to understand how a company with $17bn in revenues underwent a spiritual revolution involves examining the personal transformation experienced by one General Mills employee – who in turn became the company’s de facto guru.…Janice Marturano joined General Mills in 1996 as part of the company’s in-house legal team. A compact and quiet woman with a bob of black hair, Marturano had an impeccable résumé when she arrived. After graduating from New York University’s School of Law she was taken on by Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, a New York firm specialising in corporate work. In 1984 she joined the in-house team at Panasonic and then undertook a similar role at Nabisco.When she joined General Mills 10 years later, Marturano was the liaison to the Food and Drug Administration, heading up policy work around trade regulation. She worked with the Securities and Exchange Commission and focused on anti-trust work, a role that ultimately led her down a spiritual path.In 2000, General Mills sought to acquire Pillsbury, the baked-goods company known for its iconic Doughboy mascot, for $10.5bn. The deal was set to create the fourth-largest food company in the world, but was delayed by regulators. Approval dragged on for 18 months, and Marturano became mired in contentious antitrust policy.As if those pressures weren’t enough, during that same year-and-a-half both Marturano’s parents died. The combination of events left her emotionally and intellectually drained. “I thought I’d bounce back. I’d been through deals before,” she says. “But I didn’t. My mental resilience had become so depleted.”Marturano was still at this low ebb when she was offered the chance to join a retreat taught by Jon Kabat-Zinn, a psychologist who has helped popularise meditation as the author of Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life. Though it was unlike anything she had done before, Marturano was in need of a shock to the system, so she headed to Miraval, a resort near Tucson, Arizona, for six days.She was unprepared for the rigorous demands of mindfulness meditation when she arrived. “At the very beginning, Jon said: ‘Ok, we’re going to meditate for about an hour,’” Marturano recalls. “And I thought: What, are you out of mind? We’re going to do what for an hour?’” But six days later, on the last day of the retreat, Marturano found herself walking into the desert at 6am and slipping into a deep meditation. By the time the retreat was over, she didn’t want to leave.She continued meditating daily back home in Minneapolis and noticed some marked improvements in her quality of life. She was more emotionally resilient and more focused at work. But after a few years, she was no longer content to live a dual life. “I was a closet meditator,” she says. It felt unnatural to practise meditation on the side, and go about work just as she always had. She wanted to find a way to fuse the two.Marturano began sounding out potential converts, asking if they too might be interested in discovering ways to train their mind. When Marturano had a critical mass she called up Saki Santorelli, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who had worked with Kabat-Zinn and others on the physiological effects of meditation.Aetna employees who signed up for the company’s mindfulness and yoga programmesTogether Marturano and Santorelli developed a draft curriculum, and in early 2006 they took 13 General Mills executives to a small bed and breakfast in Spicer, Minnesota, for a five-day retreat. Those first 13 students came back to General Mills transformed. “There was quite a buzz when that first group went through,” recalls Beth Gunderson, General Mills’ director of organisation effectiveness. “Everybody wanted it. It started to take on a life of its own.”To date, more than 400 General Mills employees have received the training, as have 250 executives and entrepreneurs from other companies. Marturano has also founded the Institute for Mindful Leadership, a non-profit organisation that aims to train executives from diverse professions. After more than 15 years at General Mills, Marturano will shortly depart to work at the institute full-time, though she still remains deeply involved at General Mills, often returning to campus in her continued attempt to remake an entire company’s culture.…On a hot Tuesday in June, I travelled to Minneapolis to see General Mills’ Mindful Leadership programme in action. Hearing about hundreds of executives meditating and practising yoga is one thing, but seeing the barefooted, mat-toting senior managers walking from their offices with contented grins is another altogether.The two-hour extended session was scheduled to begin at 4pm in a large conference room off the main lobby. As people arrived, many hugged one another and I noticed some tears. General Mills had recently announced its first round of mass layoffs in decades – some attendees were having to fire members of their team, while others were losing their jobs. As participants trickled in, they sought out Marturano and greeted her like an old friend.A circle of 50 or so meditation cushions was already set up, and people gradually settled down, sitting cross-legged or kneeling. They wore loose-fitting clothing and many sported T-shirts featuring General Mills products, including one woman in a bright yellow Cheerios getup. Once the group was seated, Marturano, also sitting in the Lotus position, rang a set of Tibetan prayer bells three times. “Take a posture that for you in this moment embodies dignity and strength,” she said in a slow, sonorous voice. “Allow the body to rest, to step out of busyness, bringing attention to the sensation of each breath.”Sighs rippled through the silence as highly stressed execs let the work day fall away. Marturano instructed the group to keep attention focused on the breath, the first step in basic meditation. The group sat obediently, focusing on the sensation of air going in and out of their nostrils. After a few minutes, she invited them to expand their awareness to the sensations throughout the body.After 30 minutes Marturano rang the bells again. The group stood in unison, moved the cushions to the side of the room and spread yoga mats across the conference room floor. For half an hour Marturano led the room through a series of gentle yoga poses, imploring her audience to focus on the sensations they were experiencing in their bodies.Seated once more, Marturano gave the group an impromptu talk that wove together mindfulness practice, a poem and some General Mills shop talk. Marturano also spoke about the layoffs. “When we’re in any kind of transition in our lives it’s so easy to get into the swirl and get lost,” she told them. “Use this practice to gain stability in the mind. It’s a lonely time, but it’s also a hopeful time.”…General Mills has embraced the Mindful Leadership programme at an institutional level, an unusual but significant move for a very mainstream multinational. Since then, the company’s reputation as a proving ground for corporate leaders has only grown in stature. Leadership Excellence Magazine ranked it the best for developing leaders in 2011, up from 14th in 2010.reduction in employees’ stress levels after one hour of yoga a week (Aetna/Duke University research)The company has even begun research into its efficacy, and the early results are striking. After one of Marturano’s seven-week courses, 83 per cent of participants said they were “taking time each day to optimise my personal productivity” – up from 23 per cent before the course. Eighty-two per cent said they now make time to eliminate tasks with limited productivity value – up from 32 per cent before the course. And among senior executives who took the course, 80 per cent reported a positive change in their ability to make better decisions, while 89 per cent said they became better listeners.Other companies have found that such programmes can generate both health benefits and cost savings. Aetna, partnering with Duke University School of Medicine, found that one hour of yoga a week decreased stress levels in employees by a third, reducing healthcare costs by an average of $2,000 a year.Mike Martiny, General Mills’ chief information officer, began practising with Marturano in 2007 on the recommendation of a team member. He continues to this day, sitting for 30 minutes to an hour, three to four times a week. Martiny says his meditation has enabled him to focus his attention more effectively. “The premise is to be open to what is happening right now,” he says. “There isn’t such a thing as multitasking. What people call multitasking is really shifting attention back and forth between activities very fast.” By choosing what to focus his attention on, and devoting himself to it fully, Martiny’s work has improved. Mindfulness practice has also helped Martiny become more present when spending time with his wife and four teenage children. “If I’m at family event and I’m looking at my phone, I might as well not be there,” he says. “It’s more honest to not be there.”Like almost every executive I talked to, Martiny said he didn’t consider himself a Buddhist. (The one exception was Tan at Google, but even he says Search Inside Yourself is not religious. “Everything can be completely secular,” he says. “There is no religion associated with bringing attention to the breath. Anyone can learn this.”) Marturano is adamant that she, herself, is not a Buddhist. Nor is she troubled by any apparent contradiction around using compassion to breed better capitalists. The goal, she says, is to help each individual live healthier, more productive and peaceful lives, and make them less-stressed workers and better leaders.General Mills’ position in Leadership Excellence magazine’s 2011 ‘Best for Leadership’ rankings (up from 14th in 2010)Yet Marturano acknowledges the roots of her teachings. “I’ve learned a great deal from studying with some wonderful Buddhist teachers over the years,” she says. “I’m very careful to retain the integrity of mindfulness itself. I am certainly not reinventing the wheel.” Nor are General Mills, Google, Aetna or Target trying to convert their employees to some new religion. Instead, it seems that eastern wisdom – stripped of its religiosity and backed by scientific research – is becoming an accepted part of the corporate mainstream.The trend looks set to continue. In addition to Marturano’s institute, Tan from Google has founded the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute, which is also looking to bring the training to other companies. Meanwhile, people such as Muthana from YogaAt.com will continue taking on new clients, including the advertising group Omnicom and the electronics maker NEC.These contradictions – Buddhist teachers who aren’t Buddhists, corporations with spiritual communities, capitalism embracing traditions that shun materialism – are perhaps unsurprising in the modern age. Just as General Mills products are sold around the globe, feeding people from India to Indiana, so too the fundamental tenets of the world’s great religions are freely traded in every corner of the earth. The result is that the people who work hard to make high-margin, low-calorie breakfast cereals are at the same time striving to improve their spiritual equilibrium and even get a taste of enlightenment. “There is no work-life balance,” Marturano says. “We have one life. What’s most important is that you be awake for it.”David Gelles is the FT’s US M&A correspondent"
61;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
62;GIS;General Mills;2012-08-19T16:27:21Z;Food companies fight against GM proposal;;US food and agriculture companies are spending millions of dollars campaigning against a proposal that would force them to reveal their use of genetically modified ingredients.They claim that complying with the law would push up costs, which, they warned, would be passed on to customers.Companies including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills, Monsanto and DuPont have invested $25m to defeat California’s Proposition 37.Corn, soyabeans and canola are among the ingredients derived from genetically engineered seeds to make them more resistant to pests and extreme climates. Companies are fearful that they will no longer be able to market their products as “natural” and that if voters in California pass the law in November, other states will follow.“It will have a very negative impact and higher costs,” said Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the “No on 37” campaign opposing the law. “It’s based on fear not on fact.”The US has no federal law on labelling of genetically modified foods. European countries angered US companies a decade ago when they started imposing strict labelling requirements.Coke and Pepsi, the US beverage companies, which have combined to spend $1m to oppose the California law, declined to comment but are being represented by the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association, which opposes the proposal.“This poorly written measure will mandate that our companies provide misleading and confusing information to customers,” said Brian Kennedy, a GMA spokesman.The group argues that companies will have to either begin using organic ingredients or alter their packaging production for California. Either solution will add costs that will be passed on to consumers.Monsanto and DuPont, two of the world’s biggest manufacturers of genetically modified seeds, have been the biggest contributors to the campaign to defeat the proposal, donating $4.2m and $4m respectively.Monsanto refused to comment to the Financial Times beyond a blog post, in which the company argued that “consumers have broad food choices today, but could be denied these choices if Prop 37 prevails.“Proponents of the California labelling proposal are misleading people about the safety of food in the marketplace,” the blog states.“Beneath their right to know slogan is a deceptive marketing campaign aimed at stigmatising modern food production.”Meanwhile, DuPont would only say that it “complies with each country’s labelling requirements of biotech-derived products and believes in all cases the label should be verifiable, non-discriminatory and not misleading”.The US Food and Drug Administration and the American Medical Association have not found evidence showing that genetically engineered food products are harmful. However, supporters of the law argue that companies are being untruthful about what is in their products and that the long-term effects of genetic engineering of crops have not been studied.“The giant pesticide and food companies are afraid of the mothers and grandmothers who want the right to know what’s in our food,” said Stacy Malkan, of California Right to Know.
63;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;China turns to frozen dumplings;;Frozen dumpling sales are growing rapidly in China as rising labour costs and the increasing ranks of working mothers have made it too time-consuming to fill and fold them from scratch.General Mills, the US food company, is the leading frozen dumpling maker in China, with its popular Wanchai Ferry brand accounting for 44 per cent of the market. Gary Chu, head of General Mills’ China business, said that dumpling sales are growing at double-digit rates annually and topped $200m last year.“People used to make dumplings at home but now nobody has the time because it’s messy,” Mr Chu told the Financial Times. “Today’s woman doesn’t want to cook any more.”Mr Chu said that dumpling shops and restaurants are also increasingly switching to frozen fare due to rising minimum wages across China. Last year most Chinese provinces increased minimum wages by more than 20 per cent.“Labour is too expensive,” Mr Chu said. “China is not cheap any more and you cannot tell the difference between frozen and fresh.”Wanchai Ferry has expanded its frozen dumpling offerings with other frozen dim sum-style items such as wontons and tangyuan, a glutinous rice dessert that is traditionally filled with a sweet paste.General Mills acquired Wanchai Ferry in 1997, nearly 20 years after Chong Kin-wo began selling her homemade dumplings from a wooden cart at the Wanchai ferry pier in Hong Kong. According to a 2010 survey by BrandZ, a consultancy, 28 per cent of Chinese in the top 10 cities prefer Wanchai Ferry dumplings.Mr Chu said that in spite of the success of Wanchai Ferry, the company is facing stronger competition from local brands that have improved their quality. Meanwhile, he said, the Chinese government has been getting tougher on foreign companies and targeting them over health concerns.Last year Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings were pulled from supermarket shelves in Nanjing after health officials found bacteria in the product that they said could be life-threatening.“Foreign brand privilege is going away,” Mr Chu said. “The country is getting more and more competitive.”General Mills generated $550m in net sales from China last year and projects that number will reach $900m by 2015. Mr Chu said signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy were a real concern but that the country’s one-party system had made it possible for the government to react quickly.“China won’t be like Europe,” Mr Chu said.General Mills is looking beyond frozen food in China, increasing marketing of its Bugles crisps and premium Häagen-Dazs ice cream. Mr Chu said that the company is also developing plans to introduce its yoghurt brands to the market.
64;GIS;General Mills;2012-06-27T18:20:21Z;General Mills targets China with yoghurt;;General Mills, the US food company, is developing plans to launch its yoghurt brands in China as it struggles to keep up with rivals in the US.“We’re looking at new markets where yoghurt is not as developed, with China being the first stop,” Don Mulligan, chief financial officer of General Mills, told the Financial Times.Mr Mulligan said that yoghurt was already an existing category in China, but that it was usually consumed as a drink. The company, which also sells Cheerios cereal and Progresso soups, hopes to introduce new varieties of yoghurt to the Chinese diet.General Mills is investing heavily in emerging markets and in its Greek yoghurt brands in the US, where market leader Chobani continues to dominate in spite of aggressive efforts from bigger competitors. The company has been under pressure to make gains in the fast-growing Greek yoghurt category after a deal last year to acquire half of Yoplait, the French yoghurt manufacturer, for $1.15bn.Last month General Mills made another move to establish itself in an important emerging market with the acquisition of Yoki, a Brazilian food company, for $875m.Investors have been pushing General Mills to look for new sources of growth amid the sluggish US economy, but those investments could prove to be a drag on the company’s profits next year. General Mills released a disappointing earnings outlook for 2013 as it reported its fourth-quarter and full-year results on Wednesday.Fourth-quarter net earnings rose 8 per cent year-on-year to $325.4m, or 49 cents a share, as revenues increased 11.9 per cent to $4bn.Shares of General Mills slipped 1.6 per cent to $37.55 by the close of trade.
65;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Smucker’s: jelly good show;That funny name seems to motivate, generating predictable results as the food company has done yet again;The old advertising slogan for the JM Smucker Company’s namesake jelly was “with a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good.” Parodists had a field day. Saturday Night Live pointed out that by that logic, a really excellent jelly would be called “mangled baby ducks.”The slogan applies perfectly well to the company’s leadership, though. The chief executive of the food company, which now sells much more coffee than jam, is Richard Smucker. His brother Timothy is chair of the board. Their nephew runs the US retail foods division. Timothy’s son runs the coffee business. And these Smuckers have been very good at running things.A publicly traded company that is managed and overseen by a founding family (and has a voting structure that ovewhelmingly favours long-term owners) should, in theory, be hostile to minority shareholders. At very least, one might expect the shares to trade at a discount. Yet over the long term Smucker’s has easily outperformed the broad market, consumers staples stocks, and all of its big peers, from Nestle to Kraft. It has returned 203 per cent over10 years. The runner up is General Mills, at 122 per cent.The secret ingredient is no secret at all. Generating very predictable results over time – as it did yet again on Thursday – gets rewarded by the market, especially in a period as turbulent as the last decade. Revenues fell by less than a percent during the worst of the financial crisis. Free cash flow ticks up steadily and a little under half of it is spent on dividends. The company periodically makes significant acquisitions (at least $5.6bn worth since 2000, including the $2.9bn purchase of Folgers coffee four years ago, according to Dealogic), but promptly pays down the associated debt, bringing leverage ratios down to low levels quickly. That funny name, it seems, motivates.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
66;GIS;General Mills;2012-06-03T23:37:28Z;Sights set on the global stage;The dean of the Carlson school believes that its proximity to multinational companies will help lift its profile;"Appointing one female dean might be an accident; appoint two and it begins to look like a policy. It is an argument that is rapidly dismissed by Srilata Zaheer, the newly appointed dean of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, who succeeded Alison Davis-Blake this year.Her riposte is dismissive: “It’s a non-issue for us”. If there were two consecutive male deans at a business school no one would question it, she says.Perhaps the biggest surprise about Prof Zaheer, however, is not that she is one of a small number of female business school deans, but that she became a high-flying academic at all.“I’m a bit of an accidental dean,” she confesses. Indeed, after she graduated from IIM Ahmedabad’s post-graduate programme in her native India, she decided to became a business journalist and a businesswomen. It was only when she was working in Nigeria that she began teaching in a local university there – and loved it. As a result she enrolled for a PhD at MIT Sloan. That was more than 20 years ago and she has not looked back.Now the top dog at Carlson, Prof Zaheer’s has nailed her colours to the mast. “My charge is to make the school a global brand.”At first glance this is a tall order for a school located right in the heart of North America, in Minneapolis. But Prof Zaheer is undaunted. Minneapolis is the third-largest finance centre in the US, she points out, and home to some great global brands, such as General Mills, 3M and Cargill.“They are global companies in our back yard,” she insists. “Our school has very strong relationships with these companies.”Executives from the companies are regular visitors to the school, she says, and the proximity of these companies also means high rates of employment for graduates, with 97 per cent of the full-time students from the class of 2011 holding an offer within 90 days of graduation (although just 88 per cent accepted the offer within the same timeframe).This year the dean expects the numbers to look even better, with hiring statistics tracking 20 per cent ahead of the figures for the same period a year ago.There have been several attempts by Carlson in recent years to build global outreach, largely through the Executive MBA programmes for working managers that it has established with business schools in Poland, Austria and Guangzhou, China. The dean is hoping to launch a further programme in India in 2013. As a result there are Carlson alumni living in 78 countries, Prof Zaheer adds proudly, and she intends to visit as many as she can.“I’m not sure I’ll get to all 78 countries, but I’ll try.”It is hard to doubt the determination of the 58-year-old dean. Nonetheless, there is much to detract from her vision of a truly global business school. Just 24 per cent of enrolled full-time MBA students come from outside the US, from 16 countries, and although there are alumni living in 78 countries, 85 per cent of last year’s class stayed in the US Midwest on graduation. Of the living alumni of the school, more than half (52 per cent) live in the twin cities of Minneapolis-St Paul.…And like all state universities in the US and beyond, funding is increasingly an issue. These days Carlson receives just a tiny fraction of its income from the state and Prof Zaheer acknowledges that “we’re going to have to think much more like a private school in terms of raising our endowment”.However, the big local companies that provide jobs may yet prove to be an ally in Carlson’s efforts to become global, if only in a small way. Many of them are now planning to invest in, or expand, their overseas operations and so are hoping that the Carlson school can provide MBA graduates who come from outside the US and who would like to return to their home countries, such as China, India and Brazil, after a couple of years in Minneapolis.And Prof Zaheer’s focus is clear. “One of our challenges,” she says, “has been to go and tell our story.” She has certainly made a head-start with that."
67;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;General Mills goes Brazilian;;"Brazil’s economy may have lost some of its shine recently but it’s still the “bola da vez” (“flavour of the month”) among global consumer companies, it seems.General Mills’ R$1.75bn ($857m) purchase of Brazilian food company Yoki on Thursday is a model example.Only two days previously the US food giant, whose brands include Cheerios cereal, said it would cut 850 jobs. About half the redundancies would be in Minneapolis, where General Mills is based.Slow growth in the US and high commodity costs have recently hit profits at the group.But the next announcement the company made was that it had just signed an agreement to acquire Yoki Alimentos, a family-owned company in São Bernardo do Campo, an industrial city in São Paulo state.Yoki, which is famous in Brazil for its brands of flour and popcorn, employs about 5,000 people and last year made sales of around R$1.1bn.This from General Mills:As one of the biggest and fastest-growing economies in the world, Brazil is an attractive consumer market. A majority of its 200 million people now belong to the middle class and domestic consumption has become an important economic growth driver.Some might disagree with General Mills’ assessment of Brazil as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world – it has stagnated for months and grew less than Germany last year. Just as it took a while for international companies to wake up to Brazil’s boom, perhaps it will also take them some time to wake up to its slowdown?On the other hand, such optimism could be put down to the “growth mismatch” economists see in Brazil. While the economy as a whole has slowed sharply, parts of the consumer market still resemble the booming Brazil investors fell in love with in 2010.Related reading:

68;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;General Mills to cut 850 jobs;;General Mills, the US food company, said that it would cut about 850 jobs, or 2.4 per cent of its workforce, as it looks to slash costs.The move is part of a global restructuring plan that General Mills said on Tuesday would improve its efficiency and allow it to reinvest in high-growth products.“Savings from these restructuring actions will be reinvested to support the company’s future growth strategies and to accelerate innovation across General Mills global business platforms,” the company said in a statement.The job cuts will be spread across General Mills’ global operations and the company will take a $109m charge as part of the restructuring.General Mills has been battling slow growth in the US along with high commodity costs. In March Ken Powell, the company’s chief executive, said: “Fiscal 2012 has represented a challenging operating environment, with the highest level of commodity inflation that we’ve seen in 30 years.”General Mills, which makes Cheerios cereal and Progresso soups, is working on new product innovations and hopes to expand its presence in the booming Greek yoghurt market, where it has lagged behind upstart competitors.Shares of General Mills rose 0.1 per cent to $38.58 in early afternoon trading.
69;GIS;General Mills;2012-05-03T18:57:04Z;Bright Food / Weetabix;Chinese buyer forks out £1.1bn for cereal maker;Some people hate the fact that Weetabix goes soggy in milk. But not Chinese food and retail group Bright Food, which on Thursday agreed to buy a majority stake in the UK cereal group from private equity fund Lion Capital.Details are sketchy, but Bright Food is buying 60 per cent of Weetabix and assuming its £900m of debt. Based on an enterprise value of £1.2bn, the Chinese buyer is forking out £1.1bn. That puts Weetabix on an EV multiple of 10 times trailing earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation, the same as Kellogg and General Mills, which dominate the global cereal market. Granted, Bright Food is buying a high-margin business. Weetabix’s ebitda margin of 27 per cent is 9 percentage points more than Kellogg’s. But compared to the latter, the British group makes only a handful of basic cereal products.Nor is this a buyer-led turnround story. Weetabix’s management will stay put and Bright Food will add cereal to its portfolio of candy and milk. It will also try to sell Weetabix in China. Good luck. It might have 1.3bn mouths to feed, but there is little appetite for breakfast cereal. Even if some Chinese ditch rice porridge and soya milk and start the day with cereal, the market will grow only an average 7 per cent annually for the next five years to $244m, Euromonitor estimates – equivalent to only 2 per cent of the whole European market.Put another way, even if Weetabix captures 3 per cent of China’s cereal market by 2016 (half Kellogg’s share today), it will add just £5m in annual sales. Weetabix will face stiff rivalry from Nestlé, which has captured a third of China’s cereal market by convincing rich mums that their little emperors should graduate to cereal when they have grown out of powdered milk. The deal adds one-sixth to Bright Food’s ebitda, but it still needs to make it pay its way.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
70;GIS;General Mills;2012-04-22T16:23:09Z;Lion Capital explores Weetabix sale;;Lion Capital is exploring a sale of Weetabix to China’s state-backed Bright Food in a potential deal that would value the British breakfast cereal maker at £1bn.Weetabix’s private equity owner has been in talks with the Shanghai-based group for several weeks about a possible sale of the producer of Ready Brek and Alpen cereals, people close to the situation said.The negotiations started only shortly after Lion Capital late last year refinanced the £900m debt load of the food company.The private equity group, which declined to comment, has already made more than three times its initial equity investment since it bought the British household brand eight years ago thanks to several dividends paid.It remained unclear how advanced the negotiations are or how likely a deal will be. Lion Capital has in the past been reluctant to sell the business unless a potential buyer would be willing to pay a high price.Bright Food, one of China’s biggest food groups with annual turnover of more than £4bn, has a history of failed takeovers.The group, which could not be reached for comment, walked away from talks to buy United Biscuits, the UK maker of Jaffa Cakes and Hula Hoops two years ago.In the same year, it launched an unsuccessful attempt to buy Sucrogen, the sugar and biofuels unit of Australia’s CSR. Last year it lost out to General Mills in the sale of a stake in French yoghurt maker Yoplait.But last August it succeeded in snapping up a 75 per cent stake in Australia’s Manassen Foods for US$556m including debt.The talks to sell 80-year-old Weetabix come as private equity groups are looking to sell some of the well-known food brands they bought before the financial crisis.Weetabix is the second-largest branded manufacturer by value of ready-to-eat cereals and cereal bars in the UK. Its Weetabix brand accounts for 7 per cent of the country’s total cereal sales.The company produces 70m of its cereal biscuits every week at a plant in Kettering in Northamptonshire. It has operations in North America, South Africa, Germany and Spain and exports to more than 80 countries around the world.The group employs 2,000 people and generated revenues of £449m in 2010, the most recent year for which it has given a financial statement.Its pre-tax profit came in at £20.4m in the same year, up from £4.3m in 2009.
71;GIS;General Mills;2012-03-30T17:13:24Z;J&D’s Foods wants slice of coffin market;;No, it is not an April Fool’s joke. J&D’s Foods, the Seattle-based makers of bacon salt and bacon mayonnaise, have launched a bacon-themed coffin. The move is not only a PR stunt for generating sales of bacon-flavoured foods, but also an unconventional entry into the market for customised caskets.Casket sales in the US have been on a steady decline since 2000, between 5 and 8 per cent per year, due mainly to the increased rates of cremation. But funeral industry experts believe the trend may shift as the baby boomer generation demands personalised funeral accessories that reflect their preferences and lifestyles.“Anything that is unique and highly customised is going to have an advantage over mass-produced caskets,” said Mark Allen, former chief executive of the Casket and Funeral Supply Association of America. “We’re all such individuals and we live in a culture where we want to be unique, we strive for that, and I think funeral service is no exception.”J&D’s Foods is selling its bacon coffin – a steel coffin the founders bought at wholesaler Costco and had professionally wrapped in a pink and red sheath – for $3,000. The company received one order on the first day of sales on Thursday, and plans to continue selling them indefinitely.But the main goal of the coffin sale is to draw attention to the company’s line of edible bacon products. Online sales for those tripled on Thursday.The company, founded in 2007, has made a tradition of staging April Fool’s Day jokes in recent years, by launching spoof products such as bacon lip balm or bacon soda at the same time as its more conventional products like baconnaise or bacon popcorn. Last year the company joked that it was making a bacon-flavoured sexual lubricant, as a way to gain attention for its bacon croutons, only to have customers demand that they actually make it. They have since sold 20,000 tubes.“I can’t compete with General Mills or Kraft on manufacturing cost,” said Justin Esch, co-founder with David Lefkow of J&D’s Foods, “so I have to be creative with marketing”.Referring to the pair’s appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show when they introduced bacon lip balm, he added: “If Oprah puts Dave and me on just to talk about bacon mayonnaise, it’s interesting. But if we talk about bacon lip balm, it’s hilarious, and it makes for good TV.”
72;GIS;General Mills;2012-03-23T14:20:41Z;Letter from Lex: Spring bounce;The vernal equinox has given some a renewed sense of vigour;The vernal equinox has given some a spring in their step. Apple shareholders had more bounce than most after the company announced plans to pay its first dividend in 17 years returning $45bn over the next three years. Other tech companies are not faring so well: Japan’s Sharp needs to think about diversifying away from flat screen TVs if it is to raise its performance to the level of its peers and India’s Tech Mahindra and Satyam will still lack the scale of their rivals after their merger to create the country’s fifth largest outsourcing group. UK banking software group Misys did better with a £1.2bn offer from private equity firm Vista.Resource and trading companies are searching for renewed vigour. Glencore boosted its presence in Canada and agriculture with the $6.1bn acquisition of grain trader Viterra. India’s Anil Agarwal was adding to the opaque mining businesses of his Vedanta Resources. Russian oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Vladimir Potanin do not seem to be running out of energy in their long-running spat over Norilsk Nickel, 30 per cent owned by Rusal, whose shares have halved since its Hong Kong listing in January 2010.The good news is that consumers seem to have found a new resilience. Luxury groups Hermès and Tiffany have both done well in the US as the middle classes benefit from low mortgage rates while Chinese shoppers now spend $40bn per year on shoes from the likes of Belle International and Daphne despite having to pay more for fuel after the biggest price rise in three years. Americans are also eating plenty of burgers from McDonald’s, whose chief executive stepped down, leaving the company in robust health. They are also eating too much Greek yoghurt for the liking of General Mills, which has lost out as the food has captured one-quarter of the $4bn US market in four years.Finally, Italy’s web of banking, political and corporate interests that exercises power through cross-shareholdings, nods and winks could do with a thorough Spring clean. If any more evidence were required, an investor only need look at its increasingly threadbare stock market and the convoluted planned 4-way merger of some of its insurers. Hopefully the better weather will not distract Prime Minister Mario Monti from his much-needed labour market reforms.John Casey, Lex Publisher
73;GIS;General Mills;2012-03-21T23:19:14Z;General Mills to push harder on Greek yoghurt;;General Mills has vowed to make a more aggressive push into the fast-growing Greek yoghurt market after failing to make up ground against upstart competitors.“We clearly don’t have our fair share in that segment,” said Ken Powell, chief executive of the US food company. “We want to get that.”Mr Powell said a “broad array” of yoghurt innovations would be announced in June, noting that the yoghurt market was growing by about 10 per cent a year, driven by the thicker, richer Greek brands.General Mills said that during its third quarter net sales in its Yoplait yoghurt division fell 3 per cent from the previous year. Gains from Go-Gurt, Yoplait Greek and Mountain High offset declines in its more established brands.Investors have been concerned about a lack of yoghurt innovation at General Mills, which makes Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice cream.“Chobani continues to move across the country. They’re expanding capacity on the west coast, so they certainly remain a threat,” said David Palmer, analyst at UBS. “So my hope for Yoplait is that you could introduce a new platform that could perhaps seize the news from the Greek segment …and bend the trend in market share.”General Mills finalised its acquisition of Yoplait in July last year but has failed to gain Greek yoghurt market share from Chobani, Fage and Danone.“Our goal is to stabilise and return the entire Yoplait business to growth,” Mr Powell said.Net sales at General Mills rose 13 per cent year-on-year to $4.1bn during the third quarter, while the company’s net income slipped 0.2 per cent to $391.5m, or 58 cents a share.The company’s shares fell 0.46 per cent to $38.58.
74;GIS;General Mills;2012-03-21T20:16:44Z;General Mills: yoghurt is all Greek to me;The foodmaker is suffering because it missed the boat on the Greek yoghurt craze;Executives once had to decide whether yo-yos represented a permanent shift in how people spent their time, or were merely a short-term craze. So too for the internet and now social networking. Picking a fad from a genuine game-changer is difficult at the best of times, but that is the position in which General Mills finds itself regarding American yoghurt. On Wednesday, the US foodmaker announced that its third-quarter earnings per share fell 2 per cent compared with the same period last year. A key reason behind the drop was a 3 per cent decline in its US yoghurt sales.The cause of the slump is the extraordinary growth in consumption of Greek yoghurt in the US which has cannibalised the sales of General Mills’ traditional dairy lines. In the last four years, thick, high protein Greek-style yoghurt has grown from almost nothing to comprise about one-quarter of a US market worth at least $4bn annually. That is bad timing for General Mills. Only last July, the company finalised the acquisition of Yoplait. The yoghurt-maker introduced new Greek-style products late last year, but it has only managed to eke out a 5 per cent share of the market, trailing well behind Chobani, Fage, and Danone, estimates Citigroup.That leaves General Mills in a tricky situation. To improve its position it needs to invest heavily in advertising. Yet last quarter, marketing spend rose by less than two-thirds the rate of sales. Boosting it further will depress gross margins which last quarter fell almost 3 percentage points to about 37 per cent compared with the prior year. It may be best for General Mills to accept it has missed the Greek boat and that spending the huge amount of cash it will require to catch up when its margins are falling may be a futile exercise. So whether Greek yoghurt is merely a craze or is here to stay, is almost besides the point.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
75;GIS;General Mills;2012-03-04T19:12:53Z;US food groups tailor recipes to Hispanics;;Food companies are increasingly targeting Hispanics as a local “emerging market” as they look for new ways to increase sales in the sluggish US.Products such as spicy “Tapatio” flavoured crisps, “Dulce de Leche” Cheerios and Manzanita Sol, a sparkling apple drink, are meant to lure Hispanic customers with familiar flavours. Meanwhile, analysts say these products, which are usually tested in regional markets, are becoming more mainstream in the general market and expanding the range of American palates.Executives at groups such as Kraft, General Mills and PepsiCo said during a recent industry conference that they were stepping up their efforts to reach Hispanics with tailored products and additional advertising investment. Companies are seeking to bring their experience driving fast revenue growth overseas to the US.Tony Vernon, who will take over as chief executive at Kraft, told the Financial Times that the US grocery company will increase its spending on Hispanic advertising by “double-digits” this year, after tripling its investment in 2011. He says Kraft launched seven new Latino campaigns last year and that most of the advertising budget for Kool-Aid was directed at Hispanics.“They are the largest group that we should be targeting,” Mr Vernon says, referring to the growing Hispanic population.Ken Powell, chief executive of General Mills, the US cereal company, says that Hispanics are especially valuable because of their greater propensity for cooking and eating at home.He projects that 40 per cent of US households will be “multicultural” by 2020, making Hispanics an important target.“We’re introducing these consumers to our brands and they are rewarding us with very strong growth,” Mr Powell says.Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group in the US, accounting for 16 per cent of the population, according to the 2010 US census. The Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies says the top 500 US advertisers increased spending targeted at Hispanics by 14 per cent to $4.3bn in 2010, the most recent year that data were available.Consumer and food companies were among the biggest spenders, increasing their overall Hispanic advertising to $707m. Restaurants and fast-food chains also increased their targeting of Hispanics, raising their spending 30 per cent to $301m.Credit Suisse recently found that Hispanic consumers represent an especially rich vein because their household food spending is projected to rise by 5.7 per cent during the next decade, compared with just 2.5 per cent for non-Hispanic households.“This demographic group is a marketer’s dream because Hispanic per capita income is growing, the consumers tend to be very brand loyal and they are very engaged shoppers,” says Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse.Companies such as Coca-Cola, General Mills and Kellogg, which have been dedicating the most significant resources to Hispanic marketing, have reaped the biggest benefits. Credit Suisse finds that Hispanic marketing “leaders” have outperformed “laggards” by 270 basis points in terms of organic US sales growth in the last three years.Many of those laggards are now trying to make up lost ground. PepsiCo, which spent 1 per cent of its advertising budget on Hispanic marketing in 2010, hired a new cultural branding specialist and doubled its spending on Hispanic programmes last year.“We’re putting a huge amount of resources and attention into the actual marketplace,” says Javier Farfan, PepsiCo’s director of cultural branding. “You have to start investing to speak to the community, and with the right products in place.”PepsiCo chose Sofia Vergara, the Colombian actress, as the new face of Diet Pepsi and featured her in a Super Bowl commercial. It has also recently been sponsoring programming on Univision, a top Latino television station, and has launched Spanish soccer-themed ads.According to Mr Moskow, companies need to be careful because as Hispanics become wealthier and more bicultural, their consumption habits change.“The profile of the Hispanic consumer will evolve,” he says. “The companies that are just starting to do the work to understand the consumers are going to have the toughest time adjusting to their evolving tastes.”Additional reporting by David Gelles
76;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US food groups develop taste for Greek yoghurt;;US food companies are gearing for battle in the market for Greek-style yoghurt, with big groups such as General Mills and Dannon looking to catch up with the start-ups that made the category mainstream.The Greek culinary export is thicker, richer and packed with more protein than the yoghurt traditionally favoured by Americans, and it has become wildly popular as US consumers seek healthier eating options.A staple of European diets, Greek yoghurt developed a cult following in the US five years ago and has recently become a craze, with the market doubling in the last year to more than $1bn in sales, according to Citigroup.“Yoghurt is simple and natural and has been one of the most nutritious products across cultures,” Hamdi Ulukaya, founder and chief executive of Chobani, the leading Greek yoghurt company in the US, told the Financial Times. “Health consciousness is up, but choices are still limited.”Chobani has been at the forefront of the trend. The company opened in upstate New York inside an old Kraft factory in 2007, hiring a handful of people just as the US economy was on the brink of turmoil. Now it has nearly 1,000 employees and annual sales of about $700m.According to research from Citigroup, Greek yoghurt accounted for just 1 per cent of the overall US yoghurt in 2007 and now accounts for a quarter of the market. Chobani dominates the category, with 53 per cent market share, followed by rival Fage, which has 17 per cent. Big players such as Dannon and General Mills trail with only 14 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.“This trend has been driven by smaller companies and has caught the major US yoghurt manufacturers flat-footed,” said David Driscoll, analyst at Citigroup, who reduced his earnings estimate for General Mills because its yoghurt sales have been declining.Executives of Dannon, which is owned by France’s Danone, said in September that the company did not anticipate the speed with which Greek yoghurt would catch on, and acknowledged that such products were “cannibalising” other types of yoghurt. The company has since stepped up marketing of its Greek yoghurt.Don Mulligan, chief financial officer of General Mills, told the Financial Times that it would look to use its recent acquisition of Yoplait to make faster progress with its Greek yoghurt products. “There’s going to be other ways into Greek and we have a robust pipeline to drive growth in the category,” he said.Chobani, which investment bankers suggest could be an attractive target for big food conglomerates, is opening new yoghurt factories across the US and expanding overseas to Australia as it attempts to keep up with demand.“It’s an answer to a lot of questions,” said Mr Ulukaya, who is Turkish, when explaining the popularity of his yoghurt. “It’s a snack, it’s a meal, it’s protein.”Mr Driscoll said that Greek yoghurt had evolved from being a fad into a long-term trend.“I think the battle will be over new products and new varieties and flavours,” he said. “It’s going to be a very competitive marketplace.”
77;GIS;General Mills;2011-12-20T19:16:17Z;US food groups struggle with costs;;US food companies are continuing to grapple with high costs of raw ingredients, while the challenges of passing on price increases are eating into profit margins.ConAgra and General Mills, two of the largest US consumer packaged goods companies by revenues, said on Tuesday their second quarter net incomes fell in spite of rising sales.Although the US economy has shown signs of life recently, the stubbornly high unemployment rate has made price increases difficult for customers to swallow. Commodities costs have come down from their recent peaks, but food prices remain high.According to the US labour department, grocery store prices were up 5.9 per cent in November from the same month a year ago.Gary Rodkin, chief executive of ConAgra, said: “The marketplace environment remains difficult due to continuing inflationary pressures and the impact of the current economy on consumers, so we are cautious about business conditions.”Net income at ConAgra, which makes brands such as Slim Jim and Chef Boyardee, fell 13.4 per cent year-on-year to $174.7m, or 41 cents a share, as sales rose 8.1 per cent to $3.4bn. Operating profits were supported by the company’s commercial food business, while profits from consumer foods declined.Shares of ConAgra rose 4.37 per cent to $26.27 in midday trading, as the results exceeded estimates of Wall Street analysts.Shares of General Mills slipped 2.12 per cent to $38.75 after it reported a 27.5 per cent fall in its second quarter net income. Net sales were up 13.7 per cent to $4.6bn.The maker of Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice cream said that “significantly higher input costs pressured our profit margins”. General Mills maintained its earnings outlook for next year and said it has finished implementing the price increases that it announced earlier this year.Don Nelson, chief financial officer of General Mills, said he believes its performance will improve in 2012 as consumers use food “as a small indulgence to fight frugality fatigue”.General Mills said it was planning to announce innovations aimed at increasing its market share in the Greek yoghurt category, which was bolstered by last summer’s acquisition of Yoplait, and that it has looked into launching its yoghurt products in China, where the $4.5bn market is growing by more than 10 per cent year-on-year.
78;GIS;General Mills;2011-10-12T12:30:43Z;Pepsi executives resist calls for split;;PepsiCo executives defended the company’s structure on Wednesday, rebuffing suggestions from analysts that it would be better off splitting up.Speculation that Pepsi is ripe for a split began last summer after Kraft announced that it was spinning off its North American grocery unit and making its snacks business into a standalone company. That move appeared to be an about-face for Kraft, following several other high-profile splits this year, and raised questions about Pepsi’s future.“I firmly believe that PepsiCo’s value is maximised as one company,” said Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive. “It was created as an integrated snack and beverage business and its success is tied to this combination. This has been true in the past and will remain in the future.”Last month, analysts at Bernstein Research said that splitting Pepsi into separate food and beverage companies could make strategic sense and that Kraft, General Mills, Kellogg and even Coca-Cola could be potential bidders for the snacks portfolio. Analysts Edward Jones & Co said that if Pepsi imitated Kraft’s split, the individual companies would be more valuable, with shareholders standing to gain 49 per cent.Hugh Johnston, Pepsi’s chief financial officer, said the company is “extremely shareholder oriented” and is “turning over every stone” to unlock shareholder value, but that splitting would create additional costs without clear benefits. He said that in emerging markets, the snacks business benefits from the scale and local knowledge of the beverage business, and that in the US, the divisions share back-office operations and research and development.The comments came as Pepsi announced third-quarter profits that rose as sales in emerging markets offset its flat US beverage business.Net income at Pepsi rose 4 per cent from a year ago to $2bn, or $1.25 a share, on revenues 13 per cent higher at $17.58bn. The results beat analyst expectations and Pepsi’s shares rose 2.38 per cent to $62.40 in mid-morning New York trading.Pepsi maintained its 2011 target for high single-digit earnings per share growth.Sales volume growth was strong in Europe and Asia, but North America remained a weak spot for Pepsi’s food and beverage businesses. Sales volume for the US food business rose 1 per cent and sales in the US beverage division were unchanged from a year ago.Analysts have warned that the rest of the year could be challenging for US beverage companies as they lose foreign exchange benefits and cope with volatile commodity prices and a weak economy.On Wednesday Pepsi said carbonated beverage sales continued to fall in the US, but that it experienced an uptick in overall beverage market share and that Gatorade was showing solid growth.During the past three months, Pepsi shook up its marketing team and reshuffled its beverage unit in an effort to jump-start sales and regain some of the market share it has been losing to rival Coca-Cola.
79;GIS;General Mills;2011-09-21T16:37:06Z;General Mills boosted by ‘resilient’ demand;;General Mills, the US food company, said it was seeing “resilient” consumer demand for its products as it reported a jump in first-quarter net sales.The maker of Cheerios and Progresso soups said on Wednesday that sales rose 9 per cent year on year to $3.85bn, as increased advertising investment and its Yoplait acquisition provided a boost.However, elevated raw material costs continue to chip away at General Mills’s profit margins. Net earnings fell 14.1 per cent to $405.6m, or 63 cents a share, down from $472.1m, or 70 cents, in the same period a year ago.“This reflects good net price realisation, resilient consumer demand for our established products, and good early response to new items launched during the quarter,” said Ken Powell, chief executive.Analysts at Barclays Capital said the results could provide some comfort to investors who have become increasingly jittery due to cautious commentary from packaged food companies.General Mills maintained its 2012 earnings outlook and its share rose 3.73 per cent to $38.89 in mid-morning trading on Wednesday. The company has said it expects its raw material costs to rise by up to 11 per cent this year and that it has introduced price increases to pass some of this on to consumers.General Mills could get some relief from commodity costs from a strengthening US dollar. Don Mulligan, chief financial officer, said that a stronger dollar could have a “dampening” effect on inflation.Mr Powell told the Financial Times in an interview that the company was working to be more innovative and productive to blunt rising costs. In spite of signs of consumer interest in new products, he said that US consumers continue to be cautious.“There are encouraging signals we’re seeing,” he said, noting strong appetite for new flavours of its Hamburger Helper and its frozen breakfast offerings. “But we still have a consumer who is planning her shopping trips and is looking for value.”US sales rose 3 per cent to $2.51bn during the first quarter while international sales showed growing strength, rising 30 per cent to $856m. Joint ventures in Japan performed well, with sales growing despite the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami this year.The results from General Mills followed a disappointing performance on Tuesday from rival ConAgra, which reported a 42 per cent year-on-year drop in net income due to raw material costs.
80;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Olympic sponsors seek podium for brands;;"Nature Valley, a cereal bar brand owned by General Mills, joined the likes of Coca-Cola and Samsung as an Olympic sponsor this week, paying an undisclosed sum to ensure that athletes, volunteers and spectators consume its snacks when the London 2012 games are under way.For Paul Deighton, chief executive of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Locog), the deal is another small step on the route to his target of raising £700m from domestic sponsorship. He says that the draw of the Olympics is simple: “It’s the ultimate feel-good association”.The question for Nature Valley, and the other Olympic sponsors, is how to turn this “feel-good association” into more concrete measures of revenue and profit. The investment required is a significant one – tier one domestic sponsors of London 2012 pay £50m on average, and worldwide Olympic partners about $100m (£61m)Olympic organisers are quick to point out that not all sponsors pay cash. Some agreements represent value-in-kind services and many are a combination of the two.Mr Deighton highlights three key attractions for companies: it differentiates them from their competitors; provides a global stage to demonstrate their capabilities; and provides a recruitment and motivational tool for employees.Both domestic and global sponsors are guaranteed exclusivity in their business category, and have the right to use the Olympic rings and the London 2012 logo in their marketing campaigns.For companies which supply services to other businesses, which account for about half of the 54 Olympic and Paralympic sponsors, the Olympics is “the perfect stage where they can demonstrate their own capability,” said Mr Deighton.Atos Origin, the France-based IT services provider became a worldwide Olympic partner in 1999 and is co-ordinating the technology behind the London games.Patrick Adiba, its head of major events, said the Olympics enables the company to illustrate the breadth of its expertise. “We showcase to our clients what we do to prepare for the games, how we manage the technology and information systems,” he said.He added that partnering with the Olympics also helps Atos to attract young talent and retain employees: “Our people are proud to be involved in the Olympics and, beyond that, it’s a fantastic accelerator of sales.”But sponsorship is not for everyone. Tim Crow, chief executive of sports marketing consultancy Synergy, said that of 30 companies that approached Synergy about becoming a 2012 sponsor, they advised 27 not to pursue it.“The reason for [signing up] is to generate brand and business value so really the skill of it is, having got all of that equity, how do you use it to accelerate your brand and your business,” he said.Sponsors are partly restricted by IOC rules that prohibit advertising in Olympic venues. “The reality with the Olympics is actually you don’t get a lot compared to the equivalent for the World Cup, in terms of media exposure,” said Mr Crow.Ultimately sponsors must find a way to “activate” their deals to generate a return for their business.Lloyds TSB signed up early, becoming the first tier one domestic sponsor in 2007 in a deal estimated at £80m – and insists it has been worthwhile.“Throughout the financial crisis there were still excellent opportunities for companies to win contracts through the games and through our partnership we’ve been able to help those companies,” said Gordon Lott, head of Lloyds’ 2012 partnership.Lloyds said it was doing business with one in three companies that have a direct contract from the Olympics. “We wouldn’t have been able to do that if we weren’t a partner. That has been an important revenue line for us,” said Mr Lott.Companies have become savvier in their approach to sponsoring the games since the IOC launched the Olympic Partner (TOP) programme in 1985. Eleven companies are signed up to TOP, which allows them to use the Olympics logo and gives them preferential access to broadcast advertising slots in exchange for a minimum four-year commitment.Timo Lumme, the IOC’s director of television and marketing, said: “I would never say it’s easy to get a company to part with over $100m … companies now are much more sophisticated in terms of knowing what they want. They have a better sense of overall marketing objectives and why they want to spend the money,” he said.Olympic sponsorship agreements are not signed “on a chairman’s whim anymore,” he said.Visa, which is one of the founding members of the TOP programme, said it is “constantly learning” how to maximise its sponsorship.Colin Grannell, Visa’s head of partnership marketing, said that one of his goals was to make the company stand out in the sea of Olympic sponsors. “We’re all fighting for a share of awareness,” he admitted.Its not just the sponsors that are fighting for awareness. Other companies will be trying to benefit from the games without paying the sponsorship fees.The most notorious recent example of such “ambush marketing” saw 36 women clad in orange minidresses attend last year’s World Cup match between Holland and Denmark, to promote Bavaria, a Dutch brewer, in spite of Budweiser’s sponsorship.A study by Nielsen, the audience measurement firm, in the run-up to the football tournament last year found that campaigns by non-sponsors such as Carlsberg and Nike drowned out the marketing from official World Cup partners, in part simply by making better ads that created more buzz online.Nevertheless, demand for Olympic sponsorship remains strong. Revenue from the International Olympic Committee’s worldwide sponsorship programme is close to breaching $1bn for the first time.Mr Lumme isn’t surprised by the demand: “It demonstrates there’s a business imperative,” he said.Unlike the World Cup, he said, “you’re buying an overall association to a brand that has a set of ideals.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw"
81;GIS;General Mills;2011-08-18T08:32:32Z;Bright Food agrees deal for Manassen;;China’s Bright Food has broken its streak of failed deals by snapping up a 75 per cent stake in Manassen Foods in a transaction valuing the Australian branded foods business at A$530m (US$556m) including debt.The acquisition gives Bright Food a toehold in Australia and follows its unsuccessful attempt last year to buy Sucrogen, the sugar and biofuels unit of Australia’s CSR, which was ultimately acquired by Singapore-based Wilmar International for A$1.75bn. Bright also lost out to General Mills earlier this year for a stake in French yoghurt maker Yoplait.Financial details were not disclosed but a person working on the transaction said Bright Food’s acquisition valued the Australian group at A$530m.Australia’s foreign investment regulator must clear the acquisition of Manassen Foods, which sells biscuits, fruits and dairy products.However, the Australian authorities will note that the group’s founder, Roy Manassen, and its management will retain a 15 per cent stake, while Sydney-based Champ Private Equity, the food group’s majority owner, will retain 10 per cent.“Bright Food wants to sit back and learn,” said a person close to the Chinese group. “It is an important first step for them in Australia.”Wang Zongnan, chairman of the Shanghai government-owned food group, has said he intends to maintain existing management when acquiring foreign companies. “Any company I am going to acquire must have an outstanding management team and I want that team to continue working for us because Bright has insufficient knowledge of international markets,” he told the Financial Times earlier this year.Bright Food said it would provide Manassen Foods’ export business with direct access to the fast-growing Chinese market. The Australian group is one of the country’s biggest citrus growers. But exports have been hit by a strong Australian dollar and a glut of oranges thanks to robust growing conditions.“Simultaneously, via Manassen Foods’ distribution network, Bright Food will have the opportunity to introduce its portfolio of high-quality products and brands into the Australian market,” it said in a statement.Bright’s plans to use the Manassen distribution network to introduce its products into Australia were met with scepticism, though. Wan Ge, an analyst with Beijing-based China Venture, said Bright, which is one of China’s largest dairy producers, might struggle to introduce dairy products into Australia due to food safety concerns.“As for other products line, Bright Food lacks strong products to fit westerners’ tastes,” said Jason Yuan, a Shanghai-based analyst with UOB Kay Hian Holdings.Mr Wan said Bright appeared to have gained experience from past failed acquisition attempts. But most Chinese analysts thought Bright’s deep pockets sealed the deal.Bright is a vast conglomerate with interests ranging from dairy to retail, farming and real estate. Earlier this month, Bright Food reported half-year revenue of Rmb35.74bn ($5.6bn), up 18.8 per cent from the same period last year.Champ earlier this year considered floating Manassen Foods on the Australian market, but opted instead for a trade sale due to tough stock market conditions for new entrants.Bright Food was advised on the deal by Nomura, with UBS and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch acting for Champ.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
82;GIS;General Mills;2011-08-14T16:11:23Z;Foodmakers boost sales despite price rises;;"European food-makers are trumping their US rivals and pulling off a feat few thought possible: pushing through price increases and still persuading cash-strapped consumers to buy more noodles, bread and candy.With the consumer under ever more pressure, a trio of consensus-beating second-quarter results from European food producers show “people have paid up more and are consuming even more,” says Harold Thompson at Deutsche Bank. “You kind of think … ‘What’s the problem?’”Nestlé, the world’s biggest food producer based on sales, increased underlying revenues by 7.5 per cent year-on-year in the first half; Anglo-Dutch Unilever by 5.7 per cent and France’s Danone by 8.7 per cent. Pricing accounted for between 2.7 and 4.7 percentage points of the growth.This stands in stark contrast to the last round of commodity inflation in 2008-09, when manufacturers’ efforts to pass on pricing dented volumes. For some analysts, the latest round of results thus reflects lessons learnt.“Then, companies acted very aggressively and quickly, so consumers were hit with a big sticker shock,” says Michael Steib, analyst at Morgan Stanley. “This time they’ve managed it much more carefully, much more gradually.”The other trick companies have learnt – in part, borrowing from their emerging market experience – is to make products for consumers trading down, as well as premium offerings for those feeling richer.Danone, says Mr Steib, is a case in point; cheaper yoghurts now complement the more lavish pots on offer. This strategy, he says, is what has helped the branded manufacturers fend off the threat from private-label on what has traditionally been the latter’s home turf.It is also easier for branded manufacturers to pass on input prices, as these command a smaller share of the overall cost of sales than is the case for private label, which has a far leaner cost base.Companies themselves attribute their success to innovation; a vitamin-enhanced soft drink or indulgent chocolate will more readily justify a few extra cents – and recession-battered consumers’ desire for more affordable treats.As an example of the latter, Mr Thompson cites Nespresso, “basically the most expensive coffee on the planet, with 90 per cent of sales in western Europe – and it’s still growing at 20-plus per cent”.“Some people doubted whether we could put pricing through,” says Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, admitting the group had struggled to do so in the past. “But we think where we are now on pricing is more or less sufficient for the balance of the year, because we have transparency on costs which have now plateaued.”Contrast that with the Americans. General Mills saw net sales to US retailers fall 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, year-on-year, while volumes sank 6 per cent. The maker of cereals and breakfast bars is looking for a further deterioration of gross margins next year because it will not be able to pass on all of the commodity cost increases.Sara Lee, maker of breakfast sausages and hot dogs, has been among the most aggressive at raising prices in the US this year, pushing increases of 5.5 per cent in its North American retail business and 9.5 per cent in its North American food service business. Result: again, tumbling volumes.“Given our position as market leaders in most categories and given our strategy is to protect a healthy margin structure, we have mostly been at the forefront of price increases. And that leads us to being less competitive from time to time, at least temporarily,” said Marcel Smits, chief executive.A similar point is picked up by more sceptical analysts in Europe. Alan Erskine at UBS uses US margarine to illustrate the point.Unilever led with a price increase in the US margarine sector in the first quarter and lost some volume share before competition subsequently followed suit on pricing.“So far, so good,” he says of the latest set of results. “But because of lag effects and negotiation periods, price rises only took effect in the second quarter, so you probably want another quarter to be sure.”"
83;GIS;General Mills;2011-08-04T18:49:59Z;Kraft: a not so crafty scheme;Plan to split in two is a striking admission of fallibility by management;"There are two arguments in favour of Kraft’s dramatic plan to split itself amoeba-like into two listed entities. Management endorses both; investors might not.Financially, separating into a high-growth, largely international snacks company (representing two-thirds of pre-split sales, or $32bn) and a low-growth, high-yield US grocery company should allow the growth business to capture a higher valuation. Operationally, the two companies will have different products, distribution channels, and capital allocation strategies, and the focus will bring better performance.In principle, the financial case makes sense. Kraft’s businesses grow at widely differing rates. Note that the North American foods segment grew 3 per cent in the first half, despite raising prices by 4 per cent; while developing markets foods grew 12 per cent organically, and price rises contributed less than half of that. Expanding businesses, as a rule, get higher multiples, so if the undivided company trades at a low valuation, splitting the high-growth part should add to total value.But in practice, regardless of growth, big food and drink groups trade within a tight range of each other. Kraft’s enterprise value is 9.9 times forward earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortisation. Nestlé, more heavily concentrated in emerging markets, trades only a shade higher; dowdy General Mills only a bit lower.The second argument is still less certain. Management has not promised that the new companies will grow faster in aggregate than the old. They predict instead that capital and resources will be allocated more efficiently. In effect, this is a striking admission of fallibility. Why should management not allocate capital between different food products in different countries just as well as the market, which will, ultimately, take charge of that function once the two entities separate? Kraft’s announcement came on a terrible day for global markets. But on any day, a change that will release only modest value deserves a muted response.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
84;GIS;General Mills;2011-07-31T17:04:32Z;US food groups step up healthy eating drive;;US food and restaurant companies are aggressively stepping up their healthy food initiatives to get ahead of government regulations, but sceptics warn that they could be overreaching at their own expense.McDonald’s, the US fast-food restaurant chain, last week bowed to pressure over its marketing to children, putting its “Happy Meals” on a diet by shrinking the size of its French fries and offering apple slices. That followed a move in early July when 19 US restaurant chains promised to offer a children’s meal with limited calories, fat, salt and sugar.Big food companies have also been forging ahead to be healthier. Ken Powell, chief executive of General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soups, said its organic business is now a “growth engine” for the company and that the success of that division is informing its entire product line.“Consumer attitudes are changing,” Mr Powell told the Financial Times.PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, has been especially ambitious on this front, aiming to double the revenues it generates from nutritious products by the end of the decade. Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, in February said, “This is no longer a trend or a fad, this is here to stay”.In spite of these efforts, some argue that food groups risk overreaching by investing in food fads and straying from their strengths.A former chief executive of a top US food company, who now advises other companies, warns about the costs of overreacting to the health push. He said companies risk confusing their research and development departments, which have spent years focused on taste, and that they may be opening opportunities for groups that stick to their less calorie-conscious roots.Steve West, analyst at Sifel Nicolaus, said that healthy options still account for a small percentage of sales at restaurant chains and that companies need to adapt their recipes gradually because flavour preferences are deeply ingrained in their customers. He points to the grilled chicken venture by Yum! Brands’ KFC as an example of the pitfalls of trying to change.“They spent millions of dollars a couple years ago buying ovens for franchises to make grilled chicken to capitalise on the healthier food craze, and it flopped,” Mr West said. “They did not see any sales lift at all.”Last year KFC made a bigger bet on taste with its “Double Down” sandwich, encasing bacon, cheese and sauce between two slabs of fried chicken.Jerry McVety, president of the restaurant consulting firm McVety & Associates, said that some restaurant chains, such as Taco Bell and Hardee’s, have thrived by clinging to core values that are not healthy. He advises restaurant groups that appetite for healthier food is likely here to stay, but that they should be careful about straying too far from what made them successful.“If you change things too much, it can come back to haunt you eventually,” Mr McVety said.
85;GIS;General Mills;2011-07-17T21:29:55Z;General Mills hits out at ethanol subsidies;;General Mills hit out at ethanol subsidies as a driver of rising food prices in the US, arguing that they needlessly fuel inflation.“We’re driving up food prices unnecessarily,” Ken Powell, chief executive of General Mills, said in an interview with the Financial Times. “If corn prices go up, wheat goes up. It’s all linked.”General Mills, which makes Cheerios cereal, Progresso soup and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, is the world’s sixth-largest food company by revenues. It said last month that it expects its input costs to increase up to 11 per cent next year as it lowered its earnings forecast on inflation fears.Mr Powell said that the company had had to pay twice as much as last year for wheat and that costs of corn and oats are up 30 to 40 per cent. General Mills has absorbed much of these increases but has also had to pass some of them on to consumers.The comments come at a time when ethanol subsidies have been a subject of intense debate in the US amid ongoing negotiations to shrink swollen budget deficits.“There seems to be growing political questioning of the programme,” Mr Powell said, adding that its fate remains highly uncertain.The ethanol blenders tax credit, which was implemented in 2004, costs $6bn annually. Last week US senators reached an agreement to repeal the tax credit, but such a move would still need approval from Congress.The fight over ethanol will intensify ahead of the 2012 election season, as corn-producing states such as Iowa cling to the lucrative subsidy which has made their crops more valuable.Biofuels and ethanol consume 40 per cent of the US corn crop, and according to the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University, half of the rise in corn prices from 2004 to 2009 is due to ethanol expansion. Earlier this week, the US Department of Agriculture said that US ethanol refiners are consuming more domestic corn than livestock and poultry farmers for the first time.The Grocery Manufacturers Association has been pushing aggressively to end ethanol subsidies. “In essence, we’re paying three times for the one bad policy,” the industry group said in April.Mr Powell said other factors are also pushing food prices higher. He pointed to increased speculation causing volatility in food markets and greater wealth in emerging economies causing a shift in how people eat.As a result of those factors, General Mills sees little hope for relief from food price inflation.
86;GIS;General Mills;2011-06-29T20:47:11Z;Financials lead Wall Street higher;;Financial stocks saw some of the strongest gains in an upbeat session on Wall Street as the big indices continued to bounce off some technical lows last week and sentiment was lifted by news that the Greek parliament had passed a package of austerity measures.The financial sector, which has been one of the worst performing in recent months, falling 14 per cent from its last cyclical high in February, bounced up 2.1 per cent led by the large investment banks.Morgan Stanley was up 4.8 per cent to $23.39 while Goldman Sachs rose 2.6 per cent to $132.58. The S&P investment banking index was up 3.1 per cent.The S&P financial sector has now added 3.7 per cent in the past three days, and is on course for its best week in nearly seven months.Elsewhere in the sector, Visa was up 15 per cent to $86.58 while MasterCard added 11.3 per cent to $309.70 on news that the Federal Reserve is proposing to rework limits on fees that banks can charge each time a consumer uses a debit card.Bank of America added 3 per cent to $11.14 as investors reacted positively to news that the bank will pay $8.5bn to finally settle claims by investors that mortgage-backed securities sold by its Countrywide Financial unit failed to meet underwriting requirements and other guidelines.These gains helped the S&P 500 put on 0.8 per cent to 1,307.41, pulling the measure back over the psychologically significant 1,300 mark and reacquainting the benchmark index with its 150-day moving average lost three weeks ago.The materials sector saw the next strongest gains in the session after financials as the sector benefited from the uptick in global risk appetite after the Greek vote and some strong analysts’ reports on the steel industry.US Steel rose 5.9 per cent to $45.85 while AK Steel added 5.2 per cent to $15.51 after the companies received a ratings upgrade from Deutsche Bank. The sector also benefited from a Goldman Sachs note saying that steel demand in the third quarter may surprise to the upside.Elsewhere in the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was up 2.3 per cent to $51.62 while Allegheny Technologies rose 4.3 per cent to $64.29.Monsanto, the largest seed company by revenue, which is also a member of the S&P materials index, was up 5 per cent to $70.26 after reporting a 77 per cent jump in earnings on higher sales of Roundup weed killer and genetically modified crop seeds.The energy sector saw the next strongest gains. The S&P energy index was up 1.1 per cent as Halliburton, the oilfield services company, added 2.3 per cent to $49.82 and Schlumberger rose 1 per cent to $85.22.All these gains left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.6 per cent to 12,262.78, moving to within striking distance of its 100-day moving average line, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,740.49.The 3.1 per cent gains on the S&P 500 index so far this week, following nearly two straight months of losses, have led some investors to argue that the market reached a bottom last week when the index neared its technically significant 200-day moving average line.Sentiment on Wednesday was helped by better-than-expected housing data. Figures showed that pending sales of previously owned US homes rose 8.2 per cent in May ahead of the 3 per cent rise expected.This follows news in the previous session that April saw a rare monthly rise in home prices on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, suggesting that the pace of decline in the beleaguered housing market may be abating somewhat.But most argued that there was still little reason to be bullish on the downtrodden sector, particularly as the gains in pending sales last month followed a 11.3 per cent drop in pending sales in April.“In absolute terms this is a very depressed level, and with prices in most areas either still declining or flat, there is little incentive for buyers to be aggressive,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Shares in KB Home fell 15.4 per cent to $10.08 in the session after the homebuilder reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss, in a further confirmation that the sector was far from healthy.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in BJ’s Wholesale Club were up 4.6 per cent to $50.29 after the discount retailer announced that it was selling itself to the private equity firms Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital Partners for $2.8bn, wrapping up a months-long sale process.
87;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
88;GIS;General Mills;2011-06-06T13:32:29Z;Li Na, the next Yao Ming?;;"As Li Na collapsed in the clay of Roland Garros in rapturous joy on Saturday, the sight of the first Asian to ever win a Grand Slam tennis singles title must have been almost as exciting for executives in the global tennis industry.The French Open final was watched by an estimated 95m viewers on state sports television and Ms Li’s victory was front-page news on Sunday in virtually every Chinese newspaper, including Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily.Today just over 12m people in China regularly play tennis, according to figures published in state media, a miniscule portion of the country’s 1.3bn population and far fewer than other popular racket sports like table tennis and badminton.As an elitist sport for the capitalist bourgeoisie, tennis was virtually outlawed in Communist China but today it is enjoying a revival as the country’s nouveau riche search for pastimes that reflect their newfound social status.China Tennis Association head Sun Jinfang told state media that the sport is still considered an elite game that lags behind basketball, soccer and table tennis in its popularity among young people.But Ms Li’s victory “can have a great effect on Chinese tennis. I’m sure it will help re-evaluate the sport and inspire more youngsters to play tennis,” Sun said after Saturday’s final.As with many other sports, such as soccer and volleyball, Chinese male players lag far behind their female compatriots. No Chinese man has ever played in a Grand Slam and the highest-ranked male Chinese player is Bai Yan, ranked number 354.Ms Li is now ranked number 4 in the world and is almost certain to be offered a string of new endorsement deals, in addition to her existing contracts with the likes of Nike and Haagen-Dazs ice-cream.Her victory may also lead to a rethink of the way the Soviet-style Chinese state sports machine develops national sporting stars for individual sports like tennis.In 2008, Ms Li and a handful of other promising players were released from the onerous duties imposed by the official state tennis system and allowed to choose their own coaches and support team.They were also allowed to keep more of their winnings, with the cut going to the official Chinese federation reduced from 65 per cent to just 12 per cent, which means Ms Li will be able to keep the bulk of the €1.2m in prize money from Saturday’s final.The lure of riches, on top of national glory, will be another factor promoting the sport of tennis in China.Related reading:

89;GIS;General Mills;2011-05-06T21:47:28Z;Wall Street rallies on US jobs;;A volatile week on Wall Street ended on a high note after better than expected employment data pulled investor sentiment from the doldrums and helped energy and materials stocks rebound.Materials stocks saw some of the strongest gains of the session with the S&P materials index up 0.7 per cent, helping to pare some of the 4.5 per cent losses seen earlier in the week due to falling commodity prices.Material stocks had taken a particular battering on Thursday as commodity prices suffered their sharpest one-day fall since the financial crisis.But on Friday, investors speculated that the losses may have been overdone, and the sector rebounded. Cliff Natural Resources was up 1 per cent to $88.93 while Alcoa, the aluminium producer, added 0.8 per cent to $17.15.These gains helped the wider markets snap a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,340.20, still leaving the benchmark index 1.7 per cent lower over the week, however.Sentiment was lifted in the session by strong employment data. The crucial non-farm payroll figures from the labour department showed that 244,000 jobs had been added last month in the US, ahead of the 185,000 that had been expected by economists.The data showed that the government’s work force had fallen in April but that the private sector had more than taken up the slack, adding 268,000 jobs. The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 9 per cent.These data were particularly market moving because a key reason for the losses on Wall Street earlier in the week had been worries that the non-farm payroll numbers would be sluggish.Because of this, the S&P 500 index jumped 1.2 per cent following the figures.But the markets then pared some of these gains after a report in a German newspaper that Greece was considering leaving the eurozone and abandoning the single currency.The S&P energy index was 2.3 per cent higher following the jobs report, paring some of the 7.3 per cent in losses seen earlier in the week, but the index was only 0.4 per cent higher at the close because of the speculation over Greece.In the energy sector, EOG Resources was up 2.3 per cent to $117.44, helped by healthy earnings numbers. Elsewhere in the sector, ConocoPhillips rose 1.4 per cent to $72.94 while Tesoro added 2.6 per cent to $24.91.A number of positive earnings reports also helped to lift sentiment. Shares in Kraft Foods were up 2.1 per cent to $34.08 as the food group reported a rise in revenue and margins.Elsewhere, Visa reported a 24 per cent increase in profits as a result of higher consumer spending and the stock was up 0.9 per cent to $79.41.All this left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4 per cent to 12,638.81 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 2,827.56. The indices were down 1.3 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively over the five days.The markets had opened on Monday in positive territory as the news on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world. But this quickly fizzled out as investors turned their attention to more prosaic matters and began to worry that the market was overbought following the technical highs reached in previous sessions.Late in April, the S&P index achieved a 35-month high, the Nasdaq rose to a 10-year high and the Russell 2000 hit at an all-time high.The sense that the market was overheating was also compounded by weak economic data throughout much of the week. As well as lacklustre employment data on Wednesday and Thursday, the ISM non-manufacturing index showed a sharp decrease in the rate of growth in the US service sector in April.Earnings also failed to give the same lift to the markets as the number of companies beating expectations fell back.Two weeks after the start of the earnings season in early April, 80 per cent of companies had beaten analysts’ expectations with their quarterly earnings results. At the end of April, the positive surprise rate was 76 per cent, but now the rate stands at 73 per cent, with slightly less than 100 companies left to report.But the biggest drags on the S&P index over the week were energy and materials stocks as the correction in commodity prices gathered steam. The S&P energy index was down 7 per cent over the week while the S&P material index lost 3.8 per cent.
90;GIS;General Mills;2011-04-01T17:09:10Z;Street smarts needed to thrive in China;;Shanghai’s premier shopping street, Huai Hai Middle Road, is a roadmap of US brands.At number 550 stands the shuttered House of Barbie, the department store for the doll and symbol of all that can go wrong when the US sells to China.At number 887 are KFC and Pizza Hut, examples of what can go right in the relationship between multinationals and China consumers.Occupying pride of place at number 1 is Starbucks, the coffee-house.The street tells a tale of foreign capitalism in China, with a moral: to thrive on the mainland, brands must be flexible, meaning altering not just their products but sometimes their core business models to suit Chinese tastes and culture.After setbacks for brands such as Home Depot, Best Buy and Barbie, which have closed stores or withdrawn after failing to win over Chinese consumers, the lessons of Huai Hai Road are germane.“Anybody who comes into this market and thinks they can just plant their brand and let it grow will be sadly mistaken,” Tom Doctoroff, north Asia chief executive of JWT, the advertising agency, says.“Any [foreign] business model needs to be brought into alignment with Chinese cultural and consumer imperatives.”He points to Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs as the gold standard for foreign brand success in China. They took products alien to Chinese tastes and made them popular.Pizza Hut and KFC, both owned by Yum Brands, localised their menu. On Huai Hai Road, Pizza Hut offers teriyaki squid with quail egg skewers, while one of KFC’s most popular breakfast dishes is rice gruel with thousand-year egg.But adjusting to local tastes is not just about food, Mr Doctoroff says.Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs all focused on eat-in, rather than carry-out, in China.“Barbie just got plonked down in China.”Even luxury goods companies have had to adapt their model, he says. The Chinese market for luxury goods is “broad and shallow”. Not all consumers can afford a luxury handbag, so top-end brands offer more accessories such as key-chains and sunglasses.“When foreign companies come to China, they are very proud of the business model that gave them success in other countries,” Chen Can, of Beijing-based Analysys International, says.Amway, the US direct selling company that has 43 per cent of the China direct sales market, took the opposite approach, abandoning core elements of its business model when pressed to do so by Beijing. This included setting up retail outlets, which it had in no other country.Eva Cheng, recently retired head of Amway China, says the company changed its strategy “to promote harmony and fusion with the Chinese culture” – words that might not trip off the tongue of every foreign chief executive.This has proved to be a winning strategy, Audie Wong, president of Amway China, says.“At first we opened retail stores to comply with government regulations, but then we found they were very useful,” he says.He notes that Chinese consumers prefer a brand with premises they can visit in case of problems.China is Amway’s biggest market, with sales of Rmb22bn ($3.6bn) last year.John Quelch, dean of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says the go-to-market strategy of companies must be locally tailored.“The key differentiator between successful and unsuccessful companies is distribution management,” he says.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
91;GIS;General Mills;2011-03-23T14:26:03Z;Financials weigh on Wall Street;;Bank of America lost ground after announcing that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its planned dividend increase, while the wider markets edged lower for another day as oil prices tipped over $105 a barrel.The bank said it had submitted a plan to the Fed for a “modest increase” in its dividend for the second half of 2011 but that they had “objected to the proposed increase in capital distributions”. Shares were down 1.4 per cent to $13.68.Last Friday, financial stocks on Wall Street were given a boost following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders. But this news left the S&P financial index down 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session.JPMorgan Chase, which itself announced a dividend last Friday, was down 1 per cent to $45.01. Elsewhere, Zions Bancorporation fell 1.2 per cent to $23.11, while Regions Financial lost 1.8 per cent to $7.17. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent lower to $158.65.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,289.25, adding to the 0.4 per cent loss in the previous session, as oil prices ticked up and traders continued to try and assess the impact of the conflict in Libya and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.Adobe Systems, the software developer, was down 3.2 per cent to $31.83 after lowering its second-quarter revenue forecast due to the Japanese earthquake.Japan is Adobe’s second-biggest market after the US and accounts for between 10 to 15 per cent of revenue each quarter. The company also reported an 85 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit.The S&P technology sector was down 0.3 per cent with semiconductor stocks losing ground in spite of assurances from analysts that the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese disaster would not sprawl.“We believe the Japan earthquake will result in only a temporary disruption to the semiconductor supply chain and stock prices,” analysts at JPMorgan said. “As a result, we maintain our constructive stance on semiconductors,” the note continued.Investors remained nervous and Applied Materials lost 1.2 per cent to $14.93, while Rubicon Technology fell 2.8 per cent to $25.80. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.
92;GIS;General Mills;2011-03-23T13:48:04Z;Snack sales boost General Mills profits;;General Mills, the US foods group, said on Wednesday that its third-quarter profits grew thanks to strong demand overseas and its ability to raise prices amid rising commodity costs.Net income at General Mills rose by nearly 18 per cent to $392.1m, or 59 cents a share. Meanwhile, sales rose by a more modest 2 per cent to $3.65bn.The results were slightly behind Wall Street analysts’ expectations and the company’s shares fell 2.03 per cent to $36.16 in pre-market trading in New York.Ken Powell, General Mills’ chief executive, offered a bright outlook for the fourth quarter, predicting “the highest earnings growth of the year”, as the company looks to raise prices. Food groups such as General Mills have been lifting prices to cope with higher costs of raw materials.“We expect to generate good sales and earnings growth in the final quarter of this year, and meet the targets we set for fiscal 2011 in total,” the company said in a statement.Sales in the US were soft in the third quarter, falling by 1 per cent to $2.5bn. That decline was blunted by an 8 per cent rise in international sales, which climbed to $688m on strong demand in Asia and Europe.US consumers continued to have a strong appetite for snack bars, soup and frozen vegetables, but this was offset by weak sales of frozen pizza and baking products.Last week, General Mills won a hotly contested battle to acquire half of Yoplait, the French yoghurt maker, for about $1.1bn in an effort to protect its large US franchise. In the latest quarter, its Yoplait division sales grew by 1 per cent.
93;GIS;General Mills;2011-03-21T14:52:32Z;Yoplait deal hailed as French template;;Bankers are touting the structure used to sell PAI’s 50 per cent stake in Yoplait as “la solution” – a potential template for future mergers and acquisitions in France, a country that has previously balked at selling “strategic assets” to overseas buyers.PAI, the French private equity firm, steered around these sensitivities – and those of Yoplait’s co-owners, the French farmers’ co-operative Sodiaal – by splitting the French yoghurt maker into two parts for its planned sale to General Mills. The US foods group has agreed to buy the stake in a deal that gives Yoplait an enterprise value of €1.6bn ($2.3bn).Yoplait, which has annual sales of some €900m, was split into brand and operations. The brand company, which receives royalties every time a pot of branded yoghurt is sold, was previously owned by the holding company of PAI and Sodiaal. Branded sales account for some 85 per cent of total sales.After the acquisition, the brand company will be equally owned directly by Sodiaal and General Mills. The US company, however, will have 51 per cent of the operating company.“It certainly provides flexibility in terms of separating the ownership [of the operations] and the way you manage the brand itself,” says PAI’s Frederic Stevenin.The structure itself is not uncommon in the world of consumer goods, particularly at the luxury end. Fragrances and cosmetics, for example, often have different ownership for the brand and manufacturing and distribution operations.Thus when L’Oréal, the French cosmetics group, bought Yves Saint Laurent Beaute from PPR in 2008, the French luxury group handed over the operations and a long-term brand licence agreement, for which it continues to receive royalties.But bankers see further scope for the structure. One points to “known targets” like Danone, the French yoghurt producer and Moët Hennessy, the luxury drinks group controlled by LVMH of France.“Could this structure trigger a different way of thinking about these deals rather than the blunt instrument of cash for common deals?” the banker asks. Drinks groups, for example, could splice the vineyards into a property vehicle, control of which could then remain with the French seller.Cleary, national interests have been strong in this deal. Christine Lagarde, finance minister, and Bruno Le Maire, agriculture minister, said in a statement on Friday: “The government reaffirms its desire to preserve jobs and the future of the dairy sector in France. It will be particularly keen to see the shareholders put forward an industrial plan that favours job creation, innovation and milk producers.”The FSI, or strategic investment fund, is examining the opportunity to contribute to this investment in Yoplait, they added. The FSI, created in the wake of the financial crisis as a state investor in projects with perceived strategic importance, has intervened in cases involving national champions such as nuclear group Areva and hotel chain Accor.But other bankers said the structure was designed as much to keep Sodiaal on side as for any flag-waving purposes. Pointing out that Sodiaal farmers sell one-fifth of their milk to Yoplait, they say their interest was “continuing to sell their milk”.It also emerged on Friday that the ongoing legal dispute with General Mills over the amount of royalties it pays Yoplait will be resolved as part of the deal. The US group is expected to agree to a higher royalties’ payment.General Mills will now begin talks with workers and unions and is expected to complete the deal in around three months.
94;GIS;General Mills;2011-03-18T20:51:04Z;Financials lead Wall Street rally;;Financial stocks climbed after the Federal Reserve cleared the way for banks to raise their dividends, while in the wider markets a turbulent week on Wall Street ended on a high note due to easing geopolitical tensions.JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo were among those to raise their dividend following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders.JPMorgan climbed 2.7 per cent to $45.74 while Wells Fargo added 1.5 per cent to $31.83. The S&P financial index rose 1.1 per cent.In the wider markets, US equities continued to rebound from the heavy losses seen earlier in the week lifted by news that Libya had announced an “immediate ceasefire” in its offensive against rebels.The S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,279.20, adding to the 1.3 per cent gains from the previous session.News that the G7 had reached an agreement to intervene in the markets to curb the rise of the yen also served to bolster sentiment.The S&P 500 is still down 1.9 per cent over the week, however, and 4.8 per cent lower since the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East in mid-February.Industrial stocks saw the strongest gains after financials, helped by the easing geo-political tensions. In the industrial sector Caterpillar, the world’s biggest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment, was up 1.9 per cent to $105.06, while Rockwell Automation advanced 1.2 per cent to $88. The S&P industrial index was up 0.7 per cent.Energy stocks lost some ground in the session following these developments in Libya. Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, was down 1.3 per cent to $85.93 while Rowan Companies fell 2.6 per cent to $40.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 11,858.52, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,643.67. The indices were down 1.5 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively over the week.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, was down 6.5 per cent, but is still up 22 per cent over the week.In corporate news, General Mills announced that it was in negotiations to buy half of Yoplait, the yoghurt brand, sending shares in the food group up 1.4 per cent to $36.65.Elsewhere, Celera was up 34 per cent to $8.40 after Quest Diagnostics, a laboratory-testing group said it was buying the genetics group. Quest Diagnostics fell 0.8 per cent to $53.74.Nike lost ground after the company reported disappointing profits and slimmer margins due to higher commodity costs. Its shares tumbled 9.2 per cent to $77.59, a six-month low.The week on Wall Street was split into two halves. The first three days saw heavy selling as traders worried about the impact of the earthquake and resulting tsunami and potential nuclear disaster on Japan, the third-largest economy in the world.Negative news flow left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in three days and caused the Vix volatility index to spike up 46.4 per cent. Thursday and Friday saw a recovery as traders decided that the sell-off had been overdone and analysts calculated that the impact on the Japanese and the world economy would not be significant.Research from RBC Capital Markets found that technical indicators such as the number of US stocks trading below their 50 day moving average and the put-to-call ratio showed that the markets were at “deep ‘oversold’ levels often associated with market rebounds”.The markets were also lifted by bumper manufacturing data from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday, the best monthly reading since 1984, and news of a ceasefire in Libya on Friday. The sectors that suffered worst in the week were those directly affected by the Japanese disaster. Nuclear stocks plunged, with Uranium Energy falling 10.5 per cent and Uranium Resources declining 6.7 per cent.Insurance companies also lost ground on worries over how much they will be forced to pay out. Aflac was 8.8 per cent lower while Platinum Underwriters lost 4.1 per cent. The KBW property casualty index slid 2 per cent over the week.Technology stocks fell on worries over component shortages as Japan is one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors. Qualcomm fell 3.5 per cent while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2 per cent over the week.Material and industrial stocks had a mixed week, pulled sharply lower early in the week but rebounding strongly as sentiment improved. The S&P materials index ended up flat and the industrial index fell 1.7 per cent overall.
95;GIS;General Mills;2011-03-18T16:47:03Z;Yoplait: yoghurt ain’t what it was;General Mills will be relieved it won out of a reported nine candidates;Yoghurt just ain’t what it used to be. In 2005 the French deemed the stuff so important to their nation that Danone, the industry leader, was defended from a potential bid from Pepsico on the grounds of national interest. Fast forward six years and another US company, General Mills, with its eyes on another French yoghurt business, Yoplait, has encountered no such trouble. The former has won the right to exclusive talks to buy the half of the latter owned by private equity group PAI, plus an additional 1 per cent from Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative that owns the other half, valuing the business at €1.6bn.General Mills will be relieved it won out of a reported nine candidates. The diversified food maker has held the rights to market Yoplait in the US for 34 years, but the relationship with Sodiaal has reportedly soured, to the point that their contract, which was written in perpetuity, is marked for renegotiation. But rather than use lawyers and negotiators to fix the problem, Kendall Powell, General Mills’ chief executive, has thrown a briefcase full of cash at it.Given the sale of PAI’s half of Yoplait needed Sodiaal’s approval, the French co-op and General Mills have presumably worked out their differences. The US group, though, may carry more risk than its controlling stake implies. Although it now owns 51 per cent of the operating business, control of the brand, which licenses the name and global franchises and contributes about three-quarters of Yoplait’s revenues, will be split evenly with Sodiaal. French farmers wield a disproportionate amount of political clout and Paris has previously shown its willingness to acquiesce to their demands. Mr Powell, who has global expansion plans for Yoplait, may find its new partnership throws him more than he bargained for.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
96;GIS;General Mills;2011-03-17T18:32:24Z;General Mills to buy half of Yoplait;;"General Mills, the US foods group, is understood to have won the hotly contested battle for Yoplait in a deal that gives the French yoghurt maker an enterprise value of €1.6bn ($2.2bn), according to bankers.The price is higher than expected and sharply above the €1.4bn-valuation bid by French private dairy company Lactalis, which was rejected as being too low.It marks a handsome return for PAI, the French private equity firm that was selling its 50 per cent stake in Yoplait. The remaining 50 per cent is held by Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative.PAI bought its stake in Yoplait in 2002, when a crisis at Sodiaal, which created the brand in 1965, forced it to seek fresh funds. It paid €200m for its 50 per cent holding, with both parties then saying a stock market listing was the favoured exit strategy.At the time, Yoplait was generating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of €51m. This is forecast to triple to €153m in the year to June 2011.The race to acquire the number two yoghurt maker was intense, with bidders including Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company by sales, Bright Food of China, Grupo Lala of Mexico, and private equity bidders.Nestlé is understood to have been tripped up by its existing partnership with Lactalis. The two joined forces on chilled dairy products in 2005; Nestlé owns 40 per cent of the joint venture, while Lactalis holds the balance.Yoplait’s last year said it favoured a tie-up with Nestlé. Lucien Fa, chief executive since 2002, told Swiss daily Le Matin that “looking at company profiles, [Nestlé] is the ideal candidate. It has the money, the structures, the people. It is everywhere and shares our concern for healthy food.”However, the complex ownership structure meant several interests had to be taken into account – not least those of the French government, which kept an eye on proceedings. An earlier effort by a US company to acquire a French yoghurt maker – when PepsiCo was eyeing Danone in 2005 – prompted France to label yoghurt a strategic asset to stymie the deal.General Mills was eager to snare Yoplait in part to protect its large US franchise. It has held this for some 30 years and Yoplait, stirred into action by the low level of royalties the business generated, had sought to renegotiate the contract, sparking a legal battle.Adding to the complexity, PAI also had to find a buyer that met the approval of Sodiaal, as it will retain its 50 per cent stake. All three parties on the sell side – PAI, Yoplait and Sodiaal – appointed bankers to advise them on the deal. PAI was advised by Rothschilds, Sodiaal by HSBC and Yoplait by Morgan Stanley. All declined to comment."
97;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Bright Food highest bidder for Yoplait stake;;Bright Food of China has emerged as the highest bidder for the 50 per cent stake in Yoplait, the global yoghurt brand, that has been put up for sale by its private equity owner, according to people familiar with the deal.General Mills, the US food group that owns the Yoplait licence in the US, is also in the running, as is Nestlé of Switzerland.The Yoplait brand, the world’s second-biggest yoghurt brand by sales, is jointly owned by PAI, which is selling its 50 per cent stake, and Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative.However, they say that the complexities of the sale mean the winner will have to show more than just cash.The structure of the company, along with the interest of the French government, which is keeping an eye on proceedings, means different interests are at play over the choice of buyer.While PAI’s aim is to maximise value for its shareholders, the farmers are more interested in a partner they can work with.The French government, having once labelled yoghurt a strategic asset when there was speculation in the media that PepsiCo of the US was eyeing Danone, has said its state-backed fund could come in as a shareholder.But Yoplait’s owners are understood to prefer an international company that would be able to help the brand develop in emerging markets.Late last year the joint owners of Yoplait rejected a €1.4bn ($1.8bn) takeover bid for the whole of Yoplait from French private dairy company Lactalis, saying it was too low.Bright Food’s high bid might reflect the hurdles it is up against, bankers said. It is neither French nor international.The Chinese dairy company has lost a degree of credibility by balking at deals at the last minute: it has abruptly walked away from United Biscuits, of the UK, and GNC, the US vitamin retail chain.“Bright wants to move up the value added curve and thinks this is a legitimate brand to do it with,” said one person familiar with the group.“Dairy is the highest priority …It is more about what international assets make sense to leverage their prospects in the Chinese market.”General Mills is eager to protect its franchise, currently the subject of legal proceedings, which further muddies the waters.The brand also has attractions for Nestlé. Analysts noted the Swiss foods group had over the years moved out of basic dairy products, selling fresh milk activities, divesting many powdered milk operations and putting its remaining fresh dairy business into a joint venture with France’s Lactalis.James Amoroso, an independent industry analyst said: “But fresh dairy has always been a special category for Peter Brabeck [Nestlé’s chairman]. It’s still very strategic for him.”Nestlé and General Mills declined to comment.Additional reporting by Haig Simonian in Zurich
98;GIS;General Mills;2011-01-25T16:10:32Z;Sustainability: Green companies tend to crack efficiency first;;In France, Pernod Ricard has turned to a centuries-old technology, to make its supply chain greener. The drinks group uses river barges, rather than trucks, to transport its Mumm and Perrier-Jouet Champagne to Le Havre, where it joins ships bound for Asia and the Americas.Nor is Champagne the only drink to enjoy a more sedate journey. According to John Corrigan, Pernod Ricard’s global supply chain and procurement director, the company tries to use air freight only as a last resort, and aims to reduce the number of miles its products travel by road. Even the choice of sea routes affects the company’s environmental footprint.Another Pernod Ricard brand, Jacob’s Creek wine, is very popular in the UK. The cheapest way to ship the wines from Australia to Britain, according to Mr Corrigan, is via Hong Kong, Singapore, or Thailand. But putting the wine on two ships rather than one, with the need to wait quayside between journey legs, risks affecting quality. And the longer, indirect journey, although it is cheaper, produces more CO2 than a direct shipment from Australia to Europe.To make these choices, and ensure the various brands reach their markets on time and in good condition, is no simple task. Drinks brands are global, but the products are local. Perrier-Jouet must come from the Champagne region of France, Chivas Regal and The Glenlivet whiskies from Scotland, and Absolut Vodka from southern Sweden.To manage this, the company uses eight supply chain IT systems, including enterprise resource planning, business intelligence and sales forecasting. Like many fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) businesses, it is combining advanced planning and forecasting tools to help predict demand – and so limit inventories and optimise transport routes – as well as more obvious “green” measures, such as reducing packaging or using thinner glass for bottles.FMCG brands are among the more responsive to environmental issues, because of both consumers’ growing awareness, and in some cases, pressure from supermarkets.Another business that uses forecasting to help ensure supply chain sustainability is General Mills, the branded foods manufacturer.“Within the food sector, the key challenge is forecasting and planning promotional activity,” explains Dave Howorth, supply chain director for its UK and Ireland operations.“The current trend is for promotional activity to be more volatile. At General Mills UK, we transport 90 per cent of our Green Giant, Old El Paso and Nature Valley products from our North Spain and South France plants to the UK by short sea freight. This saves more than 2.5m road miles annually. But road is quicker than sea and so if we have to respond to significant unplanned demand then [that would] increase our road miles.”In the manufacturing sector, JAE, an electronics and electrical components maker is using forecasting software to help it to switch goods bound for Europe from air freight to sea.However, according to Matt Harris, JAE’s head of supply chain in Europe, cost was the main driver for the investment in forecasting. The environmental benefits followed. This view is backed by Hugh Williams, a supply chain specialist at Hughenden Consulting. “If you address supply chain improvement, green is a consequence, not a driver,” he says.In some areas, businesses have taken significant steps to improve the sustainability of their products, especially in sourcing. Legislation has forced manufacturers to make more checks on raw materials, and to eliminate hazardous substances. Businesses have also tightened up their ability to trace raw materials, especially in the light of scares over foodstuffs and toys in the past few years.But hazardous materials pose a simpler problem for a supply chain, and the IT specialists who support it. The materials are either present – and need to be recorded and tracked – or are not. For other inputs, including energy and increasingly water, or emissions, such as CO2, the challenge is dealing with multiple variables, perhaps in real time.Few manufacturers can account for the exact carbon footprint of an item on the line at any one time, especially if it is made from materials, or with energy, sourced on the open market, rather than through long-term contracts, sustainability experts warn.The more sophisticated manufacturing and ERP systems can, in fact, track many of these variables either directly, or through the use of additional modules. Here, the software companies may well be ahead of their customers’ businesses: the tools are waiting in the wings, ready to be switched on when customers need them, can justify their costs or – as one vendor warns – are forced to do so by regulation. Instead, the driver for investment is efficiency.“The reason efficient companies are green companies is attention to detail,” says Steven Barr, a supply chain expert at PA Consulting Group. “And it is efficient companies that tend to be green, not green companies that are efficient.” Those businesses that have invested in IT, to improve service or drive down costs, are those that have tools they can adapt to improving sustainability.Meanwhile, the software companies are working on standardisation, so it is easier to exchange environmental data across a supply chain and to trace the eco-footprint of a given bill of materials. Managing the end of life of a product – through so-called “reverse logistics” – is potentially a big prize for supply chain technologists, as more markets set out to reduce post-consumer waste.And, as raw material and energy costs both rise, such tools become more attractive to industry, suggests Guy Battle, a partner at Deloitte, the professional services firm. “It is the rising costs of resources coming through the supply chain that increases the incentive to recycle.”
99;GIS;General Mills;2010-12-27T19:33:49Z;Open innovation powers growth;;Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, is an acknowledged global industry leader in new consumer product innovation. According to data from IRI, the market research firm, it produced five of the top 10 US non-food product launches in 2009. But as it pursues its drive to add another 1bn customers to the estimated 4bn it already reaches, Bob McDonald, its chief executive, says that the road to more innovation should increasingly embrace other people’s good ideas.“We need bigger innovations that create more value,” Mr McDonald told this year’s annual gathering and awards event for companies and research institutions that work with P&G. “We want you to come to us with your big ideas first.”It is now commonplace for consumer goods companies to work with outside partners and to pursue “open innovation” (see panel). But P&G may be the one that has made the largest deliberate effort to expand its reach since the launch of its Connect & Develop programme in 2001 by A.G. Lafley, its then chief executive.In an attempt to open up the company and to end its resistance to innovations “not invented here”, Mr Lafley said he wanted at least 50 per cent of its new products to involve an outside partner. The company met that goal four years later and the share is now about 60 per cent.External co-operation has delivered a stream of successful “big idea” products. Last year’s IRI list included Tide Total Care, a premium version of its Tide detergent, which was number two by sales on IRI’s 2009 top 10 non-food products launch list. It was developed with external research from Sweden’s University of Lund and from two small chemical companies. P&G’s Always Infinity feminine care brand was at number eight – it uses a patented absorbent foam material from a manufacturing process developed with an external partner.P&G’s list of partners includes other large corporations, such as food groups ConAgra and General Mills, and rivals, including its Glad brand plastic bag joint venture with Clorox, set up in 2003. Its most unexpected government research partner may be the Los Alamos National Lab, the US defence technology research centre. Los Alamos initially helped P&G to regulate the production of the absorbent gel used in nappies, using theoretical data analysis systems developed for weapons technology.But part of P&G’s challenge is now learning how to work better with small and medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs. “That to me is the largest barrier,” says Bruce Brown, P&G’s chief technology officer who also oversees about $2bn of spending on its internal R&D. “How do we really learn to work better with some of the small and medium-sized entrepreneurs?”Jeff Weedman, head of the Connect & Develop programme, says: “It’s normal for new partners to have a concern that they will be overwhelmed” and that “some small entrepreneurs don’t have the patience to work through” P&G’s exhaustive procedures.Even when the company begins to explore potential co-operation, it may still decide a proposed partnership does not work. “We most often say no thank you, even in proactive searches,” says Mr Weedman. “Fairly routinely . . . we’ll refer them on to other companies, up to and including competitors. We never want them to have an excuse to not call us first.”Mr McDonald has now called for the value of the Connect & Develop programme’s contribution to annual sales growth to triple by 2015, so that products launched with outsiders account for $3bn of annual sales growth, up from $1bn now. At current growth rates, the target would raise the share of new annual sales growth from the initiative from about 25 per cent to more than 60 per cent.Mr Brown says the target marks a second stage in the programme’s development, after a first stage that managed to create the cultural change sought, but risked becoming a “tick the box issue”.“Instead of just focusing on the number [of external partnerships], let’s focus on the value we can create,” he says.“When we get those really, really big ideas, we want to scale them more quickly across the company and use them in more places across the company.”Shekhar Mitra, head of research and development for P&G’s global beauty and grooming business, recalls that a decade ago P&G was not even regularly scanning related research work.“When we started to change our culture, we found out ‘Holy cow! There’s a world of minds out there that can bring innovation to us’,” he says.He was involved in one of the programme’s early success stories, the creation of its Olay Regenerist anti-ageing creams, which was built around molecular peptides developed by Sederma, a French company, part of the Croda group.“As a small company, we had little chance of getting in there until P&G switched its policy,” says Karl Lintner, who headed Sederma at the time.Sederma has worked with many of P&G’s global rivals too, and says that potential partners with large corporations need to realise that “sometimes – like with most bigger companies – things take longer than you think, so it’s a bit frustrating”.The Olay brand is also involved in one of the company’s latest product launches, in partnership with Syneron, an Israeli technology company, that has developed a patented anti-wrinkle beauty salon treatment called ReFirme. After four years of joint development with Syneron, P&G’s business in Canada has started selling its Olay Professional ReFirme treatment for C$250 (US$248).P&G is also seeking approval for the product in both the US and the UK, a demonstration of what Mr Weedman says is its ability to deliver the kind of rapid growth and scale that would have taken a smaller company years or decades to attain on its own.“When we decide we are going to take something global, we have the wherewithal,” he says. “If you get through working with P&G and it makes sense, when we go global, you will go global. And it will be very quick.”
100;GIS;General Mills;2010-12-20T01:43:45Z;PAI Partners to sell its stake in Yoplait;;The tussle for ownership of the French yoghurt maker Yoplait kicks off on Monday, when the 50 per cent stake in the company owned by PAI Partners, the private equity group, will formally be put up for sale.Suitors have been circling Yoplait for several months – in some cases even before the sellers had appointed bankers in September. The other partner in the ownership of Yoplait is Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative.Last month, the two owners rejected a €1.4bn ($1.8bn) takeover bid for the whole of Yoplait from French private dairy company Lactalis. This month, France’s state-backed strategic investment fund indicated it could help bankroll a bid.There are also several international players in the wings. These include General Mills of the US, which owns the Yoplait franchise in North America, PepsiCo and Switzerland’s Nestlé.Two Chinese buyers are also understood to be interested: Bright Foods, which also looked at United Biscuits in the UK, and Mengniu Dairy, one of the country’s biggest milk producers.The French government, which famously declared yoghurt maker Danone a strategic asset in order to fend off a rumoured takeover bid by PepsiCo of the US in 2005, is keeping a close eye on the deal because farmers in France are a strong force politically. The government is keen not to see French influence in the company diluted and does not want to see farming interests weakened by a sale of PAI’s stake.Sodiaal has said it does not intend to sell its 50 per cent. When it made its approach, Lactalis had hoped to win the farmers’ group over by offering a share in the profits and management of the Yoplait franchise business, which accounts for 75 per cent of the brand’s total €4bn in sales.On top of this, a legal tussle with General Mills may deter buyers, analysts say, including the US food group itself. General Mills filed for arbitration after Sodima, the licensing arm of Sodiaal, said it planned to terminate the US group’s licensing agreement in 2012.“This could be a long process, whatever the French courts may think,” said one banker.However, the sellers are hoping for a speedier resolution to the sales process, with first bids in by the middle of next month and a deal stitched up by the end of March.
101;GIS;General Mills;2010-12-16T21:46:03Z;US stocks edge higher on manufacturing data;;"FedEx shares rose in spite of missing analyst expectations as the delivery company was upbeat about its fiscal year 2011, while the wider indices edged higher.FedEx missed expectations with its second-quarter profit, which was lower than in the same period a year ago. Earnings came in at $1.16 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.31 and revenue was also lighter than the consensus forecast.But the package delivery company raised its forecast for the fiscal year 2011 on the back of a stronger-than-expected holiday season, much of which was not included in the second quarter. It now predicts earnings per share of between $5.00 and $5.30 for the full year.Shares in FedEx gained 2 per cent to $94.22, helping the wider industrials sector add 1.1 per cent.The stock fell after its reported first-quarter results in September which had more than doubled year-on-year because the company issued a cautious outlook warning of the slowing of economic growth.Rival United Parcel Service also rose, up 2.1 per cent to $73.76.“I’ve always looked at FedEx as a bellwether of US economic activity because they transport goods across the country,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Smart Growth Funds. “They raised estimates on the back of the positive holiday season but is that going to extend
into 2011?”Stocks extended their gains after a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region rose to 24.3 in December, maintaining and adding to gains after a jump to 22.5 the month before.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,242.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 11,499.25 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,637.31.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, down 3,000 to 420,000. But last week’s figures on the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time were revised slightly higher.“This is a modest decline but enough to keep both the four- and eight-week moving averages heading down; the former is now at just 422,750, the lowest since July 2008, before the Lehman bust,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A separate report released before the opening bell showed construction began on more homes in November than in the month before, the first such rise for three months.The S&P 500 homebuilders index added 1.6 per cent to $248.16.Shares in Visa and Mastercard tumbled after the Federal Reserve proposed new rules which could cut the debit card fees paid by retailers who accept the cards by up to 90 per cent. Visa dropped 12.7 per cent to $67.19 and Mastercard lost 10.3 per cent to $223.49.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $12.52 after the bank said investors in some mortgage bonds had agreed to postpone a deadline
for resolving a dispute
over the assets.The biggest truckload carrier in North America, Swift Transportation, edged up 0.9 per cent to $11.10 in its first day of trading. The company had to cut the price of its initial public offering to $806m, or $11 per share, when it had originally offered shares at between $13 and $15 each.In other earnings news, General Mills profits rose 8.6 per cent and shares added 0.6 per cent to $36.59 after the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup missed analyst expectations. Sales volume rose but the company cut prices
to attract cash-conscious
shoppers.Starbucks added 2.3 per cent to $32.59 after analysts at Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the coffee chain by placing it on their “conviction buy” list, saying it has not yet saturated the US market.They gave the stock a $44 price target, 38 per cent higher than the stock’s previous closing price.Meanwhile, Transocean, which fell on Wednesday after it was among the companies that the US government sued over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, dropped further and was down 3.6 per cent to $69.31 after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the oil rig owner from “overweight” to “equal weight”."
102;GIS;General Mills;2010-12-16T13:31:34Z;Discounting holds back General Mills;;General Mills, the US cereal maker, reported sales of $4.1bn for its second quarter, up 1 per cent from the same period a year earlier, as a 3 per cent increase in volume was mostly offset by reduced prices.The company said its gross margin was off from robust numbers in calendar 2009, reflecting an increase in commodity costs.In the US, General Mills had difficulty replicating strong results from a year ago, with sales flat at $2.85bn, and operating profits down 4 per cent to $687m. Sales of the company’s brand-name cereals were down 2 per cent in the quarter, in contrast to last year, when the company reported a 10 per cent gain over 2008.The company’s international performance in the quarter was stronger, with sales growing 4 per cent to $749m over the comparable period last year. Volume was 8 per cent higher, while adverse currency moves reduced sales results by 3 per cent.Excluding currency translation, General Mills international sales were up 7 per cent, paced by a 17 per cent rise in Latin America, 10 per cent in Asia-Pacific and a 7 per cent gain in Europe.The company’s earnings per share rose 11 per cent in the quarter, to 92 cents per share, aided by several tax issues and mark-to-market commodity positions. Without those special items, EPS would have been down one penny to 76 cents for the quarter, from 77 cents a year earlier.Ken Powell, chief executive, said: “We expected the first half of this fiscal year to be particularly challenging, and it was. We were lapping very strong growth by our company in the same period a year ago, including 16 per cent segment operating profit growth and a 22 per cent increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.“In addition, the operating environment in the first half of 2011 included high levels of price promotion by food manufacturers and retailers.”
103;GIS;General Mills;2010-12-07T22:58:19Z;Consumer products: Material difference;With rising prices and economies weak, the industry has a conundrum;"Bread riots in Mozambique. Price controls mooted in China. In South Korea, a slashing of cabbage import tariffs to keep the fiery national dish of kimchi on family tables. And in the west, warnings from consumer companies that our evening supper, weekend pint and Friday night frock are all going to cost, give or take, 5-8 per cent more next year.Food and clothing inflation is back with a vengeance. Wheat has risen in price by nearly two-thirds in the past six months and cotton by almost three-quarters.“The age of ever decreasing clothing prices is over,” Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, the UK fashion retailer, said recently. “I don’t think we are necessarily going to see forever rising prices, but I think the era of ever falling prices is finished.”In other words, a generation that has grown up with food and clothing deflation – courtesy, largely, of China’s arrival as a manufacturing powerhouse – must now get used to paying more for the shirts on their backs and the bread on their table. The options: less breakfast cereal in the carton and hair-raisingly static-inducing nylon shirts, or pummelled profit margins for the global food and clothing industry.Investors, too, are as a result preparing for a new landscape of reduced profitability or greater consolidation. Western central bankers may meanwhile have to grapple with the dilemma facing their counterparts in Beijing: how can monetary policy be corralled to temper inflation?The timing could not be worse for consumers, whose income is being eroded by austerity measures such as tax rises. As Richard Hyman, strategic retail adviser to Deloitte, the consultancy, puts it: the question is whether consumers will “literally and metaphorically wear price increases”.The vigour of the latest surge in input costs has taken some by surprise. John Bason is chief financial officer at Associated British Foods, which apart from its business in sugar and groceries also owns Primark, the European discount retailer famed for its £2 T-shirts and £5 trousers. That gives Mr Bason a 360-degree window on input inflation. “It’s much more of an issue than we thought in the summer,” he says.Dealing with higher input prices, while seeking to protect – or even expand – profit margins without scaring off febrile consumers is the conundrum now facing the industry.Diversified food producers, such as Nestlé of Switzerland and the UK’s Unilever, spend about one-third of their sales on raw materials, including packaging. That means they face higher costs of around 5-6 per cent, estimates Michael Steib, analyst at Morgan Stanley. This broadly chimes with guidance for cost inflation of 4-5 per cent from General Mills of the US.The industry is divided on the severity of the threat. For some, volatile commodity costs are part and parcel of their industry: sometimes a tailwind, sometimes a headwind. Indeed, some say headline-grabbing rises in wheat prices make it easier to add 5 or 10 cents or pence to the price of bread – enough to cover increased costs and a few more pennies besides, which drop straight down to retailers’ and manufacturers’ profit lines for every loaf they sell.Others say we are in for the long haul. “Current agrocommodity market inflation is a consequence of lower production yields and unprecedented increases in demand from Asia,” says Pier Luigi Sigismondi, Unilever’s chief supply chain officer. “Additionally, the world is losing arable land at a rate of about 40,000 square miles a year. That is land being used for biofuel production, while climate change is eroding away topsoil. Farmers will need to produce more food with less land.”Morgan Stanley’s Mr Steib is in the same camp. “Longer term, agricultural commodities have only one way to go, and that’s up,” he says. “Simply because you’ve got a rising population, more health-conscious consumers and less arable land. The food industry needs to come to terms with that. Companies will have to continue to optimise their cost bases in order to deal with long-term structurally higher input prices.”There are several ways manufacturers can deal with this: those include hedging or forward buying, shaving costs, reformulating products, substituting lower-priced commodities and passing price rises on to their customers, in other words the retailers. But whatever they do, some of the effect will inevitably be felt by consumers.…Hedging alone is no panacea. “Whatever your hedging methods, you cannot buck market trends forever,” says Mark Hughes, who as global procurement director for Premier Foods oversees a £1.1bn ($1.7bn) annual spend on ingredients and packaging.Much depends on geography, as Bernstein Research’s Trevor Stirling points out. Prices for barley, used in beer, have been on “a massive rollercoaster” in Europe over the past five years, he says, ranging from €300 ($402) a tonne to below €100 in the first half of this year.But the impact varies widely. In western Europe, where most brewers are covered at least partially for 2011, the damage is muted. Even better is the US, where contracts of two to three years mean the average cost of malting barley was down by one-fifth in October year-on-year, the soaring spot price notwithstanding. In Russia, hedge books are shorter and problems in the local market forced brewers to import from western Europe, entailing additional transport costs.Along with hedging, companies such as SABMiller, Unilever and Premier Foods are sharpening up on procurement. SABMiller recently set up centralised systems that give it more clout in buying raw materials such as glass – previously, negotiations were carried out with the same glass supplier, Owens-Illinois, but at regional level. “Although they knew we are big, we never really used that muscle,” says Graham Mackay, chief executive. “Now we are able to get better prices out of them.”Centralising procurement similarly allows for more standardisation and thus more bulk buying. Premier, whose products range from Hovis bread to Branston baked beans, says last year it was buying 28 types of black pepper across the group; it has ground that down to five. Local sourcing, for reasons including sustainability, plays a role too: cassava, for example, goes into some stock cubes and African beers.Further, companies are striving to make processes more flexible to enable ingredient substitution; some even turn this to a marketing advantage. Take Unilever: as the world’s largest buyer of vegetable oils and fat, rising edible-oil prices affected the Anglo-Dutch giant during the last price spike in 2007-08. Discovering that lemon peel allowed it to slash the oil quotient in its mayonnaise, while maintaining the same taste, Unilever managed to reduce its oil bills as well as earn Brownie points for lowering its carbon footprint and doing its bit to reduce obesity. Fashion retailers are also going back to the design table, switching fabrics and restyling. Some are replacing cotton with nylon or viscose, a wood by-product typically used in knitted fabrics. One senior retailer says that whereas a man’s shirt may have been made of 100 per cent cotton last year, this year it could be 80 per cent cotton and 20 per cent polyester.At the bottom end of the market, where most retailers are seeking to hold prices, the mix could become closer to 50-50. “My entry price point will be 50 per cent cotton, 50 per cent polyester,” he says. “The further you go down the value chain, the more man-made fabrics you will find.”But the rush to find alternatives to cotton is pushing up the price of synthetic fibres, with polyester estimated to be up by a double-digit percentage.Another senior retail executive expects retailers to modify products at opening price points – what the industry calls the cheapest end of a range. “If your opening price of £18 had to go up to £20 you would introduce polyester. With jeans you can always put one less wash in. There are always ways you can engineer your prices down.” But making such money-saving tweaks can be a gamble. “The risk with doing that is the customer sees that, and you undermine the credibility of your entire brand.”At the other end of the spectrum, retailers can inject more fashion flair into garments, which means they can charge higher prices for them. On a man’s shirt, says the first senior retailer, this could mean “reverse trimming” the cuffs, that is, putting a different fabric on the inside of the cuff to that on the outside, so that it becomes a feature. Alternatively, there may be a narrow band of fabric around the edge of the collar, through a taping or piping, to add more detail.Women’s garments can be lined with a higher quality fabric or stitched in a contrasting colour. Dresses or tops can be embellished with beading or sequins. There can be more gathers, folds or tucks, or more lace and trimmings. All this detail means shoppers may be willing to pay more. “If I spend £1, I can put £3 on the selling price, but the customer is seeing a lot more,” says the retailer.…There are always retailers – such as Primark, at the bottom end of the clothing scale – who will have to take higher costs on the chin. These days, that is increasingly true in food, too. Take turkey, as much a birthright for Americans on Thanksgiving as it is for the British at Christmas. Although prices for the festive bird are up 25 per cent so far this year, most retailers are selling them below cost, says Meredith Adler at Barclays Capital.But ultimately, at least some of the extra buck is passed to the consumer. Some, have already done so, such as Kraft with coffee. Three months ago the US food giant responded to higher coffee bean prices with an 11 per cent increase in the cost to retailers of its Maxwell House brand; some stores passed the rise on to consumers.Brewers, along with a slew of food and clothing companies, are following suit; the price of clothes is expected to rise by a figure approaching double digits early next year. All are nervously watching to see whether consumers balk, seeking to ensure that their margins are preserved even at the cost of falling top-line revenues.Early evidence suggests manufacturers are succeeding in passing on higher prices, at least for now. “We’ve come out of the shoot, and quickly responded with pricing. We’re entering that into a generally weak consumer environment, but so far we’re quite pleased with the reaction from our customers, direct customers, retail partners – and the consumer response has been OK as well,” Tim McLevish, Kraft chief financial officer, told investors last month.But for most the jury is still out. “The consumer,” says Mr Bason: “That’s the $64m question. Consumers are quite resilient today, but maybe if it’s a constant diet of bad news we will start to see a real change in consumer behaviour. That’s the tightrope that food manufacturers and retailers are walking.”………………………………………………..AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIESAs reserves fall, it will take more than a bumper crop to bring prices downAgricultural commodity prices have surged in the past month to peaks last seen at the height of the 2007-08 food crisis, writes Javier Blas . The rise comes on the back of a string of drought-induced crop failures in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan – all leading cereal exporters. The shortage has been aggravated by the imposition of export restrictions that triggered panic buying.Other nations, from the US to Indonesia, are reaping smaller than expected harvests of corn, wheat and palm oil. With demand booming as developing nations such as China or India emerge from the global economic crisis, the shortfall is denting reserves.The price spikes mean that this year the total amount that countries pay for imported food will exceed $1,000bn for only the second time, according to the UN. The 2010 bill is up nearly 15 per cent from last year and within a whisker of an all-time high of $1,031bn set during the food crisis in 2008.“We are in a dangerous zone,” says Jacques Diouf of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. “Unless countries manage the situation carefully, we could end up in another crisis.”But he adds that the world is not there yet, noting that, in contrast with 2007-08, riots in emerging countries have so far been small.The FAO’s benchmark food price index, tracking the wholesale cost of wheat, corn, rice, oilseeds, dairy products, sugar and meats, last month stood at more than 20 per cent higher than a year ago. The index has been higher only during a brief period in mid-2008 at the peak of the food crisis. The Rome-based organisation has painted a worrying outlook for 2011, warning that unless farmers “expand substantially” their planted acreage and weather is favourable, the world should “be prepared” for even higher prices. Traders believe that even a bumper crop will not cut prices significantly as inventories are low.Wheat prices this week hit their highest since mid-2008, trading in Paris above €235 a tonne, up from €130 in January. Corn is near a two-year high, trading in Chicago between $5.50 and $6.0 a bushel, an increase of 50 per cent since the start of the year. Oilseeds such as soyabean, palm oil or rapeseed are also at a two-year high. Sugar recently hit its highest price since 1980. Rice, the staple food of 3bn people in Asia, is the only agricultural commodity yet to spike significantly, thanks to a large crop in the south-east of the continent."

The Yoplait brand, the world’s second-biggest yoghurt brand by sales, is jointly owned by PAI and Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative.Among the interested bidders are multinational groups General Mills of the US, which owns the Yoplait franchise in North America, Bright Food of China and Switzerland’s Nestlé.Last month, the joint owners of Yoplait rejected a €1.4bn ($1.8bn) takeover bid for the whole of Yoplait from French private dairy company Lactalis as too low. The strategic investment fund has had approaches from a number of interested bidders, looking for financial and political backing in what is already a highly sensitive deal. The fund has said it would be prepared to take a minority stake, as long as it retained a role in the governance of the group.Yoplait’s owners are believed to prefer an international partner to help the brand expand into emerging markets.But the French government has signalled that it would not be prepared to see control of a homegrown global champion pass into foreign hands.Even though only 50 per cent of the group is for sale, Sodiaal has said it would be prepared to see its 50 per cent stake in the industrial operations diluted to a significant minority. However, it wants to keep its 50 per cent in the vehicle that owns the Yoplait brand and controls its franchise business, which accounts for 75 per cent of the brand’s total €4bn in sales.Bruno Le Maire, agriculture minister, recently gave voice to the government’s concerns in an interview with Libération newspaper. “Our concern is to make sure the interests of French producers and the jobs in our agro-food industries are well protected,” he said.
105;GIS;General Mills;2010-11-18T14:25:57Z;Yoplait owners set to reject €1.4bn Lactalis bid;;The joint owners of Yoplait are poised to announce that they have rejected a €1.4bn takeover bid for one of the world’s best-known yoghurt brands from French private dairy company Lactalis.French private equity group PAI Partners and farmers’ co-operative Sodiaal are expected to say they have rejected Lactalis’s “unsolicited offer” because they would prefer to find an international partner to help Yoplait expand into emerging markets.Yoplait’s owners believe Lactalis’s offer undervalues the company and are unwilling to accept its bid to acquire 100 per cent of the company, as Sodiaal wants to keep a significant interest in the business.The rejection of Lactalis’s bid could spark a politically sensitive battle over the future of Yoplait. Lactalis has presented its bid as the best way to ensure that Yoplait stays in French hands.Yoghurt has sometimes been described as a “strategic sector” in France after the government raced to fend off a rumoured bid by PepsiCo of the US for Yoplait’s bigger rival Danone in 2005.Lactalis had hoped to gain an advantage over rivals by making its offer for Yoplait – the world’s second-biggest yoghurt brand by sales – some two weeks before a formal tender process for PAI’s 50 per cent stake is launched next month.Other companies reported to have shown interest include General Mills of the US, which owns the Yoplait franchise in North America, Bright Food of China and Nestlé of Switzerland.Sodiaal wants to keep its 50 per cent in the vehicle that owns the Yoplait brand and controls its franchise business, which accounts for 75 per cent of the brand’s total €4bn ($5.4bn) in sales.The farmers’ co-operative is prepared to see its 50 per cent stake diluted in the vehicle that controls the operations of Yoplait but it intends to keep a significant minority stake.“Trying to break down the door is not really the best way to build a long-term partnership,” said a person familiar with the situation.The fight to win control of Yoplait promises to be fierce and the government is likely to take a close interest in its fate. France is the world’s third-biggest exporter of agricultural and food products and public opinion is highly sensitive to the fate of its agri-food industry. Apart from Lactalis, all other bidders are based outside France.Lactalis management hopes this will encourage the government to look favourably on its bid, after voicing its concern over the group’s attempt this year to buy Emmental cheesemaker Entremont, eventually acquired by Sodiaal. The government had been concerned about strengthening Lactalis’s hold on the dairy industry, with many farmers fearing they could lose milk supply contracts.A person familiar with the situation said PAI and Sodiaal were convinced that if the farmers’ co-operative kept most of its stake in the company it would be enough to convince the government to allow a foreign bidder to win the auction.Lactalis is the world’s third-biggest dairy group, with the high-volume brands President and Galbani in its portfolio.
106;GIS;General Mills;2010-11-17T15:00:15Z;Lactalis bids €1.3bn for yoghurt group Yoplait;;The battle for one of the world’s best known yoghurt brands has been launched in earnest after French private dairy company Lactalis tabled a bid of €1.3bn ($1.8bn) for Yoplait.Lactalis hopes to gain an advantage over rivals by making its offer for all of the world’s second-biggest yoghurt brand by sales some two weeks before a formal tender process for a 50 per cent stake is launched next month by the company’s owners.Others rumoured to be interested include General Mills of the US, which has the Yoplait franchise in North America, Bright Food of China and Nestlé of Switzerland.Yoplait is jointly owned by French private equity group PAI Partners, which recently said it wanted to sell its stake, and the farmers’ co-operative Sodiaal. Though the farmers group has said it does not intend to sell its 50 per cent, Lactalis is hoping to win Sodiaal over by offering it a share in the profits and management of the Yoplait franchise business – which accounts for 75 per cent of the brand’s total €4bn ($5.4bn) in sales.“Lactalis has always developed the companies it has bought and we have a long tradition of investing in and developing external growth,” the group said.However the farmers’ cooperative is unlikely to be convinced at this price, according to a person close to Sodiaal. “Lactalis is trying to rally support from all the French establishment, but it didn’t work. The price is too low and we’ll probably shove them off and start the (tender) process,” said the person.The fight to win control of Yoplait promises to be fierce and the government is likely to take a close interest in its fate. Yoghurt has sometimes been described as a “strategic sector” in France after the government raced to fend off a rumoured bid by PepsiCo of the US for Yoplait’s bigger rival Danone in 2005. France is the world’s third-biggest exporter of agricultural and food products and public opinion is highly sensitive to the fate of its agri-food industry.The Lactalis bid would have the advantage of keeping the Yoplait brand under French control, said one person close to the subject, while all the other interested parties are foreign. Lactalis “is a 100 per cent French project,” he said.Lactalis management is hoping this will encourage the government to look favourably on its bid, after voicing its concern over the group’s attempt this year to buy Emmental cheesemaker Entremont, eventually acquired by Sodiaal. The government had been concerned about strengthening Lactalis’s hold on the struggling dairy industry, with many farmers fearing they could lose milk supply contracts to Lactalis’s existing suppliers.Lactalis is the world’s third-biggest dairy group, with the high volume brands President and Galbani in its portfolio.
107;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Unilever forecasts food price growth;;"Food inflation is returning in force, with Unilever the latest company to forecast price growth this year.The Anglo-Dutch group, which has seen negative pricing for five straight quarters, said Latin America had reversed course to become the first region to weather price rises.This follows similar comments from food producers General Mills and Kellogg, the latter of which said it expected to raise prices by 200 to 300 basis points next year.Until 2007, Britons had benefited from nearly a decade of food price deflation.Jean-Marc Huët, Unilever’s chief financial officer, said: “As pricing turns positive by the end of the year, and will be positive for next year, that together with savings will fund input cost rises.”Martin Deboo, analyst at Investec, said: “There has been a lot of apprehension about whether pricing power is going to come through, but I think the anecdotal evidence is that it is happening.”Unilever’s comments came as it surprised the market with a better than expected set of third-quarter results.Organic sales growth rose 3.6 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter while the underlying operating margin – which many analysts expected to narrow – expanded by 20 basis points.Alex Sloane at Evolution Securities said the results “show the business model is intact and represent continued progress on all three of the priorities laid out” by Paul Polman, chief executive.These are volume growth, which at 6 per cent in the first nine months of the year marks a 25-year record, sustainable margin expansion and progress on cash flow.However, margins benefited from savings on overheads, some of which will reverse next quarter, and margins were lower in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and central Europe, as well as in the Americas.● FT CommentPaul Polman famously dislikes the short-termism of quarterly hits and misses; investors just as famously lap them up. At the second quarter his downbeat tone sent the shares southward. In spite of Unilever’s protestations on Thursday that performance was merely “solid”, investors whooped, lifting the shares 6 per cent. Much of this is catch-up. Unilever has underperformed its peers and seen its stock derated from about 15 times forward earnings at the start of the year to 13.5 times now. The group has its issues: acquisitions it would rather forget (Slim-Fast, bought for $2.3bn) and a big but sluggish spreads business. Yet more than half of sales come from fast-growing emerging markets, injecting a welcome note of raciness to that solid performance. The catch-up is long overdue.Additional reporting by Greg Farrell in New York"
108;GIS;General Mills;2010-11-01T19:32:25Z;P&G woos more brand tie-ups;;"Bob McDonald, the chief executive of Procter & Gamble, has said he wants the company to step up its work with external partners on new consumer products to deliver at least $3bn in annual sales growth by 2015, up from around $1bn currently.“We need bigger innovations, that create more value,” Mr McDonald told a meeting with companies and research institutions that work with P&G.“We want to be the partner of choice …we want you to come to us with your big ideas first,” he said.The sales target would shift the share of P&G’s annual sales growth derived from products developed with external partners from around 25 per cent currently, to more than 60 per cent, if organic sales grow by 5 per cent annually over the five-year period.It builds on the industry-leading “connect and develop” programme launched by AG Lafley, Mr McDonald’s predecessor, in 2001. He wanted to make Procter, the world’s largest consumer goods company with global brands such as Tide, more outward looking and set a goal of having outside partners involved in at least half the new products brought to market.The initiative led to high-profile deals such as P&G’s joint venture with Clorox, a rival consumer goods company, in 2004, which created Glad brand ForceFlex rubbish bags. Its successful Olay Regenerist anti-ageing cream was developed with Sederma, a small French skin technology company, while its Swiffer cleaning products use technology licensed from Japan’s Uni-charm.P&G now says that external partners are involved in around 60 per cent of its product launches. Bruce Brown, P&G’s chief technology officer, said the new sales target represented an important shift to “value creation, against just measuring a number of connections”.“What we really want to do now is say, ‘What are the biggest opportunities that we want to address, and are we looking outside to make the right corrections?” he said.P&G’s current partners include Alibaba, the Chinese web services company; General Mills and ConAgra, the US food companies; and in research institutions India’s Council for Scientific and Industry Research and the US government’s Los Alamos defence research laboratory.Mr McDonald told the Financial Times that he believed P&G could easily meet the target. “Frankly I think we can do a lot better …nowadays it is almost remarkable to have an innovation that doesn’t have a connect and develop partner of some kind,” he said.P&G said it received 3,950 external proposals for joint projects last year. Roughly 75 per cent of its joint projects evolve from efforts to seek partners."
109;GIS;General Mills;2010-08-12T18:34:59Z;Hedging helps foodmakers through uncertainty;Derivatives are ensuring groups protect themselves from the turmoil;Imagine you supply the world’s biggest supermarket chains with breakfast cereals, bottled beer and sliced bread. Or that you are one of the world’s biggest meat producers, buying corn to feed cattle whose meat is your bottom line.Now imagine prices of wheat, corn and other agricultural commodities, which comprise much of your input costs, jump 50 per cent in a matter of weeks because of a drought in Russia that has caused catastrophic crop failure.Worse, Moscow slaps a ban on exports. That is exactly what has happened to companies such as Tyson Foods, Anheuser-Busch InBev, General Mills, Kellogg and Kraft. Contrary to the fears of many investors, however, these big food companies are likely to weather the turmoil in commodities markets.The reason? They learnt from bitter experience during the food crisis of 2007-08 and have protected themselves from the latest surge in prices by using derivatives, say bankers and industry executives.The benefits are already being felt. Companies have told investors that their commodity hedging strategies will largely insulate them from the effects of spiking wheat, corn and barley prices.In a conference call two weeks ago, when the magnitude of the Russian grain problem had become known, Kellogg executives told investors that the cereal and snack company was 90 per cent hedged on a range of commodities.Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, on Thursday said it had hedged its barley purchases through 2011, avoiding a big cost problem. The price of barley has doubled in the past month-and-a-half due to the drought in Russia and Ukraine.A few weeks earlier, before the Russian grain shortage suddenly worsened with the export ban, Don Mulligan, chief executive at General Mills, told investors that the food company was “about 50 per cent hedged” for the 2011 fiscal year, which began in June.The growing use of derivatives to lock in forward prices marks a big change from the situation multinational food producers found themselves in in 2007 and 2008, when they were caught offguard by sudden jumps in prices. Their attempts to pass on cost rises then sparked a consumer backlash.Many of the same companies that have hedged their exposures were those that suffered the last time round. Then, they were caught between rising input costs, which eroded their margins at the start of the crisis, and, later, anger at the price increases in shops, which drove customers away from their brands and into the arms of private label distributors.Bankers estimate that up to a third of the world’s largest food companies launched fresh hedging programmes in the aftermath of the 2007-08 crisis.“The price volatility we saw three years ago certainly raised the issue of ingredient cost to the boardroom,” says a banker who works closely with several large food companies. “It made chief financial officers more receptive to the ideas of hedging.”The 2007-08 crisis was for the food industry what the 1990-91 Gulf War spike in oil prices was for the world’s airlines: a wake-up call.Since then, says Will Shropshire, head of agricultural commodities at JPMorgan in London, companies “are paying more attention to price risk management and putting hedges in place”.For years, food companies did not worry too much about being caught out by unexpectedly steep price rises. Only the biggest groups hedged and, in most cases, they only bought protection for a few volatile commodities, such as coffee, sugar or cocoa.They sidelined other key agricultural commodities, from wheat and soyabeans to milk and corn, on the grounds the prices in those markets were relatively stable. Moreover, the convention in the industry was to pass on to consumers any rise in costs. Companies learnt in 2007-08 there was a limit to shoppers’ loyalty.As a result, they overhauled their forward buying practices and locked in prices through buying futures and options traded on commodities exchanges in Chicago, New York, London and Paris. They dealt directly, too, with Wall Street banks on bespoke “over-the-counter” derivatives deals that are not traded on exchanges. Bankers say most of the hedges were relatively simple compared to the more exotic derivatives common to other industries, such as natural gas or copper.The shift to hedging is work in progress. Some companies are still debating whether to use derivatives, while others have only just started. Steve Jesse, director of agricultural commodity sales at Barclays Capital in London, says the main shift in attitudes has happened over the past six to nine months.Hedging has become a strategic choice, too, rather than an opportunistic punt when, for example, prices fall.Even so, bankers say that the length of the hedges in the food industry is shorter than in other industries, such as energy or metals, where companies lock in prices up to 10 years ahead. As supplies of agricultural commodities vary each year depending on the weather, plant diseases and planting, companies are reluctant to lock in prices beyond 12-18 months.Gary Stibel, chief executive of the New England Consulting Group, warns, though, that hedging could itself lead to unexpected problems. Some multinationals, he says, bought too much protection in 2009, when prices were falling, adding to their costs then.Crises such as the one that has propelled wheat prices to their highest in nearly two years are rare. “Having some hedges is good. Having too much of a hedge is counterproductive. You’re dealing with black swan events,” he says.
110;GIS;General Mills;2010-08-06T15:03:38Z;Commodities sell-off eases wheat prices;;Wheat prices took a pause on Friday from their surge after Russia imposed a ban on grain exports on Thursday, which triggered a panic in commodities markets and sent wheat prices to their highest level since the 2007-08 global food crisis.The rally opens the door to a sharp increase in the price of everyday staples such as bread and flour.The market was frenetic on Friday amid talk of contract defaults following the ban, and as food companies and importing nations scrambled to find alternative supplies. In early trading, wheat prices in Chicago surged as much as 6 per cent, but later prices went down 3 per cent amid a general sell-off in commodities.Vladimir Putin, Russian prime minister, on Thursday announced the ban on all the country’s grain exports, effective within 10 days, after a severe drought devastated crops and wildfires spread across the country.The move, which caught traders and food producers by surprise, pushed the price of wheat to its highest level in two years and evoked memories of the last time the Soviet Union suffered a catastrophic crop failure in 1972.“There is full-blown panic in the European grain market,” a senior trader said.On Thursday, European wheat prices rose more than 12 per cent to hit a peak of €236 a tonne on record trading volumes. US wheat futures jumped by their daily limit to $7.85 a bushel and are up more than 80 per cent since mid-June, the fastest rally in nearly 40 years.On Friday, US wheat futures traded 2.8 per cent down to $7.65 a bushel, after hitting in early trading a two-year high of $8.41 a bushel.“Bottom line – no sign of a top as yet,” said Richard Feltes at brokerage MF Global in Chicago. “We think wheat end users are still short and at risk for further price gains,” he added, echoing a view widely held among grain traders.Another trader said that prices could continue to move higher next week amid panic buying, but that from a supply and demand point of view, prices probably have already risen enough. “That does not mean the rally is going to stop,” he added.The rally is triggering fears that food price inflation could take off and that the world could even suffer a repeat of the 2008 food crisis should the big shortfall in wheat output persist. “Soaring grain prices have brought food inflation back to centre stage,” said Joachim Fels of Morgan Stanley in London.Prices of other crops including barley, corn and rapeseed also jumped sharply.Shares in some of the world’s largest food companies tumbled on fears they would struggle to pass on all the increased costs of buying wheat to millions of households already suffering the effects of the financial crisis. However, several companies have already said they plan immediate price rises on goods, such as bread and biscuits.Unilever, the British consumer goods group, dropped 5.2 per cent, while General Mills, one of the world’s largest food companies, was 2.5 per cent lower. Nestlé fell 2.1 per cent. But the shares of trading companies such as ADM and Bunge surged on the prospect of more businesses exporting wheat from the US.On Thursday, Mr Putin told a cabinet meeting: “I think it would be expedient to introduce a temporary ban on export grains and other agricultural goods.”“We cannot allow an increase in domestic prices and we need to maintain the number of cattle.”The ban would take effect from August 15 and last until December 31, a spokesman for Mr Putin said.The worst drought in more than a century in the Black Sea region has led to widespread alarm. Forecasts for the Russian grain crop have been falling daily, with the agriculture ministry’s most recent projection at 70m-75m tonnes, down from 85m tonnes a fortnight ago.Last year, the harvest was 100m tonnes.Traders at Glencore, the world’s largest commodity trading company, on Tuesday warned the crop could fall to about 65m tonnes.Cargill, the world’s biggest trader of agricultural commodities, criticised Moscow’s move. “Such trade barriers further distort wheat markets by making it harder for supplies to move from areas of surplus to areas of deficit, and by preventing price signals from reaching wheat farmers,” it said.Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the Grain Union lobby group, said that the swift imposition of the ban risked undermining Russia’s reputation as a reliable supplier.Mr Putin said the government would disburse Rbs35bn ($1.17bn) in subsidies to agricultural producers. He added that Russia would use its grain stores for distribution without auction to regions in need

He also added that Russia would use its grain stores for distribution without auction to regions in need.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language.

113;GIS;General Mills;2010-07-21T18:52:31Z;Food brand sales to exploit hunger for defensive assets;;A swath of well-known food brands, including United Biscuits in the UK, Yoplait yoghurts in France and Sara Lee’s US bread business, are set to change hands as their owners capitalise on strong demand for defensive assets.The board of United Biscuits, which is owned by private equity groups Blackstone and PAI Partners, met on Tuesday to approve a £2bn ($3bn) sale of the UK’s leading snack maker in an auction this year.Despite the UK recession, United Biscuits has increased its operating profit by about a fifth since the maker of McVitie’s, Mini Cheddars, Jaffa Cakes and Penguin biscuits was acquired by the private equity groups for £1.6bn in October 2006.Elsewhere, PAI is holding a beauty contest between investment banks to decide who will run an auction of its 50 per cent stake in Yoplait, the second-largest yoghurt maker in France, which is likely to be valued at as much as €1.2bn ($1.5bn).While a sale of Yoplait could trigger a protectionist backlash in France, the auction is likely to draw interest from overseas rivals, such as Nestlé, General Mills and Arla Foods.In the US, Sara Lee is reported to have hired investment banks to sell its North American bread business, which could fetch about $1.5bn. The company declined to comment.The sale of United Biscuits, which has revenues of £1.3bn and net debt of £1.2bn, is likely to attract interest both from branded food manufacturers and private equity groups. Its owners are considering splitting the company into separate snacks and biscuits divisions.Owners of defensive assets – those that have proved resilient to the downturn – believe it is a good time to sell, particularly as private equity groups are in a rush to spend $1,000bn on deals before investors reclaim their money.“There is a vast amount of cash sitting on the sidelines competing for relatively few opportunities and if you have assets that are performing reasonably well then it is a great time to sell,” said one buy-out boss.Another food brand on the block is Van Houtte, Canada’s biggest gourmet coffee roasting company, which is close to being sold for about $750m, according to people familiar with the situation.

115;GIS;General Mills;2010-06-29T22:47:44Z;General Mills sees rising sales costs;;After a year of decreasing input costs which contributed to strong earnings announced on Tuesday, General Mills predicts that inflationary pressures will add 4.5 per cent to its costs of goods sold in fiscal 2011.The Minneapolis-based cereal and snack company told investors and analysts on its earnings call that rising costs of the ingredients used to make its products, particularly in dairy, would cut into its net sales and operating profits for this coming year. In the past year, the company said its input costs had declined by 3 per cent.For its fiscal fourth quarter, which closed last month, General Mills reported net sales of $3.7bn, down 2 per cent from the comparable period a year earlier, when the fourth quarter had an extra week. On a comparable weeks basis, the company said its sales would have been up 4 per cent.For the full year, the company’s sales were $14.8bn, barely above the prior year’s sales, but its cost of sales dropped by 5.6 per cent, helping General Mills boost its operating profit to $2.6bn, a 12 per cent rise over 2009’s operating profit.Over the past two years, General Mills has enjoyed strong growth, paced by robust sales of breakfast cereal in the US, as a recessionary economy and lower input costs fueled outsized gains. Net sales for the company’s “Big G” cereals, including Cheerios, were up 11 per cent in 2009 over 2008, and the company reported on Tuesday a 5 per cent rise in 2010 over the previous year.Ken Powell, General Mills chief executive, said the current economic environment is favorable for food companies. “The consumer mindset is favorable for our kind of company”, he told the Financial Times. “The grocery store is a great place to look for value. People are cooking more at home. These are nice, highly-growing categories”.“Both 2009 and 2010 benefited from more people eating at home”, said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. “This company has been on a pretty darned good run”.Shares in General Mills were off in after-hours trading on Tuesday, since the inflation warning was almost twice what the market was expecting, said Mr Russo. The biggest challenge facing the company, he says, is whether it can raise its prices to keep up with rising input costs. Walmart in particular has been firm in its insistence that suppliers hold the line and not try to pass through cost increases to customers.

Consumer confidence was worse than expected this month, falling to 52.9 from 62.7 in May. The US Conference Board revised its leading economic indicator index for China in April to a rise of only 0.3 per cent from its previously reported 1.7 per cent.“It just demonstrates the current level of risk aversion and fear that a two-month-old piece of data on China, coming out of the US, can spook the markets so much,” said Uri Landesman, president at Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund.He expects trading to remain range-bound in the near term and the S&P to retest support levels at the 1,401 level.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 3.1 per cent to 1,041.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.7 per cent to 9,870.30 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.9 per cent to 2,135.18.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, was up 21.8 per cent to 35.31.Industrial stocks were some of the hardest hit on Tuesday as worries about the strength of the global economy mounted.Textron, a conglomerate active in the aircraft, defence and industrial sectors, was one of the biggest fallers as it dived 10 per cent to $16.80.Deere & Company, the agricultural equipment maker, lost 5.3 per cent to $55.43, General Electric declined 3.5 per cent to $14.48 and Terex Corp, a commercial equipment manufacturer, dropped 7.4 per cent to $19.03.Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, slid 5.5 per cent to $60.85. The company said late on Monday that it planned to buy out one of its partners in a Chinese joint venture.The materials sector also underperformed the main indices on worries about the strength of demand should the global economy slow down.Titanium Metals Corp lost 9 per cent to $17.82, AK Steel declined 9.4 per cent to $12.07 and Cliffs Natural Resources dropped 10.9 per cent to $48.49.Bank of America dropped 4.4 per cent to $14.57, Wells Fargo fell 4.1 per cent to $25.93 and JPMorgan Chase declined 3.8 per cent to $37.06 following a report by Moody’s arguing that the three largest US debit card issuers may lose a combined $1.38bn in annual revenue from the proposed cap on interchange fees being considered by Congress.Tesla Motors, an electric car company that has yet to make a profit, priced its initial public offering above its forecast range to raise $226m. Its shares were up 40.5 per cent on their first trading day. The maker of the $109,000 Roadster sold 13.3m shares at $17 each after offering them in a range of $14-$16.Zimmer Holdings, the maker of surgical products, was one of the S&P 500’s best performers as it gained 0.1 per cent to $54.60. The stock was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs on Tuesday.Barnes & Noble, the book retail chain, fell 19.1 per cent to $13.27 after reporting a fourth-quarter loss that was bigger than analysts had expected.Shares in Emerson Electric, a diversified global technology company, were
3.5 per cent lower to $43.29.The company raised its previous offer for Chloride, a London-listed power solutions group, to 375p per share from the 275p-per- share offer made in April, which was rejected by Chloride. It hopes the move will break up an agreed bid for the Chloride from ABB, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group.Consumer staples stocks, typically seen as a defensive sector, were among the session’s best performers in a falling market. The group was led by Procter & Gamble, which fell 0.5 per cent to $60.32. Clorox was down 1.1 per cent to $62.73 and Johnson & Johnson lost 0.4 per cent to $59.24.General Mills, maker of products such as Lucky Charms and Cheerios cereals, was down 1.3 per cent to $36.90, even after it said it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 14 per cent compared with last quarter to 28 cents per share."
117;GIS;General Mills;2010-06-29T00:00:25Z;General Mills gives a taste on cereal growth;;Earnings at General Mills, which are to be announced on Tuesday, will give a clear indication on whether the breakfast cereal business in the US can continue its impressive growth rate.The sector, which generates $9.7bn in annual sales, is dominated by General Mills and the leading brand, Kellogg, which together account for more than 60 per cent of sales, according to data from Symphony IRI, a market research firm.“This has been one of the best categories in packaged foods over the past two years,” said Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital, who estimates that the sector grew by 6 per cent in each of the past two years, a level previously considered unsustainable for a household staple.The sector benefited in fiscal 2009 from a combination of the recession, which drove cash-strapped consumers to seek affordable breakfast foods, and an easing in the price of grain. In late 2007 and 2008, rising prices of wheat and oats added to production costs and drove retail prices up.Recent results from Kellogg suggest that sales are likely to be less buoyant in 2011. In an April earnings announcement, Kellogg said its North American cereal sales increased by only 0.5 of a percentage point in the first quarter, compared to 6 per cent in the same period in 2009. The company also said that consumers were buying on promotion and shopping for cereal at club stores and dollar stores, where prices are generally lower.By contrast, General Mills reported a 6 per cent gain in cereal sales for the quarter which ended in February, driven by sales of line extensions of its popular Cheerios and Wheaties brands, and by innovation in its children’s cereals, particularly Lucky Charms and Trix. General Mills also ramped up its advertising spending during the period by 27 per cent, which translated into stronger sales.Sales of the third-largest brand, Post, which was acquired from Kraft by Ralcorp, have flagged in the competitive environment. Ralcorp, a private label consolidator, lowered its guidance last week based on declining sales of its cereal.In spite of the increased General Mills spending, Kellogg remains the industry leader in cereal advertising, says Christopher Growe of Stifel Nicolaus Research, with about 9 per cent of its sales going into paid media, while General Mills’ advertising budget is between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent.Mr Growe predicted that General Mills would report an increase of 3 per cent in revenues for its fourth quarter on Tuesday and that the cereal sector as a whole will continue to grow, albeit at a more measured level in the low single-digits.General Mills said it did not rely heavily on trade promotion to fuel its sales in the quarter which ended in February, although analysts expect trade promotions to be the norm in fiscal 2011.

Things don’t always go smoothly.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,116.03, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,434.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher to 2,307.16.AOL advanced 1.7 per cent to $22.65 after the company sold Bebo, its social-networking site, to Criterion Capital Partners, a California private investment firm, for less than 2 per cent of what it paid for the site. It expects to record a tax benefit this quarter of $275m to $325m from the sale. The media company bought Bebo for $850m two years ago.US-listed shares in BP were 0.4 per cent lower at $31.71 as Tony Hayward, chief executive, testified to Congress.Shares in DryShips dropped 5.1 per cent to $4.09 after the dry bulk carrier vessel operator, which owns ultra-deep water drilling rigs, was downgraded from “outperform” to “neutral” at Credit Suisse and the share price target lowered from $8 to $5.The broker said that “given all of the uncertainty following the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, we expect a continued soft patch for the deep water rig sector in the near term”.JM Smucker, which makes Smucker’s jams and Jif peanut butter, advanced 6.6 per cent to $61.55 as the company said it expected full-year profit of at least $4.50 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $4.39 per share.Consumer staple stocks were some of the session’s best performers. Kroger, a supermarket chain, rallied 3.3 per cent to $20.75; Supervalu gained 6.1 per cent to $13.24; while General Mills climbed 1.6 per cent higher to $38.93.Pier 1 Imports, a retailer of imported furniture, added 2.2 per cent to $8.20, after it posted quarterly profit of 7 cents per share, compared with an expected 2-cent loss.M&T Bank Corp was up 9 per cent to $89.34. Matias Rodriguez Inciarte, the deputy chairman at Santander, the eurozone’s largest bank by market capitalisation, said it had held talks to merge its US operations with M&T, but declined to make further comment.Annaly Capital Management, a New York real estate investment trust, declined 0.5 per cent to $17.50 as the stock was lowered from “buy” to “neutral” at Sterne Agee.Toll Brothers retreated 4 per cent to $18.03 as the largest US luxury homebuilder said deposits in the past three weeks were about 20 per cent lower compared with last year.“Concerns about the financial crisis in Europe and escalating regional political tensions, coupled with worries about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and its effects on the economy and the environment have negatively impacted the outlook of American consumers,” said Joel Rassman, chief financial officer.Homebuilders and housing-related stocks were among the biggest fallers. Pulte Group dropped 2.5 per cent to $9.51, DR Horton fell 2.7 per cent to $10.94 and KB Home lost 3 per cent to $12.54.Home Depot, a home improvement retail chain, lost 0.7 per cent to $31.91.

119;GIS;General Mills;2010-06-10T22:10:10Z;Funding costs fall for US companies;;Borrowing costs for industrial companies in the US have plunged, allowing some groups to pay the lowest interest rates ever on long-term debt.The decline in funding costs reflects the sharp fall in US Treasury yields amid the surge in demand for low-risk investments as jitters about the eurozone debt crisis have escalated.For investment-grade companies including Altria, the tobacco maker, Duke Energy, the utility, Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceuticals group and General Mills, the food manufacturer, it has provided an opportunity to sell bonds with record low interest payments, according to Dealogic.The interest paid by companies is usually calculated relative to government bond yields.“All the problems in Europe again caused Treasury yields to fall,” said Allen Carrick, general manager of corporate finance at Duke Energy.“This created an opportunity for us. We are part of the flight to quality.”Duke Energy last week sold $450m of 10-year bonds that paid investors a coupon, or interest payment, of 4.3 per cent, the lowest the company has paid for debt of that maturity.This week, Altria sold bonds due in 2015 paying 4.125 per cent.The average yields on the bonds of investment-grade industrial companies recently approached 4 per cent, according to the Barclays Capital US Industrial Bond Index, the lowest level since the index was started in the early 1990s.The 10-year US Treasury bond has fallen to 3.27 per cent from more than 4 per cent in April.Even though the yield differential, or risk premium, between government bonds and corporate bonds has risen amid the flight to quality, the decline in bond yields has offset that spread increase for some groups.The all-in funding cost for companies with high credit ratings and stable prospects has therefore remained low or even fallen.“There is no question that borrowing costs are extremely low,” said Justin D’Ercole, head of Americas investment grade syndicate at Barclays Capital.For riskier investments, such as junk-rated US companies or European banks, this has not been the case.Despite the low funding costs, corporate issuance remains light. Many companies have boosted their cash levels since the crisis, and rushed to sell bonds early in the year when economists were predicting that interest rates would rise.Also, turmoil has resulted in lower levels of mergers and acquisitions.“There is relatively little new supply of investment-grade corporate debt, so demand for non-financial companies that do come to market is very strong,” said Jim Probert at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Some investors are, however, cautious about buying bonds at current levels. Any rise in yields would push down the price of bonds.“With very low yields, you don’t have a lot of room for error,” Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said.
120;GIS;General Mills;2010-06-03T15:59:55Z;Beyond carbon: Profligacy in a cup of coffee;;Walmart’s plan to extend carbon dioxide emissions reduction targets to its suppliers – aiming to cut 20m tonnes from its supply chain by the end of 2015 – indicates that, for some companies, climate change is integrated into corporate strategy.However, World Bio­diversity Day in May was a reminder that greenhouse gases are just one of a range of environmental impacts the corporate sector has to worry about.“There are different ways of looking at resource use, and it’s not just about energy,” says Dominic Searle, head of clean technology and renewable energy at RSM Tenon, a member of the global accountancy network RSM International.He cites the case of a cup of coffee and its water use. “The hundreds of litres it takes to produce that cup has an impact on the rest of the world, particularly in water-distressed areas where the beans are produced,” he says. “This message has yet to emerge, whether in financial markets or among individual consumers.”Among some companies, however, a more integrated approach is emerging. “We are seeing some great examples,” says Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental groups.She cites the case of General Mills, and its strategy on water and other environmental impacts. In its Green Giant division, the US group has worked with growers not only to cut water consumption but also minimise use of agricultural chemicals for all its main crops, setting tangible goals in areas such as insecticide application on maize, where it aims to make a 30 per cent cut over three years.This integrated approach appears to pay off for companies. In research conducted by Accenture, the consulting firm, of Fortune 1,000 companies, it found that the 30 highest financial performers also did well on sustainability. “And almost all those companies are looking beyond pure carbon,” says Peter Lacy, who heads Accenture’s sustainability services practice across Europe, Africa and Latin America.Mr Lacy points to Diageo as an example of a company that has taken an integrated approach. In addition to establishing aggressive carbon targets, he explains, the company is also focusing on reducing water consumption, introducing sustainable packaging codes and coming up with alternative materials to reduce waste.However, the integrated strategy embraced by General Mills and Diageo is not being universally adopted. For water consumption alone, even among organisations espousing sustainability, not all companies are factoring consumption into their decision-making processes.Mr Lacy sees a 20-40-40 division of companies, with 20 per cent now very concerned about water resources and the extent to which they could threaten their cost base and operations in the short term.He believes 40 per cent may be aware of water as an issue but do not yet know what it means for their business, while another 40 per cent have not even considered water as a risk.Ms Lubber would agree. She argues that sustainability practices are often piecemeal and seen only in a small group of high-profile companies. “We have to move from anecdotal, one-off projects to systemic, strategic movements,” she says.A recent study commissioned by IFS, a software company focused on lifecycle management, found that nearly half of top executives admitted their company did not have technology to track its environmental footprint on a continual basis.Moreover, if the number of companies considering waste, water and other environmental issues in their business strategies is increasing, those addressing the full spectrum of their impact on natural resources remain in the minority.Few companies, for example, have an understanding of their impact on biodiversity or their business exposure to its loss.And yet – in the food and agriculture sector in particular – many rely on healthy ecosystems and biodiversity to prevent soil erosion and provide protection from storms. Diverse natural resources also provide raw materials such as crops for food and fibres for textiles.Some sectors, such as mining, have been forced to address biodiversity. Often as a result of activist pressure, companies have developed not only mitigation strategies to address their impact on biodiversity but also rehabilitation plans, particularly after closure of a mine or quarry.However, few other companies have yet considered their impact on biodiversity. “I’m not sure biodiversity has been thought through, either on the downside, in terms of the impact, or the upside in terms of how you can harness biodiversity, particularly in supply chains,” says Mr Lacy.He believes biodiversity and ecosystems will start to enter the corporate consciousness. “This will become increasingly central,” he says.“Particularly as a number of organisations are beginning to think about the broader environmental services impact of their business.”
121;GIS;General Mills;2010-06-03T02:53:45Z;Rothschild to bolster US presence;;Rothschild, the investment bank, is bolstering its senior management in the US as the banking dynasty moves to take advantage of the growing demand for independent advice from companies globally.Jim Lawrence, co-founder of the LEK Partnership, a consulting firm, and most recently chief financial officer of Unilever, will become chief executive of Rothschild North America.He will also become co-head of global investment banking, the first time that role has been based in the US, alongside Nigel Higgins in London and Olivier Pecoux in Paris.Mr Higgins, who earlier this year became the first non-family member to lead the firm in Rothschild’s 212-year history, told the Financial Times that the time was right for a “step change” in the US after almost a decade of gradual expansion.“Over the last couple of years, the market globally has moved ever more towards recognising the benefits of truly independent, high-quality advice from an investment bank with a global footprint,” he said, highlighting the firm’s strength in emerging markets.Rothschild has close to 1,000 investment bankers globally, in more than 35 countries. The 140 bankers in North America currently generate about a fifth of the bank’s revenues.In appointing Mr Lawrence, Rothschild has plumped for a US chief executive with ample corporate experience rather than a traditional Wall Street resumé.After starting his career in management consulting, he held senior executive positions at PepsiCo, Northwest Airlines and General Mills.Mr Lawrence said on Wednesday of his background: “I’ve hired a lot of bankers and had the experience of working with a lot of bankers. I have some understanding of what the competition looks like out there.”He added that he saw a “tremendous opportunity” to leverage the Rothschild brand and build the business in the US.The dynasty traces its roots to 1798, when 21-year-old Nathan Mayer Rothschild arrived in England from Germany to start a textile business.Last year it ranked 14th in providing mergers and acquisitions advice in north America, according to Mergermarket, up from 24th in 2008.Rothschild advised various US government agencies on the bankruptcy of General Motors. It is reportedly advising a special committee of directors at AIG on repayment of the insurance company’s government debts.Other recent mandates include the acquisition of Volvo from Ford Motors by Geely, the Chinese carmaker, and CF Industries’ 14-month, hostile pursuit of Terra Industries.David de Rothschild remains executive chairman in North America and of the global bank. Christopher Lawrence and David Resnick, two of Rothschild’s most senior US bankers, will assume global, client-facing roles within the firm.
122;GIS;General Mills;2010-06-01T20:41:18Z;Wall Street lower on mixed data;;"US stocks bounced around the flat line on Tuesday but closed lower on the day, as the day’s mixed macroeconomic data gave support to both the bulls and the bears.Early in the session investors digested disappointing manufacturing reports from China, which suggested that future global economic growth might be weaker than previously expected.However, strong US manufacturing data provided evidence that a domestic recovery remains relatively unaffected by problems in the eurozone.The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing survey index fell less than expected by economists, to 59.7 in May, just off the six-year-high mark reached in April.Jim Dunigan, executive vice-president and managing executive of investments at PNC Wealth Management, was bullish on US growth prospects.He said: “The bottom line is that, in spite of all the negative news, the recovery here remains on track.” Mr Dunigan expects sectors that are most exposed to the recovery to perform best, namely technology and industrials.The S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,070.71, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 10,024.02 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent lower to 2,222.33.US-listed shares in BP sank 15 per cent to $36.52 as traders got their first chance to react to news that its latest attempt to cut the rate of oil leaking from its well in the Gulf of Mexico had failed.The company’s ‘top kill’ strategy failed to close the leak at the weekend, forcing it to start a long process of installing a cap on the well.There was also speculation that BP, whose shares have lost almost 40 per cent of their value since the spill begun, could be a takeover target.Transocean, the deep-water driller and owner of the oil rig, lost 11.9 per cent to $50.04 and Halliburton, a contractor on the oil rig, declined 14.8 per cent to $21.15. Among the session’s biggest fallers were oil drillers and energy-related stocks. Diamond Offshoreslumped 7.3 per cent to $58.51, Smith Internationalfell 8.3 per cent to $34.45 and Schlumberger retreated 7.8 per cent to $51.75.Construction equipment maker Caterpillar declined 2.5 per cent to $59.27 after it said its Progress Rail Services unit would buy Electro-Motive Diesel for $820m in cash from Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group, two private equity groups.The target had $1.8bn in revenue last year.AIG fell 3.2 per cent to $34.25 as the insurer rejected a revised $30.4bn cash and shares offer by London-listed insurer Prudential for its Asian insurance business but remained in negotiations.RadioShack bucked the day’s downward trend and rallied 2.8 per cent to $21.01, making it one of the best performers of the session, on renewed rumours that the electronics retailer is in negotiations to sell itself.Reports named Blackstone Group, a private equity group, as a leading bidder. The deal may be worth as much as $3bn.Consumer staples companies were some of the strongest performers. Hershey, a confectioner, rallied 2.6 per cent to $48. The
company said it was planning to modernise and upgrade its manufacturing processes.Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola’s largest bottler, fell 0.8 per cent to $25.90 even as the stock was raised from “hold” to “buy” at Stifel Nicolaus.General Mills, a food and beverage group, added 1.1 per cent to $72, Dollar General, a discount retailer, gained 1 per cent to $30.54 and Walmart, a value retail chain, rose 0.7 per cent to $50.92.Apple gained 1.5 per cent to $260.83 as sales of its iPad portable computer device reached 2m, just two months after its launch. The target price on the stock was raised by at least two brokers.Barclays Capital and UBS, which have an “overweight” and a “buy” rating on Apple, respectively, both raised their price target from $315 to $320.Financials were lower. JPMorgan pulled back 2.6 per cent to $38.54 and Morgan Stanley lost 3.6 per cent to $26.13.Citigroup slipped 2.8 per cent to $3.85 even as Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jaber Al-Thani, Qatar’s prime minister, was reported to have said his government is considering buying a stake in the bank."
123;GIS;General Mills;2010-05-19T17:47:08Z;P&G goes online to compete for sales;;Procter & Gamble has started to sell brands direct to US consumers online for the first time, in a sign of how digital commerce is shaking up relations between retailers and their suppliers.The launch of P&G’s “eStore” site is part of the company’s drive to increase its total online sales. Such sales through retailers accounted last year for less than 1 per cent of its revenues of $79bn. The site will sell Pantene shampoo, Pampers baby products, Gillette razors and other brands.The eStore, which will also offer CoverGirl cosmetics, Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste, brings P&G into direct competition with e-commerce sites run by its retailer customers, including Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgreens.It will compete as well with a growing number of online-only retailers that show consumers are happy to buy items such as nappies and washing up liquid online, including Amazon, Drugstore.com and Diapers.com.P&G, the world’s largest consumer goods company, argues that the initiative represents a direct challenge for retailers, describing it as a “living learning lab” that will “help us listen, learn and collaborate with online shoppers”.Kirk Perry, vice-president of its North America operations, said the site “will help deliver new tools, services and features that can ultimately be shared with retailers” to the benefit of shoppers.However, Bob McDonald, P&G’s chief executive, has been more explicit than his predecessor, AG Lafley, in focusing on online sales, telling the Financial Times in an interview late last year: “I don’t feel the need to have every sale go through a retailer.“We want to maximise our sales through retailers but we also want to be where the consumer wants to shop,” he said.P&G said the site would also support online brand building through social networks, such as Facebook. The Facebook page of Pantene is currently using the eStore site to offer its more than 300,000 fans the opportunity to buy promotional bundles of its products.A number of other leading US consumer brands have also begun setting up e-commerce operations with Alice.com, which allows customers to amalgamate shopping for household and personal-care brands.Mark McGuire, president of Alice, said the company had more than 30 brand “store front” sites already running, with another 50 or so under development. “ We are seeing a huge wave of these in the last few months, of consumer companies saying they want to go direct to consumers, and a lot of that is about what P&G is doing.”
124;GIS;General Mills;2010-04-21T01:38:48Z;Food companies braced for salt curb;;US food companies might be facing new regulations that could force them to cut drastically the level of salt in processed food.This follows the release of an influential report on Tuesday that found that voluntary approaches by companies had failed to curb the problem.Kraft, General Mills and other large manufacturers of processed food have been awaiting the report by the Institute of Medicine, a federal health panel, for clues on how federal regulators at the Food and Drug Administration might act.The report said that while a “patchwork of voluntary approaches” offered by companies to reduce salt in food were “laudable”, the effort was not enough to reduce the overall salt content in the US food supply. Over-consumption of salt has been linked to high blood pressure and cardio vascular disease.The report found that Americans on average consume 50 per cent more salt per day than levels recommended by federal dietary standards.Under current regulations, sodium is considered a product that is “generally regarded as safe” at the FDA.In effect, such a classification means that the federal government has never set a limit on what amount of salt in food is actually safe.The Institute of Medicine called on the FDA to modify that standard, and create a limit on the level of salt that is deemed safe.“This change, when carried out in a stepwise manner, will reduce the sodium content of food supply slowly, in a way that should avoid making food unpalatable to consumers,” the report found.The FDA said it was closely examining the report’s findings but had not yet decided on whether to pursue new regulations.Pepsi, Kraft and ConAgra, among others, have already taken steps to reduce the amount of salt in the foods they sell.Kraft said it was working towards reducing salt in its North American portfolio by 10 per cent over the next two years.The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a top food lobby group, said it looked forward to working with the FDA to develop a new “national sodium reduction strategy”.Salt serves as a preservative and important flavour additive.Food groups have expressed concern that consumers will lack the appetite for salt-free foods, given the national taste for salty snacks.Companies are likely to push back on any attempt at greater regulation.
125;GIS;General Mills;2010-03-24T20:32:57Z;Weak housing figures damp US sentiment;standardise;"Mounting worries about the European sovereign debt situation curbed risk appetite, sending Wall Street stocks lower on Wednesday, with negative economic data also weighing on sentiment.New orders for durable goods in the US in February rose 0.5 per cent but missed analysts’ consensus projections for a 1 per cent gain.Sales of new homes in the US dropped for the fourth straight month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000 – the lowest since records begun in 1963.“Housing is the weakest link in the recovery story,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of Gamco’s global growth fund. “Real estate makes up about 50 per cent of bank assets. A lot of these mortgages are going delinquent. It’s one area I find troubling, which is why we have a low exposure to financial stocks.”However, Mr Ward regards the broader economic recovery as “very resilient”.At the close, the S&P 500 was down .06 per cent to 1,167.72, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.5 per cent to 10,836.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,398.76.One bright sport for the US housing market was Lennar Corp, the third-
largest US housebuilder by revenue, which rallied 3.7 per cent to $17.69 after reporting better quarterly earnings than were expected. Its loss was significantly lower than expected at 4 cents a share versus consensus analyst expectations of a 30 cents a share loss and better than its 98 cents a share loss last year.Gross margins surged to 19.2 per cent from 6.5 per cent a year earlier as the company cut incentives for potential buyers.“Virtually every metric outperformed our expectation,” wrote Stephen East, analyst at Ticonderoga in a client note. “No matter how one cuts it, this was a strong report.”Adobe Systems was one of the session’s biggest risers, advancing 3.7 per cent to $36.51 as the world’s leading graphic design maker forecast significantly stronger second-quarter sales than analysts were expecting.The company said it would launch a new version of its most profitable software – Creative Suite, which comprises design software such as Photoshop – on April 12.Market analysts expect Adobe profit from pent-up demand for the product as many customers avoided upgrading to the current version during the recession.Two tech stocks staged successful debuts, raising hopes for the still struggling initial public offerings market. MaxLinear, a maker of broadband chips, rallied 33.6 per cent above its initial listing price to $18.70 while Calix Networks, a telecoms equipment company, surged 16.2 per cent to $15.10.The oil and gas sector was broadly lower as the price of crude oil fell. Chevron lost 1.1 per cent to $73.93 while ExxonMobil retreated 0.7 per cent to $66.50.ConocoPhillips, the third- largest US oil company by market share, bucked the trend to close flat at $52.53 as the company announced plans to sell half of its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, in the next two years.Coal and natural gas producer Consol Energy added 1.9 per cent to $45.70 as the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” by John Bridges, an analyst at JPMorgan, with a nine-month target price of $53 a share.AK Steel gained 0.7 per cent to $23.33 after the steelmaker said it would record a non-cash charge of about $31m resulting from the US healthcare reform legislation. It is one of the first companies to take such a step following the passage of the bill on Sunday.MF Global rose 10.4 per cent to $8.08 as Jon Corzine, former New Jersey governor who ran Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, was appointed chief executive of the New York-based futures and options broker.General Mills slipped 1.9 per cent to $72.18 despite the food conglomerate posting solid quarterly earnings, aided by new product sales, a focus on cost-cutting and lower input costs.Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee shop chain, fell 0.5 per cent to $25.29 after announcing a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, its first since going public in 1992."
126;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Generals Mills chief upbeat on US consumers;;General Mills chief executive Ken Powell said on Wednedsay that while US consumers remain “cautious and looking for value”, there were signs that the shift to retailers’ lower-cost private brands seen over the past year was moderating.“It’s very early days, and in general, the consumer is still being careful, but we are seeing a few signs, perhaps …of a little more confidence.”Mr Powell noted that over the past 52 weeks, private label brands had gained around 1 percentage point of market share in General Mills’ food categories, which include Cheerios cereals, Yoplait yogurt and Progresso soups. But growth had slowed over the most recent quarter, while private label products had lost marketshare in February.Mr Powell also said there had been some moderation in the rate at which restaurant food sales had been declining in what he called an “encouraging” trend suggesting improved consumer confidence.Darden, which operates the Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurant chains, said on Wednesday that it had seen slight improvements in comparable sales during its most recent quarter, reporting its first positive comparable sales in two years.For its third quarter as a whole, General Mills reported a 15 per cent increase in earnings to $333.2m against the same period last year, on a 2.6 per cent increase in sales, to $3.63bn.Gross margins improved to 38 per cent from 34 per cent, as the company faced lower ingredient input costs, while continued cost control efforts improved operating margins to 15.6 per cent from 13.9 per cent.Its US retail segment reported three per cent sales growth - on top of 8 per cent growth reported a year ago - with six per cent in its Big G breakfast cereals, where sales were boosted by the launch of new chocolate-flavoured Cheerios. Sales of snacks grew 15 per cent.Its meals division saw sales decline 2 per cent, as growth in meal-preparation brands such as Hamburger Helper and El Paso Mexican foods was offset by weak sales of its Progresso soup, which reflected broader weakness in soup sales over the winter.Campbell, Progresso’s main rival, reported that sales of its ready-to-eat soups fell 18 per cent in the quarter ending January 31, which analysts blamed on competition from other lower cost meals alternatives such as Kraft’s Macaroni & Cheese.General Mills raised its full-year earnings guidance to $4.57 to $4.59 per share from $4.52 to $4.57, excluding any mark-to-market impact.Its shares fell 1.6 per cent to $72.39 in midday trading.
127;GIS;General Mills;2010-03-02T10:24:12Z;Food and drink: Beer, bread and baked beans on the menu;;Food and drink is big business in the north-west. According to Food North West, the promotional body, the region is the UK’s largest for food and drink production, with some 103,000 people employed in more than 2,000 companies.A number of well-known international brands have their UK headquarters in the region, including Kelloggs cereals at Manchester’s Trafford Park, and Typhoo tea on the Wirral. The Wigan baked bean canning plant of US multinational Heinz is said to be the largest food processing plant in Europe, turning out 1.5m cans of beans a day.Warburtons, the UK’s second biggest bakery, is probably the best-known local success story. But there are several others, ranging from Frank Roberts & Sons, the Northwich bakers, and Nichols, owner of the Vimto soft drinks brand, to Daniel Thwaites, the North of England’s biggest regional brewer, and Lofthouse, whose Fisherman’s Friend lozenges are sold in more than 100 countries.Although operating in very different parts of the market, all these companies share a couple of things in common. They remain largely family-controlled and have been operating for more than 100 years. In the case of Blackburn’s Daniel Thwaites, it has recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, and is still going strong.There are a number of reasons why the north-west has such a strong food and drink pedigree. With a population of 6.8m, it is the third biggest region in the UK, after London and the south-east, so for a start there is substantial local demand.A quarter of the UK’s dairy farming activity takes place in the region, which accounts for 16 per cent of the UK’s milk deliveries and supports substantial dairy-related activities at companies such as Robert Wiseman, Dairy Crest and Fayrefield Foods.The region’s central position in the UK, and excellent motorway and airport links, are big draws for food manufacturers, as is the Port of Liverpool. More grain and animal feed is imported through Liverpool than at any other UK port – more than 2m tonnes a year.The port plays a vital role in the supply chains of some of the UK’s best-known food manufacturers. Multinational agribusinesses, such as Archers Daniel Midland (ADM) and Cargill, have sizeable raw material processing operations connected to the port, which in turn supply the nearby plants of companies such as Cereal Partners, the UK’s second biggest breakfast cereal producer, jointly owned by Switzerland’s Nestlé and General Mills of the US.The north-west’s food and drink operations have not been immune to cutbacks and closures, particularly on the bakery side. But the sector continues to attract new investment.Greggs opened a £16m ($24m) bakery in Manchester last September which employs 220 people, and Fine Lady Bakeries has named Manchester as its preferred location for a £20m northern base, which will create up to 250 jobs.Tulip, a Danish meat products company which closed its sliced meats factory on the Wirral last year, is investing £12m in a new sausage-making factory on the same site, which will create 270 jobs.New Britain Palm Oil, which produces in Australasia, has commissioned a £18m palm oil processing facility at the port. Its first customer is United Biscuits, one of a growing band of north-west food manufacturers that are keen to demonstrate their ethical policies, by securing a supply of palm oil that can be proven to have come from sustainable plantations.Overall, the food and drink industry in the north-west – encompassing all parts of the food supply chain: food retail and food service, food processing and agriculture – contributes 10 per cent to the region’s gross value added and accounts for almost 15 per cent of total regional employment.While the sector still has considerable long-term growth potential, there are signs of increasing consolidation.Economies of scale in commodity-type food manufacturing, and the need for increased bargaining clout to counter a highly concentrated UK supermarket sector, are putting pressure on mid-sized operators.The collapse of Blackburn’s Inter Link Foods, a fast-growing cake manufacturer with 11 bakeries, highlighted the vulnerability of some smaller food companies. In a attempt to achieve the critical mass to compete with bigger rivals, such as Northern Foods and Associated British Foods, Inter Link overstretched itself, and had to be rescued by McCambridge, an Irish bakery group, in 2007.Size is not the sole criterion of success. Bells of Lazonby, a Cumbrian company producing allergy-friendly bakery products, and Cheshire’s Delamere Dairy, the UK’s leading supplier of goats’ milk products, are two small north-west companies that have managed to carve out leading positions in national niche markets.However, they tend to be the exceptions. “The north-west has some very big companies at the top end and small ‘cottage’ industries at the bottom,” says Julian Wild, food group director at Rollits, a Yorkshire law firm. “Life is most difficult for the food companies caught in the middle.”
128;GIS;General Mills;2010-01-12T23:18:02Z;Alchemist of all garbage;;Tom Szaky has very ambitious goals for TerraCycle, the recycling company he founded just over five years ago. “I want TerraCycle to become a verb, like Google,” he says of the small company, based in an old factory building in the post-industrial wasteland of Trenton, New Jersey. “We hope to wake up one day and become the new version of recycling, where every waste stream has a solution within the TerraCycle system.”The 27-year-old Mr Szaky founded his company with just one waste stream – leftover food from the cafeteria at nearby Princeton University, where he was a student, which was fed to worms and turned into fertiliser and sold in discarded soda bottles.But after a rapid journey that few start-ups can claim to emulate, he is dealing with the waste flow of some of the US’s biggest consumer companies, including Kraft, Mars, PepsiCo, Kimberly-Clark and General Mills, al­though TerraCycle’s turnover was just $12.5m (€8.7m, £7.8m) last year.The recycling logo that Mr Szaky says he designed during an uninspiring lecture at Princeton now appears on an estimated 1.5bn familiar consumer packages in stores across the US, ranging from Capri-Sun juice drinks to M&M sweets. “It will be on 20bn to 30bn packages by the end of 2010, on a global basis,” he says.TerraCycle’s five warehouses across the US receive millions of items of wrapping and packaging, collected by more than 8m people, including schools and charities, who may get 2 or 3 cents per wrapper. Together with other items, such as flawed rolls of packaging material, the waste is ultimately recycled into products such as bins, backpacks and pencil cases.This year, TerraCycle expanded to open offices and recycling warehouses in Canada, Brazil, the UK, France and Germany – yet it has just 55 employees. The waste it collects is turned into more than 100 different products, including injected plastic made from old foil crisp packets, thanks to a recently developed process.After losing $4.5m in 2008, the company is now operating profitably, as it continues to double its turnover every year. This is in spite of tearing up the rule book on expanding a start-up: “Everything we do, you are not supposed to do,” says Mr Szaky. That included signing some early, almost overwhelming, contracts to sell its worm-waste product to Home Depot and Walmart Canada, as well as developing a big range of products, and expanding overseas (see panel).Mr Szaky’s original idea for the worm business grew out of a start-up business plan he entered for a competition at Princeton. But serendipity rather than MBA science seems to have shaped TerraCycle’s business, mixed with on-the-hoof inventiveness, occasional luck and plenty of ambition. “It’s how I like to do business. I am willing to take some risk, to put some capital down and test an idea,” says Mr Szaky. “I don’t want to sit and debate with anyone whether it’s a good or bad idea.”The business has undergone two big shifts. The worm-waste operation was bubbling along in 2007, and TerraCycle had begun paying “collection brig­ades” to send in used soda bottles for the packaging. That led to a deal with Danone’s Stonyfield Yoghurt to collect and reuse yoghurt pots.Then Mr Szaky was approached by Honest Tea, a small ethically focused start-up, which wanted a way to process foil and plastic children’s juice pouches, whose composite nature made them unsuited to regular recycling. Under the deal, Honest Tea’s packages were made into branded backpacks – and into a dress worn by Soyeon Lee, Mr Szaky’s Korean pianist wife, at her Carnegie Hall debut in New York in 2008. This was one example of his ability to win free publicity – which also includes writing a book, Revolution in a Bottle , that includes tales of gunfights between local gangs and fending off venture capitalists.But the far bigger transformation came later that year, after TerraCycle came into possession of piles of recycled juice pouches from Kraft’s Capri-Sun brand that had been collected in a state-run project in British Columbia. Mr Szaky proposed that Capri-Sun join the Honest Tea programme.“Tom found us, as opposed to us finding him” says Jeff Chahley, Kraft’s senior director for sustainability, who describes the decision to launch the scheme with a small start-up as “a calculated risk”.“Capri-Sun signed a million-dollar contract right off the bat, and they basically exploded the programme,” says Mr Szaky.Other Kraft brands followed, as did more consumer companies. But growth brought new challenges in meeting demand for new products, as TerraCycle was trying both to continue product development and oversee the manufacturing. “Kraft wanted more kids’ products, Aveeno [owned by Johnson & Johnson] wanted its brand around more cosmetic products,” he says. But the costs of developing products and handling the manufacture and merchandising to retailers was too much.“We could either completely scale back, and focus on a handful of products, which I really didn’t want to do. Or we come up with another solution,” says Mr Szaky.The solution, launched last year, was licensing, an idea Mr Szaky says occurred to him when he was in California discussing waste recycling with Hollywood studios, in what he calls “a totally random connection”.TerraCycle tested one licensed product, a billboard bag for Yak Pak, a small New York-based bag company. “It was just throwing an idea against a wall to see if it worked, and the moment it worked, we aggressively said: ‘We’re not making products any more, we’re licensing everything.’“The effect was phenomenal. We are now profitable, next year we will be high­ly profitable. The number of products we make exploded . . . and the sales of our products tripled overnight. And the risk disappeared.”But the shift also required an overhaul of TerraCycle’s model. “In 2008 we lost a tremendous amount of money. I went in a direction that many people thought was not a good direction. And the financials tanked, which made it even harder to justify it as the right move. What solved it was the transition to licensing.TerraCycle now has a head of licen­sing, who was formerly at Disney, to supervise a unique product licensing programme in which the licensor also supplies some raw material.Mr Szaky believes he has achieved through trial and error the model that will enable the company to become the “Google of recycling”, establishing itself as the global standard setter.“We’re taking the global expansion very aggressively . . . The gas pedal is pushed as deep as it can to continue growth. The big challenge at this point is managing that growth.”
129;GIS;General Mills;2009-12-17T17:51:18Z;US stocks slide on employment worries;;US stocks fell on Thursday after a disappointing outlook from FedEx added to concerns over unemployment.Shares in Fedex dropped 5.3 per cent to $85.20 after the shipping company forecast worse third-quarter results than the market had been expecting. The group, which is considered an economic bellwether of business activity and consumer spending, said its forecast reflected the outlook for fuel prices as well as a modest pace of economic recovery.Futures extended their early declines on Wall Street after data showed an unexpected rise in the number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits.“Admittedly, the job claims numbers weren’t great but the leading economic indicators and the Philadelphia [Fed] numbers were terrific,” said Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors. “I would have thought that the market would have been acting much more positively.”However, Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said that a distinctive pattern had begun to emerge on Wall Street since August.“We’ve been cautioning people to watch out for the latter part of this month,” he said. “The market has normally been strong in the early part of the calendar month until right around options expiration and then it’s been weak in the latter part of the month.”Citigroup shareholders’ losses also continued to mount up after the bank sold $17bn of shares at such a low price that the the US government was forced to delay the partial sale of its stake in the bank. The shares, which have already lost almost 20 per cent this week, were down 6.7 per cent at $3.22. Citigroup’s problems weighed on investor confidence in the sector, helping to send S&P financials down 1.2 per cent.By midday, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent at 1,099.21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had also lost 0.9 per cent to 10,342.80 and the Nasdaq was 1 per cent lower at 2,185.00.The financial sector was also hurt by Meredith Whitney downgrades. The banking analyst group cut its forecast for Morgan Stanley, sending the group’s shares down 3.9 per cent to $29.16. Meredith Whitney, which is headed by the analyst who won a following on Wall Street for her warnings about toxic assets in 2007, also reduced its forecast for Goldman Sachs, prompting the bank’s shares to drop 2.1 per cent to $161.57.Harley-Davidson added to the downbeat mood, falling 4.6 per cent to $25.66 after Goldman Sachs added the motorcycle manufacturer to its conviction sell list.Analysts at the bank said they expected year-on-year sales in October and November to have dropped 35 to 40 per cent: a steeper decline than Wall Street’s current consensus. Earlier this month, the manufacturer said it would cut almost half of its workforce at its central Pennsylvania plant.Among the market’s gainers, Pier 1 Imports, which sells imported furniture, reported a third-quarter profit after analysts had predicted a loss. The retailer said it had benefited from improving sales as well as cost cuts, sending its shares up 5 per cent to $5.23.While Rite Aid posted a third-quarter loss, it was smaller than expected, sending the shares up 10.5 per cent to $1.47. The country’s third-largest drugstore chain reported fewer charges than last year and also said its pharmacy division had shown particular improvement.General Mills edged 0.7 per cent higher to $68.80 after the food company reported higher-than-expected results. The group, which owns brands such as Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, also said it had boosted its advertising budget by almost 40 per cent.In deals news, Apollo Global Management announced that it was buying Cedar Fair at a 27 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price, sending shares in the amusement park owner up 23.4 per cent to $11.20.The total transaction was valued at $2.4bn, including the refinancing of the company’s outstanding debt, and ranked as the third-largest LBO this year, according to Capita IQ data.
130;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Unilever to appoint new finance chief;;Unilever is to appoint a new chief financial officer before Christmas as chief executive Paul Polman continues to reshuffle the top ranks of the consumer goods company.Unilever’s current CFO, American James Lawrence, who was brought in under former Unilever chief executive Patrick Cescau in September 2007, has resigned and will leave by the end of the year.Mr Lawrence was chief financial officer of US food group General Mills before joining Unilever. He signalled his intention to leave after failing to get the CEO job, which was given to Mr Polman in October 2008.“He’s a very ambitious man,” one person close to Unilever said on Thursday. “He was never going to hang around to try and be the CEO after Paul Polman.”Mr Lawrence, who has previously headed the Bain & Co consulting group in London and was a co-founder and chairman of LEK, another consulting group, is believed to be considering transatlantic jobs, including private equity.His departure will allow Mr Polman – a former CFO at Nestlé who joined Unilever after the Swiss company awarded its CEO job to Paul Bulcke – to bring in someone more closely aligned to his way of thinking.The Dutchman, a former Procter & Gamble man, has stamped his mark on Unilever by restoring sales volume growth and encouraging action over analysis. This has included pushing through 30-day plans to turn round underperforming brands and replacing a third of Unilever’s top 100 executives.“The momentum in terms of the top brass change is relentless,” said one analyst.Although Mr Lawrence is credited with helping restore the City’s confidence in Unilever by communicating better with investors and analysts than Rudy Markham, his predecessor, his more formal style was seen to clash with Mr Polman’s gregariousness.Analysts said it would benefit Unilever to have someone who shared Mr Polman’s way of thinking. “The CFO preceding the CEO is always a difficult situation,” said Martin Deboo, analyst at Investec.Unilever is understood to have made an external appointment. Mr Lawrence’s replacement is not believed to be from a direct competitor to Unilever.Mr Lawrence was appointed at a difficult time for Unilever. Although it made significant changes under Mr Cescau, including splitting the roles of chairman and CEO, the Frenchman was a Unilever career man who found it difficult to change the culture of the organisation.Mr Polman’s changes have won investor confidence, with Unilever’s share price rising almost 21 per cent over the past 12 months. Mr Lawrence is understood to be retaining his shares, worth £10m-£12m ($16m-$20m).
131;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Sweet taste of Cadbury draws suitors;;Ever since Kraft went public with its £10.2bn unsolicited offer for Cadbury in early September, the market has been waiting for a counter-bid to emerge.On Wednesday, Hershey, the largest US chocolate maker, and Ferrero, the Italian confectionery group, helped fuel those hopes.They released separate statements saying they were in the preliminary stages of evaluating their options regarding Cadbury.Hershey, which hired JPMorgan in September to advise it, has made no secret of its desire to expand into international markets. It gets 14 per cent of its $5.13bn (£3bn) in revenue outside its home market.But launching a formal offer, even if it were working in combination with a partner such as Ferrero, would be complex.Hershey is run by an active charitable trust that owns about 31 per cent of the company but controls 80 per cent of voting shares.In 2002, Hershey was forced to abandon a proposed sale of the company to Wrigley amid intense opposition to a deal in Hershey’s home state of Pennsylvania. All seven of the trust board members who voted for the Wrigley deal were removed after it failed.As Cadbury shareholders might be unwilling to take Hershey non-voting shares, the deal would have to be paid for in cash. However, analysts at JPMorgan said that there were doubts over how much equity Hershey could raise from existing shareholders without diluting the trust. Under state law, the trust must retain control of the company.Hershey has $119m in cash and debt of $1.7bn, and in the year to October 4 it generated $1bn of earnings.Analysts estimated the company could only add $4bn in debt before losing its investment grade status, so it would need to raise another £4.7bn in equity to afford Cadbury, which has a market capitalisation of £10.8bn.Meanwhile, Ferrero is privately held, making it difficult to raise money in the private equity markets. It has no large-scale mergers and acquisitions experience.The Ferrero family has full ownership of the company, which is led by joint chief executives Pietro and Giovanni Ferrero.Ferrero’s confectionery sales were estimated at €6.2bn (£5.5bn) in 2008, with almost half that coming from the European Union, according to analysts at Investec. In addition to Ferrero Rocher chocolates, the company owns the Nutella, Kinder and TicTac brands.An acquisition of Cadbury by Hershey and Ferrero would also create fewer cost-cutting opportunities than an acquisition by Kraft. Cadbury and Ferrero’s chocolate markets are complementary in Europe rather than overlapping, with Ferrero holding significant shares in Germany, France, Italy and Spain, where Cadbury is weak, according to JPMorgan.The bank estimates that the only meaningful overlaps would be in the UK, Poland, France and Russia.Analysts at Credit Suisse say there is no obvious way for Ferrero and Hershey to split Cadbury’s assets.Hedge funds and institutional investors yesterday doubted a firm counter-offer would emerge.One person at a US-based hedge fund that bought almost 1 per cent of Cadbury after Kraft announced its offer, said he believed the US food group would have made a higher formal offer if it expected Cadbury to receive a counter-bid.Institutional investors were also wary. “Surely this is just part of the Cadbury defence to drum up interest,” said one large UK shareholder.With Unilever and General Mills having both publicly ruled themselves out from making a bid for Cadbury, the most likely remaining counter bidder is Nestlé, the Swiss food group.Nestlé, which has not discussed Cadbury publicly since Kraft went public with its offer in early September, declined to comment. However, any bid by Nestlé would require it to divest much of Cadbury’s chocolate business for anti-trust reasons.Additional reporting by Vincent Boland, Jonathan Birchall and Giulia Segreti
132;GIS;General Mills;2009-10-28T02:26:13Z;General Mills eyes return to inflation;;"General Mills, the US food group that owns Cheerios cereal, Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker baking mixes, foresees a return to price inflation as demand for commodities rises from emerging markets.“As the economy recovers, we’ll see a return to 4-5 per cent inflation,” Kendall Powell, chief executive of General Mills, told the Financial Times in an interview.Mr Powell, whose company buys raw materials such as grains, sugar, milk, vegetables, fruits, meats and vegetable oils as well as packaging materials, was referring to input cost inflation, which includes energy prices and supply chain costs, such as salaries.Many commodity prices have retreated from their highs of last year, although some – like sugar and cocoa – have recently been hitting multi-decade highs as demand outstrips supply.He also noted that oil prices – currently trading just under $80 per barrel – also appeared to have “come back”. “The key driver of oil prices is clearly emerging markets …that’s the demand we watch.”Mr Powell said General Mills, which last week reported a 51 per cent rise in first quarter 2010 net profit to $421m, did not plan to raise prices significantly this fiscal year to offset cost inflation.General Mills has made relatively small price increases of just more than 8 per cent during the past five years, even though its input costs have risen as much as 25 per cent.The company claims it has been able to avoid raising prices too heavily by pursuing a cost-cutting programme it refers to as “holistic margin management”, which involves simplifying brands. Its Hamburger Helper meals brand, for example, used to come in 75 flavours, but today comes in just 30.Mr Powell said the recession had benefited General Mills because its brands were reasonably priced, with breakfast cereals costing 40 cents a serving and yoghurt 60 cents a serving. He added that consumers were still too much in debt to return to indulgent spending habits.General Mills wants to take advantage of growth in emerging markets by expanding internationally; at the moment just one-fifth of sales are outside the US. It also plans to build on existing operations in China, Brazil and India organically and through acquisitions.But it was not considering a bid for UK confectionery group Cadbury, saying an acquisition of Cadbury by Kraft appeared to make “sound strategic sense.”"
133;GIS;General Mills;2009-10-20T23:02:58Z;US FDA demands action over food labelling;;The US Food and Drug Administration has warned the food industry to standardise the proliferation of symbols and ratings used to highlight nutritional claims on the front of food packages – or else face government action.Dr Margaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner, said consumers encountered a “cacophony” of front-of-package claims, creating “confusion rather than clarity”, while the country faced rising obesity levels.“We want to work closely with manufacturers and retailers towards the goal of a common gold standard for the presentation of key nutritional information,” she said.In a letter to the food industry, the FDA warned that “if voluntary action …does not result in a common, credible approach to front-of-package and shelf labelling, we will consider using our regulatory tools toward that end”.The agency said that it would initially create a single set of science- and nutrition-based criteria that existing front-of-package labels should meet, and that its staff would be examining current labels for violations of existing regulations.It has asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct an 18-month study on the creation of a proposed unified labelling system.Dr Hamburg highlighted recent criticism of the largest US front-of-package labelling system, Smart Choices, which launched this summer with backing from Kraft, ConAgra, Pepsi- Co, Kellogg’s and General Mills, five of the largest US food companies.“There are products that have gotten the Smart Choices check-mark that are almost 50 per cent sugar,” she said. Products carrying the mark include Kellogg’s Coco Pops and Froot Loops sugared breakfast cereals.The FDA warned Smart Choices’ managers this summer that it would be concerned if the green tick symbol “had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits, vegetables and whole grains”.Dr Hamburg cited the experience of the UK’s “traffic light” system– showing levels of sodium, saturated fats, sugar and total calories – developed by the food industry according to government standards.The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents leading US food and beverage companies, said it “looked forward” to working on the initiative.“This initiative …can serve as another important step in improving the health and wellness of the American public,” it said.The Center for Science in the Public Interest welcomed the move, saying it hoped it would lead to “one national, mandatory system that will truly help consumers choose healthier diets”.
134;GIS;General Mills;2009-09-27T22:30:06Z;Pound fall lifts Kraft position;;The weakening of sterling against the US dollar has strengthened Kraft’s position in the takeover battle for Cadbury.When Kraft announced its indicative offer on September 7, sterling was valued at about $1.64. But the value of the British currency has since fallen to $1.59, down 2 per cent against the dollar last week after Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, suggested weakness in the currency could boost UK exports.If sterling continues to weaken, Kraft is likely to take its time before launching any higher offer. “I’m watching the foreign exchange,” said one UK-based hedge fund that has taken a position in Cadbury.The UK’s Takeover Panel is this week expected to give Kraft a deadline of between four and six weeks to make a formal offer.Kraft’s indicative offer for Cadbury was initially valued at £10.2bn ($16.2bn), or 745p per Cadbury share, when it was made public by the US food group on September 7.But the value has fallen to £9.9bn, or 728p per Cadbury share, because of fluctuations in currency markets and a 5 per cent fall in Kraft’s share price.Cadbury’s shares have risen 29 per cent since September 7 to close at 800.50p on Friday.Only three months ago, Kraft’s advisors recommended the company not to make a move for Cadbury because it reckoned to obtain financing for a bid would be too uncertain.Bruce Wasserstein – the US investment banker known for encouraging companies to be bold with their merger bids – was instrumental in urging Kraft to proceed.Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief executive, has stressed the company will not bid for Cadbury at any price. She told an internal meeting of employees on Thursday that to buy Cadbury was something Kraft “would like” to do rather than something it would “have” to do. “We intend to remain disciplined in our actions,” she said.Investors say a “put up or shut up” ruling by the UK Takeover Panel will make it more difficult for other companies to put a counter-bid together, because it gives them less time to sort out financing and to figure out the tax consequences of any potential offer.The most likely counter-offer remains a combined Hershey and Nestlé bid. Some investors think an outside contender would be General Mills, which owns the Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker brands. But some bankers say General Mills, with a market value of $20.7bn, is too small to buy Cadbury.
135;GIS;General Mills;2009-09-23T21:18:49Z;General Mills;;Has the bonfire of the brands been snuffed? There are signs that the shift to private label goods is waning. General Mills produced surprisingly good first-quarter results on Wednesday, with decent sales growth along the supermarket aisle. That followed an optimistic outlook from ConAgra on Tuesday and an August where branded food gained dollar market share from private label for the first time in three years.Yet to declare trading down over would be premature – soft comparisons are helping. A year ago, consumers were in shock as the financial system was imploding. High agricultural commodity prices hurt premium products especially hard and squeezed profits. As the pressure on costs eases, manufacturers have more cash available for advertising and promotion – General Mills’ first-quarter marketing bill was up 16 per cent on the previous year.Those signs of life also deserve close inspection. Private label’s loss of dollar market share reflects falling prices for dairy and wheat, which translate quickly into lower prices for generic items such as cheese and flour. Reversing the private label sector’s advance will take stronger volume growth for branded goods. But if a weak economic recovery means deflation persists into next year, a growing price gap will again favour private label.In addition, General Mills stands out from the sector. It never lost share in the downturn and specialises in foods that tend to benefit from more consumers choosing to eat at home. A doubling of profitability in its food service business, meanwhile, reflects a successful restructuring as it adjusts to a restaurant sector that continues to shrink. Neither factor points to less price-sensitive shoppers, it merely suggests that General Mills, trading in line with the sector on 15 times 2009 earnings, deserves a premium rating.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
136;GIS;General Mills;2009-09-23T21:11:10Z;US stocks follow commodities lower;;Commodity stocks dragged Wall Street lower on Wednesday, forcing the market to give up modest gains following an optimistic statement from the Federal Reserve.In an announcement at the end of the Fed’s two-day monetary policy meeting, the committee said that it would hold interest rates and continue to use a range of tools to help the economy along the road to recovery.Although economists had not been expecting any change to interest rates, Wall Street had been anxiously waiting for any indication that Washington would rein in its stimulus measures.After a flat opening, the S&P 500 rose following the Fed’s statement but sunk back in the last hour of trade, closing 1 per cent lower at 1,060.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 9,748.55 and the Nasdaq fell 0.7 per cent to 2,131.42.“The Fed really did not provide a lot of detail on exit strategy or tightening,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global. “It seems to be very comfortable with the status quo.”But the price of US crude oil, which has powered the market’s recent rally, was set for its biggest daily decline since July.Metals also fell back from the opening bell, dragging industrial and materials stocks lower. Chevron lost 1.7 per cent to $71.37, while ExxonMobillost 1.2 per cent to $69. Alcoa fell 0.9 per cent to $14.14.Goodrich Petroleum also sank 6 per cent to $25.07 after the Texas-based company sold $190m of convertible bonds to repay debt.ATP Oil & Gas launched an offering of $125m in convertible perpetual preferred stock and said that production in its third quarter would be lower than expected. The shares fell 16 per cent to $18.61.Massey Energy dropped 7.7 per cent to $30.64 after Macquarie downgraded the stock from “outperform” to “neutral”.Financial stocks also fell back sharply in the hour after the Fed’s statement, with the S&P financial index losing more than 2 per cent. Citigroup was down 2.8 per cent at $4.52, while JPMorgan lost 3 per cent to $45.06.However, BlackRock rose 1.4 per cent to $211.03 after Deutsche Bank recommended buying the shares.This month, it emerged that BlackRock, which is poised to become the world’s largest money manager with $3,000bn under management, was preparing to create its own global trading platform.Technology stocks mitigated losses from commodity stocks throughout the day. Palm, the smartphone maker, priced its 20m share offering at $16.25 – a discount of 5 per cent to the closing price on Tuesday. The stock lost 0.6 per cent to $16.96.The smartphone market has become increasingly crowded over the past few months with the announcement of new handsets from Nokia, Samsung, Taiwan’s HTC and Motorola. Last week, Palm reported its ninth consecutive quarterly loss.Ascent Solar Technologies signed a contract to supply photovoltaic modules – which turn sunlight into electricity – to Turtle Energy over five years. Ascent shares rose 13.9 per cent to $7.97.Yahoo added to the sector’s gains, rising 2.1 per cent to $17.21. The internet search engine group said in an interview that it expected to take market share in Asia. On Tuesday, it rolled out a $100m marketing campaign in an effort to persuade consumers and advertisers that it can take on Google as an advertising power.But Seagate, computer hard-disk drives maker, lost 1.4 per cent to $15.46 even after saying sales might exceed previous forecasts as demand improves.General Mills, the food company, helped lift sentiment after it released higher-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year profit forecast, lifting shares 4.6 per cent to $63.80.The company, which owns Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream brands, said that it had benefited from lower commodity costs and stronger sales in the US.AutoZone, the largest US auto parts retail chain, reported better- than-expected quarterly results. But the group said that it had suffered as buyers shifted toward lower-margin products. The shares fell 7.5 per cent to $141.50.
137;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Wall Street rallies on jobs data;;Wall Street stocks hit fresh highs for the year following a shaky start on Thursday, after encouraging data on jobs and a successful Treasury bond auction reassured investors.The US government’s weekly jobless claims report showed 550,000 Americans had filed for their first week of unemployment benefits last week. The figure was down from 570,000 in the previous week and better than economists’ forecasts of 560,000.A strong Treasury auction also relieved concerns about the US deficit.Uncertainty lingered over President Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system, but health insurance stocks reacted well.After recent losses, WellPoint rose 2.5 per cent to $54.18, while Unitedhealth Group also gained 2.5 per cent to $29.11.The US president said that under his plan, it would be illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition or cancel coverage due to sickness, and that they would also be required to cover routine check-ups and preventive care.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up at its high for the day of 1,044.14, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,627.48.After five straight days of gains, the market hit fresh highs since last October. The S&P also hit its high for the year on Wednesday.The technology-focused Nasdaq, which has outperformed the other indices every day this week, climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,084.02.Shuffle Master added to the gains in the tech sector after the company posted second-quarter earnings above expectations. Shares in the company, which makes automatic card shufflers for casinos, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.40.Texas Instruments, the second largest US chipmaker, said it was expecting stronger revenue than it had forecast in July for the third quarter. The shares were 0.6 per cent lower at $25 after early gains.Yahoo rose 4.5 per cent to $15.45 after Bank of America changed its recommendation to “buy” from “neutral”, saying growth in the company’s user traffic continued to outpace growth in the internet as a whole. Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating on Time Warner, boosting its shares by 3.7 per cent to $29.51.“The run that we’ve seen in stocks still continues to impress,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage. “The stocks are overbought here but I’ve been saying that for a long time . . . the biggest issue in the end will be about revenue. You can say, well, we beat earnings expectations but are you making money? That’s going to be the big question.”Airlines also lifted the market after an analyst from JPMorgan said demand was “not as bad as feared” and bankruptcies in the sector were unlikely. United Airlines parent UAL led the sector, rising 17.8 per cent to $7.6, while US Airways also climbed 12.3 per cent to $4.02. The market’s early gains, however, were led by the consumer staples index.Procter & Gamble, the company behind brands such as Gillette and Pantene, rose 4.2 per cent to $56.04 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 above analyst expectations.General Mills, which owns brand such as Cheerios cereal and Häagen-Dazs ice-cream, said easing commodity inflation meant its fiscal first-quarter earnings were also running ahead of its target. Its shares fell back 0.6 per cent to $60.90 after early gains.But the materials sector continued to weigh on market sentiment, after pushing the indices into negative territory in early trading. Shares in Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, slid 5 per cent to $79.30 after the company forecast earnings below estimates. It said trading in its herbicide business had suffered due to oversupply in the market.The utilities index also pushed the market lower, after spending most of the past three weeks in negative territory.Ameren fell 2.8 per cent to $25.35 after the power company said it planned to offer 19m common shares to raise cash for investment in its subsidiaries.
138;GIS;General Mills;2009-07-01T20:26:38Z;US stocks start quarter on strong note;;"US stocks began the second half of the year on a positive note on Wednesday with shares in prominent food and drink manufacturers leading the market higher.General Mills, which makes Cheerios, reported better profits than expected, lifted by lower commodities prices and strong sales of new brands.The company also raised its forecast for earnings in 2010, and the shares picked up 3.9 per cent to $58.18.Constellation Brands, which owns several alcoholic drinks brands, including Robert Mondavi wines, kept costs sufficiently low to beat profit expectations in spite of falling revenues. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $13.61.A weaker dollar boosted shares in multi-national brands. Coca-Cola, which Credit Suisse had said could soon see double-digit earnings growth, picked up 2.5 per cent to $49.18, while rival Pepsiadvanced 2.8 per cent to $56.52.Elsewhere in the sector, Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut and KFC, gained 5 per cent to $35.02 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares, saying its overseas businesses would probably exceed its target of 10 per cent growth in profits.Commodities stocks rallied strongly in the morning but fell back as the price of raw materials dropped during the day. Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold miner, finished 0.9 per cent higher at $50.57.The price of oil briefly rose above $71 a barrel, but then fell back in the afternoon. After a strong morning, Chevron closed 0.4 per cent higher at $66.52 while Exxon Mobil climbed 0.9 per cent to $70.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at 923.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,504.06 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.6 per cent to 1,845.72.Investors remained focused on commodities and the dollar rather than economic data released during the morning, including two early indications on job losses.The market initially took confidence from the Challenger jobs report, which said that companies announced 9 per cent fewer job cuts in June than the previous year, the first annual decline in planned cuts since February 2008.This was counterbalanced by data from ADP Employer Services, which said companies cut more jobs than expected in June.Investors also took a near 20 per cent fall in mortgage applications during last week in their stride.“People are starting to dismiss some of the negative data and focus on the positives,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.But with the more closely watched data on initial jobless claims and the official unemployment rate due out this morning, the markets slipped as investors became more cautious.“I was surprised by the reaction to the data this morning,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab. “But people have taken some of the gains off the table as we get closer to Thursday’s unemployment reports.”Pfizer gave up 0.7 per cent to $14.90 after the company said it would not continue a late stage trial of its cancer drug Sutent after disappointing results.But rival Biogen Idec climbed 3.6 per cent to $46.77 after it acquired the rights to market an experimental drug made by Acorda outside the US for a fee that could rise to $550m.An analyst at JPMorgan warned that the deal would make it less likely that Acorda would be taken over however, and its shares fell 14.9 per cent to $23.99.There was further concern for the hotel industry after Barclays said a recovery in lodging stocks would lag behind a broader recovery, and the bank downgraded shares in Choice Hotels.This came the day after Wachovia downgraded Starwood Hotels, saying similarly negative things about demand in the sector.Choice lost 2.3 per cent to $26.01. Starwood added to Tuesday’s losses, falling
4 per cent to $21.31.A second initial public offering in less than a week reinforced optimism about demand for new equity, as shares in LogMeIn, a newly listed software maker, rose 25.1 per cent to $20.02 on its first day of trade."
139;GIS;General Mills;2009-06-08T20:44:29Z;Wall Street recovers losses in late trade;;US stocks staged a late recovery on Monday to end roughly where they were at the end of the previous session after a day spent almost entirely in negative territory.The equities markets opened lower on worries that interest rates might rise later in the year and stall an economic recovery.“Bond yields have been on the rise and that spells weaker than average performance,” wrote analysts at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch. “We found that stocks deliver below-average performance when interest rates rise dramatically.”Don Galante, senior vice-president of fixed income at MF Global, agreed, saying: “The risk is that such a rise could shut the economic recovery down.”But financial stocks, which were the only sector to perform well throughout the day, led a late reversal while the market waited to see which banks would be first to be allowed to repay money from the government’s troubled asset relief program.The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs would be named on the initial list. But while JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $35.39, Goldman gave up 0.4 per cent to $148.35. Citigroup rose ahead of an expected swap of preferred shares into common stock.The Financial Times reported over the weekend that the bank’s plan to raise $33bn in capital had been postponed after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation threatened to lower a crucial financial health rating as part of the regulator’s drive to replace Vikram Pandit, chief executive. Citigroup shares closed 1.2 per cent higher at $3.42.The paper also reported that Bank of New York Mellon and BlackRock were competing to buy Barclays Global Investors.BlackRock, which Reuters reported was the frontrunner with an offer of about $12bn, gained 3.4 per cent to $169.36, while BNY Mellon picked up 1.1 per cent to $28.54.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.1 per cent down at 939.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, on which Travelers and Cisco made their first appearance, replacing Citigroup and General Motors, edged a fraction up to 8,764.49. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,842.40.Materials were the biggest drags on equities markets as the price of oil and metals dropped.Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper, lost 1.2 per cent to $56.48, while Nucor, the steelmaker, dropped 1.6 per cent to $46.76.Multinationals felt the effect of the strengthening dollar. McDonald’s was a particularly heavy faller as the company warned that exchange rates could cost the company 20 cents per share for the year.The warning negated the impact of a stronger-than-expected rise in global sales for May and the company’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to $58.72.General Mills, which makes food brands such as Cheerios, gained 4 per cent to $54.22 after the company said 2009 earnings would be several cents better than forecast.Apple shares lost 0.6 per cent to $143.85 even though the company unveiled a new iPhone and a new Mac operating system at its annual developers conference.There had been early rumours that Steve Jobs, chief executive, might make an unexpectedly early return from ill health at the conference.However, the company said his return was not expected until the end of June.Meanwhile Palm, Apple’s latest competitor in the smartphone market, retreated 6.5 per cent to $12.16 in spite of reports that the company’s Pre phone had sold out at some stores during its launch over the weekend.Investors were concerned the new iPhone would reassert Apple’s position in the market.Verisign, which operates internet domain names, fell more than any other on the S&P after a court on Friday allowed an antitrust suit against the company which claims its pricing of the .com and .net domain names is artificially high.The company’s shares slumped 14.2 per cent to $19.90.
140;GIS;General Mills;2009-05-21T21:46:33Z;A taste of a stricter future;;American consumers are accustomed to being sold everyday food items on the basis of their health benefits.But this month, the US Food and Drug Administration shook up the food industry by warning General Mills, maker of the best-selling US breakfast cereal, Cheerios, over its assertion on packets that, “in just six weeks, Cheerios can reduce bad cholesterol by an average of 4 per cent”.The FDA warned that it was exceeding the qualified health claim approved for food labels on the benefits of soluble fibre. The claimed impact on cholesterol meant Cheerios (pictured above) were, in effect, being marketed as a drug.US consumer groups welcomed the warning letter as a sign that the FDA may become more active on the question of health benefit labelling claims, which have proliferated in food marketing in both the US and the European Union over the past decade.Richard Carvajal, a former associate counsel at the FDA now practising at Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, notes that the pressures on resources in recent years at the FDA had led to food labelling “taking a back seat” to other more pressing issues, such as food safety.“We’ve seen across the industry a pretty aggressive push on making a wide variety of health claims because everyone could see it was low priority at the FDA …against this background, [the Cheerios warning] could be seen as a shot across the bow,” he says.The broad issue has also inspired a recent class action law suit supported by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), an activist consumer group, challenging Coca-Cola over claims made by its Vitamin Water soft drinks, that include an assertion they reduce the risk of eye disease, promote healthy joints and support optimal immune function. Coke says the lawsuit is groundless.But global food companies may face a much more pressing challenge across the Atlantic from the comparatively new European Food Safety Authority, based in Parma, Italy, and its Panel on Nutrition, Dietetic products and Allergy (NDA).While the FDA restricts its authority over food marketing to “disease” reduction claims on labels – such as whether foods reduce the risk of heart disease or cancer – the EFSA has been asked by the European Commission to assess “functional” health claims as well – such as assertions that a food ingredient helps blood circulation or helps increase concentration.Under current European legislation, all such claims must be assessed by the EFSA by 2010 – and those that are not subsequently approved by the Commission will not be allowed on product packaging.So far, the EFSA has assessed only disease reduction claims and it is already proving a tough audience, having ruled that there is no proper scientific basis to support most of the claims it has reviewed.Its opinions may only be valid in the EU but they have implications for global brands. Ocean Spray, the New England cranberry growers co-operative, recently saw the EFSA decline to approve its claims that the juice can reduce the risk of urinary tract infections in women.Danone, the French food group, has also withdrawn its applications for approval of its “functional” digestive and immunity claims for its probiotic yoghurt brands, Activia and Actimel, which are the central plank of their marketing in both Europe and the US. Danone has said it wants a better understanding of the EFSA’s requirements before resubmitting its application.Ocean Spray also says: “The opinion we received demonstrates that, while the science we submitted was strong, it wasn’t sufficient to meet every EFSA requirement” – despite having included clinical trials published in “respected, peer-reviewed journals”.Mr Carvajal observes that the US is unlikely to see a similar expansion of the powers of the FDA, given the constitutional protection granted to “commercial” speech, such as advertising and labelling – which would only permit health claims to be banned if they were inherently harmful or misleading. “It would be surprising to see a push toward anything that looks like it could curtail otherwise truthful and non-misleading speech …I think the agency would think long and hard about that,” he says.But American consumer companies have already seen the transnational impact of standard-setting decisions on health by the European Commission. European opinions on the usage and safety of chemicals in consumer products – under the EU’s Reach initiative – are being used by consumer websites and activists to evaluate US consumer products. Similarly, US retailers moved last year to stop selling baby products containing Bisphenol A (BpA), a chemical found in plastics, after the Canadian government ruled that it could pose health risks to infants although there were no health warnings from US regulators.Asserting a health claim in the US that had been dismissed on scientific grounds in Europe would at least undermine the claim at home. Bruce Silverglade, of the CSPI, says: “If one region forbids health claims on food labels, it is hard for a transnational company like Nestlé or Kelloggs to make those claims on the other side of the pond.”
141;GIS;General Mills;2009-05-20T21:52:57Z;Pringles case fails to stack up;;Fans of Pringles might take comfort from a court ruling that the savoury, stackable crisps are made from potatoes rather than less appealing ingredients such as fat, emulsifier and wheat starch.But for Procter & Gamble, Pringles’ manufacturer, the decision leaves them paying £20m a year in tax after failing to exempt the brand from value added tax as a “non-potato-based” snack product.It is the latest in a series of bizarre legal scraps that have pitted consumer goods giants such as P&G, General Mills and Marks and Spencer against Revenue & Customs over how everyday food items should be taxed.While the cases, such as M&S’s 13-year battle over the VAT status of chocolate-covered teacakes, appear esoteric, hundreds of millions of pounds of revenue is at stake.In the Pringles dispute, the government estimated that the amount of back taxes alone in question is as much as £100m.The cases arise from Revenue & Customs’ fiendishly complex VAT regime, which classifies some goods and services as “zero rated” or exempt from VAT and others as “standard rated” and subject to a 15 per cent duty.While food products are generally zero-rated for VAT, one of the exceptions is potato crisps and other snack foods “made from” potatoes, including, but not limited to, chips, sticks and puffs.Procter and Gamble tried to argue that only products with 100 per cent “potato-ness” should be caught out by the anomaly. In Pringles, by contrast, the proportion of potato flour hovers at only about 40 per cent.The Court of Appeal threw out the company’s case on Wednesday, concluding that even a child would be able to determine that the product was made from potatoes, given the natural, common-sense meaning of the words.Most crisps, Lord Justice Jacob said, have already lost all or almost all of the natural taste of a potato anyway, “even when some overpowering flavour such as cheese and onion has not been imposed”.P&G said it was disappointed and would consider an appeal.
142;GIS;General Mills;2009-05-12T22:52:30Z;FDA warns Cheerios over health claims;;The Food and Drug Administration has taken issue with health claims made by Cheerios, America’s best-selling breakfast cereal, signalling a new approach to food industry marketing under the Obama administration.The FDA warned General Mills that it was, in effect, marketing its Cheerios breakfast cereal as a drug, because the cereal’s familiar yellow boxes carry unapproved claims about lowering cholesterol and reducing the risks of heart disease.In a warning letter, the FDA cited the claim that “you can lower your cholesterol by 4 per cent in six weeks” by eating Cheerios regularly.It objected to Cheerios’ assertion that “eating two 1½ cup servings daily of Cheerios cereal reduced bad cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol”.The claims – a central plank of Cheerios marketing for more than two years – go beyond the tightly defined health benefit claim for foods with soluble fibres, such as Cheerios, approved by the FDA for use in food marketing.Dr Steven Sundloff, head of the FDA’s Center for Food Safety, said the action was “not to impugn Cheerios”, which he called “a product that can be part of a healthy diet”.But he said: “The packaging clearly carries a drug claim.”He went on: “The industry is really looking at these health claims as a good marketing tool, and we’re seeing more and more companies trying to differentiate their product through health claims.“As they do that, they do have a tendency to go too far.”Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which campaigns for stricter limits on food health claims, said the FDA letter marked a significant change of approach under the Obama administration.“This is the strongest action that the US FDA has taken against misleading health claims for food in almost a decade, and it represents a major reversal from the lack of consumer enforcement under the Bush administration,” he said.General Mills said that Cheerios’ health claims were “not in question” and that the complaint focused on how “cholesterol-lowering information is presented on the Cheerios package and web site”.The FDA’s action followed a complaint filed in September by the National Consumer League, a consumer advocacy group.
143;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;ConAgra;;"Recessions cause all sorts of changes in behaviour, but some habits die hard. “Crispy Rice” may look and taste nearly the same as “Rice Krispies” at a lower price. Even so, most Americans continue to pay a premium for the snap, crackle and pop they have come to know and trust every morning. Releasing third-quarter numbers on Thursday, ConAgra, maker of brands such as Chef Boyardee, is the latest food company to demonstrate this as sales and earnings rose at its consumer foods segment versus the same quarter a year ago, offsetting weakness in sales to restaurants.Earnings reports from other companies with leading brands such as Kraft, General Mills and H.J. Heinz tell a similar story. While consumers are trimming their food budgets, much of it is coming from a drop in eating out, to supermarkets’ benefit. This has largely offset a migration to private-label brands for the top two or three names in any category.Private-label goods now represent 17 per cent of US supermarket sales, having grown about 7 per cent in the past year versus 4 per cent for overall sales, according to Shea Marketing Consulting. This has been a boon to manufacturers such as Ralcorp, which derives two-thirds of sales from the category, but the gains seem mostly to have come at the expense of marginal brands, not top ones. Management guru Peter Drucker observed that manufacturers possess far more information than consumers about products they buy. If they can trust the brand though, consumers can buy with confidence, which is why the best brands remain so profitable.Having navigated surging commodity prices in 2007 and 2008, ConAgra joined its competitors in striking an upbeat tone about the rest of this year. Sure, it faces increasingly aggressive supermarkets pushing for greater price concessions. But food producers have demonstrated their defensive nature in a recession – as long as they have the right brands.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

144;GIS;General Mills;2009-03-18T19:52:04Z;US stocks spike on Fed plan;;US stocks surged on Wednesday afternoon, taking the S&P briefly back over 800, as the Federal Reserve announced unprecedented measures to clear financial companies’ balance sheets and stimulate the economy.The unexpected move by the Federal Reserve to buy $300bn in long-term Treasury bonds and an additional $750bn in mortgage-backed securities delighted investors, with financial stocks feeling the most benefit.The benchmark S&P 500 index spiked after the announcement, and was 1.6 per cent up at 790.8 shortly before the close, having hit a high of 803.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7,642.6 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,486.16.Banks were the biggest risers, having also been boosted by reports from Bloomberg that the Treasury was ready to expand the term asset-backed relief program (Talf) also to help clear balance sheets. The troubled Citigroup lifted 22.7 per cent to $3.08.Bank of America, whose chief executive, Ken Lewis, earlier said would be able to repay $45bn in government money from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), picked up 17.2 per cent to $7.35.Fifth Third gained after it declared a dividend of $0.01 a share, helping to push its stock up 13.9 per cent to $2.22.Insurers also felt the benefit of the Fed’s boldness, with Metlife rising 25.8 per cent to 25.17 and Prudential gaining 19 per cent to $24.02.Morgan Stanley fell, however, after JPMorgan, as part of its new coverage of the company, said that it would need more capital. It dropped 0.6 per cent to $23.68.“The Fed needed to act with buying these assets and injecting money into the banks by printing money to capitalise the banks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But others were more sceptical about the effectiveness of the Fed’s plan. Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group, said it could actually be bad news for stocks. “I don’t think that many people would view that as a good thing, especially when China has said it is already concerned about US debt. There could be some serious consequences if we were to anger China.”The technology sector continued its recent good performance after it emerged IBM was in advanced talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for $10 per share, more than double Tuesday’s closing price. The news sent shares in Sun soaring 77.5 per cent to $8.82 while IBM slipped 2 per cent to $91.01.“The recent buying of tech stocks shows we have hit the bottom. You wouldn’t buy growth stocks if you didn’t think the economy was going to recover,” said Mr Pado.The Fed’s move came despite data released on Wednesday morning showing consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Corporate earnings from General Mills, the food producer which makes Cheerios, came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 11.4 per cent to $47.55.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 18.6 per cent to $35.47.Gains in industrial stocks were limited after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 1.7 per cent to $37.57, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, gained 1.9 per cent to $27.33.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, rose 5 per cent to $35.22. The shares had suffered earlier after JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per share.Energy stocks put a moderate drag on the market’s gains, rising only slightly after oil prices came off their recent lows. Chevron picked up 1.6 per cent to $66.36 and Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $69.16. The shares were hit in part by profit taking, with the sector having gained more than10 per cent between the beginning of last week and the end of Tuesday.
145;GIS;General Mills;2009-03-18T13:03:11Z;Wall St anxious before Fed decision;;Reports of a possible major acquisition were not able to tempt US investors out of their caution on Wednesday morning as equities markets waited for details from the Federal Reserve on what action would be taken on asset purchase schemes.IBM was reported in the Wall Street Journal as being in talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for at least $6.5bn, nearly 100 per cent above its market capitalisation at the end of Tuesday’s trading. The news sent shares in Sun up 66 per cent to $8.25 while IBM slipped 3.1 per cent to $89.99 before the bell. The companies refused to comment.The increased activity in the tech sector helped futures for the Nasdaq Composite index outperform those for the benchmark S&P 500 index or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Less than an hour before the opening bell, futures for the Nasdaq were 3 points down at 1,187.2, while those for the S&P were 5.8 points lower at 769.5 while the Dow Jones lost 68 points to 7,286. On a fair value basis, however, which takes into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, both the S&P and Nasdaq were higher.Hopes for “quantitative easing” from the Federal Reserve were fading on Wednesday, but investors were still waiting to hear if it might buy long-term Treasury bills in an effort to stimulate the economy.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who mixed upbeat comments about the economy over the long-term with an understanding of what is needed to get from here to there in comments during a rare interview with CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ on Sunday.”The Fed may be less anxious to get into such asset purchase schemes after data released on Wednesday morning showed consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Mortgage applications were also higher, adding to the confidence given to financial and homebuilder stocks on Monday by data showing more new houses were started in February than had been predicted.Corporate earnings from General Mills on Wednesday came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 3.5 per cent to $51.81 in pre-market trade.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 10.4 per cent to $33.00 before the bell.Industrial stocks looked set for falls after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, fell 0.8 per cent before the open to $36.64, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, fell 1.8 per cent to $26.35.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, fell 1.8 per cent to $32.95 on the news from China. The company was also hit when JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per cent.Bad news from China also weighed on Coca-Cola before the bell, as the company said it was “disappointed” by the Chinese government’s rejection of a $2.3bn bid for China Huiyuan Juice Group. Its shares lost 1.1 per cent to $41.01.European stocks were down slightly ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.4 per cent lower at 712.96. Asian equity markets rallied for a fifth day, with the Nikkei 225 closing 0.3 per cent higher at 7,972.17.Bond yields were flat ahead of the Fed’s announcement. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 2 basis points to 1.013 per cent, while that on a 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 3.007 per cent.The dollar was higher against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.39.Gold was trading $1.09 lower at $905.45 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices were $0.49 at $48.67 a barrel.
146;GIS;General Mills;2009-02-23T23:07:48Z;Coupon clippers go digital;;This Saturday’s “Extreme Couponing 101” workshop at the leisure centre in Lexington, South Carolina, is entirely booked out, with 30 people paying $10 each for a two-hour course in how to save money when shopping.The event is organised by Jenny, the author of Southern Savers, one of a plethora of online blogs devoted to the art of saving money when shopping, traditionally by clipping the coupons delivered each weekend with the local newspaper.But Southern Savers’ expertise now goes beyond the familiar coupon clipper techniques – such as joining shopper loyalty programmes or waiting for retailers to “double up” the savings offered on manufacturers’ coupons. The blog – and others such as Simply Thrifty or The Frugal Mamma – now embraces the internet and the mobile phone, as big name retailers and manufacturers increasingly commit themselves to delivering coupons online.Kmart, one of the largest US discounters, is launching printable manufacturers’ coupons on its website this month, joining Kroger, the largest US supermarket group, and CVS and Walgreens, the drugstores, which launched printable coupons last year.Kroger has also recently expanded a pilot programme that it launched last year with Cellfire, a California-based mobile couponing company. The programme allows Kroger customers to use their mobile phones to load coupons from Kimberly-Clark, General Mills, Clorox and others on to their Kroger Plus supermarket loyalty cards.The increased interest in digital coupons in part reflects a frugal mood among US consumers and the maturity of secure technology to handle coupon distribution. But it is also the result of a more fundamental shift in the traditional couponing industry, due to the profound decline of the newspaper business that has been the main vehicle for delivering coupons through “free-standing inserts”.“Our clients are for the first time saying that if venerable print titles are closing they will have to move their promotional budget somewhere else,” says Steven Boal, who founded Coupons Inc, an online coupon service, in 1998.Some clients, he says, are now increasing the share of their direct promotions budget allocated to his online printable coupons to as much as 40 to 50 per cent, from a normal level of 10 to 20 per cent.Laura Keely, director of marketing promotions at Kimberly-Clark, whose brands include Huggies and Kleenex, says changes in the age of the audience that is reading newspapers – and clipping coupons – is a significant factor in her interest in online couponing, such as Kimberly-Clark’s partnership with Cellfire (see side).“What we’re seeing is that younger consumers aren’t buying a Sunday newspaper and clipping those coupons,” she says. “The numbers drop off significantly when you are looking at an 18-24 consumer. If she’s not reading the paper and cutting that coupon, where is she? She’s online.”As the coupon clipper moves on to the web, printable internet coupons appear to be emerging as the dominant strategy for reaching younger consumers, although not all companies are convinced. Procter & Gamble, for instance, says it has opted not to issue printable online coupons because of concerns over potential counterfeiting fraud. Instead, P&G mails coupons to customers who apply online. It is also operating a system for loading coupons on to loyalty cards at both Kroger and its rival Safeway.Mr Boal at Coupons Inc argues that fraud is “no longer an issue” for the retailers, and that his company sees less than 0.05 per cent of the coupons it issues being illegally duplicated. “We think of ourselves as a document security company,” he says, noting that Coupons Inc’s data on each coupon means it can cut off computers that are linked to coupon duplication patterns.In the longer term, there is general agreement in the industry that the mobile phone linked to a digital wallet is likely to emerge as the favoured medium for shoppers to receive and redeem coupons.But Mr Boal at Coupons Inc argues that fully mobile shopping is still five to eight years off. Meanwhile, printing out coupons, rather than storing codes on a mobile phone to show to a cashier, is the most attractive option for a busy supermarket shopper, he says. “Mum doesn’t text a box of cereal to get a coupon. She’s busy stopping her two children pulling things off the shelves.”Matthew Tilley, at the Promotion Marketing Association’s Coupon Council, says that “digital redemption” – which involves customers receiving codes via mobile phones, remains under development. “I believe it will be another year or two before those programmes have any measurable scale to them,” he says.But Brent Dusing, chief executive and founder of Cellfire, argues that mobile coupons will prove too attractive for manufacturers and retailers to ignore.Cellfire’s offers, many of which deliver a bar and text code that needs to be shown to a retailer at the checkout, have redemption rates of 20 to 30 per cent, against a rate of less than one percentage point for newspaper coupon inserts. The system that links the programme to Kroger’s loyalty cards means the coupons are redeemed automatically when the card is scanned, although the system is by definition limited to loyalty card holders.Other companies are also increasingly interested in the intersection of the mobile phone and shopping. Kraft, the largest US food company, launched an iPhone application this year that includes menus and a shopping list facility. In January, Coupons Inc also acquired a popular iPhone application, GroceryiQ, designed for drawing up grocery lists – which it may eventually be able to match to money-off coupons.Coupons Inc has also formed a venture with Yahoo to develop a system for distributing coupons to mobile phones. Mr Boal argues this is better suited for distribution of coupons for single-trip transactions, such as restaurants, entertainment and services such as dry cleaning.“There is a lot of talk about the moment of truth, about why consumers choose brand X rather than brand Y,” says Mr Dusing at Cellfire. “The power to actually influence a purchasing decision is inside a store, and it is only the mobile device that is able to do that…suddenly you can message offers to people based on where they are.”
147;GIS;General Mills;2008-12-17T22:17:09Z;Wall St falls as rate cut euphoria fizzles;;"Macy’s helped consumer discretionary stocks find positive territory on Wall Street on Wednesday as the wider market fell from its monthly high after the company quashed fears over its ability to repay debt.The shares soared 18.2 per cent to $10.01 on the back of plans to amend covenant terms on its $2bn credit facility, led by Bank of America and JP Morgan. Nordstrom, another department store chain, bounced 6.5 per cent to $13.98 and the retail sector stood 1.8 per cent higher overall, helping pare the market’s losses.“It’s a good sign for the retailers, that’s for sure,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. He said the move could be a sign that banks were “being a little bit less restrictive”.The market overall failed to hold gains enjoyed in the previous session, when the Federal Reserve’s historic move to cut rates to virtually zero spurred a 5.1 per cent rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent on Wednesday at 904.42 after drifting between positive and negative territory throughout the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.1 per cent lower at 8,824.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent weaker at 1,579.31.Trading was largely muted, however, as investors digested the effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate policy.Financials finished 1.3 per cent lower overall. Shares in Morgan Stanley lost as much as 8.3 per cent in the morning session as the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss that was wider than even the most bearish predictions. The figures prompted Moody’s to downgrade the bank’s senior debt rating.Yet the shares finished 2.3 per cent higher as traders were encouraged by the bank’s attempt to reduce its leveraged capital structure. Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, lifted his price target on the stock to $18.Goldman Sachs, which jumped 14.4 per cent in the previous session following its fourth-quarter results, added a further 3.7 per cent to $78.78.However, regional banks, off 2.3 per cent overall, underperformed the wider financial sector after Fifth Third’s move to cut its fourth-quarter dividend to 1 cent a share sparked concerns others may be required to take similar action. Fifth Third fell 6 per cent to $7.51 while KeyCorp lost 4 per cent to $8.33.Among other consumer stocks, ConAgra and General Mills jumped 8 per cent to $16.25 and 0.2 per cent to $61.35, respectively, on the back of better-than-expected second-quarter profits.Newell Rubbermaid was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, pushed 27.3 per cent lower to $9.58 by a profit warning that prompted analysts at BMO Capital Markets to question whether the company would retain its dividend.Investors did not appear reassured by plans from the maker of Sharpie pens, among other products, to cut up to 10 per cent of non-
manufacturing jobs.Meanwhile, the materials sector provided the market with support, up 0.1 per cent overall. Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold advanced 4.5 per cent to $26.01 as gold prices enjoyed strong gains.However, the energy sector came under selling pressure as US crude prices neared $40 in spite of Opec’s production cut.Elsewhere, Apple continued its bad run, down a further 6.6 per cent to $89.16, after the withdrawal of Steve Jobs, chief executive, from the group’s main event of the year prompted Oppenheimer to downgrade its view of the stock to “perform”.“It’s past time for Apple to either disclose the state of his health or elaborate a viable plan for eventually transferring power,” the analysts wrote, removing their price target. “Until such time, we can no longer continue to recommend Apple as a long-term investment.”Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Adobe afforded the technology sector scant comfort.Shares in the software group were dragged 2.8 per cent lower to $21.69 as the wider sector fell 1.7 per cent.Barclays noted the company did not give guidance for next year. “We believe the near-term environment will continue to pressure the top-line,” wrote the analysts, although they maintained their “overweight” stance."
148;GIS;General Mills;2008-12-09T20:17:44Z;Household names miss out on aid for liquidity;;Household US and European names such as General Mills, British Telecom, Vodafone and Heinz are a few among a long list of companies that have been left behind by efforts to ease short-term debt markets.These groups all have a second-tier credit rating in the commercial paper markets, where companies raise funding for typically anywhere between overnight and 90 days.Crucially, only top-rated paper qualifies for the US Federal Reserve’s programme to step in and buy short-term corporate and financial paper. This support has brought a stunning decline in the cost of issuing the best CP, which is rated A1/P1, but yields on lower-rated, yet still investment-grade, paper remain at record high levels.“The spread between A1/P1 and A2/P2 CP rates is a barometer of the extent to which financing markets are under stress,” says Laurence Mutkin, head of European rates strategy at Morgan Stanley. “The continued wide spread between these two levels is evidence the credit crunch continues and that the private corporate sector is still suffering from liquidity issues.”That spread, or difference, between the cost of funding for top-tier and second-tier CP has hit record high levels since the Fed programme began. Since 2001, the spread for 90-day paper has never been much more than 100 basis points. It started rising in summer 2007, and in recent weeks hit around 600bp.Companies use commercial paper to fund day-to-day activities. Money-market funds previously bought large volumes of CP, but have been suffering widespread redemptions during the credit crisis, first of all due to fears over the asset-backed CP markets that funded banks’ off-balance sheet vehicles. However, since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which led one major money market fund to lose investors’ money – or “break the buck” – those redemptions have turned into a flood.The Fed stepped in to prop up the market in October, arresting the decline in volumes and the sharp rise in costs for many issuers – including in asset-backed CP – in the US market.Bankers say the better-rated companies are able to issue CP and the amount of CP that has been refinanced over year end has also increased to about 60 per cent.The programme also helped out European issuers with existing and operational US dollar CP platforms.The Fed stopped short of buying paper that is rated A2/P2, however. The idea behind this was that by supporting the top-rated short-term debt, liquidity would be freed up and lower-rated companies should benefit. But the result has been that the cost of funding in CP for those corporates remains elevated.In the US, AA-rated non-financial corporates whose paper gains the top A1/P1 grade pay 1.1 per cent to issue CP for 90 days. Companies rated A2, meanwhile, pay 6.35 per cent. The difference is also stark in one-day debt – with AA corporates paying 0.05 per cent and second-tier corporates 2.16 per cent.Martin O’Donovan, assistant policy director at the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers, said while there was always a difference between the CP rates between A1 and A2 borrowers, “it has been aggravated by the Fed’s moves”.The volume of outstanding tier-two CP in the US has remained at about $80bn in recent months, indicating that companies are paying up to get financing done.Financial and asset-backed CP make up by far the majority of the roughly $1,700bn of paper outstanding. CP from the likes of Heinz is, however, a significant chunk of the $211bn in non-financial issuance.Corporate CP makes up a similarly small proportion of overall short-term debt in European markets as well, bankers say.The current tight conditions have created some nervousness among some companies about funding through year-end. “The worst-case scenario is that they hit their bank facilities,” said one banker. “The Fed didn’t bail out the A2/P2 market because they don’t want A2/P2 risk.”Zahra Peerbhoy, head of short-term credit trading at Credit Suisse, says investors are still cautious going into year-end. “CP is being rolled over, but for some issuers not in the volumes we would expect at this time of year,” she says. “Issuers, including many corporates, have been dealing with this problem since August 2007 and have made contingency plans and raised longer-term funding.”British Telecom, for example, has issued £4.3bn of long-term debt since June 2007 to minimise refinancing risk and to ensure it is not too reliant on short-term paper.But for those that have not done so, it can lead to demands on their banks. Cadbury, the UK confectionery group, recently drew down on a £1bn revolving credit facility – which acts like an overdraft – to refinance short-term debt because of the illiquidity of the CP markets. Only a small amount was drawn down, a person with knowledge of the situation said.Vodafone said the commercial paper market continued to be open to the UK telecoms group and it was using it regularly.In the US, General Mills did not comment, while Heinz did not return calls.Additional reporting by Richard Milne and Paul J Davies
149;GIS;General Mills;2008-10-01T04:36:35Z;Low sales spread globally for Pepsi bottler;;Pepsi Bottling Group, the largest global bottler of Pepsi-Cola drinks, said on Tuesday it was seeing signs that the slowdown in the US was spreading to its global customers.Eric Foss, chief executive officer, said that soft consumer demand in the US had spread during the third quarter “across geographies” leading to sales volume declines in Europe and Mexico.In Europe, total volume of cases sold fell 6 per cent. He cited economic factors ranging from economic volatility and the impact of food inflation in Russia, to the effects of the housing slump in Spain. In Mexico, where case volumes were down 9 per cent, he noted that cash remittances from the US had fallen to their lowest level in over a decade, leading to declines in consumer confidence.PBG said the total volume of cases it sold during its third quarter fell 6 per cent in the US and Canada.Just over 30 per cent of PBG’s $14bn annual revenues come from its international business in Europe and Mexico, which accounts for around 40 per cent of PepsiCo’s global drinks business.Over the past year, strong intenational sales have helped to offset the increasingly sluggish US performance of consumer goods companies, ranging from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark.Over the summer, the larger US food companies reported continued strength in their international operations during their second quarters, with General Mills saying it was expecting “continued strong top line growth”, and Kraft citing “good organic growth”.In the US, where PBG handles more than half of PepsiCo’s business, it noted that sales of both bottled Aquafina water and non-carbonated drinks and Tropicana juices had been harder hit by slowing demand than its traditional carbonated drinks such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew.Mr Foss argued that the non-carbonated drinks were largely dependent on single serving sales in stores and “were probably a little more prone to be more impacted by difficult economic conditions that prevail right now”.Water sales volume was down 6 per cent during the quarter in the US, exceeding the overall 2 per cent decline for the category, which PBG attributed in part to its decision to avoid chasing competitor’s price cuts to support sales.Its non-carbonated drinks volumes fell 2 per cent, against an overall 3 per cent decline in the category. Carbonated drinks sales fell four per cent, in line with forecasts.PepsiCo reported net income for the third quarter of $231 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.8bn.
150;GIS;General Mills;2008-09-17T19:31:34Z;Bowl still full for breakfast food makers;;Signs are growing that frugal American consumers are staying at home for breakfast, extending a trend that has hit evening sales at US restaurant chains.General Mills, whose brands include Cheerios cereals and Yoplait yoghurt, estimated on Wednesday that total US breakfast cereal sales rose about 5 per cent in June to August from a year ago. Its US sales of breakfast cereals rose 10 per cent, while its yoghurt sales were 19 per cent higher.Ken Powell, chief executive, said the company’s products, which also include Progresso soup and home baking brands, had benefited from a shift away from eating out in the evening.But the increased sales of cereal and yoghurt were consistent with the hypothesis that the same thing was happening in the morning, he said.Breakfast has been the fastest growing segment for US restaurants, as time-pressed Americans opt to eat their morning meal on the go. Mintel, the market research company, estimated annual growth at 7 per cent last year.Restaurant chains have responded by creating novel breakfast offerings such as granola “smoothies”. The Jamba Juice chain launched a range of baked goods this year.But a restaurant survey by NPD Group/Crest this summer reported that in the second quarter foot traffic at breakfast was flat for the first time since 2004.Harry Balzer, food analyst at NPD, warned that the figure could be a hiccup. About 15 per cent of US consumers now ate breakfast away from home, he said.Mr Powell said General Mills’ yoghurt sales also seemed to be benefiting from consumer’s efforts to save money by making lunch at home to eat elsewhere – “brown-bagging” – rather than eating out.“Generally we are seeing a shift to dinner [at home], and the percentage of consumers who brown-bag and bring their own lunch is going up a bit,” he said.David Palmer, analyst at UBS Equity Research, told clients he expected General Mills to continue to benefit from a decline in dining out for the next few quarters.“As job losses deepen, we wonder if lunch and breakfast occasions [for eating away from home] could be next,” he said.A decline in lunching and breakfasting out could deliver a further boost for cereal makers, he said.
151;GIS;General Mills;2008-09-14T17:50:30Z;Small may be beautiful but it can also be deceptive;;"Food in America is shrinking. Last month, Unilever’s Skippy brand peanut butter reduced the contents of a typical jar from 18oz to 16.3oz by increasing the depth of the indentation on the bottom of the plastic tub. It kept the price unchanged.Kellogg has done the same thing with its Apple Jacks breakfast cereal: while the front panel size – and the price – remain the same, the contents have shrunk from 11oz to 8.7oz. Cans of Del Monte’s StarKist tuna now contain 5oz of fish rather than 6oz, while a redesigned bottle of PepsiCo’s Tropicana orange juice contains 89 fluid ounces compared with the previous 96 fl oz.The food companies involved mostly blame the impact of rising commodity prices for what are in effect unit price increases being passed to the consumer, although a few creatively attribute content reductions to more “consumer friendly” packaging designs. “It is in effect raising the price, but it seemed to appeal to the consumer psyche, despite paying the same price but getting less,” says Pat Conroy, who heads the consumer goods practice at Deloitte & Touche USA.For the companies, the results can be extremely positive. General Mills reduced the depth of packets of its leading breakfast cereals such as Cheerios while maintaining the dimensions of the front of the box and the price. As a result, the number of packs sold increased by 6 per cent, yet the weight sold was virtually unchanged from the previous year.Ed Dworsky, the editor of Mouseprint.org, a website that tracks consumer issues, says the tactic, known as downsizing, is as old as the packaged goods industry itself and takes advantage of the fact that consumers are “price sensitive, but not net weight sensitive”. But over the past year, he says, the tactic has become increasingly prevalent, driven by soaring fuel prices – since downsizing also reduces transport costs per unit, adding to the savings from having less of the product in the pack.“I can’t remember a time when I’ve seen this many major brands and this many categories involved in downsizing,” he says.But not all the downsizing is under the radar. All the leading US liquid detergent brands have over the past year shifted to smaller, double concentrate versions of their products, in an environmentally focused initiative driven by pressure from Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer.Kraft Foods has responded to growing economic pressure on its customers by introducing smaller “single serve” packages of some of its leading brands at lower prices – a strategy traditionally used by companies to drive sales in developing countries rather than in the US. It also delivers higher profit margins on each unit.“There are many shoppers who are looking at the existing budgets, and they might be thinking, ‘I’d like to buy the larger detergent but I don’t have the money, so I’ll go for something smaller’,” says Ira Matathia, director of consulting at BrainReserve, a trend forecaster. The single-serve packages also follow a boom in small packages of snacks and sodas that has been driven by obesity and health concerns, after the success of the 100 calorie “snack pack” of cookies introduced by Kraft’s Nabisco in 2004.Now Coca-Cola and PepsiCo both produce 100 calorie versions of their carbonated drinks, which are three-quarters of the size of their standard 12oz cans. That emulates the small-but-powerful can concept that has been popularised by energy drinks such as Red Bull.Some of the present outbreak of shrinkage in food packaging is a direct result of a weakening economy. Mr Matathia and others argue, however, that it is playing out against the background of a broader trend – with concerns about issues such as sustainability and health leading towards a desire for greater simplicity and frugality.In a new study on the “culture of the recession”, BrainReserve found that 84 per cent of the 1,011 adults surveyed reported they were “inclined to buy less stuff”, while 72 per cent “want to reduce clutter” in their lives. It had previously argued that 2008 would be a year in which consumers sought greater simplicity in their choices.Sohrab Vossoughi, the founder of Ziba, a Portland, Oregon-based research and design firm, says his company has been forecasting the emergence of a “less is more” philosophy for some years. “The abundance economy is here and people have access to everything, as much as they want. But then they are asking, ‘Now what?’,” he says.He cites as evidence a new housing development in downtown Portland that is marketing itself, with Ziba’s help, under the slogan “Buy Small”, arguing that its one-bedroom, European-scale 550 sq ft apartments are not only less expensive but also better for the environment. “It used to be that less is less, and now less is more. Large purchasing used to signify status; now small purchasing signifies status.”Other indications of the taste for “less is more” include the decline in sales of sports utility vehicles and the Fresh & Easy “neighbourhood markets” opened in America by Tesco of the UK, which offer a highly edited selection of groceries in stores of less than 15,000 sq ft. The concept is being emulated by Wal-Mart, Safeway and other supermarkets.American consumers have not relinquished their enthusiasm for giant-sized buckets of popcorn at the movies, for massive sky-scrapers or for king-size Snickers bars containing more than 500 calories. Mr Matathia also notes an economic counter-trend towards “big” – as consumers seek to save money and fuel by bulk-buying at warehouse discount clubs or concentrating all their shopping into one stop at a Wal-Mart Supercenter.But beyond the downsizing tactics of consumer goods companies, or shoppers heading to their local 200,000 sq ft Wal-Mart, he argues that “you have the confluence of a bunch of cultural currents that are all in principle moving towards the idea of smaller. The prevailing social trend is that we are in a post-supersize-me environment.”"
152;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Hedging is second nature for food groups;;Food companies were once a little blasé about the price they paid for the ingredients that went into their corn flakes, chocolate bars and yoghurts because in the 1980s and 1990s, prices of agricultural commodities were falling.While many food companies took the precaution of hedging some of their key ingredients – Mars, the owner of Snickers bars, has been hedging cocoa since the 1960s – they did not have to worry too much about being caught out by unexpectedly big price jumps.Today, that luxury has vanished. Soaring global demand for commodities has driven prices of all kinds of food ingredients, from corn to cocoa to coffee, to new highs, and more than a few food companies have been unpleasantly surprised.On Friday, Hershey, the US chocolate group, became the latest in a long line of food companies to warn that its commodity costs – which include sugar and peanuts as well as cocoa and are up as much as 45 per cent since the start of the year – were rising faster than expected.The company said it would spend up to $12m hedging its 2009 costs – it expects cost increases next year to be double this year’s – and take a hit to third-quarter profits.Other companies caught out by soaring commodity prices include Hershey’s competitor Cadbury, which recently said it was proceeding with a new round of restructuring after finding rising raw material prices “a stronger challenge” than it had previously anticipated.Meanwhile, Unilever, the multinational food and household products group, which estimates its commodity costs rose by €1bn ($1.47bn) in the first half of the year, has warned it will face its biggest ever annual rise. Analysts estimate this will amount to €2bn.Companies have been trying to counter higher costs by raising the wholesale prices for their products. On Friday, Hershey said it was putting through another round of price increases (it raised them 13 per cent in January) on its chocolate bars and other confectionery, lifting them by a further 11 per cent.But companies are starting to find that consumers are reluctant to pay more for groceries as inflation rises and disposable incomes fall, and many price increases are being followed by drops in sales volumes.Good commodity risk management is consequently becoming an essential part of remaining profitable.Michael Steib, consumer goods analyst at Morgan Stanley, says: “Companies are more focused on hedging, particularly the ones that got burned.”Although food companies have long employed “procurement” people with logistical skills in sourcing commodities, they are now looking for people with experience in trading commodities.“Consumer industry companies are turning into agriculture commodities trading houses,” said one senior commodities banker in London.Meanwhile, consumer industry bankers say investment banks are putting money in commodities teams that give food and consumer goods companies advice on how to hedge their risk exposure.When corn prices rose or fell 5 cents per bushel per day, companies could afford not to be hedged because the price movements were not big enough to lower profits.But now that they are swinging by 30-40 cents a day, and prices have soared – which means they account for a bigger proportion of total sales – companies are being hit with considerably higher additional costs.Pilgrim’s Pride, the US group that claims to be the world’s biggest producer of processed chickens, has hired a former trader and grain broker to manage its commodity risks.Pilgrim’s, which has not been able to increase prices fast enough to cope with soaring feed grain costs, said it was “imperative” to find ways to reduce its exposure to commodity volatility.Brice Russell, chief procurement officer at privately held food group Mars, said publicly traded food companies were under pressure from investors to show they could manage their commodity costs so they could give accurate earnings forecasts. “They’re looking for price certainty,” Mr Russell said.However, even as companies hedge as much of their exposure as they can they cannot hedge all of it. Not all commodities are hedgeable, including some oils and liquid milk (which accounts for most of the milk purchases made by yoghurt producers Nestlé and Danone.)Nestlé is nevertheless trying to reduce its reliance on global milk markets by investing more heavily in farming co-operatives in countries such as India and China.Additional reporting by Javier Blas in London

154;GIS;General Mills;2008-04-24T18:26:26Z;Breakfast and bottoms;;In the breakfast cereal aisle of a Manhattan supermarket, a box of General Mills’Cheerios is advertising a special offer. A small green panel offers the chance to save $1.50 on a box of Pampers disposable nappies, made by Procter & Gamble.Over in the babycare aisle, packs of Pampers return the favour – with an image of a small round Cheerio linked with the brand’s heart logo, and a coupon to save $1.50 on any packet of the cereal.The on-pack coupon promotions are part of the “together for bright mornings” marketing campaign the two brands launched at the start of the year, highlighting a relationship bet­ween breakfast cereal and babies’ bottoms that might not otherwise have been apparent.Pampers, says the panel on the cereal packet, can help babies sleep better by helping to stop “leaks”, while Cheerios, the wheat cereal, has been recommended by one in five US paediatricians as a first “finger food” for toddlers.The campaign is the latest example of the consumer product industry’s pursuit of what it calls “customer focused” innovation, bringing together two companies that might not otherwise have realised their complementary relationship. Just as Nike and Apple looked at joggers listening to music and teamed up in 2005 to create the Nike+ running system, which combines running shoes and iPods, so Cheerios looked at its customers and saw the wisdom of a tie-up with Pampers.The initiative, says Becky O’Grady, marketing director for Cheerios, was about “being very consumer focused, really trying to be led by insights into their needs, and putting that into the marketing”.Behind the alliance lay an effort by Cheerios to look more closely at its consumers. It started segmenting them at the end of last year into four distinct groups: health-conscious adults, families, children and young parents, the target of the joint promotion with Pampers.“The foundation of the brand is the first finger-food moment – which means moms [with children] in the one to two age group – and if you talk to consumers …where they first and most emotionally connected with the brand, that life stage is at the centre,” says Ms O’Grady.Cheerios’ marketing campaign includes a parents’ section of the brand website that lists tips and articles on parenting, as well as a gallery of users’ photos, with their own brief anecdotes or tips.The children’s section, in contrast, provides cartoons and computer games.In the supermarkets, Cheerios has also started appearing alongside baby food. General Mills has created a new refillable plastic “toddler pack”, holding just over an ounce of cereal. The new packages appeared shortly after Nestlé’s baby food company Gerber launched its Fruit Puffs, cereal-style finger food. The re­usable containers, says Ms O’Grady, were created after observing parents putting Cheerios in plastic bags as a portable snack for their infants.The tie-up with Pampers came through their mutual advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi Americas. Saatchi, says Ms O’Grady, “was at the core of bringing the two groups together and saying, here’s a non-competitive area where you can get together and really understand the moms and what they want,” she says.The idea occurred, according to Mary Baglivo, chief executive of the advertising division, when two groups working on the separate accounts happened to start talking to each other. “They arrived at the thought that we could do some co-marketing together …that it would be fantastic for the business, and drive sales while contributing to each others’ brand equity.”Saatchi, whose advertising philosophy currently focuses on building emotional relationships with customers, argues that the tie-up “pushed forward” the emotional equity in the brands, which in Ms Baglivo’s view, “have a connection not just from the fact that they target the same group …but a connection in emotion and tonality”.For Cheerios, however, parents are only one of its target customer groups, and the link with Pampers has to work alongside its other targeted marketing.Ms O’Grady says the brand, which was first launched in 1946, needs to perform “a balancing act, and to talk about how to address to those consumers in the right way, and not to do anything that would alienate any particular group at any particular time”.“I think we’ve balanced that in a way that is true to the brand,” she says of the Pampers link-up.Ms Baglivo argues that emotion is the key, which is why it is acceptable to read about Pampers on the back of a breakfast cereal packet.“I think most people, when they see anything to do with a baby, tend to go to the cute and sweet side and not the down and dirty side …we have never had any polarising comments,” she says.
155;GIS;General Mills;2008-03-27T15:00:10Z;Unilever’s Cescau sees pay boosted to €4m;;An improving performance from Unilever has boosted pay for Patrick Cescau, chief executive, the consumer goods group’s annual report revealed on Thursday.Mr Cescau’s total remuneration rose from €2.94m for 2006 to €4.06m (£3.2m, $6.4m) in 2007. That included a bonus for the year of €2.35m. He took over in 2004, a time when Unilever’s performance had disappointed investors.The accounts also showed that Jim Lawrence, who was appointed chief financial officer in September, is on a base salary of $1.1m. He also received a total of $3.5m to compensate him for the loss of incentives he had at his former employer, General Mills, the US food group. That was made up of a cash award of $1m and shares worth $2.5m which will vest over the next three years.On average, Unilever executives received incentive awards for 2007 of 128 per cent of their base salaries.Unilever in February reported an 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 2007 to €5.2bn. It said in the accounts that it had “created more than €20bn of shareholder value” over the last three years.The total shareholder return Unilever has achieved has lagged the London and Amsterdam stockmarket indices over the last five years but in 2007 the gap narrowed.The group has also improved its standing in its 21-strong peer group of leading consumer products companies around the world such as Coca-Cola, Colgate, Danone, Nestle and Shiseido.On a three-year rolling basis, Unilever ranked 14th in 2005, and 13th in 2006 – a ranking too low to trigger awards made in 2004, which therefore lapsed in 2007.Its ranking rose again in 2007, but was just below the seventh place position which would give a 100 per cent award of shares granted three years earlier.

157;GIS;General Mills;2008-03-05T00:57:12Z;Gene modified crop spurs investor revolt;;A group of socially con­cer­ned US investors has launched a public campaign calling on food companies not to use a controversial new genetically engineered sugar beet crop that is to be planted for the first time this spring.The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) is calling on consumers to write to 63 companies, including Heinz, Campbell’s Soup, General Mills and Kraft, asking them to say they will not use a new sugar beet strain developed by Monsanto.The ICCR is a coalition of more than 300 faith-based institutional investors that has been in the vanguard of successful efforts to make companies more responsive to a range of social and environmental concerns.Its members have filed shareholder resolutions calling on the McDonald’s and Wendy’s restaurants chains and Safeway supermarkets to label products that contain genetically engineered ingredients.In a break with its usual focus on shareholder resolutions, it has launched a web-site, www.dontplantGMObeets.org, that calls on consumers to send letters to the management of the food companies that are the focus of its campaign. The letter cites survey claims that 50 per cent of US consumers would prefer not to buy GM products, and calls on the companies “to publicly oppose the spring 2008 planting of genetically modified sugar beets”.The “Roundup Ready” sugar beet in question was approved for planting by the US Department of Agriculture in March 2005. It has been genetically engineered to make it resistant to Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide.In January, four activist groups opposed to GM crops, including the Sierra Club, the largest US environmental group, filed a lawsuit in California calling on the agriculture department to review its approval of the beets.A similar lawsuit led a federal judge to issue a nationwide ban last year against further planting of Monsanto’s Roundup Ready alfalfa, pending a further environmental review by the federal government.Leslie Lowe, of the ICCR, said that leading food companies, including McDonald’s, Camp­bell’s Soup, General Mills and Anheuser Busch, had already chosen not to use a variety of genetically engineered ingredients. “This is a front-burner brand, reputation and consumer confidence issue [for the companies],” she said.

Retailers stayed under pressure after a profit warning at Sears compounded concerns about the health of the US consumer.The S&P 500 closed at 1,416.25 points, up 1.1 per cent; the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.6 per cent to 2,478.30 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.4 per cent to 12,778.15.IBM’s preliminary fourth-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent and revenues climbed 10 per cent, as overseas sales received a boost from the weak US dollar. The shares rose 5.4 per cent to $102.93.IBM’s results spurred a broad-based rally with strong gains in the technology sector. Intel, which reports quarterly results on Tuesday, rose 5 per cent to $23.08; Hewlett-Packardalso put on 5 per cent to $39.84.“In times of high uncertainty small pieces of information can have a disproportionate impact – markets tend to overreact both on the upside and the downside,” Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said.The tech sector has had particularly heavy selling in recent weeks, causing the Nasdaq to slide about 14 per cent from its October peak, amid worries that growth forecasts were too high.Echoing these concerns, Citi Investment Research lowered its view on the software and services sector on expectations of lower second-half demand. “It is not a big surprise that one of the industry’s key purchasers of software (the financial sector) is likely to be much more judicious with its dollars in the next year or so,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist.The fourth-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this week with technology companies’ profits forecast by Thomson Financial to rise 22 per cent and energy and healthcare also expected to deliver good earnings growth.A 72 per cent slump in financial company profits is expected to drag average fourth-quarter earnings into the negative for a second successive quarter, averaging an 11.3 per cent decline for the S&P 500. Citi reports on Tuesday, with earnings from JPMorgan on Tuesday and Merrill Lynch on Thursday.Investors are preparing for more losses with Citi taking as much as $24bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and cutting up to 24,000 jobs, according to a CNBC report.Citi, up 1.8 per cent at $29.06, is seeking as much as $14bn from Chinese, Kuwaiti and public market investors to ease pressure on its balance sheet, while Merrill Lynch, 2.3 per cent higher at $55.97, is looking to raise about $4bn.Retailers faced continued pressure amid fears for the health of consumer spending. Department store operator Sears said fourth-quarter earnings came in far below Wall Street expectations due to higher mark-downs and falling same-store sales.Goldman Sachs advised investors to sell the shares, which fell 5 per cent to $91.38, and downgraded several retailers. Coach, the handbag chain, fell 4.2 per cent to $25.72 and Ralph Lauren, the fashion house, lost 4.3 per cent to $52.90 after Goldman cut its rating on the stocks from “buy” to “neutral”.Consumer companies slid last week after a cautious outlook at American Express and weaker earnings guidance at Tiffany, the jeweller, led to fears about wealthy consumers, previously considered more immune to a downturn.Agribusiness continued its buoyant form after Cargill said second-quarter earnings had jumped 44 per cent. Monsanto gained 5.5 per cent to $127.25 while Archer Daniels Midland put on 3.4 per cent to $45.14.General Mills, the cereal maker, rose 0.7 per cent to $56.54 after a JPMorgan analyst upgraded the shares.Transport stocks benefited from a brokerage upgrade after Bear Stearns raised the trucking sector from “market underweight” to “market weight”. Ryder System jumped 6.4 per cent to $46 and YRC Worldwide gained 7.1 per cent to $14.86.Healthcare stocks ended five days of gains.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 13,206.95, but the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.2 per cent at 2,601.01.Financials pared solid early gains after S&P said “worsening expectations” for the performance of mortgage-backed securities meant it was lowering its outlook on MBIA and Ambac Financial’s AAA-rating to “negative”, meaning a downgrade is more likely.Ambac said it was confident of the performance of its insured portfolio and was taking measures to reinforce its capital position and its shares rose 1.8 per cent to $27.46. MBIA fell 2.5 per cent to $27.02. S&P cut ACA Financial Guaranty’s credit rating from A to CCC, in effect, stopping it from insuring more debt.Morgan Stanley rose 4.2 per cent to $50.08 after it said China Investment Corp, an investment vehicle controlled by the Chinese government, would inject $5bn to help shore up its balance sheet.Morgan fell to its first ever quarterly loss after it took a total of $9.4bn in mortgage-related writedowns, $5.7bn more than the company had advised in November. Full-year earnings were down 62 per cent to $3.44bn.Bear Stearns, 2.2 per cent weaker at $90.60, reports fourth-quarter results on Thursday and is also expected to report a loss for the quarter.In other earnings news Palm disappointed investors after it fell to a $9.6m second-quarter loss and revenues slid 11 per cent to $349.6m, just below expectations. The shares sank 6.9 per cent to $5.52. Results from Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, are due on Thursday. It rose 1.4 per cent at $102.13.After the closing bell Oracle, the enterprise software firm, reported a bigger-than-expected 35 per cent increase in quarterly net income, helped by a sharp rise in license sales. It closed 2.3 per cent lower at $20.76 but rose 3.7 per cent after hours.Quarterly profit at General Mills, the breakfast cereal producer, gained 1 per cent to $390.5m while revenues rose 7 per cent. The shares fell 1.8 per cent to $57.99 after the company said soaring costs will force it to raise prices.
160;GIS;General Mills;2007-12-11T03:10:39Z;Companies move to halt junk food advertising;;Nearly a dozen global food companies will on Tuesday announce plans to halt advertising junk food to children under 12 throughout Europe by the end of next year in the first serious attempt by food groups to tackle one of the causes of childhood obesity.The self-imposed ban, which follows a similar move by soft drink companies last year, comes after Markos Kyprianou, the European Union’s health and consumer affairs commissioner, warned industry to stop advertising junk food and drink to children voluntarily or face legislation.Food companies say that they want to show the EU that they are making a “credible” effort to limit advertising of sugary and fatty foods to children in television, print and on the Internet.The companies committing to what they call the “EU Pledge” are: Burger King, Coca-Cola, Danone, Ferrero, General Mills, Kellogg, Kraft, Mars, Nestle, PepsiCo and Unilever.Each company will set its own guidelines for what kinds of foods are inappropriate to advertise to children, but will base these guidelines on national or international nutrition standards. “It’s not a one-size fits all marketing code,” said one food company. Compliance with the standards will be monitored by independent bodies.Companies will also stop marketing foods and drinks in primary schools, unless they receive the approval of school authorities.Mr Kyprianou is also drawing up minimum food labelling standards, though plans have been delayed by internal Commission infighting. A proposed “made in EU” label drew fire, as did a proposal that all meat should carry the place of birth, death and slaughter.A leaked copy of the legislation, now expected early next year, shows industry will have some flexibility in what information it publishes and where.Details of calorific value, fat, saturates, sugar and salt must be placed prominently “in the field of vision” of the viewer reading the name of the product and with a minimum font size of eight.“Small print size is one of the main causes of consumer dissatisfaction with food labels,” the paper says.While consumers like schemes such as the traffic light system in the UK, more evidence is needed on its effectiveness, it says.Drinks makers are worried by plans to force beverages with more than 1.2 per cent alcohol content to include the number of calories on the bottle. They will also have to provide a fuller list of ingredients.In addition, drinks other than tea or coffee that are high in caffeine content will have to say so prominently.A spokeswoman for Mr Kyprianou said that the legislation could be amended further before publication in the New Year. It will then have to be agreed by governments and the European parliament.

Anna Venturi, the London-based school’s founder, says business is brisk as teams from companies including Abbott Mead Vickers, Merrill Lynch and Ebay head to Wandsworth to cook up a storm.Ms Venturi says cooking appeals to companies because it brings people together: “It’s not competitive. We just want everyone to relax and have a good time. In fact, it’s almost therapy. We get everyone, from directors to secretaries, from graduates to retirement dos.”The team from Cereal Products Worldwide, a joint venture between Nestlé and General Mills, making mushroom ravioli, stuffed loin of pork and caramelised oranges with profiteroles in the kitchen at Venturi’s Table, appears to prove Ms Venturi’s point that cooking can build teams.The group members are of mixed culinary abilities: some are dab hands in the kitchen; others have never caramelised an orange in their lives. Yet everyone happily pitches in – and slaving over a hot stove and piping chocolate custard into a profiterole helps to break down barriers. Masele Siatu’u, CPW’s human resources vice-president, says having your elbows in flour and eggs brings together fellow employees who are dispersed across the world.This is the reason the company chose to send the team on a cookery course, says Christi Strauss, CPW chief executive. “We look for something that cuts across ages and backgrounds and cultures. If we [played] golf, it would be great for good golfers, but not necessarily for anyone else.” With cookery, she says, anyone can take part and they can participate as much or little as they want. Plus there’s a tasty meal on offer at the end of the day.Richard Pash, a marketing manager at Mars and another Venturi customer, says cookery feels natural compared to some teambuilding activities. Constructing a bridge across a stream when there is a perfectly good one 50 metres away may seem a little pointless, but cooking a three-course meal you intend to sit down and eat certainly isn’t. “Unlike many courses we’ve been on, it’s the opposite of contrived,” says Mr Pash.Venturi’s Table isn’t the only company offering corporate cookery courses. Cookery School at Little Portland Street in London has an increasing number of corporate clients who, says principal Rosalind Rathouse, comprise about a third of its business. These include Investec, BP and Iron Mountain.Many of the better known cookery schools offer packages aimed at businesses. Mosimann’s Academy allows teambuilders to be taught by the eponymous Anton, while the Lavender House in Norfolk and The Food and Wine Academy also cater for corporate cooks.The Cookery School differentiates itself by working with psychologists who observe the team members as they cook before feeding back to the group. Organisations that want to see how teams work under different circumstances can ask for a stressful or confrontational kitchen. “It becomes a microcosm of the workplace,” says Ms Rathouse.Perhaps the most intriguing use of places like Venturi, however, is not as venues for teambuilding but for client entertainment. Ms Venturi’s daughter Letizia Tufari, who worked at Pfizer before joining her mother’s business, says client hospitality is a growing income stream for Venturi. She says that for cash-rich, time-poor business people, fine dining has become rather pedestrian. But cooking a three-course meal for oneself is more unusual.“When a lot of people entertain clients, they just spend a great deal of money,” says Ms Tufari. “But after a while being taken to another expensive restaurant becomes boring. Something like this appears much more thoughtful to clients.”"
162;GIS;General Mills;2007-10-31T19:14:54Z;Milk costs;;Record-high dairy prices have eaten into margins at companies whose products list dairy as a primary ingredient. The US has stepped up production to counteract supply shocks in Europe and Australia, and prices should ease next year. But milk future prices suggest that the timetable for relief is moving further into 2008, as accelerating demand continues to overwhelm supply.Global population growth and booming consumption in developing countries have strengthened demand for dairy products. But European Union exports have dropped sharply in recent years because of cuts in farmer subsidies and stronger local demand. Droughts have shrunk Australia’s surplus, and production costs have risen worldwide as a result of higher fuel, fertiliser and cattle feed prices. Exports from the US, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Ukraine have only barely offset these declines elsewhere, according to Rabobank. And once-huge stockpiles of butter and dry milk powder in the EU and US are gone.Costs have spiked for most commodities, but dairy has led the charge. November prices for the type of milk used to make cheese are up 85 per cent from a year ago, while yoghurt milk is up 141 per cent and skimmed milk powder 155 per cent. High input costs are pressuring margins at chocolate-makers Hershey, Nestlé and Cadbury Schweppes, yoghurt-makers General Mills and Danone, and Domino’s and Starbucks. Kraft on Wednesday blamed soaring dairy costs when it reported a 20 per cent drop in third-quarter profits.Most dairy-dependent companies have responded by raising prices, and consumers have so far accepted costlier KitKats and Kraft cheese slices. But if global dairy demand continues to accelerate, prices may not soften as much as forecast – and foodmakers may have limited headroom for further price rises.
163;GIS;General Mills;2007-09-20T04:20:24Z;General Mills lifts prices to see earnings rise;;General Mills, the US food company, said on Wednesday that price increases in cereals, yoghurt and other foods contributed to a strong first quarter, as it passed on higher commodity prices to consumers.But it also said it was expecting to face “continued inflation in our input costs over the year ahead”, due to price increases for commodities, energy and labour.Steve Sanger, chief executive, said the company was “actively monitoring the need to pass on additional input costs as they arrive”.He added: “These costs have been marching upwards for several years now.”General Mills is forecasting a 5 per cent increase in input costs for the current fiscal year, against the 4 per cent seen in the previous year, including a forecast $250m increase in ingredient and energy costs.Mr Sanger said the manufacturer was carefully watching recent increases in oil and wheat prices, adding that it was “very possible” its $250m estimate for increased costs would rise. During the quarter, General Mills reduced the box sizes of cereals such as Cheerios and Chex, while increasing the cost per ounce.General Mills and other food manufacturers have been hit by higher milk and cereal prices that they attribute in part to agricultural production being switched to corn for bio-fuels. Kroger, the largest US supermarket group, said on Wednesday that price inflation for dry and perishable grocery products was running currently “at a level not seen in several years”.General Mills’ net earnings rose 8 per cent to $289m, or 81 cents per diluted share, on a 7 per cent year-on-year increase in sales to $3.07bn.During the quarter, it said it had also boosted its performance with an 11 per cent increase in its marketing spending. Shares in General Mills’ were down just under 1 per cent at $58.14 at lunchtime in New York.● US retailers are likely to see slower growth in holiday sales due to the credit squeeze and concerns over energy prices and housing, according to two new forecasts. The National Retail Federation says in its holiday forecast it expected sales in November and December to grow 4 per cent to $474.5bn, compared with 4.6 per cent last year. TNS Retail Forward, a consultancy, said sales growth should slow to 3.6 per cent.
164;GIS;General Mills;2007-07-26T21:49:15Z;Kellogg fears bite of switch to biofuels;;Kellogg, the US cereals and snacks company, on Thursday highlighted what it called the “structural change” in agricultural production because of bio-fuels and the growing inflationary pressures on commodity and food prices they were causing.David Mackay, chief executive, said: “Generally, what is going on with ethanol and bio-diesel is having a material impact on most of the raw materials that most food manufacturers use …We are seeing a structural change.”Kellogg, which announced stronger-than-expected second quarter results on Thursday, said it had lifted its forecast for the impact of commodity and energy costs on its full-year earnings by 8 cents per share – or more than a third – to $0.26-$0.30.Mr Mackay estimated that wheat prices had accounted for 25 to 40 per cent of the additional 8 cents costs, as the company went into the market this month with prices at a 20-year high. He also cited increased packaging costs, as a result of increases in aluminium and resin, and higher dairy costs.In June, General Mills forecast that its commodity and energy costs would more than double in its new fiscal year.Early this month, Peter Brabeck, chairman of Nestlé, warned that food prices were set for a period of “significant and long-lasting” inflation because of demand from China and India and the use of crops for biofuels.Kellogg maintained its earnings guidance for the year at $2.71-$2.74.Mr Mackay said that the company had already increased prices in most of its categories over the past six to 12 months, including a 1 per cent increase in its retail breakfast cereal prices last month, and would seek to contain the further cost increases through increased efficiencies as it continues.Kellogg said that its profits rose 12.7 per cent to $301m, or 75 cents a share, in the second quarter, while sales rose 9 per cent to $3bn, both beating analysts’ estimates.
165;GIS;General Mills;2007-05-23T19:44:35Z;A commodities boom makes itself felt in the supermarket;;"The old adage that “as goes silver, so go soybeans” is more than just a whimsical piece of American farming folk wisdom. That commodity prices tend to rise and fall in unison is a deadly serious economic phenomenon for consumers around the world as food costs increase sharply, in some countries at the fastest pace for decades.Agricultural commodity prices are often volatile, in part due to weather fluctuations that affect crops. But what is unusual about recent price increases is that so many prices – everything from grains to ground nut oil – are rising simultaneously.Market observers say raw material prices are being driven up by shortages in supply (in part due to the growth of the biofuel industry and a drought in Australia) combined with increases in demand from countries such as China and India.They warn the world could be facing a period of “unprecedented food inflation” over the next 18 months as food companies try to pass on the higher costs of raw commodities to consumers. “It could become a perfect storm scenario,” says Michael Steib, food analyst at Morgan Stanley. He also warned of potential humanitarian consequences. “Affordability could become an issue in some parts of the world,” he said.The 6.7 per cent annual growth in food prices tracked in the US at the beginning of this year, if it continues, would be the biggest annual increase since 1980. The UK is witnessing comparable increases, as is China, where food is up an annual 6.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year. In all these countries, food prices are rising more quickly than overall prices. “There is a global trend,” says Mislav Matejka, European equity strategist at JPMorgan. “Food pricing is on the increase.”No one in the food industry has any doubt that the reason for food price inflation is higher agricultural commodity prices. What is under debate is why all commodities are up so suddenly and for how long the prices will continue to rise.Average US dollar spot prices for corn are up 86 per cent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier; palm oil is up 41 per cent; US raw milk is up 22.5 per cent; soyabean oil is up 32 per cent; cocoa is up 16 per cent; and coffee is up 23.5 per cent, according to data from Morgan Stanley.Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, believes the price increases are here to stay, in part because demand for agricultural raw materials is so strong that countries will have to expand the amount of land they farm to satisfy it. This is more costly than just increasing yields on current farming land, the bank says. “Growing land is going to be a lot more expensive than growing yields,” says Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.Most analysts say the global economic recovery is also a significant long-term cause: as people become wealthier, they can afford to eat more meat, milk and eggs, which are more expensive than other staple foods.The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which promotes the integration of developing countries into the world economy, says increases in per capita income and expanding urban populations in developing countries will lead to greater consumption of livestock products, fruits and vegetables.An analysis of income growth in China released by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation in April also predicted that higher incomes would lead to greater consumption of vegetable oils, meats and dairy products.Although China should meet much of the higher demand for meat by increasing its own production, it is expected to have to import more vegetable oils and some dairy products. China’s total agricultural imports have grown more quickly than anticipated, more than doubling between 2001 and 2004 to $33bn.Economists worry that the sudden increase in the cost of such a basic good as food will fuel inflation. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at US financial advisor Wells Capital Management, says the rise in non-energy commodity prices could presage an increase in core consumer inflation later this year.Meanwhile, humanitarian agencies are worried that a sustained rise in prices will make it more difficult to feed people in the poorest countries. Greg Barrow, spokesman for the UN’s World Food Programme, says rising demand for raw materials from China, as well as a weaker US dollar and higher transportation costs, are making its food purchases more expensive. A sustained rise in food prices would mean the agency would either have to ask donors for more money or cut back on aid for the 90m people it feeds, he adds.Stock analysts have begun to downgrade the share prices of food companies, which they believe will have trouble passing on the rising costs of raw materials to consumers. Deutsche Bank last week lowered its equity ratings on Unilever, Danone and Nestlé, citing concerns over the impact of price increases on the companies’ future profit margins, while Morgan Stanley similarly lowered its ratings on Numico.Nestlé, the Swiss food group, last month announced that not only was it facing higher costs for grains, corn and green coffee, but that the price of milk (its biggest single raw material cost) was “going up like a rocket”.Agricultural raw materials typically account for 20-25 per cent of a food company’s costs. Nestlé and Unilever, along with other food and drink companies such as Hershey, Mars, Wrigley, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and SABMiller, have been raising prices to try to recover some of the cost increases.But analysts worry that food retailers may soon start to resist food companies’ attempts to push through price increases and food companies have been looking at alternatives to putting up prices. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, recently said it had started “playing games with [product] formulations” to try to reduce costs, such as using less rapeseed oil in its margarines.One tactic favoured by companies in the past is to sell less food for the same price. Hershey famously kept the price of its trademark chocolate bar steady at a nickel (5 cents) between 1900 and 1969. When cocoa prices rose, it simply bought less and made the bar smaller. This worked until the 1970s, when rampant inflation made it untenable.The strategy is now being tried by cereal makers. John McMillin, food analyst at Prudential Securities, says: “Both Kellogg’s and General Mills [cereal makers] are shrinking boxes: the question is, will Americans notice it?”"
166;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;The to-do list to end them all;;Three years ago, Kevin Wilde overhauled his life in an effort to be more organised. As vice-president of General Mills, the US food manufacturer, he was already successful. But as its chief learning officer, he was sure he could learn some new tricks about personal productivity. So he called in David Allen, author of the best-selling book Getting Things Done (GTD).Mr Allen’s approach to personal organisation is rigorous to say the least. It involves gathering every single unfinished task or “open loop” in your life – from implementing a new policy across your company to fixing a leaking tap at home – into a regimented system of to-do lists so that they no longer weigh on your mind.Initially, this means walking round your office and house, picking up every scrap of paper, business card, receipt and Post-it Note – anything that represents an open loop – and putting it into a huge box marked “in”.Processing all this stuff takes the average person two full days. But, Mr Allen says, it is absolutely necessary: your goal should be to create a comprehensive list of actions and projects (when two actions or more are needed) that can be deferred, delegated or done personally. In this way, you have a trusted system to take the strain of all your commitments. “If it’s on your mind, your mind isn’t clear,” he says.To maintain the system, you must review your commitments and process any new ones you have gathered on a regular – preferably weekly – basis.Mr Wilde says the regime has had a dramatic impact on his work style and wellbeing. He singles out two of Mr Allen’s insights for particular praise: “First, putting everything in one place and managing off a master list of tasks versus having to look at old e-mails, file folders and paper notes to find my commitments. Second, doing the ‘weekly review’ of my calendar: all the commitments, projects and goals.”He is not the only one to have benefited from Mr Allen’s ideas. Since the book was first published in 2001, tens of thousands of GTD fans have used websites, forums and chat-rooms to exchange advice, anecdotes and software recommendations.The “cult of GTD” is still growing and at the heart of this loose community is 43folders.com, published by Merlin Mann, a San Francisco-based website project manager and designer. GTD and similar techniques, he explains, were initially most popular with IT workers.“Geeks are like coal-mine canaries,” he says. “They encounter problems before other people. They got spam before the rest of us knew what it meant, for example. And being aware of ways to improve what you’re doing is a built-in practice in programming.”Increasingly, Mr Mann says, the techniques are being embraced by other types of worker. “I think there was an immediate resonance with writers, designers and other creatives – anyone with a job involving lots of decisions and without hard walls between their different roles.”So could such systems be adopted as policies to make entire companies more productive? Mr Wilde thinks so. “We’ve had more than 2,000 employees GTD’d in one form or another, from top executives to entry-level employees,” he says. General Mills has modified and extended the methodology to “better adapt to our culture” and now offers GTD training to all 27,000 staff.The results, he says, have been impressive – and measurable. “Various measurements are used, depending on the programme and initiative. Some track return on investment, some employee satisfaction, some ‘alignment to strategy’.”A big benefit of widespread use of GTD, he adds, is that when staff switch jobs they leave their successor with comprehensive information about the status of all their work.Mr Mann highlights how GTD encourages you to consider what your “next action” is whenever you are outlining a project, finishing a period of work or coming to the end of a meeting. “When people learn the ‘next-action habit’ they get a lot more done every day.”There is evidence to suggest that many “knowledge workers” would benefit from “personal productivity improvement” training – for example in the results of the Microsoft Office personal productivity challenge, published in 2005. Respondents to this survey of 38,000 people in 200 countries said that, although they worked 45 hours a week on average, 17 hours were “unproductive”. Similarly, they spent 5.6 hours in meetings, but 69 per cent said they felt those meetings were not productive. The most common “productivity pitfalls” identified by the survey included ineffective meetings, unclear objectives, unclear priorities and procrastination – all targeted specifically by GTD. Only 34 per cent of respondents said they were using “proven scheduling tools and techniques” to help them accomplish tasks.For knowledge workers, the tools of personal organisation include software – hence Microsoft’s interest in commissioning such a survey. Indeed 55 per cent of respondents said they related productivity directly to their software.Mr Allen’s website sells literature and software utilities that help users of common applications such as Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Notes to implement GTD. These products are targeted primarily at PC users, but it is users of Apple Macintosh computers who have embraced GTD most fervently. A huge number of applications have been written for Macs by members of the GTD movement.“Apple’s whole design ethos is one of elegance,” Mr Allen says when asked why Mac users should be particularly enthusiastic about GTD. “They have a kind of zen approach, and the same is true of our methodology.”Among diehard GTD converts, talk of eastern philosophies governing the in-tray is not unusual. Indeed, many report that by “capturing” all the unresolved tasks in their lives in a watertight system, they achieve an almost transcendental state in which dealing with everyday problems becomes effortless and dealing with crises considerably easier.As Mr Allen says, by observing a few simple rules of information management, it really is possible to have a “mind like water”, the term karate experts use to describe a state of perfect readiness.A QUEST FOR HARMONY IN YOUR LIFE, WORK AND CALENDAR■ One to-do list is not enough. Your calendar is the place for time-critical matters. Everything else should go into to-do lists. Actions that are not related to projects should be grouped into contexts such as “at home”, “at computer”, “telephone calls” and so on. This ensures that, whenever you have a spare moment in any particular context, you can get to work on the “next action”. David Allen, author of “Getting Things Done” also recommends a “waiting for” list, where commitments made to you by others are recorded.■ Learn to leverage your software. Most staff learn the nuances of corporate systems on the job and even where training programmes exist they often ignore features of software that can make a huge difference to productivity. For example, opening e-mails manually rather than letting your system announce their arrival will improve concentration.■ Introduce new staff to your personal techniques. “When someone joins your team, take them to lunch on day one and explain the little procedures you follow to help keep friction to a minimum,” says Mr Mann, of 43folders.com. “How do you use e-mail? How late can you be reached outside office hours? When is it OK and not OK to come over to your desk with a problem? Asking for uniformity in the way staff use subject lines in e-mails can be hugely helpful, but it’s something they may not learn for 10 years on the job unless you tell them.”■ Roll out good techniques by example. If you make one person more productive, their colleagues will want to improve. “The issue is not who is using what system, but who is keeping their commitments,” Mr Allen says.■ Create a “tickler file” for reminders. Take 43 folders and label them one to 31 and the months of the year. Now, whenever you find something in your in-tray that requires your attention in the near futureslip it into the folder that corresponds to the relevant date. Checking today’s folder gives you a physical reminder of what needs doing.
167;GIS;General Mills;2006-10-12T07:44:19Z;Unilever fails to freeze out ice cream rivals;;The European ice cream market could be opened to greater competition after Unilever lost an appeal to the European Court of Justice to ban sales of competitors’ ice creams in freezers in Ireland.The ruling marks the end of a dispute, spanning more than 20 years, between Unilever, which dominates the European ice cream market, and Mars.“This is a landmark case of European competition law that may revolutionise the ice cream market in Europe,” one anti-trust specialist from a international legal firm said. “It opens the market up to much more competition.”Unilever has a 25 per cent share of the Western European ice cream market, according to data from Euromonitor, the market research firm. It is followed by Nestlé with a 11 per cent share, Mars with 4 per cent and General Mills with one per cent.However, Unilever said that the Court of Justice’s ruling applied only in Ireland, and would not have an impact in any other European market.Unilever and Mars have been battling for decades over sales of so-called “impulse” ice cream (single ice creams that are sold in petrol stations and convenience stores) in Ireland, where Unilever is the main producer. The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company has traditionally supplied ice cream retailers with freezer cabinets for free on the condition that retailers stock them exclusively with Unilever’s products.Mars complained about Unilever’s sales practices to the European Commission after entering the Irish ice cream market in the late 1980s, having found that retailers supplied by Unilever would not stock its products.This set off a chain of legal proceedings that ended up in the European Commission. The Commission found that Unilever had abused its “dominant” position in the Irish market.Unilever appealed the decision, but in 2003, the Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance backed the Commission’s decision. Unilever contested the court’s findings, appealing to the European Court of Justice.Unilever said on Wednesday that it did not expect to make any further appeals, and that it had been allowing other companies to sell ice creams in its cabinets in Ireland since the last court ruling in 2003. It said that its market share had grown in Ireland since that time, proving that exclusivity in freezer cabinets “is not a barrier to competition.”

Barrick Gold rose 2.5 per cent to $29.06 and Phelps Dodge added 2.9 per cent to $83.79.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent, or 7.15 points, at 1,318.03, well down from a 5½-year high recorded on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.7 per cent, or 15.14 points, at 2,237.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also down 0.7 per cent, or 79.96 points, at 11,538.23.The main indices had edged higher at the start of trade after the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged.But news that the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s business activity index for August had fallen to its lowest level for more than three years heightened concerns about a broad US economic slowdown.“This breaks a string of 14 straight positive readings, and is much weaker than expected,” said analysts at ActionEconomics.Breakfast cereal maker General Mills climbed 3.3 per cent to $54.75 after it reported a better-than-expected 6 per cent rise in first quarter earnings.Consumer stocks were among the main losers from the Philadelphia Fed data. Amazon tumbled 5.9 per cent to $30.22, and Federated Department Stores dropped 4.1 per cent to $40.95.Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Cubs baseball team, rose 4.4 per cent to $32.05 on speculation that it would announce a restructuring.Media group CBS sank 1.1 per cent to $28.25.Hospira, a maker of drug delivery systems, rose 4.4 per cent to $39.20 on news that it would buy Australia’s Mayne Pharmaceuticals for $2bn. Cruise ship operator Carnival sailed up 2.7 per cent to $44.75 after it beat forecasts with its third-quarter earnings as it benefited from falling fuel costs."
169;GIS;General Mills;2006-04-23T20:11:45Z;Fitch downgrades Cargill outlook;;"Fitch, a credit rating agency, has offered a rare glimpse into the finances of Cargill, the world’s largest agricultural company, revising the group’s long-term debt outlook to negative from stable on concern that higher capital expenditure will slow debt reduction.Cargill was the largest privately held company in the US until it was overtaken by Koch Industries through its recent purchase of Georgia-Pacific, the world’s biggest tissue maker.Fitch said Cargill’s consolidated debt as of February was $14.8bn.Cargill, which had revenues last year of $71bn, has been shifting from relying mostly on grain processing into higher margin businesses such as developing ingredients for food groups.It has a division producing plant sterols, cholesterol-reducing plant ingredients that go into health bars made by General Mills. In 2002, Cargill bought Cerestar, a European maker of starches and sweeteners, for about $1bn.Last month, European antitrust authorities gave approval for Cargill’s acquisition of the food ingredients business of Degussa, a German chemical group, for $685m including debt.Fitch, which has rated Cargill since 2003, said on Friday the Degussa purchase and higher capital expenditures would “likely slow debt reduction in the near term”.Fitch said: “The expansion in capital expenditures from $731m in 2002 to almost $1.8bn for the latest 12 months has reduced free cashflow to below $300m.”Lisa Clemens, a Cargill spokeswoman, said the company was not surprised by Fitch’s move, which left the long-term rating unchanged at A+. She said: “Over the past five years if you look at our sales, earnings and net worth our financial performance has been strengthening with our strategy. Cashflow has outpaced capital expenditure by more than historical averages over the last three years.”This month, Cargill reported $370m in third-quarter net earnings, up from $366m previously.Three of Cargill’s five business segments – risk management and financial; grain origination and processing; and food ingredients – beat last year’s performance.However, Fitch said it was “concerned about the sustainability of the large and growing earnings stream” coming from the risk management and financial division (RM&F).Fitch said net earnings from RM&F contributed about 30 per cent to 2005 earnings and were “likely to contribute an even greater amount in 2006”."
170;GIS;General Mills;2006-03-27T11:59:05Z;Diageo moves to plug pensions hole;;Diageo on Monday became the latest British company to announce plans to plug the hole in its pension fund, pledging to pay off the £653m deficit over seven years.An initial payment of about £100m will be made by the drinks company later this year following the planned three-yearly reassessment of the pension deficit. Repayment of the total shortfall will take seven years, from the start of the company’s next financial year in July.On top of the deficit funding, Diageo will continue its cash payments to maintain the benefits of those within the fund, expected to be £50m in the financial year ending June 30.Paul Walsh, chief executive, said in a statement that the framework demonstrated, “ Diageo’s commitment to provide a high standard of employment benefits.“It follows the sale of our shares in General Mills and our full exit from Burger King and provides further clarity in relation of Diageo’s balance sheet,” Mr Walsh added.Last week, British Airways, which has one of the biggest pension-fund shortfalls facing a UK company, said it planned to pay £500m into its scheme in return for its staff agreeing to work longer and cap their benefits.The airline has a deficit of about £2bn, the worst pensions shortfall in the FTSE 100 as a ratio to its market capitalisation of just over £4bn. Diageo has a market value of £25.7bn.Shares in Diageo lost 4.5p in London morning trade to 904p.

Microsoft, which lost more than 2 per cent on Wednesday, shed 1.1 per cent to $26.85. Dell, which bought gaming-computer maker Alienware for an undisclosed sum, failed to buck the falling trend, easing 0.2 per cent to $30.34.The news lifted shares in chipmaker Advanced Micro Devicesto climb 1.1 per cent to $34.75 after JPMorgan analysts said the Dell deal could spur sales.YRC Worldwide, the largest trucking company in the US, led the decline among transport stocks. Its shares skidded 14.9 per cent to $38.56 after it slashed its first-quarter guidance.The earnings reporting season for food makers had a good start with General Mills rising 0.5 per cent to $50.23 after it topped analyst estimates with a 7 per cent rise in third-quarter profits.Rival ConAgra rose 1.4 per cent to $20.54 despite a swing into third-quarter losses due to restructuring and litigation charges. Analysts said that without the one-off costs, the company had beaten expectations.Better than expected quarterly profit and earnings guidance sent shares in Jabil Circuit, a contract electronics maker, to a five-year high of $42.75, up 11.8 per cent.General Motors, which sold a majority stake in its financing arm GMAC Commerical Holding in a deal valued at $9bn, ended a choppy session almost unchanged at $22.00.
172;GIS;General Mills;2006-02-22T00:45:30Z;Activist investor targets Heinz;;"Heinz could become the latest large US company to be targeted by an activist investor after moves by Nelson Peltz, the New York financier, to build a stake in the food group.Mr Peltz, who has already been pushing for change at Wendy’s International and Cracker Barrel, two restaurant chains, is considering mounting a campaign to challenge Heinz’s management in a proxy battle, according to people familiar with the matter. They added that Mr Peltz might be joined by other investors calling for change at Heinz.Heinz is one of a handful of midsize US food companies, such as Campbell Soup and Sara Lee, that have been struggling to compete with the scale of larger rivals that include Kraft and General Mills. Under the leadership of William Johnson, Heinz’s current chief executive, the company’s shares have fallen from above $50 in the late 1990s to $36.78 on Tuesday.However, Mr Johnson is well respected in his sector, and has already been taking steps to refocus the company’s businesses.In the latest move, Heinz on Tuesday agreed to sell its European seafood division to Lehman Brothers’ private equity unit for $506m.A spokesman for Mr Peltz declined to comment on any efforts to take control of Heinz, which is based in Pittsburgh and has a market capitalisation of $12.3bn. If his stake were to move above 5 per cent, his intentions would have to be disclosed in a filing with US regulators.Although Mr Peltz’s move on Heinz might still falter, it marks the latest example by activist investors to put pressure on the management at some of the biggest US companies to amend their strategies.Last week, activist Carl Icahn reached a settlement ending a six-month battle for control of Time Warner, the largest media company.Mr Peltz is among the most well-known financiers specialising in the US consumer products industry, and prides himself on his operational expertise in the sector. In the late 1990s, he took control of Snapple for $300m, selling it three years later for $1.5bn.Most recently, he has been seeking change at Wendy’s, which has already been targeted by Bill Ackman, another activist investor. Mr Peltz has built up a stake in CBRL, a holding company for Cracker Barrel, the roadside restaurant chain.News of Mr Peltz’s interest in Heinz came as the company finalised a deal to sell its European seafood business to Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking, a unit of the US investment bank, for $506m.“This major transaction successfully focuses our portfolio in Europe on three core categories: ketchup and sauces; infant nutrition; and meals and snacks,’’ Mr Johnson said.Heinz shares, which were trading above $50 in the late 1990s, were down 0.3 per cent to $36.59 in Tuesday."
173;GIS;General Mills;2006-01-31T19:56:43Z;Transatlantic split persists over GM food;;"At the cereal aisle of the Safeway supermarket in Washington’s Tenleytown district, Ellen O’Brien scans the shelves. She picks out a box of Wheaties, made by General Mills, and turns to eye jars of Smucker’s Goober Strawberry peanut butter.Does she know cereals and peanut butter may contain genetically modified ingredients? “I have to say I’m blissfully unaware,” says Ms O’Brien, who works in healthcare finance. Like most American shoppers, she accepts that three-quarters of processed foods sold in the US contain GM organisms. But in Europe, GM food is absent from supermarkets and remains a subject of much consumer suspicion.A study produced for the International Food Information Council last year showed that fewer than 0.5 per cent of American consumers identified food biotechnology as a safety concern. In contrast, a Eurobarometer opinion poll across the 25-nation European Union found that 54 per cent considered GM food to be dangerous. It is a transatlantic divide that will be thrown into renewed stark relief this month as a landmark trade dispute between the two regions comes to a head.The World Trade Organisation is about to rule in a case brought against the European Union in 2003 by the US, Canada and Argentina, which claim that an EU moratorium on the approval of GM foods and crops, introduced in 1998, lacked scientific basis and created an unfair trade barrier. The case has significance beyond the moratorium, which the EU argues has in any event become all but obsolete following its enactment of stricter labelling and tracing legislation and the limited resumption of product approvals in May 2004, when the EU gave clearance to a GM corn developed by Syngenta.Instead, the ruling will be important in efforts by the US to prevent European GM concerns from spreading, especially to Asia and Africa. David Bullock, professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, says with a neatly chosen metaphor: “The US is trying to nip things in the bud.’’GM crops – first grown in the three nations that brought the WTO case – now cover 90m hectares (222m acres) in 21 countries. Summing up the challenge for American farmers – for whom exports already represent one-quarter of their cash receipts – Richard Crowder, the chief US agricultural negotiator, says: “As incomes rise in the rest of the world and our market further matures, trade will be ever more important for agriculture.”Since the first commercial amounts of GM soyabeans, cotton and maize were planted in 1996, US farmers have become increasingly reliant on the advanced crop types produced through genetic modification. The technology involves selecting specific genes from one organism and introducing them into another to produce traits – such as drought-resistance or resilience against pests – that can increase farmers’ harvests. About 85 per cent of soyabeans, 76 per cent of cotton and 45 per cent of maize planted in the US in 2004 were of GM varieties, according to the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology.US President George W. Bush once provocatively invited visiting European leaders to the White House dining room with the words: “Let’s go and eat some genetically modified food for lunch.” In Europe, few politicians are willing to endorse GMOs – and some even avoid condemning the burning of trial fields by anti-GM activists such as José Bové in France. Patrick Rudels­heim, a specialist on European GM regulation who supervised field trials for several leading GM companies, says: “A field destruction in itself is a serious investment loss, but perhaps more depressing is the subsequent lack of support from the authorities. It’s often pure judicial laisser faire.’’At the retail level, Europe’s GM clock has arguably been turned back in the past decade. The little GM food that was available, notably tomato purée sold in the UK by the J Sainsbury and Safeway chains in 1996, was subsequently removed from the shelves amid a wider food safety debate. Today, one European supermarket executive says, it would be “almost commercial suicide’’ to sell GM food.Ragnar Löfstedt, professor in risk management at King’s College London, identifies three main reasons for Europe’s aversion to GM food. First, he argues, Americans’ trust in their Food and Drug Administration is far greater than that of Europeans in their own health regulators (the wariness dating as far back as the 1960s Thalidomide birth deformities scandal). Second, the US has avoided food scandals on the scale of the “mad cow’’ crisis of the 1990s, which led to a decade-long ban on British beef exports. That coincided with the first GM crop trials and brought “a knee-jerk reaction’’ by the EU in its decision to stop approving new types of GM products in 1998.Third, Prof Löfstedt and others stress, was a faulty communications strategy by GM companies, in particular Monsanto of the US, the industry leader, when it targeted Europe. He says: “Monsanto was not culturally sensitive enough to realise the potential for a European public backlash . . . GMOs, rightly or wrongly, are perceived to be an American issue and Europeans don’t like Americans to tell them what to do.’’Europeans have therefore remained sceptical about whether GMOs are harmless, notably when it comes to growing GM crops alongside traditional produce, where strains can cross-
pollinate. American politicians and GM scientists argue that the burden of proof lies the other way, namely to find evidence that GM crops cause harm. Jonathan Ramsey, a Monsanto spokesman in Europe, says European consumer perceptions will shift, adding that people had “reflected on the scare stories that were around 10 years ago on super weeds and fish genes in tomatoes and have come to see that this was actually scaremongering”.Yet the real ideological – and commercial – battleground for GMOs is increasingly in the developing world. Alarm was raised in the US when Zimbabwe in 2002 refused an aid shipment of US grain because it might have contained GM maize. The debate has also been intense in countries such as Zambia and Ethiopia. The US has tried to strengthen its case by arguing that GM crops can alleviate poverty, not least since they eliminate the need for poor farmers to budget for inputs such as insecticides. Officials have pointed to agricultural progress in countries such as Brazil, which almost doubled its GM crops last year to 9.4m hectares, the fastest growth rate worldwide.However, many environmental and consumer groups contest those benefits. In a report last month focusing on Monsanto, Friends of the Earth underlined some of the paradoxical aspects of GM farming in the developing world – including an alleged increase in the use of herbicides to combat weeds that have grown tolerant to Roundup Ready soyabeans, a leading GM crop. The result, according to Charles Margolis of the Washington-based Center for Food Safety, a non-profit advocacy group, is that “companies like Monsanto are now telling these farmers to use really toxic chemicals. It’s a joke.’’In spite of such scepticism – and regardless of the WTO case – the US can point to signs that it is starting to win the argument on GM acceptance globally, according to recent statistics on the extent of GM crop plantings. A study produced last month by the non-profit International Service for the Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation showed that developing countries have adopted GM crops at four times the pace of developed economies in the last decade. Of the 8m farmers growing such crops globally, 90 per cent were located in developing countries.Acceptance of GMOs is receiving a further boost with the emergence of largely government-backed research into the technology in China – which is developing a strain of rice rich in vitamin A – (see below right) as well as work in India and even Iran, which joined the GM-growing club last year.Experts say such developments may have more effect than any WTO pressure on Europe to relax its opposition to GMOs. Even within the Vatican it is recognised that GMOs can have a role in reducing poverty (see below left). But the short-term prospects for GM farming in Europe remain unclear. Of the four countries that started or resumed GM crop production last year, three were EU members: Portugal, France and the Czech Republic. However, that has been countered by growing regional opposition to GMOs – 172 regional governments across Europe have sought or implemented bans on GM crops, according to Friends of the Earth, the environmental campaign group.At a national level, Switzerland’s voters rejected GM crops in a referendum last November. Maria Rauch-Kallat, health minister of Austria, which currently holds the EU’s presidency, says she believes her country’s “strict resistance’’ to GMOs will remain. “Like others in Europe, Austrians are very close to nature. Our vision of a good society is certainly not one where everybody is allowed to do whatever is technologically possible.’’According to GM proponents, the first consequence of such resistance is that Europe is losing corporate investment. They cite Syngenta, which in 2004 started moving its biotechnology research headquarters from Britain to the US “to be in a more positive environment for this kind of work”. Christian Verscheuren, director-general of CropLife, a trade association representing Monsanto and other leading GM companies, says: “The industry has not given up on Europe but it has considerably scaled back.”But the longer-term and more serious impact for Europe may lie beyond GMOs, in more sophisticated agribiotechnologies to develop modified foods that carry a particular health benefit – such as reducing the incidence of
diabetes.Some of that research is being carried out in Europe, including a project called Lipgene, involving 25 laboratories across Europe co-ordinated by Trinity College, Dublin, which is working on a linseed oil to contain fats that occur in fish oil and have cardiovascular benefits. But more advanced and large-scale efforts are under way in the US. Last month Kellogg, the cereal maker, said it would put in its baked products a type of soyabean oil developed by Monsanto that eliminates the need for hydrogenation, a process that normally creates harmful fatty acids.Michael Fernandez, executive director of the Pew Initiative, says: “There is some potential that the European industry could be left behind with regard to other kinds of applications [for GMOs]. If you have a regulatory and political climate that is not conducive to R&D, they [Europeans] could end up losing out.”Europeans might not take readily to Goober Strawberry peanut spreads, with or without genetic tweaks. But for the world food business, even in Europe, gene modification is fast becoming what could be described, not just metaphorically, as a bread-and-
butter issue.BRUSSELS BEATS A RETREAT1994–98 Nine genetically modified agricultural products are authorised for commercial use in the European Union.1996 Evidence linking BSE in British cattle with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease damages public trust in health regulators.1997 Austria bans an EU-approved GM maize, a decision that goes unchallenged by the Commission. Over the next four years, similar bans follow in Luxembourg, France, Greece, Austria, Italy and Germany.1998 Approval of agricultural GM products comes to a halt in the EU.2003 The US files a WTO complaint over the EU moratorium. George W. Bush says the ban is morally wrong and unscientific.2004 EU authorises the marketing of a GM product for the first time since 19982005 Commission suspends import of corn products after Syngenta announces that unapproved GM maize had been released into commercial distribution.Vatican views are under delicate strainIf the Vatican were to endorse genetically modified organisms, it would have a profound impact on global discussion of the issue, writes Tony Barber. With a flock of 1.1bn faithful, the Roman Catholic church’s ethical messages penetrate the whole world.But GMOs are a divisive issue in the church, pitting clergymen sympathetic to their use (who have enthusiastic support from the US embassy to the Holy See) against others who express opposition.Perhaps for this reason, the Vatican under Benedict XVI, who was elected Pope last April, has yet to take a definitive stance.Some African and South American bishops have doubts about GMOs because they worry that control of world food supplies will rest with a few giant companies. GM crop use in developing countries may exacerbate the poverty and vulnerability of poor farmers, they say.But advocates of GMOs in the church contend that there is a moral obligation to eradicate hunger if the technology exists to do so. By 2025, half the world’s population will be living in regions with severe water shortages, so higher-yield crops that need less water must be developed, they argue.The most authoritative Vatican statement on GMOs appeared in a 2004 publication, the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, prepared by the Holy See’s Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. In a passage devoted to safeguarding man’s environment, the council pleased supporters of GMOs by stating: “In effect, nature is not a sacred or divine reality that man must leave alone . . . The human person does not commit an illicit act when, out of respect for the order, beauty and usefulness of individual living beings and their function in the ecosystem, he intervenes by modifying some of their characteristics or properties.”However, opponents seized on another pair of sentences in the compendium that said: “The authorities called to make decisions concerning health and environmental risks sometimes find themselves facing a situation in which available scientific data are contradictory or quantitatively scarce. It may then be appropriate to base evaluations on the precautionary principle.”In other words, the jury is still out as far as the Vatican is concerned. This conclusion seems reinforced by the fact that the compendium was reviewed before publication by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith – the Vatican organ that enforces theological discipline and that Benedict ran for 24 years before he became Pope.Cardinal Renato Martino, the 73-year-old Italian prelate who heads the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, is seen as one of the Vatican’s highest-level supporters of GMOs. He organised a scientific conference on the matter in 2003, describing the stakes involved as “high and delicate” but stressing the Vatican’s view that it was a field of inquiry “subject to evolving research”.On one point, the Vatican seems certain not to budge. Those who support contraception as a way of limiting families and thereby improving access to food find no support at all at the Holy See.China treads a careful path towards biotech greatnessPlant scientists see China as a global leader for the future, writes Clive Cookson. The country has set agricultural biotechnology as a research priority, with spending estimated at around $200m this year and rising fast.Clive James, chairman of the International Service for the Acquisition of Agribiotech Applications, says the development of genetically modified crops “is primarily as an issue of food, feed and fibre security” for the Chinese leadership. Commercial considerations come well behind security as a motive for the country’s agribiotech programme, which employs an estimated 2,000 scientists.But even in China the route to GM crops is not straightforward. The government is far from united in its commitment to GM. Some officials in the agriculture ministry are more interested in building exports of non-GM crops, particularly soya, to markets where there is strong consumer resistance to biotech foods. And the State Environmental Protection Administration co-operates with China’s surprisingly vigorous Greenpeace organisation, which is campaigning against GM crops.Chinese farmers have grown insect-resistant “Bt” cotton since 1996, when the commercial planting of GM crops also started in north America. Today, almost 70 per cent of China’s cotton comes from GM plants. Jikun Huang, director of the Centre of Chinese Agricultural Policy in Beijing, says GM cotton has benefited 6m Chinese farmers through increased yields and greatly reduced insecticide use.However, Monsanto, the company that pioneered the worldwide commercialisation of Bt cotton, has not benefited as much as it had hoped from China. The country introduced its own Bt cotton, developed at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, at the same time as the Monsanto product arrived. Originally the American company had 70 per cent of the Chinese market, says Mr Huang, but last year the Chinese products overtook it.“Monsanto [executives] are not happy,” Mr Huang observes. “They complain that the government limited them to a few provinces and they complain that they cannot control their own varieties in China.”Although cotton is still the only GM crop grown commercially in China, a dozen others are being field tested. The main focus of attention is rice, the country’s principal food crop. Four types of Chinese-developed GM rice – three to prevent insect damage and one to resist bacterial blight – have undergone extensive field trials yet none has won a commercial production licence, in spite of a series of applications going back to 1998.Environmental campaigners are fighting hard to prevent the commercial planting of biotech rice in China – and may delay approval for a few more years – but the crop’s proponents are confident that the food security arguments and GM’s agricultural benefits will win the argument eventually. It might then be adopted widely in Asia.However, GM soya, one of the key biotech crops in the Americas, is not likely to be planted commercially in China for a long while. While the country imports large amounts of GM soya, the agriculture ministry perseveres with its policy of growing only non-GM soya, for export at premium prices to Europe, South Korea and Japan.Although research is getting under way, GM soya will not be commercialised until China has its own varieties, Mr Huang says. “Biotech crops in China depend on what technology is developed in the country.”"
174;GIS;General Mills;2005-12-04T18:44:02Z;A brand new opportunity in the empty nest;;The new advertising campaign for Pills­bury, the General Mills-owned food brand, is designed to appeal to parents whose children have just left home. It sounds like an advertising gimmick yet it is anything but. New research suggests that “empty nesters” present some of the most significant opportunities and challenges for household brands.As part of its marketing campaign for Pillsbury, General Mills commissioned research among US empty nesters. Just 12 per cent of those surveyed felt advertising accurately reflected their lifestyles while 60 per cent felt “ignored”.The findings come as no surprise to Andrew Edwards, president, Europe, the Middle East and Asia for marketing services agency Arc Worldwide, part of Leo Burnett. Arc has conducted its own study of empty nesters and identifies them as a critical group for ­consumer goods brands.“Leaving home, getting married and having children are widely acknowledged as the triggers most likely to prompt consumers to reassess the brands they buy,” Mr Edwards says. “A fourth, however – the period of re­adjustment parents face once children depart the family home – is just as, if not more, important.”The reason is simple. Women control 80 per cent of household purchases in many countries. And mothers between the ages of 45 and 64 have the highest disposable income of all.“Irrespective of social, ethnic or demographic backgrounds, when their children leave home a mother re­appraises many – if not all – aspects of her life,” Mr Edwards adds. “Our research shows when kids leave home a mother is likely to change 80 per cent of the branded goods she regularly buys.”Apart from obvious shifts in spending – buying smaller packs, for example – these women are keen to experiment. But Mr Edwards claims most brand owners ignore them by marketing to male and female empty nesters simultaneously, often using the same tactics as for any over-50 consumer.The approach is shortsighted but understandable, says Nicky Owen, director of consumer service brands at London-based brand and design group Dragon and author of a new report on 21st-century families and brands.“Few [brand owners] can see beyond the stereotype of two parents, two kids, let alone understand what happens to those parents’ brand loyalties once those kids have grown up,” she says.The challenge household brands face is to understand how to capitalise on empty nesters’ spending power and desire to try something new. The best approach is to evolve both their products and marketing strategies, according to a report published in the US last month by Imago Creative, an agency specialising in marketing to women over 40.Empty nesters’ mixed emotions about their children’s departure present the potential for brands to reassure as well as capitalise on new leisure time. They could also tap mothers’ growing interest in communications technologies to stay in touch with offspring, and their desire to redefine themselves through new interests.Mr Edwards says it is important that retailers and marketers respond pro­actively when their customers experience a big lifestyle change. “There’s clear potential for brand owners to make better use of consumer data to pre-empt when a mother’s children will leave home and target communications accordingly. It is also clear there is a role for brands to offer them support and advice,” he says.As important, however, is paying closer attention to brand experience in stores. Mr Edwards says women empty nesters are more likely than any other group to decide which brands to buy once they are in a shop rather than know what they want before they leave home so “it is essential that brands interest and engage from the shopping aisle”.A growing number of brand owners are modifying products for older consumers. US sports shoe brand New Balance, for example, is rolling out a wider range of products designed for older people, and advertising designed to appeal to an over 45-year-old audience.In the UK, Kellogg’s recently targeted 40- and 50-something women to reverse declining sales for All-Bran, the breakfast cereal. A direct marketing push, supported by celebrity endorsement from tennis-professional-turned-broadcaster Sue Barker, distributed coupons to selected households to encourage sampling.Mr Edwards hopes more brands will follow Pills­bury’s example. “More accurately representing these consumers’ lifestyle in advertising is just the tip of a very big iceberg.”
175;GIS;General Mills;2005-10-31T18:37:28Z;Healthier cereals help Kellogg’s bottom line;;Profits at Kellogg, the largest US cereal maker by revenue, jumped 11 per cent in the third quarter on a surge in the sale of new cereals geared towards healthy people such as fruit-and-yoghurt Special K.Net income rose to $274.3m or 66 cents per share, from $247m, or 590 cents last year while sales rose 7 per cent to $2.62bn in the quarter. The group’s results were also helped by a reduced tax rate.But in early trade, Kellogg shares dipped 5.5 per cent to $43.90 as investors registered their disappointment that the group’s profits from operations jumped only 2 per cent in the quarter due to higher expenses and competition in markets outside the US.While Kellog’s cracker and healthy snack product group reported strong results in the quarter, the company failed to sell as many Pop-Tart toaster pastries and cookies. Also, its energy costs jumped in the second half of the year.Kellogg now expects earnings this year to fall between $2.32 and $2.34 per share, up from its previous forecast of $2.30 to $2.33 per share.Kellogg is locked in a battle for market share with General Mills. It has in recent months managed to beat its arch rival by keeping prices low.Food companies in the US, especially cereal makers, have been stepping up the introduction of whole grains into their product portfolios in the wake of new dietary guidelines introduced this year by the US government. Many Kellogg cereals, which include Raisin Bran, are made with whole grains.Last year, Kellogg boasted sales of almost $10bn. Its brands include Keebler, Eggo, Cheez-It, Nutri-Grain, Rice Krispies and All-Bran.

Coming a month after Hurricane Katrina, Rita raised further fears about the possible impact of the storm on the US refining industry, gasoline prices and the broader economy.Concerns about energy supplies showed up in a rally for crude oil, natural gas and gasoline futures.Marc Pado at Cantor Fitzgerald, referring to Galveston, Texas, where Rita was reportedly likely to make landfall, said earlier in the session: “The citizens of Galveston are under a mandatory evacuation, and so are investors.”However, Rita’s apparent slowdown cause stocks to come back in the last two hours of trade amid hopes this hurricane will only be as bad as Katrina, rather than far worse.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had put on 0.5 per cent to 10,424.30, while the S&P 500 index was 0.3 per cent better at 1,206.21. The Nasdaq Composite index advanced 0.2 per cent at 2,111.14.A sobering note came from Arthur Cashin, managing director at UBS, who warned that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both failed to stay above their 90-day moving average on Wednesday. “Since the May rally began, the 90-day moving average has served as a protective net under those indices. Now we are working without a net,” said Mr Cashin. Neither index rebounded sufficiently yesterday to erase Wednesday’s gains.Exxon Mobil closed flat at $64.98 as it said it had shut facilities in Texas. Valero Energy, a refiner in the same region, followed suit. Its shares were 0.3 per cent off at $112.80, but are up 149 per cent this year.In earnings news, General Mills added 3.4 per cent to $46.19 after the breakfast cereal company reported above-expectations quarterly earnings and reiterated its outlook.In a further reflection of the strength of the housing market, KB Home reported almost doubled quarterly earnings and saw its shares add 4.2 per cent to $73.70.In retail, Bed, Bath & Beyond shares put on 6.1 per cent to $39.70 after the purveyor of linen, kitchen and other house wares reported an 18 per cent rise in profits.Calpine shares were 0.4 per cent off at $2.66 as the utility company said it was considering its options after the Bank of New York said it planned to withhold proceeds from an asset sale until Calpine had resolved disputes with bondholders about the way it uses cash.JetBlue recovered from earlier turbulence to rise 1.2 per cent to $17.99 after one of the low-cost carrier’s planes had to perform an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport with damaged landing gear.In mergers, Ace Cash Express agreed to buy some of Popular’s cheque-cashing stores for $36m. Shares lost 1.7 per cent to $19.25.
177;GIS;General Mills;2005-09-22T17:35:33Z;General Mills heralds ‘cereal revival’;;"General Mills said on Thursday it was seeing the “most positive tailwind in cereal in years” as consumers abandoned Atkins-style diets and started to embrace whole grain-based foods.The comments by Steve Sanger, chief executive, came as the second largest US cereal maker reported a 38 per cent rise in first-quarter profits, driven by strong sales of its Yoplait yoghurt and Progresso soup business.Such sales offset a decline in cereal shipments as General Mills misjudged
consumers’ willingness to accept recent price rises, prompting shoppers to
defect to cereals made by rival Kellogg and own-brand cereals from retailers.Mr Sanger said: “Our problem was we got our [prices] a little high and we had to bring them back in line. We had a decline in cereal shipments that was offset by price realisation on cereals, so our overall cereal sales were flat.”But he said the cereal category was growing strongly. “That’s partly a reflection of the end of the Atkins [diet] mania and the introduction of whole grains. We’ve had the most positive tailwind in cereal that we’ve had in years,” he said in an interview with the FT.Food companies in the US, especially cereal makers, have been stepping up the introduction of whole grains into their product portfolios in the wake of new dietary guidelines introduced this year by the US government. All General Mills cereals, which include Cheerios and Total, are made with whole grains.The company is locked in a battle for market share with Kellogg and has seen its share price fall 10 per cent this year, compared with only 1.7 per cent at its rival.David Palmer, analyst at UBS, said he believed Kellogg had “the upper hand” in the price war. “It has curried favour from retailers through its pricing decisions and innovation.”General Mills shares rose 1.5 per cent on Thursday to $45.40 after it said quarterly net income had risen to $252m, or 64 cents a share, compared with $183m, or 45 cents, a year ago. Sales rose 3 per cent to $2.66bn.Mr Sanger said price increases were “still attainable in this business” in spite of the uncertainty over the future direction of energy and commodity costs.He said he would “definitely like to get bigger” outside North America, which accounts for 85 per cent of total sales. General Mills would achieve this by a combination of organic growth and “bolt-on” acquisitions. “Our view is that international sales will grow at least [at] double [the rate of] what the US business is doing,” Mr Sanger said, without giving a timeframe. He declined to comment on whether he would be interested in acquiring any part or all of Danone, the French food group."

The Nasdaq Composite was less than 0.1 per cent lower at 2,068.89.Oracle, the software company, saw its shares add 5.8 per cent to $13.57 after it reported a 3.2 per cent rise in net profits, thanks to the effects of its takeover of rival PeopleSoft.There was less good news for Sigmatel, a maker of components for the ubiquitous iPod music player made by Apple. Sigmatel shares edged off 0.8 per cent to $17.60 in spite of news that it had cut its second quarter earnings earnings and revenue outlook. Lower forecasts hurt Symbol Technologies shares, which gave up 7.2 per cent to $9.72 as the barcode scanner and handheld device maker announced a restructuring.Shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose 12.9 per cent to $305.95 after reports that the futures exchange had made a bid for its cross-town rival the Chicago Board of Trade.Research in Motion, meanwhile, was 0.9 per cent off at $75.91 ahead of its quarterly earnings announcement after the close.Among insurers, American International Group shares gained 6 per cent to $58.48 after the world’s largest insurer by capitalisation reported a sharp increase in quarterly profits.But AIG’s gain failed to pull the Dow industrials higher. Many of the average’s 30 components were in the red, led by ExxonMobil, which fell 1.1 per cent to $58.44, and Walt Disney, down 1.7 per cent to $25.43.General Mills, a cereal maker, reported increased net profits, but its earnings missed analysts’ expectations. Its shares gave up 6.7 per cent to $47.21. The company was cited, alongside Kraft Foods and France’s Groupe Danone, in a lawsuit alleging dairy makers engaged in false advertising by telling customers that milk helps with weight loss.Kraft shares eased 0.7 per cent to $31.71 while Danone’s US-listed shares were 0.6 per cent lower at $17.61.Great Lakes Chemical lost 0.9 per cent to $31.55, while Constellation Brands eased 1 per cent to $30.52 following news of changes to the S&P 500 index. Great Lakes faces eviction from the index that has billions in mutual fund capital benchmarked against it, while Constellation stock is expected to see buying by managers forced to add it to their portfolio as it joins the benchmark.Shares in TheStreet.com gained 7.9 per cent to $3.40 after the online business media group decided to shut down its investment research unit.Monsanto lost 7.1 per cent to $63 after the agricultural products company announced an 81 per cent decline in profits due to a charge, while its earnings forecasts fell short of analysts’ estimates.Johnson & Johnson stock eased 0.9 per cent to $65.46 on talk regulators would warn of dangerous side-effects for one of its drugs.Away from corporate news, stocks appeared to have entered the two-day ‘pre-Fed vigil’ during which activity slows down before the US central bank anounces the outcome of a monetary-policy meeting. Alan Greenspan, the chairman, and colleagues are widely expected to decide a new quarter-point increase in benchmark interest rates.In other economic news, the US government announced the final reading of first-quarter gross domestic product growth, which came at 3.8 per cent. The data included a downward revision of an inflation indicator watched by the Fed, which could fan hopes that the US central bank was approaching the end of its cycle of monetary policy tightening.The pre-Fed vigil was also evident in the lack of reaction to weekly data on petroleum inventories in the US. Rising stockpiles of crude and fuels sent futures lower on the Nymex but stocks opted to switch obsession from oil to the Fed.
179;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Bright Dairy slumps on alleged safety problems;;Bright Dairy, one of China's largest milk producers and best-known brands, has seen its sales slump after being accused of suppressing news about alleged health safety problems with its products.The backlash against Bright Dairy is part of a growing trend in China where consumers are turning against both local and multinational companies that come under attack from the media or government about health safety.KFC, Heinz, Haagen-Dazs, and this month Nestle, recently have all come under pressure over complaints about the safety of their products, and have often seen sales suffer temporarily.But while western companies have extensive experience on consumer complaints, Bright Dairy, one of Shanghai's most powerful state businesses, is unused to responding to complaints about - let alone admitting defects with - its products.Bright Dairy is the listed vehicle of the Shanghai Milk Group, owned by the city government. Danone, the French dairy company, owns 7.7 per cent of Bright Dairy, according to the Chinese company's annual report.Bright Dairy equivocated for nearly three weeks before confirming reports last week that it had stored its milk products at a subsidiary in Henan province outside in the hot summer months because its cold-storage facilities were full.Journalists in Shanghai were warned by the city's propaganda department, which controls the local media, against writing stories about the controversy, after it was aired on Henan TV, telling them such reports had been banned.Shanghai largely suppressed the story but the city could not control the media elsewhere, nor the Internet, with devastating results for the company's business.Bright Dairy's sales were down 30 per cent in Guangzhou, 90 per cent in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, and 60 per cent in Changchun, in north-east China, according to CCTV, China's national broadcaster.Of 200,000 respondents to an online survey by Sina.com, China's largest portal, 80 per cent said they would no longer buy the company's products, even though more 70 per cent said they had once trusted the firm.The safety of dairy products has been an issue of heightened concern since a scandal in Henan last year, when at least 13 babies died after being fed fake infant formula purchased by their parents.A spokesman for Bright Dairy said on Monday the company had had problems with management and was now seeking to address them.“We've failed to pay enough attention to sanitation and ensuring our workers had no health certificates,” the spokesman said.“It is also against the rules for us to pile products outside of the cool storage area, so we are having our storage rebuilt.”Dairy, mainly through the sale of ice cream and yoghurt, is one of China's fastest-growing food industries, with consumption doubling in the five years to 2004.With the government encouraging more calcium in diets, demand for milk is expected to continue to grow strongly for many years.
180;GIS;General Mills;2005-04-27T19:12:52Z;US group joins fight for Allied Domecq;;Allied Domecq on Wednesday said a consortium led by the US's Constellation Brands had approached it to discuss a potential counter-offer for the UK company, which last week agreed to be acquired by France's Pernod Ricard in a £7.5bn deal.The consortium includes Brown-Forman, the fifth-largest US spirits company, as well as private investment firms Lion Capital and Blackstone.People familiar with the situation said the consortium had been put together early on Wednesday morning and would offer all cash if it launches a formal bid.Pernod's offer consisted of 80 per cent cash and 20 per cent equity. An all-cash offer may be more attractive to UK shareholders reluctant to hold an equity stake in a French company.The consortium, which has proved to Allied that it is capable of making a valid offer, will be given the same access to Allied as Pernod had in order to undertake due diligence on the UK company.The consortium does not yet have commitments for financing a potential bid.Pernod said that it remained confident that its offer for Allied would be successful. “Our offer is a very good offer,” said a company spokesperson. “It's good for shareholders and good for the future of the brands.” Pernod will be discussing its offer with Allied investors in the US and Europe over the next two weeks.A person close to Pernod Ricard said the company was sceptical of the consortium's chances. “They are going to find it very difficult to put something credible together.”Allied would have to pay Pernod a £37m break-up fee if it accepts a competing offer within six months.The approach by the consortium underscores the attractiveness of Allied's spirits assets in a rapidly consolidating industry. Opportunities to purchase premium spirits brands are rare because most spirits companies are family controlled and difficult to acquire.Diageo, the world's biggest distiller, said on Wednesday it was also considering acquisitions that would complement its premium drinks brands as consolidation in the industry picks up.“We want to be able to seize opportunities if they present themselves,” a company spokesperson said. The company declined to comment on whether it had recently hired financial advisors to pursue a specific acquisition.Domecq is considered unlikely to mount a bid for all of Allied Domecq due to a large amount of overlap between the companies' spirits brands that would raise concerns with regulators, but analysts said it may want to pursue the company's wine assets.Diageo on Wednesday announced plans to refinance $900m in debt, and said borrowings could potentially be used to fund acquisitions. The company said it could also pay for acquisitions using free cash flow, which is projected at £636m for the 2005 financial year, as well as by selling its shares of US food company General Mills. It has 24m shares in General Mills, worth £600m.Diageo has some $4.5bn in debt outstanding.
181;GIS;General Mills;2005-03-09T17:21:01Z;Publicis chief hunts for big acquisitions;;Maurice L?vy, chairman and chief executive of French marketing services group Publicis, on Wednesday said his appetite for acquisitions was growing because the company was doing so well.Mr L?vy said Publicis would be looking to buy companies this year with revenues of ?100m-?300m ($134m-$401m). Last year, he said, Publicis targeted companies with ?50m-?100m in revenue.He said the primary targets for Publicis would be public relations firms in Europe and in Asia, and direct marketing and other customer-relationship businesses in the US.?We are targeting bigger acquisitions. We now have the resources to go to a new level of growth a new acquisition plan. We have some very clear targets.?Mr L?vy said he would be interested in adding to his company's giant media buying and planning operations, but added, ?I don't see anything coming for sale?.The decision by European regulators to approve WPP's purchase of Grey Global suggested that Publicis could make a big media acquisition as well. ?Our interest is clearly there.? Mr L?vy added that the Saatchi & Saatchi advertising unit of Publicis was conducting talks on the possible return of some of the 17 members of its New York office who resigned en masse on Valentine's Day. The exodus followed the departure of Mike Burns, who oversaw the General Mills account.Mr L?vy said the agency hoped ?to bring back some? of the 17 New York employees who left. He said Mr Burns would not be among those returning. ?We don't want him back.? His comments came as Publicis reported that its net profit rose 40 per cent last year to ?210m. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, earnings rose 55.5 per cent. Revenue rose 4 per cent, either with or without currency changes.The increase in net income reflected changes in the company's legal structure, which led to a lower effective tax rate, and a reduction in debt, which cut interest costs.Publicis said its effective tax rate was 33.8 per cent last year, down from 37.8 per cent in 2003. Net interest expense fell by ?21m as debt was reduced to ?563m from ?1.2bn.Organic revenue growth of 4 per cent was the strongest since 2000. Growth was 2 per cent in Europe, 2.7 per cent in North America, 10 per cent in Asia-Pacific, 15.9 per cent in Latin America and 21.7 per cent in the rest of the world.
182;GIS;General Mills;2005-02-23T18:38:25Z;Food groups get taste of fear;;"Pam Murtaugh holds up some packaging with a picture of a seven-year old boy on it. He is relaxing in a ""video rocking chair"", which resembles a child's car seat but is curved so it can rock back and forth on the ground. He holds a television remote control. And he is clearly overweight.The box is evidence, says Ms Murtaugh, who owns a Wisconsin-based management consultancy, that obesity is so pervasive that household goods manufacturers are aiming products at the parents of overweight children.She was speaking last week at a conference on obesity organised in New York by UBS, the Swiss financial services group, aimed at assessing the impact of America's obesity problem on its food and drinks companies.""It is just such a clear statement of what's happening to us,"" she told the conference.While the issue of obesity in the US is clear - about 30 per cent of Americans can be considered obese - the legal implications for food and soft drinks companies are also clarifying.Companies such as General Mills, Kellogg's, McDonald's, Kraft Foods and Coca-Cola are at risk from tobacco-style obesity lawsuits even as they step up efforts to remove fatty ingredients from their products, embrace wholefood diet programmes and scale back advertising junk food to children, panellists at the conference warned.Attorneys-general in the US, encouraged by success against tobacco companies, now have the food companies in their sights.""The attorneys-general will be the cutting [edge] force in the obesity argument,"" says Stephen Merrill, a former governor and attorney-general of New Hampshire, now president of Bingham Consulting, a Washington DC group.He believes attorneys-general are willing to co-operate across states in the US to bring cases against another industry with ""deep pockets"". They are also armed with ""broad consumer powers without statutory back-up"", as well as the incentive of acting for clients on a contingent-fee basis.Discussion about obesity lawsuits died down after the dismissal in 2003 of a case brought by two New York teenagers against McDonald's, seeking billions of dollars in damages for allegedly hiding the health risks of Chicken McNuggets. But last month, the spectre of ""McLawsuits"" returned after a US appeals court re-opened part of the landmark Pelman vs McDonald's case, arguing it had been dismissed without hearing enough evidence. Specifically, there had been insufficient scope for ""discovery"" - the process of soliciting from plaintiffs and defendants documents and other testimony that might shed light on the case.Uppermost in the minds of food and soft drinks company management is likely to be whether there are similarities between tobacco and food that might encourage attorneys-general.Richard Berman, executive director of the Centre for Consumer Freedom, a non-profit coalition of restaurants, food companies and consumers, believes there is no correlation. He told the conference: ""The biggest problem tobacco ran into was that people began to perceive that tobacco companies were lying to them. I don't think we're there yet with food companies"". Others pointed out there is no ""safe"" tobacco, whereas there is plenty of harmless food.Indeed, opinion polls at the time of the Pelman v McDonald's case showed that more than 80 per cent of the US public thought the case was frivolous. McDonald's maintains it remains so, and says the issue is still personal choice over what we eat.However, attorneys-general, many of them elected, are sensitive to the possibility that public opinion could turn. In that case, they might feel more able to sway juries in any obesity cases, some panellists argued. Worryingly for the food companies, it seems that some parallels between tobacco and food can be drawn. One is that it was largely thanks to discovery that the tobacco companies were forced to settle, after incriminating evidence was made public.Richard Daynard, professor of law at Boston's Northeastern University, believes last month's decision to reopen part of the Pelman v McDonald's case to allow discovery was ""a tremendous step that says discovery is necessary"". He told the conference: ""Discovery in turn may provide materials that would help change public attitudes towards these cases.""Potentially more explosive is a link between children and vending machines in schools. The Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group, says there are 3m snack foods and drink vending machines in the US - or one for every 100 people. Their widespread presence in schools has been blamed for contributing to childhood obesity.According to Mr Merrill, vending machines could provide the crucial ""hook"" attorneys-general may be looking for to launch cases: ""It is difficult to predict where the attorneys-general will go but the tobacco case became incendiary when children were tied to it.""Kenneth McClain, a lawyer with Missouri-based Humphrey, Farrington & McClain, says the fact that food and drinks companies were not acting to address the issue of easy access to vending machines by children was itself a basis of liability:""If health effects come forward, liability will attach over time.""Mr Merrill says attorneys- general were likely to focus on the cost to their states of maintaining Medicaid payments to low-income patients with obesity-related diseases: ""Attorney-general lawsuits remove the obese person from the litigation and substitute financial loss to the state's finances."" Obesity-related conditions were lifelong conditions ""with staggering costs"", he said. Medicaid pays regardless of fault. States will focus on whether the food industry's advertising and marketing adequately identified the risks of the product. Compensation would be calculated by looking at the advertising and marketing budgets of defendant companies as a way of gauging what a corporation should pay ""to redress the wrong"".Last month's decision to revisit one part of Pelman v McDonald's was followed by a flurry of announcements by food companies of healthier products, partly in response to new US government dietary guidelines. Hamburger chain Wendy's now has fruit at all its US restaurants, while Green Giant, the canned vegetable unit of General Mills, launched a web-based campaign called ""Mix-Up Dinner: Get Your Greens!"". But the move that won the most praise was Kraft Foods' voluntary pledge to stop advertising certain junk foods to the under-11s.At the meeting Laurian Unnevehr, professor in the department of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, did question the motivation of such moves. ""It is not clear whether this is a marketing strategy or a legal strategy to enable you to say 'I gave consumers the right choice'.""Mr Benson argues that changing menus and developing healthy food lines was not enough and that companies had to become more aggressive in countering attacks from obesity lobby groups: ""My concern is that, from a defence point of view, public opinion is a driver of outcomes in courtrooms. Companies have not figured out how to play offence on the public policy [area].""Whatever the tactics employed, Mr Merrill says, the issue had already assumed urgency. ""There seems to be a lack of appreciation that the train is already going down the track. The light at the end of the tunnel is the oncoming train.""OBESITY: THE PARALLELS WITH TOBACCO• It was largely thanks to “discovery” - soliciting relevant documents and other testimony from both sides - that the tobacco companies were forced to settle, after incriminating evidence was made public.
• The kids factor: potentially more explosive is a link that adds children and vending machines in schools to the mix:”the tobacco case became incendiary when children were tied to it”.
• How cases might be structured: attorneys-general would probably focus on the cost to individual US states of maintaining Medicaid payments to low-income patients with obesity-related diseases.
• More to digest: changing menus and developing healthy food lines may not be enough to head off legal action from obesity lobby groups: “public opinion is a driver of outcomes in courtrooms. Companies have not figured out how to play offence on the public policy [area].”"
183;GIS;General Mills;2005-02-17T09:06:29Z;Diageo profits fall amid tough European trading;;Diageo, the world?s biggest spirits group, on Thursday unveiled an almost 5 per cent drop in pre-tax profits partly on the back of a challenging consumer environment in Europe.The maker of Smirnoff vodka, Baileys liqueur and Guinness said pre-tax profits before exceptional items fell from ?1.3bn ($2.4bn) to ?1.24bn. Part of this drop was also due to the group?s sale of two-thirds of its 20 per cent stake in General Mills, the US cereal maker.The results were broadly in line with analyst expectations of between ?1.23bn and ?1.27bn in pre-tax profit for the first half.Paul Walsh, chief executive said: ?We have made a good start to the year and we can maintain our full-year guidance of 6 per cent organic operating profit growth.?He added that the ?group?s main engines for growth? were its global priority brands, which include Smirnoff and the Johnny Walker label.But the company warned that the adverse impact from exchange rate movements will wipe ?80m off pre-tax profits for the full year in 2005 and the same amount again in 2006.Sales volumes grew 5 per cent in North America, well ahead of regional market growth of 2 per cent. But in the European markets, which the company described as ?tough?, they grew only 1 per cent.The company?s Johnny Walker label performed strongly with net sales up 14 per cent and growth in all regions on the back of price increases in selected regions of the US coupled with growth in the drink?s Black Label line.Sales of Guinness were flat due to difficult trading conditions in Africa, particularly Nigeria. But the brand returned to growth in the UK and slowed its decline in Ireland.Baileys saw sliding sales and volume due to lower sales of Baileys Minis.Sales of J&B declined due to lower sales in Spain, the brands biggest single market which represents almost 50 per cent of volume.Turnover for the six months to 31 December 2004 dipped from ?5bn to ?4.9bn. Earnings per share were 29p compared to 29.3p last time. The interim dividend rose to 11.35p from 10.6p.Diageo?s shares, which have underperformed the FTSE 100 index by about 10 per cent over the past year, were trading down 0.4 per cent or 3p at 742p in early morning trading valuing the group at about ?22.6bn.
184;GIS;General Mills;2004-10-06T09:38:31Z;Lombard: A storm clears but clouds gather;;"Share buy-back prompts controversyCould there be an inverse relationship between share price performance and corporate governance? You might think so at British Sky Broadcasting, where the shares have substantially underperformed the media sector in the past year, just as the company has been trying to win round the City's governance watchdogs.At last year's annual meeting there was considerable investor unhappiness about the manner in which James Murdoch was appointed chief executive. So his father Rupert, the chairman, threw out some corporate governance sops. Two committees were set up to examine BSkyB's corporate governance and remuneration. The first was headed by Lord Wilson of Dinton, a former cabinet secretary; the second by Jacques Nasser, the former chief executive of Ford.By all accounts, Mr Nasser has done a good job, winning round City institutions on a recent tour during which he told them, among other things, that guaranteed bonuses were a thing of the past. The company rejigged its boardroom structure in the light of Lord Wilson's report.But all is not complete sweetness and light. Some large City investors are unhappy with plans for the company to ask approval at next month's annual meeting to buy back 5 per cent of its shares. Attached to this would be a waiver that allowed the Murdochs' News Corporation to lift its stake in the company as the share base shrank. It could go up from the current 35 per cent to as high as 37 per cent.The Takeover Code requires investors with more than 29.9 per cent of a company to launch a full takeover if they increase their stake, unless they have such a waiver. The idea is to prevent substantial shareholders slowly gaining control without paying a bid premium.Some investors fear this is just what News Corporation would like to do at BSkyB. Understandably, they would much prefer cash to be returned through a special dividend. But with News Corporation controlling more than one-third of the shares, any vote looks certain to go the board's way.DiageoDear Diageo pension fund member: First, the good news - your company has injected an additional £100m into the scheme. Now the not so good news: it takes the form of 4m shares in General Mills, the US foods group. These must be held until October next year and are therefore illiquid, potentially volatile and will significantly increase the fund's exposure to US equities.Perhaps one should not be too churlish about Diageo's announcement yesterday, alongside the sale of £2.1bn of General Mills common stock, that it was lobbing £100m of its remaining holding, which cannot be sold for another year, across the wall into its pension fund, which had a deficit in June of £817m on £3.3bn of liabilities.After all, it is a real asset, and at a time when fund sponsors are being urged to accept the debt-like nature of their pensions obligations and think creatively about reducing their deficits, Diageo is doing just that. Its move follows a variety of innovations from other companies during the past year, ranging from Imperial Chemical Industries' establishment of a subsidiary backed by £250m of receivables to act as a pension scheme insurance, to Marks and Spencer's £400m bond issue to reduce its pensions deficit.But one wonders about the thought processes of the scheme's trustees (who evidently took outside advice) in accepting the shares to meet a previous commitment by the company to inject £100m by next March. Would not cash have been altogether more preferable?One might also argue that it is undesirable for such a mature scheme (31,000 pensioners, 32,000 deferred pensioners, and only 5,665 contributing members) to be further increasing its exposure to volatile equities. But since Diageo's scheme already has an extremely high proportion of its assets in shares, and very little in bonds, that seems almost academic. Still, scheme members may take comfort in the drinks company's strong cashflow, if not in a stiff whisky.Bungee JumpingRoger Matthews, who will step down as finance director of J Sainsbury next March and become portfolio man, evidently hopes to ""address his passion for sport"".You might have thought he would have got enough of that at Sainsbury: bungee jumping profits and boardroom wrestling being but two of the company's specialities.His departure does not look particularly sinister. After five years grappling with Sainsbury's problems, it would not be surprising if he had been eyeing sports fields new. The company's problems, primarily of strategy and operations, can hardly be laid at his door.But this does put extra pressure on Justin King, the newish chief executive, who is set to unveil his grand plan to rescue Sainsbury in a fortnight. It looks like extreme mountaineering.martin.dickson@ft.com"

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,952.40.The indices were undeterred by government data saying new orders at US factories fell more than expected in August. While this bodes ill for the fortunes of the US industrial sector, some economists have expressed concern about consumer spending, rather than industrial activity.Wal-Mart highlighted those concerns when it said growth at stores open at least one year last month reached the low end of its forecast range. However, its shares rose 0.3 per cent to $53.31.Merrill Lynch pointed out ""powerful internals"" fuelling the rally in US stocks, such as sharply-rising volume and a favourable advance-decline ratio. In addition, Merrill said: ""Portfolio managers are sitting on a lot of cash and equity fund flows do seem to have picked up in September …leaving investors with some buying power"".Optimistic assessments from two officials at the Federal Reserve also boosted the buyers' cause in morning trading. Governor Ben Bernanke said the US economy could accommodate high energy prices, while Anthony Santomero, president of the Philadelphia Fed, forecast US gross domestic growth of between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent through next year.The third-quarter earnings season kicks off on Thursday when Alcoa, the Dow component and the world's largest aluminium group, announced results. General Electric, the conglomerate and another Dow component often seen as a bellwether for the US economy, reports earnings on Friday.However, sceptics were not silenced by the recent buying on Wall Street and pointed out that oil was still close to the psychologically-important $50 per barrel mark. In addition, bears said earnings growth at US companies was bound to slow from its persistently high pace in recent quarters, which even bulls have admitted is unsustainable.Among other stocks in the news, SunGard Data Systems rose 10.6 per cent to $27 after the financial technology provider said it would spin off its disaster recovery division.General Mills shares finished flat at $45.26 after the company, best known for breakfast cereals, said it would buy back 16.5m shares from Diageo. The transaction would be financed by selling bonds, that will convert into General Mills shares in 2007, to an affiliate of Lehman Brothers.Merck shares rose 2.8 per cent to $34.23 after Barron's, the weekly newspaper, said they could rebound in the wake of a 26 per cent hammering taken on Thursday last week, when the company announced a worldwide drug recall.XM Satellite Radio shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $29.88 after the company said it added less subscribers to its services than expected and announced a slowdown in production of its receivers late on Friday.Shares in Pfizer added 1.1 per cent to $31.30 after some analysts said the company’s earnings could benefit significantly if patients taking Merck’s withdrawn drug Vioxx switch to Pfizer’s rival pill.Among financials, American Express and MBNA saw shares add 1.9 per cent to $52.63 and 0.9 per cent to $25.68, respectively, after rival credit card issuers Mastercard and Visa were told by a US court that they violated anti-trust rules.The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index added 0.8 per cent, paced by Texas Instruments’ 1.7 per cent rise to $23.04 and Advance Micro Devices’ 2 per cent rise to $13.70. Vitesse Semiconductor, however, lost 5.9 per cent to $2.70 after it said it was going to post a loss instead of a profit in the quarter.Siebel Systems shares jumped 14 per cent to $9.34 after the software company raised its earnings forecasts above analysts’ previous estimates thanks to recovering licence revenue.Elsewhere in the business software sector, PeopleSoft was off 2.8 per cent at $22.20 after Microsoft’s chief executive denied the company was going to pursue a rival bid for PeopleSoft to counter Oracle’s. The latter’s shares were 0.3 per cent lower at $11.87."

On Thursday Paul Walsh, chief executive, said he did not ?see any major changes in the trading environment? the group faced.Diageo?s steady-as-she-goes guidance came as the group reported operating profits before exceptional items of ?1.87bn ($3.35bn) compared with ?1.79bn last year.Underlying pre-tax profits were in line with expectations down slightly to ?2.07bn from ?2.1bn last year.Currency fluctuations, including the weak dollar, the Venezuelan boliver and Nigerian naira, continued to erode profits. The group estimated that ?100m was shaved off underlying pre-tax profits by currency movements.Reported pre-tax profits rose to ?1.97bn from ?632m last year following ?1.5bn loss on the sale of Burger King.The long-awaited disposal of the group?s stake in General Mills, estimated to net ?2bn, is expected to stimulate some investor interest as the company is likely to return cash to shareholders.Some observers have also speculated that the group could use the money for acquisitions, but given the management?s?s conservative acquisitions policy a share buy-back is thought more likely.Diageo has been named as a possible bidder for Glenmorangie, the last independent whisky distiller quoted on the London Stock Exchange. However it already owns single-malt distilling operations and might run into competition issues.Brown-Forman, the US maker of Jack Daniels whiskey, and rival drinks combine Bacardi-Martini were touted as strong potential buyers after the controlling Macdonald family revealed it intended to sell its stake and said it was in talks with ?a number? of parties.Total drinks volumes rose by 2 per cent to 122.1m equivalent units. Organic volumes rose by 4 per cent, driven by the global priority brands, whose volumes were 5 per cent higher in the year.

187;GIS;General Mills;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
