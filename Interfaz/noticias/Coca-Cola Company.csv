0;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2019-06-24T06:00:24Z;Olympics takes gold with $3bn Mengniu Dairy-Coca-Cola deal;US drinks maker and Chinese milk group in one of sport’s biggest corporate sponsorships;The organisers of the Olympic Games have signed a record sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola and China Mengniu Dairy worth a combined $3bn, in one of the biggest ever corporate endorsements in sport.On Monday, the US drinks maker and Chinese milk and yoghurts group announced they would jointly sponsor the event between 2021 and 2032, covering six summer and winter games.The deal helps secure the financial future of the world’s biggest sporting event into the next decade, and represents a show of co-operation between big US and Chinese companies following trade tensions between the two superpowers.Coca-Cola has been associated with the Olympics for more than a century and has used the games as a platform to market its products globally.In renewing its place in the worldwide sponsorship programme of the International Olympic Committee, the governing body of the games, the drinks group has agreed to a deal alongside Mengniu, the second-largest dairy group in Asia that was tarnished by a 2008 scandal over contaminated baby formula. Together, they will share the position as the official non-alcoholic “beverage” partner for the games.“With Mengniu, we saw an opportunity to expand the dairy aspect of the beverage category,” said James Quincey, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola. “We will be activating our own individual marketing plans, but we are pleased to be a joint partner with a well-respected dairy company that is well known to us in China.”For Mengniu, the sponsorship is part of ambitious plans to expand outside its home market. The company is buying entry to a global corporate elite that includes US chipmaker Intel, Japanese car manufacturer Toyota and Chinese internet group Alibaba. Each has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to be part of the IOC’s top tier of international sponsors.Financial details for the agreement have not been revealed, but a person with knowledge of the terms said the deal was worth “multiple dollar billions”.Another person briefed on the negotiations said the sponsorship was worth up to $1.5bn, comparable with the $200m-$250m the IOC earned from recent deals with Alibaba, Bridgestone and Panasonic over a four-year Olympic cycle. But they added the overall value of the partnership was closer to $3bn, as both Coca-Cola and Mengniu have also committed to additional media spending, such as running advertising with Olympics broadcasters.Mengniu, together with rival Yili, controls almost half of China’s dairy market, according to Euromonitor. But it is facing difficult conditions in its home country.One area of concern is sales of infant formula, a significant revenue source for Mengniu. It lost market share to overseas rivals such as Nestlé following the 2008 baby milk powder scandal in which Chinese milk producers were found to have poisoned hundreds of thousands of children.Sales of baby formula are also projected to decline in China because of falling birth rates, according to Goldman Sachs. In response, Mengniu has sought overseas expansion, particularly in south-east Asia.“This historic joint [Olympics] partnership deal, together with our global expansion plans, will help Mengniu promote our long-held values around quality and safety,” said Jeffrey Lu, Mengniu chief executive.The deal also signals the eastward shift of the IOC’s sponsorship strategy. The top tier of Olympics partners was once dominated by western companies, with PC maker Lenovo the first Chinese company to be included at the 2008 Beijing games.“When the [global sponsorship] programme was initially started, the criticism was there are a lot of American companies,” said Michael Payne, a former marketing head at the IOC who brokered the Coca-Cola-Mengniu deal.“I think IOC has done a very good job at finding a proper geographic balance between leading American, European and Asian companies,” he said.According to forecasts from the IOC, its top 12 sponsors provided revenues of a little more than $1bn for the 2014 winter games in Sochi and the last summer games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Overall revenues from broadcasting rights and other commercial deals netted the organisation $5.6bn over the same period.
1;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2019-05-09T08:13:23Z;Thirst for yield allows Coke to guzzle cheap debt;Now is a very good time for companies to swap old bonds for less expensive debt;"The latest splash into European bonds by Coca-Cola’s ­bottling arm illustrates the fizzy quality of the market.In 2013, the company came to market with bonds maturing in 2020 and carrying a coupon, or regular interest payment, of 2.375 per cent.Now the group is back, this time to buy back those €800m in bonds. It is offering to pay holders 102.24 cents on the euro in the process and will chop the bonds out for newer, cheaper debt. In the process, it will push out repayment dates to eight- and 12-year maturities.The switch-up shows that, by some measures, borrowers in Europe have never had it so good. Perhaps ironically, it also demonstrates a sense of nervousness about what lies ahead. “Nearly all our clients . . . are trying to take advantage of the market window,” said Tomas Lundquist at Citigroup, one of the banks handling the pop-bottler’s deal. The cost of borrowing, which last year looked on the charts “like the Matterhorn”, had collapsed, he said. Companies are strongly incentivised to scrap pricey debt and lengthen maturity profiles with super-cheap new money.Deutsche Bank summed up the environment in April. “These really are extraordinary times for core country European corporate funding levels,” it said in its annual study of corporate defaults. “The funding conditions for corporates in real terms are at levels that likely haven’t been seen in generations.”US corporate issuers have clearly taken notice; the number borrowing in euros this year is up 300 per cent compared with the start of 2018.Pulling down the cost of borrowing is the European ­Central Bank, which has pushed back plans to tighten monetary policy and is instead helping the region’s banks with another round of cheap loans. The notion that central bank asset-buying programmes was a post-crisis blip is now fading. “I used to think QE was an anomaly,” as one debt banker put it recently. “Now I think it’ll be around for the rest of my career.”Europe’s benchmark rates are back in the freezer. Ten-year German government bonds now yield minus 0.05 per cent — meaning buyers face a guaranteed nominal loss for holding the paper to maturity. That all leaves investors scrambling for yield. Any yield.So, even at these prices, are companies paying too much to borrow? Possibly, said Mr Lundquist, but with a caveat. “We saw what happened at the end of last year,” he said, alluding to sharp moves downwards in global markets.Donald Trump’s latest salvo on Chinese trade is a reminder that markets are vulnerable. “Things could change, even if the credit markets remain robust,” he said.By that measure, it makes sense to get in now, while the going is good.katie.martin@ft.com"
2;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Femsa launches €2.5bn offering in Dutch brewer Heineken;;"Heineken’s controlling shareholder, L’Arche Green NV will boost its stake in the Dutch brewer by buying €200m of the €2.5bn in shares – some 5 per cent – being put up for sale in a surprise offering by Mexico’s Femsa after the partners fell out in July over distribution rights in Brazil.L’Arche Green NV is the company through which the Heineken Family controls Heineken Holding NV. It currently holds 51.709 per cent in Heineken Holding NV, which in turn holds an interest of 50.005 per cent in Heineken NV. Together Heineken Holding NV and Heineken NV make up Heineken Group. Femsa currently holds a 20 per cent stake, consisting of 14.94 per cent of Heineken Holding NV and 12.53 per cent of Heineken NV.“The participation of L’Arche Green NV in the share offering by Femsa underlines the long-term commitment of the Heineken family towards the Heineken company, founded by the Heineken family in 1864,” it said in a statement. “The family have been shareholders of Heineken Holding NV since its incorporation in 1952.”Femsa, the Mexican group whose Coca-Cola Femsa venture is the world’s largest Coke bottler by volume, earlier announced it had launched an IPO for up to €2.5bn – or some 5 per cent – in Heineken Group, according to a statement filed to the Mexican stock exchange.Under the terms of its 2010 corporate governance agreement, it said it will maintain its current rights including a seat on Heineken’s board and two seats on its supervisory committee.Heineken had taken note of the filing and quoted Carlos Salazar, Femsa chief executive, as saying:We have long held a very positive view of Heineken as a long-term investment. The transaction announced today does not represent or reflect a change in our view or expectations. However, the equity offering will allow us to partially monetise our position while retaining our existing governance rights in Heineken, taking advantage of the favorable tax treatment afforded by the repatriations decree issued by the Mexican government … we plan to invest the proceeds of the equity offering to support our growth initiatives in Mexico in the coming years.Heineken’s purchase this year of Kirin’s beer business in Brazil has led to a disagreement between the Dutch brewer and Femsa over the distribution of the beer brands previously owned by the Japanese group.Femsa said in July that it disagreed with Heineken’s notice to end the group’s distribution contract – saying it believed it remained in force until 2022. “We are currently studying the implementation of possible actions; and in the meantime we are looking for a constructive dialogue with Heineken,” it said in its second-quarter result report.Analysts at Liberum said: “Heineken intends to take Brazilian distribution in-house post its acquisition of Brasil Kirin and leverage the scale and stronger commercial platform of the enlarged unit. …We expect Heineken will agree to compensation.”Femsa’s stake in Heineken dates back to 2010 when the Dutch brewer acquired Femsa’s beer brands in Mexico. The lock-up clause on Femsa’s 20 per cent shareholding expired in 2015. At the time, analysts said that Femsa would be unlikely to sell unless it had an acquisition in mind. Femsa is one of Coca-Cola’s largest bottlers and could have an eye on assets from the US soft drinks group.The price per share will be set by an accelerated bookbuilding process for institutional investors outside Mexico which L’Arche Green, which was advised by Citigroup, said it would participate in.Femsa last month announced that Eduardo Padilla will succeed Carlos Salazar as CEO from January 2018. The decision to wind-down part of the stake could suggest that Femsa may have abandoned any hopes of having a strategic influence in the development of the family-controlled Dutch brewer.The Heineken family rebuffed an approach from SABMiller in 2014, before the London-listed brewer was taken over by Anheuser-Busch InBev in a £79bn deal. That takeover made Heineken the world’s second largest-brewer – albeit by some distance – after AB InBev."
3;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Mexico’s Femsa announces new CEO;;Femsa, the Mexican groups whose Coca-Cola Femsa venture is the world’s largest Coke bottler by volume, has announced a changing of the guard at its helm.From January 2018, Eduardo Padilla will succeed Carlos Salazar as CEO. Mr Salazar is retiring after nearly 45 years at the company during which time he has led Femsa’s beer operations and Coca-Cola Femsa.“Carlos has been key to the transformation of Femsa into a power in the drinks industry and retail business, with operations across Latin America and a growing presence in South East Asia,” the company said in a statement. He will stay on as a member of the board and adviser to the chairman.Mr Padilla, the current CFO, joined Femsa in 1997 and has held a variety of posts at the company. During his 16-year stint as head of the Femsa Comercio business line, the group’s Oxxo convenience store chain has become largest and fastest-growing player in the segment in Latin America with more than 15,700 stores, and Femsa has entered promising new formats including pharmacies and filling stations.“In his new role, Eduardo and his team will spread their talent and energy across all our operations while they guide Femsa towards new stages of growth,” the statement said. His replacement as CFO has yet to be announced.Besides controlling Coca-Cola Femsa, the company has a 20 per cent stake in Dutch brewer, Heineken.
4;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2016-09-26T03:31:27Z;Japan Coca-Cola talks reach critical phase;Two beverage groups with combined sales of $10bn look to strike deal by year-end;Discussions that will create the world’s second-biggest Coca-Cola bottler with combined sales of $10bn have reached a critical phase amid growing market scrutiny on whether the two Japanese beverage groups involved can strike a deal by the year-end.Analysts say disagreements over the merger ratio and the board composition could pose a potential stumbling block for Coca-Cola East Japan and Coca-Cola West in sealing a marriage that could transform the Japanese groups into Coca-Cola’s main consolidator in Asia.The talks in Japan, which were announced by the companies in April, come as the Atlanta-based group has been pushing its bottlers to consolidate amid a drive for increased efficiency, triggering a string of mergers in Europe and Africa over the past two years.Domestically, a successful merger could also be a boost for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s governance drive if the combined entity can deliver returns that are in line with other international bottlers of Coca-Cola products.“Given that the new company will be the largest beverage company in Japan and the second-largest Coke bottler in the world, it is important that it has the appropriate management and governance from the beginning,” said Ethan Devine, a partner at New York-based investment firm Indus Capital, which owned a 5.5 per cent stake in Coca-Cola West as of early June.“It is not every day that a major multinational company is born,” Mr Devine added.Both Coca-Cola West and Coca-Cola East have only two independent board members, compared with a majority for the board of Coca-Cola European Partners, which became the world’s largest Coca-Cola bottler following a three-way merger in Europe announced last year.The average five-year return on equity for the two Japanese groups stood at a dismal 3 per cent compared with 38 per cent delivered by Coca-Cola European Partners, which had annual revenue of $12bn in 2015, according to Indus Capital.Executives at both Japanese companies have said the talks are continuing, but analysts say delivering the deal will not be easy.Despite being based in the same country, the two companies have different corporate cultures. About 30 per cent of Coca-Cola East is owned by Coca-Cola in Atlanta and run by a Romanian chief executive, while Coca-Cola West is predominantly Japanese with office equipment maker Ricoh holding 15.6 per cent of the company.Coca-Cola has expressed full support for the Japanese deal but it remains unclear how much it will exercise its influence over the combined group. It invests in a number of other bottlers in Asia including Myanmar, Malaysia and Vietnam, which analysts say could be offloaded and potentially absorbed into the Japanese bottler.Still, Mizuho Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji said more consolidation needs to take place in the crowded Japanese soft drinks industry if the Coca-Cola group wants to position itself as a significant Asian competitor.Even with the merged scale, the Coca-Cola group will be competing directly with Asahi, Suntory and other Japanese rivals, which are all aggressively expanding in the Southeast Asia and Oceania regions amid a shrinking market at home.“The merger doesn’t change the situation that there are too many players in the Japanese soft drinks market. It’s questionable whether the market is sustainable with this merger alone,” Mr Saji said.Since the deal was announced in late April, shares in Coca-Cola West have fallen 4.7 per cent while Coca-Cola East shares have risen 10 per cent.
5;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2015-08-03T19:28:59Z;US cleaning company Clorox warns of Argentine devaluation;Message on economy deals blow to Fernández in the run-up to October elections;Efforts by President Cristina Fernández to dispel fears over Argentina’s ailing economy were dealt a blow when Clorox, the US cleaning products company, warned it expected the country to devalue its currency over the next 12 months.Reporting its fourth-quarter results, the company said it expected sales for fiscal 2016 to be hit by the “anticipated significant devaluation of the Argentine peso”.Clorox does not break out how much of its annual sales are generated from Argentina. But analysts reckon the country is now the company’s largest single market in Latin America following its exit from Venezuela, accounting for just under 5 per cent of total group sales last year. The US maker of the eponymous bleach product exited its Venezuelan operations last September amid mounting economic problems and restrictions there.Since capital controls were introduced in 2011, devaluation has become a politically sensitive issue in Argentina, with soya farmers often coming under attack from officials for allegedly hoarding their stocks in order to sell them later to benefit from a more devalued currency.In the run-up to presidential elections due on October 23, government officials have attempted to avoid discussing economic policy, which is seen as a weak point amid stagnant growth, double-digit inflation and weak foreign reserves.Nonetheless, the peso has fallen nearly a fifth since mid June to hit 15 per dollar in the informal market last week as companies and institutional investors — increasingly sceptical that the elections will herald more business-friendly policies — move to dollarise their portfolios.The peso’s sharp depreciation and the widening gap between the official and black market rate, have forced officials to deny that a devaluation is on the cards.Central bank president Alejandro Vanoli last week discarded such a move as a “liberal” measure, while cabinet chief Aníbal Fernández said that if currency controls were removed, central bank reserves would be drained in three days.Clorox is not the only multinational to suffer from LatAm currency headaches.Companies with exposure to Venezuela have been collectively forced to take billions of dollars of write downs in recent years as the Opec member’s currency crisis accelerates. Procter & Gamble took a $2.1bn charge on the way its accounts for its operations there last week, while Coca-Cola Femsa, the Mexican bottler, said a move to reduce the value of its revenue from Venezuela by 95 per cent has wiped out its sales and profit gains for the year to date. Meanwhile, American Airline has warned that there is a risk of further losses on the $629m in cash it has in bolívars.
6;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2015-04-03T23:06:02Z;Financial innovation, Silicon Valley style;;Alternative lenders such as Lending Club are now well known for having created new kinds of securities for investors looking for high yields. But it’s not just Silicon Valley’s larger start-ups courting hedge funds with new financial instruments.Taulia, a 200-person start-up in San Francisco, is one of the small companies in the game. The company’s software gives small merchants a way to get early payment on invoices they are owed by bigger groups for a discount on the invoices’ face value. Say Halliburton or Coca Cola, two of its clients, owes a supplier $1,000, payable in 60 days. Taulia’s system lets the supplier choose to instead get paid $980 in 10 days.Where it gets interesting from a financial markets perspective is that the large company can either make the early payment with cash off its balance sheet or can use the cash of a hedge fund or other institutional investor, who will then later collect on the invoice from the big company.“The only risk is the 52-day bankruptcy risk of Coca Cola Bottling, which is obviously infinitesimally small,” says Josh Hannah of venture capital firm Matrix Partners.One challenge for the company — as with other start-ups working on financial innovations — will be proving its model can hold up and grow during a downturn. Analysts are concerned that companies like Lending Club and Paypal, which is building out a consumer credit business, could see rising default rates. Taulia’s chief executive, Cedric Bru, says its paper’s default rate is so far zero and should stay low, as a downturn won’t put large companies out of business.It also needs to keep convincing investors to take up its new financial instruments and continue convincing big and small merchants to get onto the platform and generate enough paper to give those investors something to buy. It recently changed chief executives — Mr Bru was its head of sales — and has raised three rounds of funding in the last year from investors including BBVA, the Spanish bank with an active Silicon Valley venture arm.For now, it’s mostly hedge funds taking Taulia up on its new kind of commercial paper, says Mr Hannah. Eventually, he says, as they get the market more familiar with their model, they hope to tap cheaper cash from “the Pimcos of the world, or people sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars of money that need to be deployed across fixed income investments.”

The Nasdaq Composite index was 2.1 per cent higher at 4,644.31."

9;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2013-09-01T17:19:58Z;Coca-Cola Femsa to buy Brazil rival for $1.86bn;;Mexico’s Coca-Cola Femsa, the world’s biggest Coca-Cola bottler, has agreed to buy Brazil’s second biggest private bottler of the beverage in a $1.86bn cash deal that it says will boost volumes in Latin America’s top economy by 40 per cent.Coca-Cola Femsa, a joint-venture between the US drinks giant and Mexican bottler Femsa, sees synergies of $33m over the next 18 to 24 months from the purchase of Spaipa SA Industria Brasileira de Bebidas, and expects the deal to give it a 39 per cent share of the Coca-Cola system’s volume in the Brazilian market.The company has been aggressively targeting Latin America’s largest economy this year, and it has just completed a $448m purchase of Cia. Fluminense de Refrigerantes, a Brazilian bottling company that Coca-Cola Femsa bought to expand its strategic presence in Brazil.Coca-Cola Femsa highlighted Spaipa’s footprint in one of the highest income-bracket regions of Brazil as a “perfect geographical fit” between Coca-Cola’s presence in Mato Grosso do Sul and São Paulo.But José Antonio Fernández Carbajal, the company’s president, also acknowledged, “the challenges we face in the short term [in Brazil] because of adverse market conditions”.Coca-Cola Femsa has been boosting its presence and profitability in Brazil in the decade since its $3.6bn acquisition of Panamco. The Spaipa acquisition is the largest since that deal, though Coca-Cola Femsa has spent $4bn on acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines in the last two years.“We continue to strengthen our operating platform in Brazil,” said Carlos Salazar Lomelín, managing director, adding that the company’s solid finances and operating capacity should cut leverage in the “short term”. The company plans to finance the deal with bank debt, which it has already lined up.Spaipa, with four plants, seven distribution centres and some 6,000 staff serving 17m customers, reported net income of $905m in the year to June 30, 2013. Coca-Cola Femsa sees improved logistics and other efficiencies delivering the synergies over the coming two years from the deal, which still has to be approved by Brazilian regulators.
10;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Mexico’s Femsa: from convenience stores to pharmacies;;"Mexico’s revamped retail industry has seen its greatest transformation at the level of mom-and-pop stores: where disorganized, dingy and poorly-supplied grocery stores were once common in metropolitan areas, there are now brightly-lit, well-stocked and strategically located convenience stores.Now another retail segment faces a similar revolution: pharmacies. And the company likely to lead this turmoil is, again, Fomento Económico Mexicano, or Femsa.Femsa owns Oxxo, Mexico’s leading convenience store chain. It now wants to replicate a business model that has allowed it to open more than 10,500 convenience stores across the country in 30 years and generate nearly $7.1bn in annual revenue, by running and expanding a small-size pharmacy retail chain.Femsa – which is also the largest publicly-traded Coca-Cola bottling company in the world – recently completed the purchase of Farmacias Yza, one of the leading pharmacy chains in southeastern Mexico. This week, it announced a second acquisition, of Farmacias FM Moderna, based in the state of Sinaloa on the Gulf of Carifornia.So, less than six months after it entered the business, Femsa owns about 445 pharmacies in two parts of the country. It makes no secret of wanting more. Femsa described the Moderna deal as a step further “in its strategy to establish a relevant position in this attractive small-box retail segment.”No financial terms have been disclosed for either transaction. But it’s clear that – rather that building its business one store at a time, as it did with Oxxo – Femsa wants a quick and efficient burst of growth to establish its presence in the pharmacy sector.The company certainly has the means and resources to do it. Last Friday, just before Monday’s announcement of the Moderna deal, Femsa raised $1bn with the sale of 10- and 30-year bonds in international markets.Femsa has yet to say whether it plans to consolidate the pharmacies it’s acquiring under one brand and one format, as it did with its Oxxo chain. That would make sense – but perhaps only when the company feels it has the critical mass to launch a new chain of pharmacies as the biggest in the country, with a near nationwide presence.Related reading:

11;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2013-04-01T14:17:21Z;Healthcare that comes in a Coke crate;Developing nations need better distribution systems for medicines;"Simon Berry is pointing out the stark contrast between two photographs: a local health clinic in rural Zambia and a nearby village store. The first shows a storeroom with shelves completely empty of medicines; the second shows a shop piled high with packets, boxes and bottles ready for purchase.The photos illustrate why so many public health officials working in the world’s poorest regions suffer what could be called “Coca-Cola envy”. Faced with bottlenecks in the supply of life-saving drugs, they lament that their medical systems are so much less effective than the multinational drink company in getting products “the last mile” to remote rural areas.Mr Berry, a development consultant with long experience of working in Africa and a passion for action, decided five years ago to respond with a branded anti-diarrhoea kit, called Kit Yamoyo. Speaking in London, he says his initial idea was: “Why don’t we put simple health products in Coca-Cola crates so that wherever you get a drink you could get medicines?”In 2008, without any support from or direct contact with Coke, he set up a charity called ColaLife to put his plan into practice with Kit Yamoyo, which involved adapting the well-established salt and sugar rehydration treatment for diarrhoea with added zinc and soap, finding someone to produce it and branding it. An evaluation programme is under way.Salt-and-sugar mix treatments for diarrhoea, one of the biggest killers of children in Africa, are typically provided free of charge by medical centres and humanitarian agencies, but are frequently unavailable. ColaLife is trying a “ social marketing” model, in which patients value the attractively packaged product more because they pay for it. The supply chain is stimulated and extended because money is involved in the successive transactions.Mr Berry’s idea was to copy Coca-Cola’s model, which includes giving financial in­cen­tives along the supply chain from factory to store in order to ensure that people at all stages are rewarded for getting the drink to the customer. By turning a public health commodity – the salt and sugar mix – into a branded consumer product and using marketing to create demand, everyone would benefit, and help make the project sustainable.He drew up plans for the kit, which involved putting the oral rehydration salts in a sterile package that was designed to double as a mixing vessel for the correct volume of water and to be fitted neatly between Coca-Cola bottles in crates. The design has been shortlisted for the Design Museum in London’s annual awards.●In many poor countries, inadequate funding, weak supply chain management, complex logistics and weak infrastructure mean life-saving medicines are often out of stock in clinics.●Companies such as
Coca-Cola often appear far more effective in getting their products to remote areas through their focus on a “value chain” of pricing and marketing that provides incentives to everyone in distribution.●Proponents suggest that “social marketing” of health products can borrow from commercial experience: for instance, charging helps patients value the product, generates income and provides financial incentives to improve supplies.●Critics caution that the distribution of medicines is far more complex than that of consumer food products and needs to be carefully regulated. Also, charging patients directly for products risks excluding the poorest and most in need.The recommended retail price for a kit is five Zambian kwacha (£0.61) with retailers paying K3.70 per kit.ColaLife initially planned to use Coke’s distribution system directly, and tried to persuade the drink company to carry the product. After three years of social media campaigns to raise awareness of his project, he ent­ered exploratory discussions with Coca-Cola. In practice, it turned out that there was not enough space available in the crates for the quantity of packets requested by shops.But the talks were valuable. Mr Berry’s wife and co-founder of Cola­Life, Jane, says: “The most important thing our liaison with Coca-Cola has taught us is to understand what [the] value chain for a particular product is and then make sure you make it work from the manufacturer right to the customer.”Mr Berry realised he must modify his marketing techniques, inc­luding tapping into the increasingly ubiquitous use of mobile phones in African commerce. ColaLife has beg­unto distribute free samples to potential customers by giving them scratch cards, which they hand to local shopkeepers, who scratches it to reveal a code that allows them to be reimbursed for supplying the sample.Boniface Fundafunda, the new head of Zambia’s Medical Stores, the government-backed distributor, sees potential for ColaLife’s approach “if you can generate community demand and people see the value of the product”. He cautions that regulatory requirements such as keeping vaccines refrigerated limit the scope for using commercial supply chains for medicines. Private distributors, he says, often use franchisees and do not have direct “end-to-end responsibility” for supplies.While Mr Berry was refining his Coke-inspired social-marketing model, Coca-Cola res­pond­ed to aid agencies’ requests to share some of its distribution savviness. In 2010 it began a partnership with the international health charity Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria. Coca-Cola began a pilot with the Tanzanian government’s Central Medical Stores, which distributes its medicines.“Without healthy consumers, we can’t have a product,” says Adrian Ristow, the Coca-Cola project co-ordinator. But he stresses that the company’s expertise is not in medicines supply, and its work through local franchises complicates the process. “We wanted to deal not with the immediate symptoms [of medicine shortages] but help handle the specific problem of bottlenecks in supply.”Coca-Cola did not distribute health products directly – as some had hoped – but focused on training, mentoring and sharing its expertise with government employees, partly with secondments. It provided advice on procurement techniques, performance management and greater control over the supply chain right down to individual clinics. Whether distributing bottles of drink or packets of drugs, “the key is defining job descriptions, measuring results and holding people accountable,” Mr Ristow says.As Coca-Cola’s most recent six-month Tanzanian advisory project draws to a close, some observers say the results have been modest. They hoped for direct involvement in distribution rather than advisory and technical help. But Coca-Cola is in talks about a similar project in Ghana, and Mr Ristow says it is open to sharing its advice elsewhere.ColaLife has so far sold more than 17,000 packets of Kit Yamoyo.The projects have sparked debate over the mix of commerce and health, with some suggesting that by charging for products ColaLife excludes the poorest who are most in need.Mr Berry argues, however, that marketing and charging for Kit Yamoyo creates demand and ensures patients value the product more than handouts. Even when treatments are available for free, he points out, patients often pay for transport and miss productive work to travel to a clinic that is often many hours away: “Shops are everywhere in rural Zambia, but health centres are not.”Oral rehydration salts are useless or worse without clean drinking water to dissolve in. In areas where clean water may be unavailable, one doctor recently suggested that flat Coke could be an alternative to water: but in practice, the drink’s sugar content would unbalance the kit’s medically proven proportions of salt and sugar – as well as adding to the growing obesity burden in Africa.For those interested in public health, Coca-Cola’s supply chain management expertise rather than its product is the more desirable focus of their attention.This article has been amended to reflect a number of clarifications."
12;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2011-11-23T23:41:37Z;Comeback king who restored a company’s lustre;Isdell pulls no punches when describing colleagues;"Inside Coca-Cola: A CEO’s life story of building the world’s most popular brandBy Neville Isdell with David BeasleySt Martin’s Press, $25.99Twice in his career of more than 30 years at Coca-Cola, Neville Isdell was offered positions at PepsiCo, the arch-rival soft drinks company and perennial number two in the cola wars. For some, the rivalry was al­ways a marketing myth, but for Isdell, who eventually rose to become Coke’s chief executive, loyalty to the red team runs deep. “I have a belief system that when the Good Lord created the world, he created Coke number one and Pepsi number two,” Isdell writes in Inside Coca-Cola. The first approach was in the 1980s, when he was in charge of reviving Coke’s bus­iness in the Philippines. Then Pepsi tried to rec­ruit him to help fix its South Africa operation – but, Isdell writes, he could not be tempted to sell something he did not believe in. His book, written with David Beasley, an Atlanta-based writer, is a tale of climbing the ladder to lead one of the world’s most recognised brands, by way of fascinating stints in Africa, Asia, Europe and Atlanta, Georgia – Coke’s headquarters. Beyond the biographical details, however, it is also a case study in management, detailing Coke’s recent history as seen by one of its most successful CEOs. Isdell’s experience dispels any notion that a career at one company is limited. For anyone seeking a short history of Coke, a lesson in juggling family and a job, or a look at how to turn round a stumbling giant of a company, the book is necessary reading. Irish-born Isdell joined the company in 1966 in Zambia, after graduating from the University of Cape Town. A job in Johannesburg was soon followed by a global career. In 2001, Isdell retired as head of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, aged 58. But azaleas in Atlanta and a home in Barbados were not sufficiently diverting to keep him away. By then, Coca-Cola was struggling. Its earnings and stock price were dep­ressed and it was reeling from what Isdell describes as a culture of arrogance. By 2002, Coke employees and board members started lobbying quietly for Isdell’s return in the top role, as investors grew frustrated with Doug Daft, the incumbent. He resigned after 18 months and in 2004, Isdell was finally at the helm.Isdell’s story of his tenure at the top details how a CEO can restore order at a tumultuous time. When he took over, the company was facing an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly “channel stuffing” – shipping excessive concentrate to bottlers in Jap­an; it was accused of hiring death squads to scare union organisers in Colombia; and European regulators were threatening an antitrust probe.He also had to smooth relations with McDonald’s, the company’s biggest client for fountain cola, and, he explains, to marginalise his own company’s president, Steve Heyer, who had offended the chain by trying to play favourites with Subway. Throughout the book, Isdell pulls no punches when describing colleagues or rivals who failed to live up to his standards. Of Heyer, Isdell writes: “Clearly, I agreed he did not have the right skills to be president. I wanted to ease him out quietly”. He travelled the world to study Coke’s operations, re­moved incompetent executives and invested heavily in marketing. Coke, Isdell had determined, had been resting on its laurels.He dubs his most significant leadership accomplishment “The manifesto for growth”. He refocused the company with five principles: people, portfolio, partners, planet and profit. With the company’s top 150 executives backing its new core values, morale at Coke began to lift.In 2009, there was a more or less seamless handover of power to Muht­ar Kent, Coke’s current CEO, who has navigated the company through the worst recession since the Great Depression. For Isdell, Kent’s success illustrates the view that the company is always bigger than any individual.“I do not have a legacy unless my successor is successful,” he writes."
13;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2011-01-24T22:42:33Z;Foster’s shares rise on potential SABMiller bid;;Shares in Foster’s jumped 4 per cent on Monday on reports that SABMiller – long touted as a potential suitor – had cleared some internal hurdles to making a bid for the Australian group’s brewing operations.Foster’s has been in play since the group unveiled plans last May to de-merge its beer and wine businesses. SABMiller, along with Japanese brewers, was among those eyeing the brewery unit, which analysts value at around $11.5bn.Obstacles for the UK-listed brewer included price and the fact any bid would have to be made through Pacific Beverages, its Australia joint venture with Coca-Cola Amatil. But according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the latter obstacle has now been resolved. SABMiller declined to comment.The demerger is expected to take effect in the first half of this year. Foster’s reports its interim results on February 15, and more detail on timing is expected then.Analysts are lukewarm on the prospects of a bid by SABMiller, and investors are wary of a deal that increases exposure towards developed markets.“It’s hard to see what it would really bring to SAB – the chance to get bigger, obviously, but I don’t think synergies would be huge. Australia is not a big growth market, and we’d be concerned that it would dilute the premium rating that SAB currently has for its superior emerging market exposure,” says Jonathan Fell, analyst at Deutsche Bank.Australia is one of the most profitable beer markets in the world, due in part to the duopoly status. According to Evolution Securities, on 2007 numbers, Australia topped the league, generating more than 5 times as many dollars of profit per hectolitre as the UK and more than three times as much as the US (although subsequent consolidation in the US will have improved that ratio).“At the right price they probably are interested,” says Simon Hales, beverages analyst at Evolution. “The problem for SAB’s is that the Foster’s share price is already largely discounting a pretty full bid. With limited synergy potential, it’s difficult to see SAB offering much of a bid premium from here.“It’s just a flag in the middle of the Pacific, so there is not much benefit from adding to your global platform.”However, like other analysts, Mr Hales believes that any buyer is more likely to emerge from Japan, where the desire to expand overseas is strong and the cost of capital minimal.Last year Foster’s rejected a A$2.7bn offer from Cerberus Capita l, the US investment group, for its wine assets.
14;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Queen in search of Facebook friends;;Facebook boasts more than 500m users but now it can add the Queen to its list of subscribers.From Monday, Facebook social networkers will be able to keep up to date with the movements of the royal family and its speeches, news, photos and videos on a new official page called The British Monarchy.The move is the royal household’s latest attempt to expand its presence online and highlights the growing influence of social media sites.Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are increasingly used by corporations, governments and heads of state. The White House has its own Facebook page, as does Number 10.However, greater openness also has its drawbacks. Dutch politicians were recently urged to stop posting on Twitter during live debates because it was hampering the parliamentary process and aggravating divisions between parties.Buckingham Palace, which has teamed up with Clarence House and the Royal Collection to create the new page, said the decision to join Facebook was a logical step given the royal household already had a presence on other social networking sites.The monarchy launched a page on YouTube in 2007, which shows short videos on royal visits such as the Duchess of Cornwall’s recent visit to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. The monarchy launched a Flickr page earlier this year and last year it created a Twitter account, which now has about 68,000 followers.As part of the new royal Facebook page, users will also be able to sign up to receive regular updates through their news feed and post comments.The site is an official one and neither the Queen nor other members of the royal family are expected to post comments. Royal watchers will also be unable to send friend requests or “poke” the Queen on the new page.
15;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2010-10-19T20:56:28Z;Coca-Cola chief backs further stimulus;;"Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, expressed support for further federal action to stimulate the US economy, saying the government remained well-positioned to “generate incentives for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit”.Mr Kent made his comments on Tuesday as Coke reported $2.06bn in third-quarter net income, up 8 per cent from $1.9bn the year before. Revenue rose 5 per cent to $8.4bn as double-digit increases in the Pacific region and the Middle East and Africa made up for slower growth in North America.“In the US, the consumer is still confused; there’s still high unemployment and companies continue to deleverage,” said Mr Kent, in an interview with the Financial Times. “They’re not borrowing at all, even at zero interest rates. I believe there is still a continued role for government here.” Mr Kent said the government “is the only entity that can borrow and should borrow and support and generate incentives for innovation and entrepreneurial spirit”.The world’s largest soft-drinks maker said overall sales in its Pacific region rose 11 per cent, up from a 6 per cent increase in the comparable period last year. The strongest performer in the region was China, where volume jumped 12 per cent, followed by Japan, where volume increased 11 per cent.Sales of the company’s flagship beverage, which have been blunted by a declining market for carbonated soft drinks in the US, were up 4 per cent worldwide from last year. The company’s weakest performance was in Europe, where volume was flat compared with 2009’s results, and net revenues were down 3 per cent.Coke said its earnings were also affected by severe weather. Unusually hot and dry weather in Russia and Japan fuelled double-digit volume increases, while heavy rain in Mexico and India reduced demand and impeded distribution.In response to the Chinese decision on Tuesday to raise interest rates, Mr Kent said changes in China’s fiscal and monetary policies should not be compared to similar moves in western economies.“It’s wrong to assume that their monetary and fiscal policy will work the same way,” he said, adding that the Chinese government’s goal of sustainable growth in the 7-8 per cent range should not have negative effects on Coke’s plans."
16;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2010-10-19T19:26:17Z;Coca-Cola;Steady progress in home market puts fizz into Coke;At least Coca-Cola should get a sales boost from global warming. The extremely hot summer in Russia had Muscovites reaching for cold drinks, pushing third-quarter volumes there up 30 per cent on the year before. The performance contributed to the fizzy drink company’s 12 per cent growth in Africa and Eurasia as a whole, part of the familiar picture of rapid emerging markets growth and a more pedestrian performance in the developed world. But the most encouraging signs in Tuesday’s results came from slow but steady improvement in the saturated west.In Europe, volumes were up marginally, reflecting a north-south divide: Great Britain, Germany and northern central Europe all grew, but economic weakness in the south and along the Adriatic held the region back.More important was the 2 per cent volume growth in North America, Coke’s largest market even before the businesses of its bottlers are integrated. Changing tastes have for several years reduced demand for carbonated soft drinks, so improving the performance of the whole system – marketing, production and distribution– is central to restoring the whole company’s vigour (and boosting its share price). Also, growth should still be available in North America. As Credit Suisse points out, the birth rate is relatively high and it is the third-largest teenage market globally.So far the evidence is encouraging. Coke appears to be holding steady on the sparkling side while growing in still beverages. There will be synergies from taking the bottlers in-house, and the new approach should make Coke better and faster at targeting more niche sales opportunities.With rival PepsiCo on a similar tack, competition will remain robust, but returns are improving at both. The beverage companies may regain their historic premium to US food manufacturers. No secret, but an attractive recipe nonetheless.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
17;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2010-04-12T10:03:34Z;Femsa to offer finance via Oxxo retail chain;;Femsa, the Mexican drinks group, is to push sales of financial services through its Oxxo convenience store chain to boost profits after selling its beer business to Heineken for €3.8bn ($5.5bn) earlier this year.José Antonio Fernández, Femsa’s chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times in an interview that by broadening the range of financial services it offers – customers can already pay utility bills and buy airline tickets – it could build smaller stores but remain highly profitable. “We want people to be able to make deposits and acquire more financial products,” he said.About 40 per cent of Oxxo’s sales come from beverages – including soft drinks, mineral waters and beers – which require a lot of storage space.In December, Oxxo became the first convenience chain in Mexico to strike an alliance with Spanish bank BBVA. The deal will allow the bank’s customers to make cash deposits and pay credit card bills at its stores.Although retailers in several countries have begun competing with banks – the UK’s Tesco has claimed it will become the “people’s bank” by opening bank branches in its stores – it is unusual for a convenience store chain to offer a broad range of financial services.Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein Research, said Oxxo’s move was likely to be successful because chain’s breadth – it is Mexico’s biggest convenience store chain controlling about half the market with some 7,500 stores – makes it a “destination stop” that people can trust.Oxxo, which contributes about 14 per cent of group earnings compared with 60 per cent for Coca-Cola Femsa (a bottling company in which Coca-Cola owns a 32 per cent stake) and 24 per cent for Femsa Cerveza, has been the fastest-growing part of Femsa’s business in recent years, with a compound annual earnings growth rate of 30 per cent between 2005 and 2008, according to Bernstein Research.It is opening 900 stores a year, a pace Mr Fernández claims Femsa can keep up for the next 4-5 years as it targets 12,000 stores by 2014.Femsa Cerveza, whose brands include Dos Equis and Sol, has been the weakest part of the business, with earnings declining 3 per cent between 2005 and 2008, although growth returned in 2009.Femsa decided to sell its beer business in 2008 following a spate of brewing industry consolidation that saw InBev acquire Anheuser-Busch, SABMiller merge its US beer operations with Molson Coors, and Scottish & Newcastle sold to Carlsberg and Heineken.The creation of AB InBev, now the world’s biggest brewer, “transformed the industry completely”, Mr Fernandez said, adding that Femsa realised it could not move fast enough to remain competitive due to its lack of international scale.The family-controlled company then made “the toughest decision in 120 years” and hired the investment bank Rothschild to advise it on strategic alternatives. After serious talks with several brewers – including SABMiller – it decided to sell Femsa Cerveza to Heineken in exchange for a 20 per cent equity stake in the Dutch group.Although Heineken will be in charge of running Femsa Cerveza, Femsa will have two seats on the Dutch group’s board. “We will be very interested members,” Mr Fernandez said, adding the Dutch group has already decided to push Dos Equis in Australia and the UK, and Sol in Russia.
18;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2010-02-09T18:26:50Z;Coca-Cola fizzes;Doubling in size may be realistic;Perhaps the world doesn’t want to notice it is just drinking sugary water. Coca-Cola has been hawking its black fizzy concoction for more than 100 years, but it is still finding ways to reach more consumer throats. On Tuesday, the company reported strong fourth-quarter results, based upon another round of worldwide volume growth. And while the vision for 2020 laid out by management in the autumn was aspirational – Coke aims to double servings to over three billion per day in the next decade – on this form it does not seem impossible.Naturally, developing markets lead the way. Soft drink case volumes for the Pacific region grew 11 per cent on the year before, and 7 per cent in Latin America. Within that, India and China were the speediest countries. Combined with Mexico and Brazil, they contributed the same amount of additional volume as another Germany, Coke’s sixth largest market. And with per capita consumption in China still very low, the potential for further expansion remains undimmed.Of course, chasing volumes is not an end in itself. Profits must feature as well. Coca-Cola is a system of interlocking businesses, with the company owning stakes in its independent bottlers. What seems promising under chief executive Muhtar Kent, a former bottling man, is that long-term agreement with bottlers about their responsibilities and share of profits should provide greater incentives to help returns.Room for improvement remains. Coke could perhaps consider cutting its equity ownership levels in bottlers that have improved dramatically (Coca-Cola Femsa, for instance) to raise funds for investment. It is still not clear why beer could not be part of the system, managed as a separate category like fruit juice or sports drinks. The company, however, has its fizz back.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
19;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Femsa chief thirsty for more action;;José Antonio Fernández, the ebullient chairman and chief executive of Fomento Económico Mexicano, is planning a spending spree after selling its beer unit to Heineken in a deal announced last week.Having divested Femsa Cerveza, the beer division of Femsa, for $7.347bn to Heineken in return for a 20 per cent stake in the Dutch brewer, Mr Fernández said he could “better focus” on opportunities to expand Femsa’s Coca-Cola bottling business and its fast-growing chain of Oxxo convenience stores.He sees a bright future for his company, which has become all but debt-free after the Heineken deal, and says he is well placed to “go hunting”.Mr Fernández has spoken in the past of the possibility of a large acquisition by Femsa Coca-Cola, perhaps in the United States, though this week he indicated he was in no hurry.A good hunter, he said, always makes a careful evaluation of his prey before reaching a decision: “Only then do you shoot.”Not everyone shares his optimism. Some 13 per cent was wiped off the value of Femsa shares early last week after the sale of the beer division, whose brands include Sol and Dos Equis, though much of the lost ground has been made up since then.“We did not find either the valuation or deal structure associated with Femsa’s sale of its brewery to Heineken attractive,” wrote Lore Serra, a retail analyst, in a Morgan Stanley research note.But Tomás Lajous, an analyst at UBS, said concern over the valuation was misplaced. “We’d been expecting a transaction in the region of $7.5bn,” he said.The market’s initial negative response, Mr Lajous said, was based on speculation of a $9bn deal or the possible sale of other assets of Femsa as well as the beer division.Moreover, Femsa has been here before. Seven years ago, the group faced a barrage of criticism when it took what seemed to many a large risk by taking on large debts to acquire South America’s leading Coca-Cola bottler, Panamco, for $3.6bn.The deal made Femsa not only Latin America’s leading Coca-Cola bottler but also the largest outside the US. Coca-Cola Femsa has performed well since and the growth of the business has silenced doubters.More immediately, the division has a problem to resolve in Venezuela, which currently accounts for 15 per cent of its cash flow. The decision by Hugo Chávez, Venezuela president, to devalue the bolívar leaves Femsa trying to figure out if it qualifies for subsidised dollars that have been promised for imports by producers of essential foods and beverages.Another unit, Oxxo, is the fastest-growing retail chain in Mexico where it has more than 7,300 brightly lit stores, which stand out as beacons of modern capitalism in even the grubbiest of barrios.Following the deal with the Dutch brewer, Heineken will be added to Femsa’s Dos Equis and Sol brands in its Oxxo stores.Femsa’s importance to Mexico’s private sector is surpassed only in financial terms by the multifaceted business empire of Carlos Slim, Latin America’s wealthiest business magnate, and Cemex, the world’s third-largest cement company.Yet Femsa’s historical importance is greater still, as Mr Fernández will be well aware. He is the son-in-law of the late Eugenio Garza Lagüera, a descendant of the founder of the original Cuauhtémoc brewery, which was set up at the turn of the 20th century.Almost single-handedly, the brewery turned the northern village of Monterrey into the powerhouse of modern Mexican industry. Monterrey sprouted manufacturers of glass, steel and other operations to provide supplies for its nascent business.Some Mexican critics of the Heineken deal have portrayed it as a surrender to international interests of an important part of the driving force of the nation’s industrial development.With his newly acquired seat on the board of Heineken, Mr Fernández views it as a fresh chapter.
20;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Heineken’s last chance for Latin America;;Heineken, the Dutch brewer, is facing its last chance to establish a foothold in Latin America as it negotiates to buy the brewing operations of Mexican conglomerate Femsa.Speculation over the outcome of a sale of Femsa’s beer business, which is estimated to be worth about $7.5bn, has centred on SABMiller as the most likely buyer, although Heineken has also held discussions. The UK-listed brewer has more synergies – estimated at $150m – with Femsa than Heineken, and a stronger balance sheet.Heineken, which has a net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio of 3.5 times, has less financial flexibility and is smaller, with a market cap of €14.65bn ($22bn) compared with SABMiller’s £26.9bn ($44bn).But people close to the situation say Heineken is seriously interested in the Femsa business because it is the brewer’s last opportunity to acquire “a major platform” in Latin America. “Heinken is every bit as motivated as SABMiller,” one person involved in the discussions said.Mexico is the largest beer market in the Americas not controlled by either of the world’s two largest brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev and SAB Miller.Femsa’s interest in a deal comes as AB InBev eyes the possibility of expanding its 50 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo, the other part of Mexico’s family-controlled beer duopoly, which it acquired with its $52bn takeover of Anheuser-Busch.Gaining control of Femsa, whose Dos Equis, Sol and Tecate brands account for slightly less than half of Mexico’s beer sales, would offer Heineken a strong position in Mexico – the ninth largest beer market in the world – as well as a foothold in Brazil, helping it to offset its over-reliance on markets in Europe.More than half of the brewer’s profits come from relatively mature European markets, and its organic volume sales in the first half of the year were poor, falling more than 6 per cent. Gerard Rijk, analyst at ING, said Heineken’s position in current and future global profit pools are “small, non-existent or worrying and need to be expanded”.A Femsa takeover by SABMiller would also be a blow to Heineken’s troubled US business, which distributes Femsa’s brands under a deal that runs to 2017.“Losing Femsa would close down one of its most obvious options to diversify away from low-growth Europe and compromise its US business,” said Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein Research.While Heineken’s own-name premium brand had a volume sales drop of 12 per cent in the US in the first half, its lower-priced Mexican beers were down 1 per cent. The US business has lost two chief executives in the past two years.Femsa owns the Oxxo network of convenience stores and Coca-Cola Femsa, Latin America’s largest soft drinks distributor. One hitch to a possible purchase of Femsa by Heineken is that the Mexican brewer’s beer business – which has been underperforming – is heavily reliant on distribution through the Oxxo stores. This makes it less attractive for either Heineken, or SABMiller to acquire on its own (without the stores).“If Heineken buys Femsa Cerveza on its own, it is going to get slaughtered in Mexico,” said Carlos Laboy, analyst at Credit Suisse.Heineken, which could afford a deal partially funded with equity, is not expected to be able to afford to bid for all of Femsa’s business (including its stores and Coca-Cola Femsa). But SABMiller is expected to be able to offer the controlling families a stock and shares deal for everything. The prospect of a deal, or a break up of Femsa, that strengthens the relationship between SABMiller and Coke, when PepsiCo and AB InBev are also moving closer, could add to Heineken’s long-term strategic challenges.
21;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2009-10-02T18:05:01Z;Mexico is focus of global beer consolidation;;Mexico has become the latest focus of attention in the consolidation of the global beer business, after Femsa, the beverage and retail conglomerate, held talks over a possible sale of its beer business.The country is the last established major beer market that has yet to be divided between the global beer superpowers.Femsa’s decision to explore a sale of brands including Dos Equis, Sol and Tecate comes as both it and its rival Grupo Modelo face the end of 25-year duopoly in Mexico, as a result of InBev’s $52bn takeover of Anheuser-Busch, the largest US brewer, this summer.Anheuser-Busch holds a 50 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo’s operating business, and Modelo’s controlling family is currently in arbitration with ABI over the terms of the takeover.However, the family is widely expected to negotiate a transfer of full control to ABI, dramatically in­creasing competitive pressure on Femsa.Femsa has held talks with SABMiller, the world’s second largest brewer, and with Heineken, the fourth largest, according to sources familiar with the situation.Heineken distributes Femsa’s beer brands in the US but lacks a strong presence in Latin America or other developing markets outside Africa.According to Carlos Laboy, an analyst at Credit Suisse, Mexico represents a last opportunity for Heineken to attain a competitive global scale.“If they don’t buy, it’s pretty much over for them strategically,” he said, noting that a sale to a rival would also take away Heineken’s US lucrative Mexican beer business.But a possible bid for Femsa would add to Heineken’s current challenges, which include management troubles in the US, and slow sales of its premium brand in Europe and the US following the consumer slump. Its balance sheet is also carrying debt from its joint £7.8bn ($12.4b) acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle last year.Femsa’s Mexican beer business is regarded as comparatively underperforming, according to Credit Suisse analysts, with its market share supported by distribution through the company’s 6,800-plus Oxxo convenience stores.As a result, SABMiller may prefer to bid for Femsa’s entire business. Its Coca-Cola Femsa bottling business has a distribution network already being used to distribute beer not just in Mexico and Brazil, and could be utilised by SABMiller in Columbia, where it acquired Bavaria four years ago in a $4.8bn deal.Coca-Cola Femsa is 31 per cent owned by Coke and is one of its largest global bottlers, raising questions over whether Coke might seek full control of the bottler, or want to develop a relationship in Mexico with SABMiller.Coke has sought to focus entirely on its soft drinks business. But the Anheuser-Busch Inbev merger has highlighted the possibility that PepsiCo and ABI might want to build globally on their growing relationship in Latin America, where ABI’s Ambev unit is PepsiCo’s largest independent bottler outside the US.“The question is, does Coke want to get involved, and say I need a cut of this,” said Mr Laboy.
22;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2009-06-11T22:28:38Z;Venezuela bans Coke Zero, citing ‘harmful’ ingredients;;Venezuela’s socialist government stepped up its attack on private enterprise this week by targeting Coca-Cola, one of the most potent symbols of global capitalism, by banning the sale of Coke Zero on unspecified health concerns.The move accompanies a broader clampdown on the private sector, which has led to a wave of nationalisations in recent months, with other international companies threatened including Cargill, Pfizer and a raft of oil service companies.Health minister Jesus Mantilla said the zero-calorie drink “should be withdrawn from circulation to preserve the health of Venezuelans,” while the government investigated its ingredients which it said could be “harmful”.Coca-Cola insisted that Coke Zero was safe to drink, but agreed to remove the drink from supermarket shelves pending the results of the government’s investigation.“Coca-Cola Zero is made under the highest quality standards around the world and meets the sanitary requirements demanded by the laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” the company said in a joint statement with its local bottling company, Mexico’s Coca-Cola Femsa, which first began to distribute the product in April with an aggressive marketing campaign.It follows a string of problems beleaguering Coca-Cola Femsa recently. In March this year the government ordered the company to vacate a plot of land it used in Caracas as a parking lot for delivery trucks to make way for housing for the poor.Last year, the company was beset by labour problems over pay disputes, with strikes led by a group of former workers backed by pro-government legislators obstructing operations in its bottling and distribution plants.Analysts suspect that the singling out of Coca Cola may in part obey political imperatives, due to its status as one of the preeminent symbols of capitalism, which Mr Chavez describes as “evil”.Others highlighted that there are far more pressing threats to public health, not least Venezuela’s spiraling homicide rate, which is one of the highest in the world.
23;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2009-04-13T18:17:27Z;Trucker hopes to back pensions with property;;"YRC Worldwide, the biggest trucking company in the US, is negotiating with its unions to allow it to suspend cash payments to its defined-benefit pension plan and
to pledge real estate as collateral instead.It would be the first major US company to use its real estate to help meet its pension obligations. The talks are also a strong sign that corporate payments to defined benefit plans, usually considered sacrosanct, could be reduced or suspended as a result of the
economic downturn.The largest corporate pension plans, which provide employees with a defined benefit on retirement, have lost more than $330bn since January 2008, leaving companies under pressure to make up the shortfall, according to Milliman, a consulting firm.Companies are struggling to make payments to the plans while their profits are plummeting. YRC said it had to pay $34m to $45m a month to its plan, while its freight volumes had fallen by 29 per cent in the latest quarter compared with a year ago.It said it was finalising talks with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters “to provide certain of the company’s real estate as collateral to its …defined benefit plans in lieu of making payments for certain to-be-agreed-upon months”. The Teamsters declined to comment.More than a third of US companies have cut back or eliminated matching payments to employees’ defined-contribution pension plans since January 2008, according to Spectrem Group, a research firm.Defined contribution plans, called 401(k)s after the section of the tax act which governs them, require employees to pay into their own plans, with their company typically matching contributions up to a certain level. Saks, General Motors, Coca-Cola Bottling, FedEx, Motorola and Sprint Nextel are among the companies which have suspended such contributions in recent months.George Halper, the president of Spectrem, said: “This …raises questions about the ability of the current generation of working Americans to adequately fund their retirements.”Among employees who have 401(k) plans, 20 per cent have reduced their contributions, and more say they intend to over the next 12 months, said Spectrem.The trend has in recent weeks spread to the UK, where Aon became the first large UK company to cut payments to its workers’ defined contribution plan."
24;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2009-03-10T23:34:10Z;US companies pull out of retirement contributions;;"A wave of US companies are suspending payments to their staff 401(k) retirement plans in a bid to cut costs amid the economic downturn.Saks, General Motors, newspaper group McClatchy, clothing company J.Crew, FedEx, UPS, Coca-Cola Bottling, Reader’s Digest, Motorola, Regions Financial and Sprint Nextel are among the growing list of companies which have suspended contributions in recent months.Even the AARP, the influential advocacy group formerly known as the American Association for Retired Persons, will suspend contributions to its staff 401(k) plan from March 22 for the rest of the year.The growing number of suspensions appears to strike a blow against the viability of 401(k) plans, which were introduced 30 years ago as the main way that Americans should save for retirement, replacing defined benefit pension plans. Companies typically offered to match employee contributions up to 5 per cent of annual salary.The average 401(k) plan at the end of 2007 held about $65,000, but half of them held less than $19,000, according to a trade group, the Investment Companies Institute. They would hold much less today because of stock market falls. The suspensions mean that individuals can continue to contribute to their plans, but their companies will not.Adam Sohn, a spokesman for AARP, said his organisation, which has 40m members aged 50 and over, had fully matched staff contributions up to 3 per cent of annual salary.“We have taken a temporary suspension for the remainder of the year to help with cost containment measures,” he said. The AARP, whose revenue comes in part from investment income, also offers its 2,400 staff a defined benefit pension plan.In recent months, companies have also become increasingly less likely to enrol new workers automatically in their 401(k) plan, citing the costs as the main
reason, according to a study by Hewitt Associates, a human resources consultancy.“The continued bleak economic outlook is forcing many companies to make difficult decisions with respect to their retirement benefits,” said Pamela Hess, Hewitt’s director of retirement research, said in the study.Hewitt estimated that only 5 per cent of large companies would halt 401(k) contributions in 2009, but that could rise to more than 10 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months."
25;KO;Coca-Cola Company;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Final encore for a man of the people;;"Neville Isdell is an imposing figure; more than six feet tall and solidly built, he is often referred to in the media as a former rugby player, a reference to his sporting days at university in South Africa. But as he prepares to step down after four years as chief executive of Coca-Cola, it is a more nuanced biographical detail that he prefers to accentuate.“My major was sociology; I’m a qualified social worker,” he says. “I do think it is all about people.”When he took the helm in June 2004, many of the people at Coke were not very happy. Neither were the board nor the shareholders. Nor were the independent bottlers who mix and distribute Coke, Sprite and the group’s other leading brands.The world’s biggest soft drink company seemed to have lost its way after the dramatic global expansion in the 1990s under Roberto Goizueta. Sales of sparkling drinks in the US were in decline and its marketing was uninspired. Its strategy was unclear: Coke had lost out to PepsiCo in a battle for Gatorade and had abandoned a botched attempt to launch its Dasani water brand in Europe. There was also a simmering war going on with its independent bottlers over price increases.Mr Isdell, a former senior bottling executive who turns 65 this month, was enticed out of retirement by a board that wanted a chief executive who knew both sides of the Coke system – meaning both CocaCola and the bottlers.He says he had a clear idea about what he wanted to achieve, and how he intended to go about it. “You don’t want to come and do quick fixes. When I accepted I agreed with the board that I was going to set it up for the long term and I believe that I have,” he says.Within his first month, Mr Isdell made two substantial changes, appointing a new head of human resources who would report directly to him – giving him close control over what he calls “the people equation” – and creating a new “bottling investment group” to repair the relationship between the two halves of the business.His next move was to create a shared agreement among Coke’s own people about what needed to be done. It was important, he says, to focus on the obvious question of what exactly Coca-Cola was, and what it was not, in spite of a clamour of calls from investors and analysts for action on everything from Coke’s assertive board to its lack of non-carbonated beverages.Before his arrival, he says, Coke had various strategic statements about its purpose. “But there was [no] coherence to them and…there were clearly mixed messages out there.”So in the summer of 2004, 150 of Coke’s top managers were brought together for three days in Miami, for a series of discussions on a new “manifesto”. In the break-out sessions, Mr Isdell sat listening to people “pour out what they felt was wrong”. “That is an important part of the rebuilding process …And then you say, ‘here’s what you said is wrong with our business…so what are we going to do about it?’”Mr Isdell’s people skills are integral to his management style. He is at pains to put people at their ease, a characteristic shown by his habit of waiting outside the interview room to greet his guests.He can also still deliver an authentic Northern Irish accent, although he left his birthplace for southern Africa at the age of 10.After leaving university, Mr Isdell joined Coke’s local bottler in Zambia in 1966, and six years later became general manager of Coca-Cola Bottling of Johannesburg, the largest Coke bottler in Africa. Subsequently, he held positions in Australia, the Philippines and Germany, before moving to Europe and spearheading the expansion of Coke into new markets in India, the Middle East and eastern Europe and Russia in the 1990s.By the time he retired for the first time in 2001, he was vice-chairman of Coca-Cola HBC, the company’s leading European bottler. He was running his own Barbados-based investment company when he was called back by Coke.Mr Isdell’s long history at the company strengthened his resolve to focus on core products. At one break-out session in Miami, managers echoed Wall Street analysts who were suggesting that Coke should try to emulate Pepsi’s acquisition of the Frito-Lay snack company, which reduced its dependency on the historically declining fizzy drinks business.“My reply was simply this: ‘You’re all telling me that we are not running our own business at all well. So why would we buy another business, and think we could run that any better than the people who are there? Unless, you’re telling me that we need to get their management to come and run our business.’“That closed down that debate. That’s where you swing it, and they say, ‘Got it, we’re clear.’”The new manifesto, by his own admission, “is not earth shattering”; it says, for instance, that the company will “reinvigorate growth…by building a portfolio of branded beverages, anchored in our icon, Coca-Cola”. But, he says, “it does reflect who and what we are”.Armed with $400m in additional spending on marketing and innovation from the board, he helped select Weiden & Kennedy as Coke’s new advertising agency – working with Mary Minnick, whom he had brought to Atlanta from Asia in May 2005 to head marketing and innovation.Ms Minnick’s proven talents created one of the toughest decisions of the four years – who would become the next chief executive.Mr Isdell’s preference was for Muhtar Kent, rather than Ms Minnick. The two had worked together at the Amatil-Europe bottling subsidiary, building market share in eastern Europe in the 1990s.However, Mr Kent had left Coke in 1998 after a sale of Amatil shares led to his investigation by Australian regulators for alleged insider trading. But Mr Isdell was convinced of his former colleague’s leadership potential and persuaded the board the younger man should return to Coke.In 2006 Mr Kent was appointed chief operating officer and the following year was named international president. Though Ms Minnick subsequently left the company, Mr Isdell says he would have loved her to stay.As Mr Isdell prepares to stand down, he says that the toughest period came 18 months after he took over, when Wall Street and the media could see no measurable improvements. Then, he said, he focused on keeping people on course, by preparing them for a difficult stage that he argues is part of every turnround effort.“You know it’s working. But most people don’t believe it’s working…That’s when people tend to panic, and go back to short termism. And then you have to stick with it…talked to everyone a lot about that, just to make sure I kept those people with me.”Under Mr Isdell, the company has recorded steady international sales growth of more than 4 per cent over the past 12 quarters. And while sales in the US are being depressed by the slowdown in economic demand, he argues that the key carbonated drinks business is “on track” for better results, supported by initiatives such as new bottle design.Mr Isdell believes Mr Kent is, like himself, a man with people skills, and describes the UK-educated son of a Turkish diplomat as “ambassadorial”.“He’s one of the world’s great best networkers, and that’s what you need in the business that we’re in. He’s really excellent at that.”"
