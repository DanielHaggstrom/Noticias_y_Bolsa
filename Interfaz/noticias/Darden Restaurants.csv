0;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2019-03-21T14:15:36Z;Olive Garden owner Darden boosts outlook as sales rise;;Darden Restaurants lifted its full-year forecasts after robust sales at Olive Garden helped carry the company to a stronger than expected quarter, firing up shares on Thursday.The restaurant operator said it is targeting revenue growth of approximately 5.5 per cent and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5 per cent to 2.7 per cent in fiscal 2019, a rosier view than its prior outlook. In December, Darden provided guidance calling for a 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent improvement in revenue and a 2.5 per cent gain for same-restaurant sales.Darden also raised its earnings forecast to $5.76 to $5.80 a share, up from a range of $5.60 to $5.70. Analysts were expecting a profit of $5.70, according to a Refinitiv poll.Same-restaurant sales, a key measure of revenue at locations open at least a year, surpassed market expectations in Darden’s third quarter with a gain of 2.8 per cent year-over-year, better than Wall Street’s forecast of 2.2 per cent.Top-line sales totalled $2.25bn in the quarter ended February 24, up 5.5 per cent year-over-year and beating the consensus estimate of $2.24bn. Sales at Olive Garden, which is responsible for about half of Darden’s revenue, advanced 5.3 per cent.Chief executive Gene Lee said in a statement that Darden’s sales results outpaced the broader industry, “resulting in significant market share gains.”Olive Garden and The Capital Grille were Darden’s best performers, each posting same-restaurant sales growth of 4.3 per cent, with the breadstick-and-pasta chain fuelled by stronger pricing and menu mix. LongHorn Steakhouse, the group’s second-largest chain by revenue behind Olive Garden, grew 3.8 per cent.Net income climbed to $223.6m from $217.8m. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share of $1.80 was up nine cents. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.75.During a conference call with analysts, executives said Darden expects to open 50 new restaurants in fiscal year 2020. The Orlando, Florida-based company had 1,772 locations, including 860 Olive Gardens, at the end of its third quarter, compared with 1,733 a year earlier.Shares of Darden rallied 6.4 per cent to $115.60 on Thursday, putting the stock on pace for its best one-day rise in nine months. Darden was up 8.8 per cent on the year as of Wednesday’s close, trailing a 12.7 per cent rise for the broader S&P 500.
1;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2018-08-22T20:46:39Z;Darden warns of cyber attack in 23 states;;Darden Restaurants was notified by federal authorities of a cyber attack involving one of its restaurant chains that may have exposed the payment card information of 567,000 customers.The breach involved Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurants in 23 states, Darden said in a statement Wednesday after the close of the market. Customer information, including payment card numbers, may have been exposed, and Darden is still assessing the scope of the incident, the company said.Darden shares were unchanged in after-hours trading at 4.30pm in New York.Darden acquired the Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen brand in 2017, and the issue involved a legacy point-of-sale system used by some of those restaurants that was replaced in April, the company said. Current systems and networks were not affected, according to Darden.“The trust our guests place in us is something we take very seriously, and we regret that this incident occurred,” said the company in a statement. “We deeply value our relationships with our guests, and our priority is to assist those who may have been impacted by this incident.”Darden said it arranged for affected customers to receive free identity protection services.Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurants affected by the breach include locations in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin between November 3, 2017 and January 2, 2018, the company said.Darden, which owns Olive Garden and other restaurant chains, in June reported total sales of $2.13bn and net income of $173.5m for the three months ended May 27.
2;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2018-06-21T13:59:35Z;Olive Garden parent Darden serves up earnings beat sending shares to record high;;Darden Restaurants on Thursday said its quarterly earnings topped estimates and sales jumped, signalling that Americans continued to dine out even as the company tries to wean itself off promotions.Shares in the Florida-based company jumped more than 12 per cent to a record high of $104.65.Same-store sales in the fiscal fourth quarter rose 2.2 per cent — driven by a 2.4 per cent rise each at Olive Garden, its largest brand, and LongHorn Steakhouse. That exceeded analyst expectations of same-store sales growth of 1.15 and 1.23 per cent respectively for the brands.Total sales climbed 10.3 per cent from a year ago to $2.13bn, broadly in line with expectations.Net income rose to $174.5m or $1.39 a share in the three months ended May 27, compared with $123.8m or 98 cents a share in the year ago period. That exceeded analysts' expectations for earnings of $1.35 a share.The upbeat earnings come as Darden in the fourth quarter opted to scrap one of its most popular promotions, the so-called “Buy one Take one” offer at Olive Garden signalling the company was willing to lose some customer traffic as it tried to reduce overall promotional offers in favour of a strategy that provides more everyday value.The company had said on its last earnings call that the number of its overall promotions had been cut to six during the year, from nine previously.The Italian-restaurant chain has been working to turnround its operations and lured customers back to Olive Garden with changes to its menu and healthier food options.Darden on Thursday said it is increasing its quarterly dividend by 19 per cent to 75 cents a share. Looking ahead Darden expects full-year fiscal 2019 same-store sales growth of between 1 — 2 per cent and sales growth of between 4 — 5 per cent. It also projects earnings of between $5.40 — $5.56 a share.Darden shares were down nearly 3 per cent year-to-date as of Wednesday’s close.
3;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2018-02-09T02:25:55Z;Starboard to start proxy fight to throw out Newell Brands board;;If Martin Franklin has his way, he will not be off the Newell Brands board for long.Mr Franklin, the billionaire investor, is teaming up with the activist hedge fund Starboard Value to throw out the entire board of Newell according to two people familiar with the situation. News of the impending proxy fight was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Mr Franklin sold his consumer products roll-up, Jarden Brands to Newell Rubbermaid in 2016 for $15bn. Newell today boasts such brands as Sunbeam, Mr Coffee and CrockPot. Newell last month admitted to a poor integration of the two companies and said it would divest several brands including Waddington, Rawlings and Rubbermaid Commercial Products and shrink by about a third to a company with just $11bn in annual revenue. At the same time, Mr Franklin resigned from the Newell board along with two other members. Newell's shares have fallen more than a third since the deal closed in April 2016. A campaign to replace an entire board of directors is relatively rare as most activists initially aim to get only a handful of seats. However, Starboard famously deposed the full board of Darden Restaurants, parent of the Olive Garden, in 2014.
4;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2017-12-19T18:04:14Z;Darden Restaurant shares hit record high on outlook;Owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains cheers investors with rosier outlook;Darden Restaurants shares hit a record high on Tuesday after the company behind the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse chains lifted its outlook for 2018 and posted upbeat quarterly sales.The stock climbed as much 6 per cent to an all-time high of $95.93, taking its gains so far this year to more than 30 per cent. The rally came after the company said it now expects same-restaurant sales growth of 2 per cent, the high end of the 1 to 2 per cent projection made in September.It also lifted its forecast for adjusted earnings to between $4.45 to $4.53 a share, up from the $4.38 to $4.50 a share range it gave previously.In its fiscal second quarter ended November 26, the company said net income rose to $84.7m from $79.5m in the year ago quarter. That translated into earnings of 67 cents a share, up from 64 cents a share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted for one-time items like the integration of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, which it agreed to buy in March, earnings of 73 cents a share, topped Wall Street expectations for 70 cents.Total sales jumped nearly 15 per cent to $1.88bn, just ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.86bn.“Our strong same-restaurant sales and new restaurant growth drove continued market share gains during the quarter,” said chief executive Gene Lee. “That performance, in addition to our solid earnings growth, is a result of executing on our strategy. Our teams are building guest loyalty at all of our brands through their constant focus on our back-to-basics operating philosophy, which is grounded in food, service and atmosphere.”Activist investor Starboard led a proxy battle at the Italian-restaurant chain and the company has since turned around its operations, luring customers back to Olive Garden with a back-to-basics menu and healthier food options.Elsewhere, Jack in the Box gained 2.5 per cent to $102.88 after it struck a deal to sell its struggling fast-casual Mexican food chain Qdoba to funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management for $305m in cash.The California-based company, best known for its namesake burger chain, said it planned to use the proceeds from the sale to pay down its debt.Like many of its rivals, Jack in the Box has in recent years been hit by softening US restaurant spending. Players in that field have been struggling to fill tables as consumers tap into a wider array of casual dining options, including do-it-yourself gourmet meal kits and fast-casual eateries such as Panera and Chipotle, as well as falling food prices, which have made dining-in a more attractive alternative to eating out.As a result, the industry has been swept by a wave of consolidation in recent months. Just last month, Arby’s Restaurant Group agreed to buy Buffalo Wild Wings for $2.9bn, including debt, while Ruby Tuesday agreed to be taken private in a $146m deal in October.In the wider market, Wall Street struggled to add to its record run as investors await the start of voting on the Republicans’ tax reform bill. By midday, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were trading 0.2 per cent lower at 2,683.94 and 24,748.87 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.5 per cent to 6,957.09.
5;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2017-09-26T20:30:57Z;Darden Restaurants falls short of expectations;Wider market trades flat even as tech stocks gain some ground;Investors soured on Darden Restaurants after the owner of Olive Garden and other casual dining chains delivered fiscal first quarter same-store sales that failed to meet the market’s lofty expectations.Shares in the Florida-based company, which hit a high in June thanks to the turnround of Olive Garden, its popular Italian restaurant chain, fell 6.5 per cent — the most in more than four years — to $77.71 on Tuesday.For the three months to the end of August, Darden said same-store sales rose 1.7 per cent. While that should make it the envy of the embattled restaurant sector, where many of Darden’s peers are struggling to halt falling sales, the increase was smaller than the 2.1 per cent rise the market was expecting. It is also a slowdown from the 3.3 per cent growth recorded in the previous quarter.Within this, Olive Garden, Darden’s largest chain by stores and revenue, reported same-store sales growth of 1.9 per cent, below the 2.5 per cent growth analysts had predicted.Still, the gains, along with contributions from the newly acquired Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen chain, were enough to help lift total group sales by 12.9 per cent to $1.94bn, just a hair above consensus estimates of $1.93bn.Net income came in at $119m, or 93 cents per diluted share, a step up from the $110.2m, or 87 cents a share, recorded a year earlier.Since hitting $95.22 in June, Darden has seen its shares retreat more than 6 per cent on concerns over how Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have affected business.In response, Darden reiterated its guidance for the fiscal 2018 year, saying its prediction of 1-2 per cent same-store growth and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $4.38 to $4.50 included the “expected full financial impact” of the two hurricanes.Elsewhere, Carnival was among the day’s top gainers on the S&P 500 after the Miami-based cruise operator lifted its full-year forecasts despite the impact of hurricanes and terror attacks in some of its key markets.The stock rose 2.9 per cent to $65.32, extending the $47bn company’s gains over the past 12 months to more than 44 per cent.The world’s largest cruise ship operator, which owns the Carnival, P&O and Cunard brands, had already lifted its full-year forecasts after a strong start to the year, but recent developments across its key markets had raised concerns about the outlook.Carnival said temporary port closures after the Caribbean storms had increased costs and would reduce fourth quarter EPS by $0.10 to $0.12, but Arnold Donald, chief executive, said “our record results, coupled with strong booking trends, have more than offset the anticipated earnings impact from these weather disruptions”.The company now expects full-year revenue yield growth of 4 per cent, compared with its previous forecast of a 3.5 per cent increase. It also lifted the lower end of its full-year EPS guidance from $3.60 to $3.64 per share.The wider market was little-changed on Tuesday. Technology stocks did bounce back slightly following Monday’s sell-off as investors kept a wary eye on the latest developments between North Korea and the US.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat at 2,497. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 22,284. The Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.2 per cent to 6,380, clawing back losses from the previous session.
6;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2017-09-26T12:33:18Z;Olive Garden owner drops after same-store sales miss;;Investors soured on Darden Restaurants on Tuesday after the owner of Olive Garden and other casual dining chains delivered fiscal first quarter same-store sales that failed to meet the market’s lofty expectations.Shares in the Florida-based company, which hit a record high earlier in June thanks to the turnaround of Olive Garden, its popular Italian restaurant chain, fell nearly 5 per cent in pre-market trading.For the three months to end of August, Darden said same-store sales, which measure how well stores open at least a year are doing, rose 1.7 per cent. While that should make it the envy of the embattled restaurant sector, where many of Darden’s peers are struggling to halt falling sales, the increase was smaller than the 2.1 per cent rise the market was expecting. It is also a slowdown from the 3.3 per cent growth recorded in the previous quarter.Within this, Olive Garden, Darden’s largest chain by stores and revenue, reported same-store sales growth of 1.9 per cent, below the 2.5 per cent growth analysts had predicted.Still, the gains, along with contributions from the newly acquired Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen chain, were enough to help lift total group sales by 12.9 per cent to $1.94bn, just a hair above consensus of $1.93bn.Net income came in at $119m, or 93 cents per diluted share, a step up from the $110.2m, or 87 cents a share, recorded a year earlier.Since hitting a record high of $95.22 in June, Darden has seen its shares retreat more than 6 per cent amid concerns over how Hurricane Harvey and Irma have affected business.In response, Darden reiterated its guidance for the fiscal 2018 year, saying its prediction of 1-2 per cent same store growth and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $4.38 to $4.50 included the “expected full financial impact” of the two hurricanes.Photo: AP
7;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2017-03-28T20:53:54Z;Darden Restaurants notches 8-year high following acquisition;Software group Red Hat also prominent as US stocks advance;Darden Restaurants was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 with shares notching their best day in eight years after the company said it acquired Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen and lifted its full-year earnings outlook.Shares in the Florida-based company surged 9.3 per cent to $82.62, taking the year-to-date advance to 13.6 per cent.The rally came as Darden acquired privately owned Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen for $780m from shareholders including L Catterton and Oak Investment Partners in an all-cash deal.The transaction gives Darden “a new growth vehicle, which is needed given limited aggregate unit growth in the current portfolio”, according to Jason West, an analyst at Credit Suisse. He did, however, note that this was a “steep price to pay”.The company also lifted its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $3.95 to $4 a share, from between $3.87 to $3.97 previously.Darden’s outlook for like-for-like sales — a key industry metric — was updated to 1.5 per cent, the midpoint of its previous guidance for 1 to 2 per cent.The upbeat outlook accompanied a rise in profits to $165.6m or $1.32 a share in the fiscal third quarter — above analysts’ estimates — from $105.8m or 82 cents a share in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, sales rose 1.7 per cent to $1.88bn — a touch above estimates — while comparable store sales climbed 0.9 per cent, above estimates of 0.3 per cent.Snapping at Darden’s heels, open source software company Red Hat saw its biggest gain in two years, following positive quarterly results released on Monday evening.Shares in the company rose 5.2 per cent to $86.48, securing a record high and the biggest rise since August 2015.It takes the company’s year to date advance to 24 per cent, having recovered from a dramatic 13.9 per cent fall at the end of the year off the back of disappointing third-quarter results.The company has built its business by taking the open-source operating system Linux and offering companies greater protection and stability so that it can be used on a larger scale.The concern in the third quarter was that this business might be slowing down without other products picking up slack.But revenue in the fourth quarter for the company was $629m, beating analyst estimates, while the company’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 was up from $0.52 last year.Analysts took particular note of the strong deal volume for the quarter. The company saw four new contracts over $20m, including their first $100m deal for their flagship Linux support services.The three other deals were tied to OpenStack, a newer product that offers companies a private cloud system.“The results that came out [Monday] night have instilled confidence that this is not a one-trick pony,” said Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair.The gains in both companies came as the S&P 500 climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,358.57 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose by the same margin to 20,701.50. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 5,875.14.

Darden expects between $20m and $25m in pre-tax savings by fiscal 2019. It also expects the deal to add about 12 cents to diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2018.The transaction gives Darden “a new growth vehicle, which is needed given limited aggregate unit growth in the current portfolio,” according to Jason West, an analyst at Credit Suisse. He did however note that this was a “steep price to pay”.The company also lifted its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $3.95 to $4 a share, from between $3.87 to $3.97 previously. Darden’s outlook for like-for-like sales, a key industry metric was updated to 1.5 per cent, the mid-point of its previous guidance for 1 to 2 per cent.The upbeat outlook accompanied a rise in profits to $165.6m or $1.32 a share in the fiscal third quarter — above analysts’ estimates — from $105.8m or 82 cents a share in the year ago period.Meanwhile sales rose 1.7 per cent to $1.88bn a touch above estimates, while comparable store sales climbed 0.9 per cent, above estimates of 0.3 per cent.
10;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2017-03-27T20:42:00Z;Darden rises after lifting full-year profit view;;Investors devoured shares in Darden Restaurants on Monday after the owner of Olive Garden and other casual dining chains delivered stronger than expected fiscal third quarter results and lifted its full year earnings outlook.The stock jumped more than 4 per cent in after market trading as the company separately also announced that it would acquire Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen for $780m cash.Like-for-like sales, a closely followed industry metric, rose 0.9 per cent for the three months to end of February and helped lift overall revenues 1.7 per cent higher to $1.87bn for the period.Net income came in at $165.6m, or $1.33 a share, a step up from the $105.8m recorded a year earlier thanks to a sharp reduction in interest payment after it used funds raised from an earlier property spin off to pay down debt.As a result, the company said it now expects diluted net earnings per share to be between $3.95 and $4.00 a share, up from its previous guidance of $3.87 to $3.97 a share. Like-for-like restaurant sales are expected to increase 1.5 per cent this year, compared with the 1-2 per cent growth range it had forecast just three months ago.“We continued to gain market share as we outperformed industry same-restaurant sales by a considerable margin again this quarter,” said CEO Gene Lee.
11;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2016-10-04T12:32:19Z;Darden shares on the menu after earnings upgrade;;Investors are helping themselves to extra servings of Darden Restaurants shares on Tuesday after the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse reported results that topped estimates.The company also raised its earnings outlook for the year and announced a new $500m share buyback plan as it continues to make sales gains at Olive Garden, its popular Italian restaurant chain.The stock jumped by as much as 5 per cent in pre-market trading.For the three months to end of August, sales came in at $1.7bn, a 1.6 per cent rise from the prior year period. Same-store sales, a key industry metric, rose 1.3 per cent during the quarter. Within this, Olive Garden, which accounts for more than half of total group revenue, reported a 2 per cent rise in comparable sales.Net earnings for the period jumped by more than a quarter to $110.2m as the company also reaped the benefits of tighter cost control.As a result, Darden said it now expects diluted net earnings per share for the year to be between $3.87 to $3.97, compared to its previous guidance of $3.80 to $3.90.The earnings upgrade is the latest sign of the business turnaround engineered by activist investor Starboard Value, which took control of the company in 2014. Under Starboard, Darden has made efforts to reduce spending and revamp its menu at Olive Garden in an effort to attract more customers.
12;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2016-07-13T20:34:08Z;Juno Therapeutics surges as drug trial suspension lifted;US equities maintain ground after move into record territory as energy sector slips;Juno Therapeutics shares shot higher on Wednesday after a suspension of its experimental cancer treatment trial was lifted by the US Food and Drug Administration.Last week, the FDA ordered the Seattle-based company to halt the Phase II clinical trial of its drug, JCAR015, after two patient deaths. But Juno said late on Tuesday that the FDA removed the clinical hold on the trial in adult patients with a type of blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and revised the protocol for the treatment.The news spurred shares in Juno higher by 20 per cent to $33.19 at one point, but they later gave up some ground, closing the day 9.5 per cent higher at $30.42. The gains trimmed the share’s year-to-date losses to 30.8 per cent.Juno is among a group of companies developing a new type of cancer therapy, which involves extracting a patient’s white blood cells, modifying them in a laboratory so they can recognise and attack cancer, and then reinjecting them into the patient.“The rapid response from the FDA and the allowance of some flexibility [mid-trial] in the preconditioning regimen could be interpreted as an early signal that if the impressive rates of patient response and improvements in overall survival continue, as they have so far, the first CAR-T therapies . . . could gain approval as early as 2017,” said Jason McCarthy, analyst at Maxim Group.The advance in Juno shares arrived as US stocks struggled to hold on to their gains after the S&P 500 closed in record territory for the first two days of the trading week.At the close, the S&P 500 was little-changed at 2,152.4, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 18,372.1, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3 per cent to 5,005.7.Energy experienced the biggest decline among the S&P’s 10 major sectors, down 0.7 per cent, as an unexpected build in inventories of US gasoline pushed crude prices lower.Chesapeake Energy shares fell 5 per cent to $4.35 — the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 energy sector index. Meanwhile, Hess shares fell 3.5 per cent to $58.02, ConocoPhillips shares dropped 2.1 per cent to $42.87 and Halliburton shares declined 1.8 per cent to $45.21.Elsewhere, shares in Darden Restaurants slipped 0.2 per cent to $62.68 after analysts at Wells Fargo downgraded the company behind Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse to “market perform” from “outperform”.The downgrade was driven by a deterioration in same-store sales and the company’s plans to reinvest its cost savings, marking “a departure from FY16 when cost savings were dropped to the bottom line driving a five-quarter run of approximately 20 per cent EPS upside”, Jeff Farmer, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said.Elsewhere, shares in Host Hotels & Resorts fell 4 per cent to $16.48, after analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “neutral” and lowered their price target by $1 to $15.The cut was motivated in part by the company’s “high exposure to urban and gateway markets [specifically New York City], and therefore adverse supply growth, Airbnb and US dollar impact,” said Joseph Greff, an analyst at JPMorgan.

The share was one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 index.The fall comes off the back of fourth-quarter earnings reported this morning. The company reported earnings of $1.10 per share, beating expectations of $1.09. But disappointing revenues have set the tone for full-year 2017 earnings that are yet to come. Revenues missed analysts’ forecasts of $1.82bn, coming in at $1.79bn.The restaurateur revised 2017 earnings down to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share, when analysts were looking for $3.99 per share.“These results reinforce our firm belief that our strategy is working as we continue to build guest loyalty by relentlessly focusing on our back-to-basics operating philosophy,” said Gene Lee, the company’s chief executive. “This focus, together with our competitive advantages, drove our strong performance for the year and increased shareholder value.”On the other end of the spectrum, Hershey’s, the American chocolatier, is the subject of a takeover bid from Mondelez International. The news resulted in trading in Hershey shares being temporarily halted after a sudden rise of over 7 per cent just after 10:30am in New York. Hershey’s was the best performing stock in the S&P 500 index, up 16.8 per cent to $113.49, helping push the consumer staples sector up 2.2 per cent.Molson Coors also saw its share price rise after the brewer, known for beers such as Amstel and Carling, issued bonds on both sides of the Atlantic in recent days.The company was the first to issue in the US after the Brexit vote last week. It secured a low coupon on its debt as yields across investment-grade bond indices and benchmark US Treasuries have been falling.The brewer’s shares rose 2.7 per cent to $101.13, responding to the bond deals, which will probably be used to fund its full takeover of MillerCoors.After strong gains on Tuesday and Wednesday, the rally in the energy and materials sectors in the S&P 500 index slowed marginally, gaining 0.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively, as Brent crude dipped 1.8 per cent to $49.68.Murphy Oil saw earlier gains in the week pared back, falling 0.8 per cent to $31.75. Noble Energy dropped 1.2 per cent to $35.87, while Marathon Petroleum gained 1.9 per cent to $37.96.Chesapeake, the second-largest producer of natural gas in the US, led the sector’s pullback, down 3.2 per cent to $4.28, after the company announced that its retirement plan was in partial termination following a more than 20 per cent reduction in the company’s workforce over the past two years.On the day, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 2,098.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 17,930, and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.3 per cent to 4,842.7.

The charges against him were unsealed today. “Mr Davis is pleased to be assisting in the government’s investigation,” said Chris Clark, his attorney.Barry Berke, attorney for Mr Walters, said:Bill Walters is a true American success story, whose extraordinary accomplishments as a lawful sports gambler have been widely recognized and lauded. Mr. Walters’ renowned work ethic and many other talents also have helped him achieve great success in business, investing and philanthropy.Mr. Walters and his counsel look forward to his day in court where it will be shown that the prosecutors’ accusations are based on erroneous assumptions, speculative theories and false finger-pointing.

None of the employees worked while they were sick, the company said.“Any employees who reported feeling ill will be held out of the restaurant until they fully recover,” a company spokesman said in a statement.Chipotle has worked to win back customers since it came under scrutiny late last year after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was investigating an E. coli outbreak linked to its restaurants. The company’s shares were rattled further after a norovirus outbreak made students in Boston ill.The food-safety scares triggered its first year-on-year decline in quarterly sales since at least 2006, and sparked a federal probe.Chipotle shares have declined 26 per cent since the beginning of last year.Elsewhere, shares in Darden Restaurants advanced 3.6 per cent to $66.93, after the company behind Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse provided an upbeat profit outlook for its fiscal third quarter and named a new chief financial officer.The Florida-based company said it expected adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $1.18 to $1.21, above analysts’ estimates for $1.06 a share.Meanwhile, same-store sales are estimated to increase 6 per cent for the quarter, which is partly affected by the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. On a comparable calendar basis they are expected to rise 4 per cent.The company also said Ricardo Cardenas had been appointed chief financial officer effective immediately, replacing Jeffrey Davis. Mr Cardenas recently served as chief strategy officer for Darden.Activist investor Starboard Value took control of the company last year with 12 seats on the board. Under Starboard, Darden has made efforts to lower expenses and revamp its menu at Olive Garden in an effort to attract more customers.Groupon shares fell more than 10 per cent to $4.11, after analysts at UBS downgraded the US coupon company to “sell” from “neutral” and maintained their $3.20 price target.While Groupon has showed signs of progress “there is still a long road ahead in strengthening the company’s positioning in the local ad and/or local ecommerce market,” said Eric Sheridan, an analyst at UBS.Moreover, he noted that companies such as Google and Facebook are stepping up efforts to “capture local ad dollars” and that “in light of Amazon’s increasing efforts in the same-day delivery space, we believe the benefit of a ‘local’ marketplace is diminished over the longer term”.Mr Sheridan also downgraded shares of review website Yelp to “sell” from “neutral” sending shares of the review website 3 per cent lower to $20.47.At the close, the S&P 500 was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,989, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 0.2 per cent to 17,000 and the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.6 per cent to 4,674.A rally in oil prices propelled energy shares 1.5 per cent higher, with the sector leading the benchmark S&P 500.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

That bolstered the performance of the utilities sector as investors expect low bond yields to prevail.The S&P 500 utilities sector tacked on 2.4 per cent this week, the biggest gain of any of the 10 top groups, despite a retreat on Friday. The rally has helped utilities reduce their 2015 loss to about 9.5 per cent.Investors often add utilities to their portfolio in times of financial volatility because of their consistent dividends — similar to how bonds provide a stream of coupon payments. The spectre of a Fed rate rise this year weighed on the sector since the move was expected to begin putting upward pressure on bond yields, offering more options to traders seeking yield.Despite the Fed increasing interest rates for the first time in almost a decade on Wednesday, policymakers’ forecasts for future rate increases tilted toward the dovish end of the spectrum. Specifically, the median end-of-year federal funds rate expectation for 2017 and 2018 was modestly lowered from the last set of projections.Fed chair Janet Yellen also reiterated the central bank’s plans to increase interest rates gradually, and vowed to continue closely monitor incoming economic data.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, for instance, is nearly flat since Monday, at 2.21 per cent.New York-based Consolidated Edison was one of the top-performing utilities, climbing 4.4 per cent on the week to $63.50. Southern Company, another large utility, rose 3.6 per cent to $46.Elsewhere, Darden Restaurants rallied on Friday after it raised its 2016 profit and sales outlook. The owner of Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse said it now expected same-store sales growth of 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent, up from an earlier estimate of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent. The management said it expected adjusted earnings per share to come in at $3.25 to $3.35, compared with Wall Street estimates of $3.15.The shares jumped 4.7 per cent to $61.12, extending their year-to-date climb to 16.5 per cent.Cruise operator Carnival rose after saying advance bookings for the first three quarters of 2016 were “well ahead” of the year prior, and at “slightly higher” prices, on a constant currency basis. The shares rose 3.1 per cent to $52.05.Fossil Group slid after Goldman Sachs downgraded the watchmaker from “neutral” to “sell”. The investment bank warned the stock could drop 31 per cent over the next 12 months.Goldman said that Fossil might be pressured by the “natural end” of a multiyear fashion watch trend, a “headwind” from smartwatches and wearable technologies which “are drawing consumers away from traditional watches,” and a slowdown in its Michael Kors brand, which Goldman called its “most important licensed watch brand”.Fossil’s shares fell by 3.9 per cent on Friday to $36.30, widening their 2015 rout to 67.2 per cent.In midday trading, the S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 2,024.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3 per cent to 17,262.9 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.6 per cent to 4,973.3.
17;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2015-11-13T18:15:24Z;McDonald’s: extra value meal;Special sauce includes just a pinch of operating momentum;Put down those artisanal burritos and kale smoothies. Nothing hits the spot like an Egg McMuffin for dinner, it seems. Shares in McDonald’s, once abandoned like a Big Mac sweating under a heat lamp, have rallied 14 per cent in the past six months (hipster burger upstart Shake Shack is down 33 per cent). That is partly due to operational improvements, but financial leverage has helped add sizzle.After two years of embarrassing declines, McDonald’s recorded a 0.9 per cent jump in like-for-like store sales at US locations in the recently reported third quarter. True, that was against weak comparatives. But part of the recovery was down to the decision, fully implemented at the beginning of the fourth quarter, to make its breakfast menu available throughout the day. And McDonald’s says customers have responded to other initiatives, such as toasting buns for longer.In the midst of its recent malaise, some called for the chain to take its 8,000 owned stores and create a new real estate company that could charge $2bn in rent to the store operators. Many retail chains such as Darden Restaurants have used this property arbitrage to great effect.McDonald's this week declined to go down that path. But it will boost leverage in other ways, raising its dividend by 5 per cent and pledging to borrow $10bn to increase share buybacks. It has committed to paying out $30bn in total between 2014 and 2016. The thinking is that between its strong cash flow — capital expenditure has come down from $3bn to $2bn as new store growth is cut and 95 per cent of locations become franchised — and a healthy credit rating, it can be more aggressive in juicing returns.Many old-school stalwarts such IBM have tried to emphasise their cash-cow credentials, only to find shareholders dubious.

General Motors slipped 2 per cent to $30.02, while shares in Ford fell 2.8 per cent to $13.91. The S&P 500 automobiles and components index fell nearly 3 per cent.Darden Restaurants, the restaurant chain behind the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse brands, reported fiscal first-quarter same-store sales above forecasts and lifted its full-year earnings outlook.The company expects earnings for the year to be between $3.15 and $3.30 per share, compared with its previous forecast for $3.05 to $3.20.First-quarter same-store sales, an important industry metric, rose 3.4 per cent, topping forecasts for a 2.6 per cent gain.Profits came in at $86.4m, or 67 cents a share — down from $503.2m, or $3.81, in the same period a year ago but ahead of forecasts for 58 cents a share.Darden shares, which had jumped immediately after results, fell nearly 1 per cent to $69.70.“My sense is that investors were a little disappointed with them not having taken the full-year EPS guidance up by more than the first-quarter beat, and guiding to stable comparable sales and significantly moderating margin performance in the second half,” said Sara Senatore, an analyst at Bernstein. “We’re seeing a lot of earnings strength get sold today.”Weatherford International shares jumped 10.7 per cent to $9.31 after the oil services company abandoned plans for a stock and debt offering.“While investor interest was strong for this offering, we are unwilling to sell securities at prices that do not reflect the value we have created at Weatherford,” the company said in a statement.Carnival shares fell 5.5 per cent to $49.79 after it issued a fourth-quarter profit outlook that missed analysts’ expectations.The cruise operator said it expected fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 36 cent to 40 cents a share, below forecasts for 46 cents a share.Carnival reported a 2 per cent drop in third-quarter profits to $1.2bn, or $1.56 a share, below forecasts. Adjusting for one-time items, however, earnings of $1.75 a share topped expectations. Sales slid 1 per cent to $4.9bn.The company lifted its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $2.56 to $2.60 a share, ahead of forecasts.US stocks followed European markets lower amid concerns about global growth.The S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent to 1,942.74, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.1 per cent to 16,330.47 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.5 per cent to 4,756.72.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
19;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2015-07-09T16:10:45Z;Retail property: lease worst scenario;Selling sites is all the fashion but the policy could prove to be fool’s gold;US retailers and restaurant chains are already struggling with intense price competition and weak growth in their customers’ incomes. So why not add a little leverage to the mix? It might seem perverse, but that is the hot trend. Merchants are not issuing debt to boost leverage, but selling properties and becoming lessees.Darden Restaurants, parent group of Olive Garden, announced plans recently to list 430 of its locations in a new real estate investment trust. Sears has also done the same. Hudson’s Bay, the Canadian company that owns Saks and has just bought the Kaufhof chain from Metro AG, has tried a number of different strategies for its property. The cash raised is often used to fund buybacks. That may be nice for shareholders in the short term, but over the long term the strategy simply adds risk to already wobbly companies.Such property deals always create new obligations. A sale and leaseback generates up-front cash, but also 10 or 20 years of increasing rent payments. Similarly, the Reit spin-off creates a new company that will collect rent and pay out healthy dividends. For shareholders, the benefit is that they get shares in a Reit that could trade at a premium to the retail business.But that does not always happen. A Reit tied to a single brand has concentrated risk. And Reits as an asset class are not always in favour. One prominent retail Reit, National Retail Properties, is down nearly a fifth this year as potential interest rate rises have weighed on yield-based instruments.Still, retailers’ enthusiasm for property spin-offs is undimmed. Macy’s could be the next in line. The department store’s most recent same-store sales growth was a dreadful -0.7 per cent. Recent reports say activist investors are agitating for some sort of action on the property portfolio. Macy’s not only owns two-thirds of its properties but also its flagship locations in New York and Chicago. Management has so far been measured in its response, due to concerns about the impact on the credit rating and control over the stores themselves. But they may yet succumb to the pressure.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The group’s stock has advanced for more than 18 per cent this year as it has undergone structural changes.The company has struggled in recent years as consumers have increasingly favoured fast-casual chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack rather than its more expensive full-service dining offerings. The group sold off its Red Lobster chain last year amid sluggish sales and saw its entire board replaced following a proxy fight with activist investor Starboard Value.One of Starboard’s demands had been for Darden to make better use of its property holdings. Under the plan being pursued, Darden will transfer 430 of its restaurant properties into a Reit and lease back the majority of them. Proceeds from the deal will be used to pay down about $1bn of debt, the company added.Sonic Corp, the drive-in burger chain, tumbled more than 10 per cent to $30.71 after saying it would open fewer restaurants than expected this year. The company’s shares have risen some 40 per cent over the past 12 months, and management said it will open 22 to 27 new franchised restaurants in the current fiscal fourth quarter. That leaves Sonic with a maximum of 47 restaurants for its fiscal year and short of its goal for 50 to 60 new openings.Green Dot, a provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards, enjoyed its biggest one-day gain on record after it signed a new five-year agreement with Walmart and announced plans to return $150m to shareholders via a new share repurchase program. The stock, down by a fifth over the past year before the news, surged 41 per cent to $21.54.Improved software sales failed to buoy BlackBerry, with investors focusing instead on the smartphone maker’s revenue and profit miss. Shares in BlackBerry fell 4 per cent to $8.81, taking the stock’s losses for the year to 20 per cent.Beauty group Coty fell by as much as 2.5 per cent after its incoming chief executive, Elio Leoni Sceti, reconsidered and decided not to take up the job. However, the stock later reversed the losses to trade 1 per cent higher at $31.80.Fitbit continued its winning streak, climbing 2 per cent to $37.88.

Sales rose 15 per cent to $422m.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 15 cents a share on sales of $418.3m. Adjusted earnings of 23 cents a share topped estimates for 20 cents a share.Same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 15 per cent, topping estimates for an 11.5 per cent gain.“The firm delivered better than expected sales and profits in a quarter marked by choppy results for many retailers, with reported growth rates near the top of the retail spectrum underscoring strong brand momentum,” said Matthew Fassler, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.The company lifted its full-year earnings and sales outlook. Restoration Hardware now expects full-year earnings in the range of $3.02 to $3.15 a share against forecasts for $3.03 a share. This is above its previous outlook for earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 a share.Sales are expected to range from $2.146bn to $2.176bn compared with forecasts for $2.16bn.Shares of Restoration Hardware advanced 3 per cent to $97.46 in morning trading, settling to close at $96.28.

22;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2015-03-25T18:17:55Z;Darden Restaurants: back for seconds;Turns out hedge funds can operate a company;"Hedge fund managers think they know how companies should be run. How surprising it would be if, in one case, they were right. Darden Restaurants, the scene of perhaps the ugliest shareholder revolt of 2014, had its entire board replaced. The instigator was the hedge fund Starboard Value. Starboard proposed the sale of the property underneath the Olive Garden restaurants — the standard bit of financial engineering prescribed to retail chains of all sorts. Darden’s new management is still working through how to pursue that play. In the meantime, surprisingly, Olive Garden has got better at selling Italian food.Last week Darden reported that the Olive Garden chain’s same store revenue growth for its third quarter was 2.2 per cent, marking the unit’s first consecutive quarterly increase in five years. Some of the increase was attributed to an improving economy and some to simplifying pricing and remodelling stores. Customers also like to eat their pasta at home, it seems; takeaway orders jumped 22 per cent.Restaurant-level profit margin in the quarter rose more than 2 percentage points to 23 per cent and, combined with the revenue boost, earnings per share surged 40 per cent from a year ago. Another reason profits went up: marketing outlay dropped 1 percentage point. Restaurant traffic dipped, so Darden is now trying to balance cost cuts and investments in the business. Sales growth, while positive, still lags behind the industry average, Telsey Advisory Group notes.The improving business may be paired with upcoming property transactions. Darden has sold 16 properties and the buyers accepted a yield of just 5 per cent on their purchases. And Darden is now looking to sell the rest of Olive Garden’s property. The corporate headquarters have already been put on the block.Darden shares have rallied a third in the past six months.

If 2014 was the year that activist investing went mainstream — the asset class has an estimated $100bn worth of funds — then 2015 will be the year we learn if activists can manage the businesses they have caught. Two companies — high-end auctioneer Sotheby’s and mid-tier restaurant chain Darden Restaurants — will be worth watching.Critics argue that activists are just stock pickers, finding undervalued companies poised to rally, then calling for buybacks or cost cuts. They then exploit the short-term pop they may or may not have inspired, and move on.The dilemma for activists starts with the fight for board seats. Hoping to ward off the activists, companies often announce job cuts and share buybacks to show “responsiveness”. By the time Sotheby’s settled with Dan Loeb in May, it had announced a $300m special dividend and $22m in cost cuts. Darden’s managers announced $60m in cost cuts and operational changes.What’s left for the investors when they get their seats? The toughest problems facing the business. Sotheby’s has lost market share to rival Christie’s and margins have fallen. The recent resignation of the Christie’s chief executive just days after Sotheby’s head William Ruprecht announced his own departure also demonstrates the turmoil in art sales. Sotheby’s shares are down more than a 10th in 2014.The activist rout at Darden, owner of the Olive Garden chain, is also intriguing. After a long fight, Starboard Value managed to replace the board. Before they left, the incumbent team — controversially — sold off the Red Lobster chain, rendering Starboard’s ideas for financial re-engineering less compelling. Starboard is now left trying to bring customers back — no easy task.If the rabble-rousers become effective managers, then the appeal of activists will become more compelling. If they fall flat, besieged chief executives will be sure to remind investors of it in the years to come.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Tesla’s existing Model S fleet reaches 60mph in 5.4 seconds.“To some extent, the all-wheel drive (AWD) Model S is playing catch-up with other luxury makers that already offer AWD on many of their vehicles – (we don’t see the addition of AWD to the Model S as a game-changer),” said Brian Johnson, an analyst at Barclays.Mr Musk had generated a lot of interest with a cryptic tweet leading up to the event that read “about time to unveil the D and something else”. Tesla shares fell 8 per cent to $236.91 on Friday.But the shares had been buoyant going into the event against a backdrop of falls for the rest of the auto sector.“The auto sector has been down since the first of October – given the relative gains Tesla has made, people are adjusting their positions and taking some of the profit off the table,” said George Galliers, associate managing director at ISI Group.“Yesterday was positive but it isn’t going to have a material impact on earnings or change assumptions in a meaningful way.”Tesla shares are up 57 per cent so far this year.Shares of Symantec fell 7 per cent to $21.94 after the company announced late on Thursday that it would separate into two public companies, with one focused on security and the other on its storage business.Analysts at BMO said the two businesses will be better off following the split but they will still face challenges.“Products and technology have not kept up with the pace of technology development, and the transition to the cloud and competition against smaller, more focused companies remain a big challenge,” said Joel Fishbein, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.“This leaves us unconvinced that growth reacceleration is around the corner.”Shares of Darden Restaurants declined 2 per cent to $21.94 after Starboard Value, the investment firm that had clashed with Darden executives, won 12 seats on the company’s board of directors to take full control, a preliminary tally of votes at Darden’s annual meeting showed.Infosys shares gained 6 per cent to $62.82 after the Indian information technology company beat expectations on profit and announced bonus shares.The company reported a 29 per cent increase in profits to Rs31bn ($505m) in the three months ended in September.

25;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-10-10T15:08:29Z;Starboard sweeps away entire Darden board;Activist wins backing in quest to revive restaurant group;Hedge fund Starboard Value scored a sweeping final victory in its ten-month fight to shake up Darden Restaurants, owner of Olive Garden, in another example of institutional investors’ willingness to back activists at underperforming companies.Starboard’s nominees, including the hedge fund’s founder Jeff Smith, won all 12 seats on Darden’s board at the company’s annual meeting on Friday.While activists often seek board seats to push their plans, it is rare for them to put up a full slate of candidates to replace existing directors, and rarer still for them to find support among other shareholders.Starboard had argued that Darden mismanaged Olive Garden and failed to pursue shareholder-friendly plans such as splitting the business or restructuring its property portfolio.Darden’s sale of its Red Lobster chain earlier this year, just ahead of a shareholder vote that might have stopped it, angered some shareholders. The company also said that its long-time chief executive Clarence Otis would step down, but Starboard continued to press its case for more sweeping change in the boardroom.“Darden has all the right ingredients to regain the strength and prominence it once enjoyed,” Mr Smith said, in a statement issued jointly with the company, adding that the new board would move quickly to find a “transformational leader to be Darden’s CEO”.Starboard was the second activist investor to alight on Darden, whose shares had lagged behind the market as Olive Garden and Red Lobster succumbed to competition from fast-food chains such as Chipotle. Earlier last year, Barington Capital demanded the company break itself up.The two activists bombarded Darden shareholders with letters attacking existing management and setting out menus of proposals for improving the business, from revamping restaurant managers’ bonuses to changing the way Olive Garden serves breadsticks.In a last gasp attempt to prevent Starboard’s victory, Darden had conceded a minority of seats to its nominees but argued that handing full control of the board to a hedge fund would hurt shareholders’ interests.Darden’s shares rose slightly to $49.34. The shares peaked at $57.20 two years ago.The margin of victory for Starboard’s candidates was not immediately available.
26;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-09-19T14:31:22Z;Letter from Lex: ending a relationship;A week where companies considered the benefits and costs of a split;It has been a week for thinking about break-ups, and not just in Scotland. Over on the west coast of the US there has also been lots of hand wringing about the benefits of staying together and the costs of a split. In the end Calpers decided to ditch its 12-year relationship with the hedge fund industry, and will withdraw $4bn from a total of 24 hedge funds and six funds of funds.That was not the only relationship that came to a shuddering halt this week. Vladimir Yevtushenkov, an oligarch who previously had a decent relationship with the Kremlin, found himself under house arrest as part of an investigation into the alleged theft of assets in the region of Bashkortostan. Mr Yevtushenkov owns two-thirds of a conglomerate called Sistema. And Sistema owns four-fifths of Bashneft, Russia’s seventh-largest oil producer. The deteriorating relationship between Mr Yevtushenkov and the Russian authorities is bad news for both businesses.Bayer, the German pharmaceutical group, is also on the verge of a break-up. It has decided to float off its plastics operation, which accounts for about 29 per cent of its revenues. Return on capital in the plastics business is just 6 per cent, while Bayer’s other operations generate returns in the mid teens. So they should enjoy a higher valuation once plastics has gone. The move does, however, raise questions about whether the consumer health business should also be spun off.Meanwhile Nelson Peltz is hoping that US conglomerate DuPont will do something similar. He wants to split the chemicals business from the agriculture, nutrition and health businesses, and says that doing so would save $2bn to $4bn of operating costs. That sounds odd – demergers usually result in higher costs, not lower. And over at restaurant group Darden (owner of the Olive Garden chain), the activists of Starboard Value have come up with a turnround plan which involves separating the property assets and spinning off secondary brands.Sony also needs to think about which parts of its business it ought to keep, and which it should shed. It has announced a change of strategy for its struggling phone business, but if it cannot foresee rapid growth, then it should get out. The same thing goes for PlayStation.In the beer world, things were breaking up before they even got together. SABMiller made a tentative approach to Heineken, which was swiftly (a little too swiftly in our view) rejected by the Dutch brewer. But it was SABMiller’s shares that jumped when the news broke, not Heineken’s. The Anglo-South African brewer might now find itself prey for AB InBev, which has a good record in squeezing savings from acquisitions.Finally on Thursday came news that Larry Ellison is ready to start the process of separating himself from Oracle. It will be a long process though. Although he is stepping aside as chief executive, he is taking on a new role as chairman and chief technology office. Separations, in some cases, do not go very deep.Have a good weekend.Oliver Ralph, Deputy Head of Lex.
27;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-09-16T17:30:43Z;Olive Garden: spaghetti on the wall;"It’s easy to be a food critic; dining may be the hardest business to manage";Activist investors are sharp financial engineers – their weakness is running a business. Or so goes the stock criticism. When it comes to Italian food, though, everyone fancies themselves an expert. That’s helpful for Starboard Value, the investment fund besieging Darden Restaurants, owner of the Olive Garden chain. Starboard’s recent tome detailing its turnround plan has struck a cultural chord. Suggestions about breadsticks and pasta have resonated with epicureans. Starboard’s recipes are about to be tested. Despite much nastiness between activist and company, the only dispute left is about the scale of Starboard’s victory.In October, Darden shareholders will elect the board. Already the company’s long-time chief executive has departed in the wake of year-long campaign by Starboard to turn Darden round. The company has offered Starboard four seats, nominated four newcomers and put up four incumbents for re-election. But Starboard wants to sack the entire board in the wake of the controversial sale of Red Lobster over the summer, which was undertaken despite heavy objections.Starboard’s main goal had been to separate Darden’s real estate holdings in Olive Garden and Red Lobster and list them as a separate company. That new company would then receive rent payments from the restaurants. With Red Lobster gone, working out how to fix the restaurants has become crucial. Hence the brainstorming about pasta and breadsticks. True to its hedge fund roots, however, Starboard still calls for a separation of the remaining property assets, a spin-off of secondary brands, and a move to a franchise model.Darden management concedes it is now taking actions consistent with Starboard’s ideas. Starboard estimates it could boost Darden’s share price by 60 per cent. However, even with Darden’s compliance and Starboard’s approaching coronation, Darden shares are down 6 per cent for the year.As easy as it is to be food critic, dining may be the hardest business to manage over the long term. McDonald's once struck gold with fancy coffee but now struggles against Chipotle. Burger King’s private equity owners cleverly instituted a franchise strategy but with that card played they have resorted to buying Tim Hortons to chase growth. A hedge fund believes it has the right ingredients to fix Olive Garden. The odds are against it.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
28;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-09-14T14:02:29Z;US companies devise tactics to limit activists’ advances;;US companies are devising new tactics to limit the advance of activist investors, as hedge funds wage an increasing number of campaigns to unseat entire corporate boards.The number of occasions on which activists have put forward a full slate of new board members has more than doubled in the past two years, reflecting the growing confidence and financial firepower of this sector of the hedge fund industry.In response, companies are appealing directly to shareholders to cap activists’ influence to a minority of board seats, in what corporate governance lawyers describe as a “cat and mouse game” between the two sides.Darden Restaurants, which owns the US chain Olive Garden, is the latest in a string of companies to concede a minority of seats to an activist and argue that handing full control of the board to a hedge fund would hurt shareholders’ interests.“Companies are using a new tactic in the face of the risk of majority-slate contests,” said David Rosewater, partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel, which advises activists.“It is a cat-and-mouse game. When they gift seats to the activist, it gives companies an argument that it doesn’t represent the same kind of mandate for change.”Darden has put up only eight nominees for 12 board seats at next month’s annual meeting, leaving four free for nominees from Starboard Value, the activist fund run by Jeff Smith, which is running 12 candidates.Darden is locked in a battle with Starboard over how it is running Olive Garden and other chains. Darden warned last week of “the risks and destabilisation that would result from full board turnover and giving control to a single shareholder’s nominees”.Assailed by activists, many companies are entering settlement talks and agreeing to give them board seats, as Hertz did last week with corporate raider Carl Icahn.Darden’s plan to leave seats vacant even though a settlement cannot be reached comes on the heels of similar concessions at Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore miner, and Bob Evans Farms, a restaurant chain. In both cases, activists were attempting to take a majority of board seats.In the US, where shareholders are handed two competing voting cards and allowed to vote on only one, the aim is to encourage them to use the management ballot, even if they would like activists to receive some board representation. That maximises the chances of management keeping control.At Bob Evans Farms, the manoeuvre kept Sandell Asset Management to a minority of the seats, but at Cliffs, Casablanca Capital did win control and replaced the chief executive.According to global data from research group Activist Insight, there have been 21 contests in the past two years in which activist hedge funds have proposed nominees to completely replace a corporate board. All but two are US companies. That compares with eight contests globally in the two years before that.
29;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11.

30;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-07-29T10:17:18Z;Darden: Olive Garden branch?;Long-time CEO goes, but activists now need to come up with a new plan quickly;The departure of Darden Restaurants’ long-time chief executive Clarence Otis will be bittersweet for the activist investors hounding him – with the emphasis on bitter. Mr Otis’ departure was announced on the day Darden closed the $2.1bn sale of its troubled Red Lobster chain. The sale was keenly contested by the activists. They wanted instead to combine the property portfolios of two of Darden’s chains – Red Lobster and Olive Garden – and to float the resulting business.However, Darden will give at least three of 12 board seats to one of the agitators, Starboard Value, which owns 8 per cent of the group. Practically, Starboard has enough backing to get more than three seats. Whatever Starboard is feeling now – bitterness, redemption, glee – will need to change quickly into a plan for how to salvage its investment.It is difficult to say anything kind about the end of Mr Otis’s tenure. Same stores sales in the last financial year at Olive Garden and Red Lobster (70 per cent per cent of group revenue) were down 3.4 and 6 per cent, respectively. The Red Lobster sale led to $500m in cash taxes and, worse, the private equity buyer will execute a property finance strategy that Darden could have done itself. Shares in Darden, which rallied late Monday, are down 15 per cent for the year.To maximise its investment in the near-term, Starboard may just sell more chains. Otherwise, it is left trying to lure more customers back to Olive Garden. Mr Otis and the present board never had much regard for Starboard, which emphasised more the shortcomings of Mr Otis than its own acumen for running restaurants.Mr Otis leaving on the same day as Red Lobster is the perfect closing insult to his detractors. His final years at the helm acted as sharp daggers to the value held by all shareholders.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com

Michael Kors was little changed at $88.60.Shares of Oracle, which makes servers, software and developed the Java programming platform, fell 4 per cent to $40.82 after the company missed expectations on two fronts in its latest earnings report.Sales climbed 3 per cent to $11.3bn, while profits fell 4 per cent from a year earlier to $3.6bn, or 80 cents per share. When adjusted for certain items, Oracle said it earned 92 cents per share.Analysts had expected Oracle to earn 95 cents a share on sales of $11.5bn. The company said it failed to ignite new software licence sales, which account for a third of net revenues.“While Oracle accounting is more conservative than many [‘Software as a Service’] peers . . . the low growth rate suggests that the ‘base’ of SaaS business such as 2012 and 2013 acquisitions Taleo, RightNow and Eloqua is underperforming its market,” Citi analyst Walter Pritchard said.Mr Pritchard also downgraded the company to neutral from buy.Darden Restaurants said on Friday that “legal, financial advisory and other costs related to implementation of [its] strategic action plan,” as well as the writedown of the value of some assets, dented profits in the quarter to May 25.The company, which is based in Florida, has been engaged in a high-profile battle with activist investors over how to generate more value from its businesses.Last month, Darden agreed to sell its Red Lobster chain to a private equity firm for $2.1bn, an agreement that riled several activist funds.Profits in the quarter tumbled 35 per cent to $86.5m, or 65 cents a share. Legal and advisory costs, as well as impairment charges, accounted for 19 cents of the drop. When excluding those costs, the company said it earned 84 cents a share, below Wall Street forecasts.Shares of the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants owner fell 4 per cent to $47.58.RadioShack, which lost almost $100m in the three months to May 3, fell 10 per cent on Friday to 92 cents, taking it below $1 for the first time in at least 30 years.At its height, RadioShack commanded a market value of more than $15bn – larger than retailers such as Nordstrom and Tiffany – and made more than $2.4bn in profits between 2000 and 2010.But a rapidly changing retail landscape, which has felled so-called big box electronics chains CompUSA and Circuit City, has pushed RadioShack’s market value below $100m.Gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson fell 9 per cent to $15.52 after the company forecast full-year earnings below Wall Street expectations.Overall, US equity markets coasted to new record heights. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,962.87 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.15 per cent to 16,947.08.

32;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-05-23T21:00:36Z;Investor activism: alternative warfare;Activist shareholders should stick to traditional techniques;Activist investors are finding out the hard way that conventional warfare trumps newfangled techniques. For Starboard Value, one of the dissidents trying to shake up Darden Restaurants (home to the Red Lobster chain), that message may have arrived too late. But Bill Ackman still has time to adapt his tactics as he tries to fashion a tie-up between Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Allergan.A week ago, despite stiff opposition from investors led by Starboard and Barington Capital, Darden sold Red Lobster for $2.1bn to a private equity firm. The dissidents wanted the property assets of Red Lobster and sister chain Olive Garden to be separated before any sale. The announced deal precludes that. And since Red Lobster is a division, no shareholder vote is required. Starboard did manage to force a special shareholder meeting to discuss the issue, but that meeting could not compel Darden into any action.Starboard’s only recourse now is to take the more conventional route and force a vote at the annual meeting. It wants to sack the entire board in the autumn. But Red Lobster may be gone by then. A better tactic would have been to lay low until just before this year’s meeting so management would not have had time to quickly dump the seafood chain.Bill Ackman’s machinations at Allergan are numerous. First, he partnered with Valeant to take a 9.7 per cent stake in Allergan, a novel activist/hostile bid gambit. Now, he seeks a “shadow”, non-binding shareholder vote that would press resistant Allergan management into talks. But for all the theatrics, the path to winning Allergan is simple: just keep raising the bid and/or throw out the recalcitrant board. As with Darden, the latter is difficult since Allergan has just held its shareholder meeting. Yet Mr Ackman’s camp grasps the former and is expected to raise its bid soon. And if eventually triumphant, it will be so for simply paying a good price, not due to cute share purchases or a sham referendum.The crowded field of activists is forcing them to act both prematurely and flamboyantly to stand out. But simply standing out will not be enough to advance their agendas.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
33;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
34;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-05-16T21:47:14Z;Department stores surge amid spring recovery;;Shares in Nordstrom and JC Penney, department store groups operating at opposite ends of the spectrum, surged after both reported better than expected earnings amid a spring recovery that has encouraged several retail executives over their second-quarter prospects.Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retailer that competes with Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale’s, said revenue growth had accelerated in the first quarter, driven by sales of cosmetics, shoes and women’s handbags, as well as by the company’s outlet business.Executives also said the company retained Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities to advise it on the potential sale of $2bn of credit card receivables, providing the motivation for an upgrade to ‘outperform’ from ‘neutral’ at Credit Suisse.“Last night’s announcement that Nordstrom would be putting its $2bn credit card receivables portfolio up for sale appears to be a bridge to the likely earnings acceleration in 2016,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Exstein said.For the quarter, net sales rose 7 per cent to $2.9bn while profits fell 3 per cent to $140m, or 72 cents per share.

35;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-05-16T19:24:29Z;Red Lobster sale goes against investors’ wishes;;Darden Restaurants has said it will sell the Red Lobster seafood restaurant chain for $2.1bn, defying a shareholder vote that urged it to take more time to consider other options.Investors reacted negatively to the deal, sending Darden shares down more than 4 per cent in Friday morning trading, and two activist hedge funds that have targeted the company called the sale “unconscionable” and “unbelievable”.Golden Gate Capital, the San Francisco private equity group that has previously invested in California Pizza Kitchen and retailers Payless ShoeSource and Zales, will pay $2.1bn in cash for Red Lobster.Darden said the deal will allow executives to focus on turning around its biggest brand, the Oliver Garden restaurant chain, and on a portfolio of smaller, growing chains that include LongHorn Steakhouse.But activists Starboard Value and Barington Capital had been fighting to stop the sale process, announced in December, saying it would scupper hopes of a broader reshuffle of Darden’s portfolio of brands and of its extensive property portfolio.“This sale is the wrong transaction, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons,” said Jeff Smith, Starboard chief executive. “This board’s value-destructive and self-serving actions fly in the face of corporate democracy.”Last month, Starboard said it had collected votes from 55 per cent of Darden’s shareholders demanding a special meeting to discuss the different plans, but the company had yet to set a date. The meeting would still be held, it said on Friday, but the sale of Red Lobster did not require shareholder approval.This sale is the wrong transaction, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasonsSmith had expressed his frustration with Darden management earlier this week at a panel on activist investing at the SALT conference in Las Vegas.“Management teams are much more receptive than they used to be, they’ve gotten smarter and know they have to work with us,” he said. “Darden may be the exception.”Jim Mitarotonda, founder of Barington, said: “It is unconscionable that the Darden Board would enter into an agreement to sell the Red Lobster business for what amounts to a ‘fire sale’ price after shareholders clearly indicated that they did not want the company to enter into any transaction unless it was subject to their approval”.Red Lobster, famous for its hearty seafood, has 705 restaurants in the US and Canada, and had $2.62bn in sales last fiscal year, but it has suffered from the rise of faster-service restaurant chains such as Chipotle.Golden Gate plans to immediately sell Red Lobster’s property portfolio for $1.5bn in a leaseback deal with American Realty Capital Properties.Darden chief executive Clarence Otis defended the transaction, saying there had been a competitive sale process and waiting for shareholder debate would have meant calling off the deal.“By enabling us to bolster the company’s financial foundation and increase our focus on the Olive Garden brand renaissance program, we believe this agreement addresses key issues that our shareholders have raised, including the need to preserve the company’s dividend,” he said.

The monthly charges may also alienate some clients, Citi said.“When considering that the desktop rental customer would see substantial increase in total cost of ownership versus either upgrade or maintenance subscription, we believe the overwhelming majority of customers would bypass subscription,” Mr Pritchard said.Car rental operator Hertz Global fell 2.7 per cent to $27.25 after it disclosed that it would need to revise previous financial statements.Hertz, which has recently implemented new financial disclosure systems, said it found adjustments to past reports that would force revisions.The changes are not expected to have a material impact on Hertz’s reported financial or liquidity positions.The company also said it would be unable to file its annual report with US securities regulators on time and had requested an extension.US carmakers broadly declined on Monday as February sales figures showed a difficult trading month.While sales accelerated at the end of the month, several executives stressed the impact severe weather had at the start of 2014.General Motors said sales fell 1 per cent from a year earlier, compared to Wall Street expectations for a 7.7 per cent dip.Ford sales dipped a steeper than forecast 6 per cent during the period. Ford vice-president John Felice said deliveries “surged in the final week, providing us momentum after a slow start to the month”.Ford shares fell 1.2 per cent to $15.20 while GM nudged up to $36.21.Overall, US equity markets followed their European peers lower as geopolitical conflict in Ukraine more than offset better than expected economic reports in the world’s largest economy.The S&P 500 was down 0.74 per cent to 1,845.73 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.94 per cent to 16,168.03.

37;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-03-02T16:43:40Z;Retail property: blame Canada;Great North structures can’t be replicated over the border;Sometimes retailers are better off as land barons, not peddlers of pasta. Take Darden Restaurants, the parent of Olive Garden and Red Lobster among other chains, which owns much of the land and structures where it operates eateries. Some noisy investors think the land could garner a premium valuation, if listed separately. Two such successes (so far) of this gambit hail from the Great North. Canadian grocer Loblaw and auto parts store Canadian Tire both listed their property portfolios in 2013. One problem, though, for US copycats: like many of Canada’s finer aspects, these structures can’t be exactly replicated over the border.There is a big class of investors who want to buy into dedicated property businesses, which makes separating “opcos” and “propcos” profitable. The propco simply collects rent from the stores. But it happens that markets (currently) ascribe a higher valuation to rent collection than to retailing. The retail parent companies, Loblaw and Canadian Tire, are up a half and a third respectively since announcing their real estate investment trusts (Reit) listings.Crucially, according to Canadian rules, the parent can stay in control of the Reit (each sold less than a fifth in the IPO). Then, if times get tough, rent and contractual obligations can be adjusted. In the US, no Reit shareholder can have a controlling stake. As a consequence, the parent becomes a creditor to the property company, rather than, effectively, borrowing from itself. In the US last year, when Penn National Gaming separated its casinos, it fully spun them off to shareholders. Still, that was well received enough to send its shares up nearly a third upon announcement. The question is if those same jubilant shareholders will still be there when market conditions change, and those outbound rent payments become onerous.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
38;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2014-01-13T13:16:12Z;Darden Restaurants faces rising pressure from activist investors;;"Activist shareholders are stepping up pressure on Darden Restaurants, owner of the Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains, to squeeze value from a property portfolio they claim could be worth $4bn.Barington Capital signalled it would oppose any sale of Red Lobster under consideration by the company that could rob shareholders of the chance to profit from a property restructuring.The hedge fund, which is leading an investor group that controls 2 per cent of Darden’s shares, said in an open letter to the company on Monday that management “can and should be doing more to improve value for its shareholders”.The broadside comes three weeks after Barington was joined on the shareholder register by a second activist, Starboard Value, which has taken a 5.6 per cent stake in Darden and is advocating the company put its 1,054 properties into a real estate investment trust.Barington said it would seek support from other shareholders and analysts in an online presentation of its own plan on January 30.In September, Barington proposed Darden should split itself into three parts: a reit for its property; a new company for growth brands including LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille; and a rump Darden that contains the two mature businesses, Red Lobster and Olive Garden.Darden, led by chief executive Clarence Otis, responded to the growing pressure shortly before Christmas, saying it would explore the sale or spin-off of Red Lobster, which is its worst-performing business. The casual dining seafood chain’s sales are down more than 4 per cent this fiscal year.Barington said the plan was “incomplete and inadequate” because it did not address ways to maximise value from the property portfolio. Darden owns 48 per cent of its 2,174 restaurants and is considering including Red Lobster’s properties in any sale of the business.Not only does Darden’s plan fail to pursue a property portfolio restructuring, Barington said in its letter: “It could hinder the company’s ability to monetise its real estate in the future, a prospect that should give all shareholders great pause.”Darden has told shareholders it does not believe the benefits of putting its properties into a Reit would be as great as advertised by the activists.The company said: ”We are confident that our plan, together with actions we are taking to enhance guest experiences and reinvigorate demand, will lead to improved performance in our restaurants and substantially increase value for all Darden shareholders.”"
39;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2013-12-19T18:25:10Z;Activist investor spurs Darden to serve up Red Lobster;;"Darden Restaurants has put its ailing Red Lobster chain up for sale, in an attempt to defuse an activist shareholder campaign and to rid itself of a worsening drag on its earnings.The company, whose other brands include US mid-market staple Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, also promised to expand a cost-savings drive and to change the way it pays executives.The moves, which were the result of a board review conducted with the help of Goldman Sachs, demonstrate the increasingly swift impact that activist investors can have on a company’s strategy.However it falls far short of a full victory for Barington Capital, the New York hedge fund which has been demanding change since building a stake of more than 2 per cent earlier this year.In a presentation made public this week, Barington set out its case for separating the company into three: putting Red Lobster and Olive Garden into one company; the faster-growing brands into another company; and the property portfolio into a tax-efficient real estate investment trust.Jim Mitarotonda, chief executive of Barington, called the Darden plan “incomplete and inadequate”. He said: “We believe that Darden can and should be doing more to improve value for its shareholders.”The company’s latest quarterly results on Thursday reflected the continuing disappointing performance of Red Lobster, which is famous for its hearty seafood but has suffered from the rise of faster-service restaurant chains such as Chipotle.The division will post same-venue sales decline of 4-5 per cent this fiscal year, while Olive Garden will also be down 1-2 per cent, Darden said, explaining cuts to its sales and earnings forecasts. Instead of a 3-5 per cent decline in earnings per share this year, it is now expecting a decline of up to 20 per cent.Darden shares were down 3.6 per cent by the close of trading in New York.Red Lobster has 705 restaurants in the US and Canada and had $2.62bn in sales last fiscal year. The company said it would entertain offers for the division, or would spin it off as a separate company by early 2015.In other moves designed to sharpen focus on improving performance and increasing the scope for cash returns to shareholders, Darden will suspend Olive Garden restaurant openings for at least three years, eschew further acquisitions, and start to compensate executives based on same-store sales and free cash flow.“This is a step that will better align management incentives with two performance measures that are even more important given the other changes we are making, and that play a significant role in driving value creation in the restaurant industry,” said Clarence Otis, Darden chief executive.Barington took public its stinging critique of Darden management this week, saying they had presided over a company with bloated head office costs and that its brands were losing their distinctiveness because chefs and managers were hopping too often between restaurant chains."
40;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2013-12-17T12:31:05Z;Activist hedge fund gets its teeth into Darden Restaurants;;An activist hedge fund will on Tuesday launch a stinging attack on the management at Darden, owner of US restaurant chains Olive Garden and Red Lobster, as it steps up its campaign for the company to split.An investor group led by Barington Capital plans to publish a critique of five years of what it calls value destruction, citing a litany of complaints from failed acquisitions to poor menu choices.By going public with an 85-slide presentation setting out its case for change, the New York-based hedge fund is escalating pressure on Darden’s chief executive Clarence Otis, ahead of company earnings due this week.In October, Barington revealed that its shareholder group owned more than 2 per cent of the company and had proposed that Darden split, separating the struggling Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains from a portfolio of faster-growing brands that include LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille.It also says the company’s property portfolio should be transferred to a tax-efficient real estate investment trust.In a change of tone from previous public statements, which have emphasised the additional value it believes its proposals can create, Barington’s new broadside highlights criticisms of how Darden is being run, including a loss of focus at its core brands.Olive Garden this month launched an “Italiano burger”, as it moved away from its traditional, homey Italian fayre and into selling burgers and fries, and Barington quotes analysts and even satirists lampooning the change. It blames managers being moved too often between Darden’s different restaurant chains.“Because nothing says Italian like a sandwich named after a German city,” it quotes from a tweet by Comedy Central’s The Daily Show.A Darden spokesman repeated that the company “welcomes input towards the goal of enhancing shareholder value . . . and the board will take the time necessary to thoroughly evaluate Barington’s suggestions, just as the company does for any of its shareholders”.Barington argues that Mr Otis’s strategy of growing and diversifying the company through acquisitions has failed to generate synergies or add shareholder value.“Where are the ‘tremendous synergies’ your management team promised?” Barington asks in the presentation. “Darden has not captured any economies of scale savings despite acquiring five brands over the past six years.”Barington, founded in 1992 by Jim Mitarotonda, has previously pursued activist campaigns against Jones Group, an apparel manufacturer, and department store chain Dillard’s.The presentation on Darden was produced with the investment bank Houlihan Lokey, which concluded that the company could save up to $150m in annual costs from running the restaurants more efficiently and argued that its $4bn property portfolio was not fully reflected in its $6.8bn market capitalisation.
41;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2013-12-10T18:18:57Z;Darden Restaurants: Food fight;;Whether activist investors can cook is not the point. Only serve them hors d’oeuvres and they will storm the kitchen, whatever their culinary talents. So Darden Restaurants is learning. The parent company of the languishing Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant chains has offered some nibbles, such as $50m in cost cuts, to agitator Barington Capital. While appetising, they fall short of the heaping platter of spin-offs Barington craves – and which, if enacted, could lead to indigestion.Traffic at the major “casual dining” (cheapish, waiter service) chains fell nearly a fifth between 2006 and 2012, JPMorgan says. The troubles are not just about the weak US consumer or the rise of “fast casual” (cheaper, counter service) chains such as Chipotle. Darden has not adapted. Operating expenses ate up 10 per cent of revenue in the 2013 financial year, twice the level of rival Brinker (the parent of Chili’s). Its capital expenditure to revenue ratio of 8 per cent also looks high. As such, Darden’s hefty dividend takes up much of its $300m in free cash flow.Barington’s most daring demand is that Darden break itself up. Its smaller chains would be put into a new company, which could trade at a higher valuation given that – unlike Olive Garden and Red Lobster – they have positive same-store sales growth. Yet this new company could take some of the $150m in cost cuts Barington also wants away with it.A spicier idea is a flotation of Darden’s sizeable property portfolio. Property companies tend to trade on higher multiples than restaurant companies, and Morgan Stanley estimates that floating the division could boost total shareholder value by 25 per cent. Risk lurks, though. The move requires Darden to become a debtor to the property company, since it must lease space and leverage would spike.Barington’s spin-off ideas are not necessarily unwise, but they are trickier than presented. And the menu of fixes still lacks a plan to grow sales again at the flagship chains.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

43;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2012-09-30T15:52:11Z;Warning over US health insurance exchange;;Healthcare experts and watchdog groups are warning that a new plan by two US companies to create private health insurance exchanges, if adopted widely, could leave employees at risk as companies try to shift costs to their workers.Sears, a US retailer, and Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden and Red Lobster, said last week they were unveiling a new “defined contribution” health insurance model. The scheme would give employees a lump sum of money and allow them to choose from a menu of insurance options with a wider variety of choices.The plans mimic the switch that many companies have made from traditional pension schemes to the 401(k) programmes that give employees greater choice while assuming more risk. Big companies cannot offload their employees into state-run insurance exchanges until 2017, and benefits consulting firms are developing private exchanges to fill the gap.“We’re trying to set up competition on the consumer level,” said Ken Sperling, health exchange strategy leader at Aon Hewitt, the benefits consulting firm that will run the exchange. “In every consumer marketplace, where you have competition, prices go down.”Aon says they will lower insurance costs for employees while giving insurers access to more potential customers. Mr Sperling said other large companies are considering the transition to private exchanges but that they want to see how Sears and Darden fare.But the possibility of private exchanges becoming mainstream has raised concerns among consumer advocates and some analysts that low-wage workers will be at risk if they choose their plans poorly and if the healthcare money given by their bosses does not keep pace with medical costs.“It’s basically a voucher leaving people to fend for themselves,” Carmen Balber, of the healthcare advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, said.According to Don McCanne, of Physicians for a National Health Programme, the impact of companies changing to private exchanges will not be immediately clear.“Only after many employees face bankrupting medical debt – a phenomenon that will increase as the employer contribution buys ever less insurance – will the implications be clear,” he said.Also unclear is if the switch to private exchanges will reduce medical costs overall.Les Funtleyder, healthcare analyst and fund manager at Polliwog, said that shifting responsibility on to low-wage workers as a way to cut costs was unlikely to work because doctors and hospitals have incentives to make them spend more.Darden argues that its workers will benefit from greater choice and the option of purchasing a less expensive health insurance plan.

The reviewer, Marilyn Hagerty, said a new Olive Garden was the “largest and most beautiful” restaurant in Grand Forks, drawing jeers from high-profile bloggers.Although Olive Gardens are not considered fine dining in many parts of the US, Mr Otis noted that the company is working to improve its menu, pricing and to give the restaurants a “Tuscan Farmhouse” feel.Darden, which also operates restaurant chains Red Lobster, Longhorn Steakhouse and Capital Grille, said on Friday that its third-quarter net earnings rose by 8.5 per cent from a year ago to $164.1m, or $1.28 a share. Net sales were up 5.5 per cent year-on-year to $957m.
46;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2011-12-06T21:59:31Z;US stocks steady despite warning on EFSF;;Shares in Darden Restaurants tumbled 12.4 per cent to $41.82, as steep discounts failed to attract customers to its flagship Olive Garden chain in November.Same-restaurant sales at Olive Garden, which brings in almost half of Darden’s total sales, fell 5.7 per cent in November, a third straight month of declines, triggering a reappraisal of the stock by analysts.“When concepts lose their resonance with customers it doesn’t come back quickly,” said Rachel Rothman, a retail analyst at Susquehanna Financial, who had a “buy” recommendation on the stock before Tuesday’s announcement.“Turnrounds generally take not just a few quarters, but over a year,” she added.Restaurant stocks have benefited from solid consumer spending so far this year, and analysts stressed Darden’s woes were company specific, as other consumer discretionary stocks escaped unharmed.Elsewhere, US indices were broadly flat, despite Standard & Poor’s warning that the eurozone’s bail-out mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility, could face a rating downgrade, once a review of eurozone sovereigns is complete.The S&P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent to 1,258.47, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,150.13. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,649.56.“The tape doesn’t lie,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “A knock to the EFSF rating had already been discounted by the market. If anything it’s a further catalyst for a positive conclusion to the eurozone summit at the end of the week.”MetroPCS was the standout performer in the S&P 500, gaining 7.8 per cent to $8.87, as Braxton Carter, the mobile phone network’s chief financial officer, told an investor conference that the company was considering bidding for new spectrum to meet the growing demand of a data-hungry customer base.“Store traffic has been very strong for MetroPCS so we expect good gross customer additions for the quarter,” said Kevin Smithen, telecom analyst at Macquarie. “The unknown is what the churn rate is going to be, its impossible to estimate how many customers are leaving.”Rival Sprint Nextel fell 1.5 per cent $2.61, as its wireless network provider Clearwire said it would issue new shares to raise $595m in new capital.Last week Sprint had committed to maintain its 54 per cent stake in Clearwire, meaning it must stump up around $300m of the capital raise.The dilution impact of the new share issuance sent Clearwire shares tumbling to as low as $2.09, but the stock closed up 11.1 per cent to $2.50.“Clearwire shares trade around the probability of bankruptcy, and that has been alleviated incrementally by the funding component,” said David Dixon, telecom analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Fertilisers were among the other big movers, after Norway-based Yara, the world’s largest nitrogen-based fertiliser producer, said demand would be strong next year, as high commodity prices provided farmers with an incentive to apply.CF Industries, the second largest nitrogen-based fertiliser company, climbed 4.3 per cent to $146.82. Potash producers Mosaic and PotashCorp were up 3.4 and 3.9 per cent to $53.19 and $43.54 respectively.Yara’s guidance comforted the industry, which has been rocked in recent weeks by fears that the weak rupee would lead Indian farmers to cut back on fertiliser imports or demand price discounts.Petrol refiner Tesoro lost 6.1 per cent to $23.31 after Credit Suisse analysts changed their guidance on the stock to “neutral”.Analyst Edward Westlake remained upbeat on the refining sector, but said other companies such as Marathon Petroleum offered more compelling value.“A lack of dividend support [at Tesoro] leaves the shares more vulnerable to short term movements in margins and compressing free cash flow in 2012,” he told clients.Marathon shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.64.Halliburton was rocked by BP’s allegations that the oilfield services company had intentionally destroyed evidence relating to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year.The stock slipped 3.9 per cent to $35.57.Regional banks took a hit after Deutsche Bank said they may need to cut costs by as much as ten per cent to meet efficiency targets if revenues do not meet targets. SunTrust Banks fell 6.4 per cent to $18.03, Regions Financial declined 3.5 per cent to $4.16 and First Horizon was off 4.4 per cent to $7.43.LinkedIn Corp climbed 4.7 per cent to $73.20 after Morgan Stanley recommended clients buy shares in the professional-networking website, arguing its valuation was compelling, after steep falls in the share price in recent weeks.Eli Lilly climbed 3.9 per cent to $38.86 after Sanford Bernstein analysts said the current valuation assumed “extraordinarily low” expectations for the success of the group’s Alzheimer’s treatments. Tim Anderson, an Sanford Bernstein analyst said Eli’s market capitalisation could double if its latest Alzheimer’s drug, Solanezumab, proved successful.3M climbed 1.5 per cent to $82.13 after the maker of Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes forecast 2012 earnings would be $6.25 to $6.50 a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $6.27.
47;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2011-07-04T12:21:47Z;US restaurants;Industry is resilient even though Americans are feeling the economic pinch;"Americans are officially feeling the economic pinch. In response, they are rounding up the family and head out for dinner.US personal consumption is slumping. Housing prices have double-dipped, according to Case-Shiller. And when the painful topic of household cutbacks comes up, eating out less is everyone’s first suggestion. Yet the habit has proven hard to break: restaurants represented just under ten per cent of total retail spending in 2006, according to the Commerce Department. In the last twelve months, the proportion is more than ten and a half per cent.Of course, less expensive restaurants are well positioned for a stressful environment, and have done well recently. So-called “fast casual” chains – a step up from burgers and fries, but you still pay before you eat – have stood out. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, for example, are at an all-time high.One would also expect mid-tier chains to be struggling as customers trade down. Yet, for now, they are hanging in: same-store sales at “casual dining” restaurants (nothing fancy, but there is table service and you pay after) grew 2.2 per cent year-over year in May, and have been stubbornly positive since February, according to Knapp-Track. Darden, operator of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains, reported solid earnings last week, and shares have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date.The industry is resilient in part because it is doing a good job of shielding its customers from food price inflation. Prices for food eaten at home were 4.4 per cent higher than a year ago in May, according to CPI data; restaurant price inflation was two percentage points less. To the extent that restaurants are protecting hungry customers’ wallets, their success is well-earned. But it will be hard to maintain indefinitely."
48;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2011-07-01T20:30:24Z;Wall Street rally gathers pace;Rising optimism over economy;Wall Street saw its sharpest weekly gains in two years after better than expected manufacturing data buoyed risk appetite, helping the major indices achieve their fifth consecutive session of gains.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 1.4 per cent to 1,339.67, led by the consumer discretionary, financial and industrial sectors, after strong data raised hopes that the US economy was coming out of the recent slow patch.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performing, led by Apollo Group, which jumped 6.4 per cent to $46.46 after the operator of for-profit schools reported stronger than expected third-quarter earnings.Elsewhere in the sector, Darden Restaurants was up 6.1 per cent to $52.78 while Wynn Resorts added 4.2 per cent to $149.57.But the gains were broad based, with all 10 major sectors moving forward after the reading for the ISM manufacturing index came in at 55.3 for June. This was ahead of the 53.5 in May and better than the 52 expected by economists. A reading above 50 indicates expanding activity.This number followed news on Thursday that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index had come in at 61.1, which was also well above economists’ expectations and raised hopes that the economy was improving after weeks in the doldrums.“This data are a strong sign we are coming out of the recent soft patch,” said Mark Lamkin, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist of Lamkin Wealth Management.This feeling on Wall Street lifted risky assets. The S&P financial and industrial sectors were up 1.7 per cent while the consumer discretionary sector added 2 per cent and technology stocks were up 1.7 per cent.Defensive sectors like consumer staples and telecoms were some of the worst performing, rising only 0.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.Gains in the industrial sector were led by Cummins which put on 3.8 per cent to $107.42 while the technology sector was dominated by gains from Visa and MasterCard.The credit card companies continued to be lifted by news on Wednesday that the US Federal Reserve set a higher than expected cap on debit card transaction fees. Visa was up 4.4 per cent to $87.97 while MasterCard added 4.4 per cent to $314.47.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average index up 1.4 per cent at 12,581.86 and the Nasdaq Composite 1.5 per cent higher at 2,816.03.The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 5.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively, over the week.The S&P 500 added 5.6 per cent over the five days, the best week on the index since July 2009. The Dow and the Nasdaq also saw their best week in two years.The only real downbeat news in the session was that the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence index came in at 71.5 for June, slightly short of the 72 reading expected and down from 74.3 in May, but the markets shrugged this off.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down 4.8 per cent to 15.72, adding to the 21.7 per cent drop it had already seen this week as investors positioned themselves for a steady climb in the equity markets.The week on Wall Street kicked off in positive territory despite some lacklustre consumer spending data as the big indices bounced off key technical support levels reached the previous week after nearly two straight months of losses.The S&P 500 had fallen 7 per cent from the start of May, reaching a bottom at the end of last week. The index found its support level just 4 points away from the 200-day average of 1,264 – a line many analysts consider to be a crucial technical level.“The markets had become technically very oversold after the recent run of losses,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.The rebound that followed over the news five days was sharp, with the S&P index putting on around 1 per cent every session.The markets were helped by a partial resolution to the situation in Greece on Wednesday and then the stronger manufacturing data on Thursday and Friday. Investors were also positioning themselves for the upcoming earnings season – starting in earnest on July 11 – which is expected to be quite strong.In recent quarters markets have generally rallied before and during the earnings season as investors turn their attention away from macroeconomic concerns and on to companies news.This repositioning took form of a rotation into risk assets. The best performing sectors over the week were energy, which was up 7.2 per cent, technology, which added 6.8 per cent and consumer discretionary, which rose 6.6 per cent.One of the biggest pieces of corporate news from the session was the strong earnings results from Nike, which came as a relief to investors, who were concerned after the company missed expectations last quarter.Shares in Nike were up 13.1 per cent to $91.82.
49;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Appetite grows for US ‘fast casual’ food;;The restaurant business in the US remains challenged going into its all-important summer season, but in one segment of the industry, known as fast casual, several groups have outperformed the giant fast-food chains and taken significant business from higher-end restaurants.Panera Bread and Chipotle Mexican Grill, which together make up more than 25 per cent of the fast-casual segment – which sits between fast food and casual restaurant dining – both posted double-digit percentage increases in first-quarter sales over the same period the previous year, driven by the opening of new outlets and robust increases in same-store sales.By contrast, US revenues at McDonald’s suffered in 2009 and, for the first five months of this year, same-store sales are up 3 per cent over the same period a year ago.Burger King, the other large chain, has struggled, with revenues in the US and Canada down 4 per cent for the first three months of this year.Yum Brands, which includes fast-food chains such as KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, also suffered from weak domestic sales.The more upmarket casual dining sector, consisting of family-style restaurants with table service and beer and wine, has been hit hard by the recession and growing unemployment.The fiscal year at Darden Restaurants ended in late May, but during the nine months ending in February, same-store sales were off 2.8 per cent at its chains, which include Olive Garden, Red Lobster and Longhorn Steak House. Revenues have dropped at another casual dining group, Brinker International, owing to the sale of restaurant lines.Analysts said the leading fast-casual chains have thrived by focusing on their core consumers – who tend to be employed with some disposable income – rather than by cutting prices in an attempt to expand their customer base downwards.Panera, a chain of 1,388 restaurants specialising in breakfast and lunch offerings, reported $364m in revenues for the first quarter of 2010, a 14 per cent gain over the same period in 2009. Same-store sales in the quarter rose 9.5 per cent.“We didn’t have the dips that other people had” in 2009, said Ron Shaich, executive chairman of Panera. “We decided that value was not defined by how cheap you were but by how much people want to go to you.”The National Restaurant Industry reports that traffic across all types of restaurants declined in 31 of the past 32 months.“That’s basically all tied to the economy, the drop-off in jobs, disposable income and confidence,” says Bruce Grindy, senior director of economic analysis at the trade association.
50;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2010-03-25T00:37:45Z;Darden claws back custom of US diners;;"Olive Garden and Red Lobster, two of the best known US restaurant chains, have seen an uptick in orders for dishes such as the $16.99 Admiral’s Feast and the $18.75 Chicken Alfredo, in another sign of improving US consumer confidence.Darden Restaurants, which runs Olive Garden and Red Lobster and whose more than 1,700 locations also include LongHorn Steakhouses, on Wednesday reported its first comparable sales gains for two years, with a 0.5 per cent rise for the third quarter ended February 28, against a year ago, despite unusually bad winter weather.In its third quarter last year, Darden’s comparable sales declined 3.2 per cent.Darden is one of the first “full service” restaurant chains to return to sales growth, after it and rivals such as Ruby Tuesday and the privately held Outback Steakhouse suffered as increasingly frugal customers dined out less.Darden has outperformed its competitors during the recession, seeking to avoid the intense discounting launched by its rivals who had been seeking to drive sales with coupons, free food and other offers.The rest of the industry’s sales declined 4.3 per cent in the quarter ending February 28, according to the widely used Knapp-Track index of quarterly same restaurant sales, excluding Darden. But nevertheless, the decline was an improvement on the 6 per cent year-on-year fall in industry sales seen in the second quarter.Ruby Tuesday reported a 0.8 to 1 per cent decline in third-quarter comparable sales at its 670 restaurants, its best performance for five quarters.Brad Richmond, chief financial officer at Darden, said that its customers remained “in a fairly fragile state right now”.“We need to continue to see their household economics strengthen; we need to see more employment to really drive the industry and our business,” he said.Darden said it had seen an increase in gift card redemption rates, which Mr Richmond said suggested that “consumers are going through their drawers and finding all the old gift cards for our business and for others”.The slump in away-from-home dining at full-service restaurants has led to a handful of bankruptcies, including Uno Chicago Grill in January, and Max & Erma’s in October last year.Market researcher NPD Group estimated earlier this month that overall food service sales last year fell 3 per cent, with fine dining restaurants experiencing the steepest decline of 13 per cent, and casual dining restaurants such as Darden’s down 4 per cent."
51;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Generals Mills chief upbeat on US consumers;;General Mills chief executive Ken Powell said on Wednedsay that while US consumers remain “cautious and looking for value”, there were signs that the shift to retailers’ lower-cost private brands seen over the past year was moderating.“It’s very early days, and in general, the consumer is still being careful, but we are seeing a few signs, perhaps …of a little more confidence.”Mr Powell noted that over the past 52 weeks, private label brands had gained around 1 percentage point of market share in General Mills’ food categories, which include Cheerios cereals, Yoplait yogurt and Progresso soups. But growth had slowed over the most recent quarter, while private label products had lost marketshare in February.Mr Powell also said there had been some moderation in the rate at which restaurant food sales had been declining in what he called an “encouraging” trend suggesting improved consumer confidence.Darden, which operates the Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurant chains, said on Wednesday that it had seen slight improvements in comparable sales during its most recent quarter, reporting its first positive comparable sales in two years.For its third quarter as a whole, General Mills reported a 15 per cent increase in earnings to $333.2m against the same period last year, on a 2.6 per cent increase in sales, to $3.63bn.Gross margins improved to 38 per cent from 34 per cent, as the company faced lower ingredient input costs, while continued cost control efforts improved operating margins to 15.6 per cent from 13.9 per cent.Its US retail segment reported three per cent sales growth - on top of 8 per cent growth reported a year ago - with six per cent in its Big G breakfast cereals, where sales were boosted by the launch of new chocolate-flavoured Cheerios. Sales of snacks grew 15 per cent.Its meals division saw sales decline 2 per cent, as growth in meal-preparation brands such as Hamburger Helper and El Paso Mexican foods was offset by weak sales of its Progresso soup, which reflected broader weakness in soup sales over the winter.Campbell, Progresso’s main rival, reported that sales of its ready-to-eat soups fell 18 per cent in the quarter ending January 31, which analysts blamed on competition from other lower cost meals alternatives such as Kraft’s Macaroni & Cheese.General Mills raised its full-year earnings guidance to $4.57 to $4.59 per share from $4.52 to $4.57, excluding any mark-to-market impact.Its shares fell 1.6 per cent to $72.39 in midday trading.
52;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2010-02-24T21:31:26Z;Wall St comforted by rate outlook;;US equities moved higher on Wednesday as the markets were comforted by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s comments to Congress that the US economy is in a “nascent” recovery that requires interest rates to be kept low to encourage demand by consumers and companies.“The markets are breathing a sigh of relief that the recent rise in the discount rate will not lead to significant tightening in the near future,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research.He said Mr Bernanke is keen to give the jittery markets plenty of visibility on policy decisions. “He wants any move the Fed makes to be a non-event.”The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up to 1,105.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 10,374.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent higher at 2,235.90.Shares in homebuilders fell as figures showed that sales of new homes in the US fell unexpectedly in January to the lowest levels on record.Only 309,000 new homes were sold in January, while inventories remain high.DR Horton fell 1.8 per cent to $12.34, Pulte Homes declined 1.5 per cent to $10.81 and Lennar Corp lost 0.1 per cent to $16.27.Shares in Citigroup were up 3 per cent to $3.45. The bank was reported to be in advanced talks to sell its fund-of-funds business to SkyBridge Capital, a New York-based alternative asset manager with about $4bn in assets.No agreement has yet been signed and the proposed sale price was not known.Shares in STEC dived 23.5 per cent to $10.27 as the flash memory drive maker said it expected to make a first-quarter adjusted loss of 11 cents to 13 cents per share. Analysts had expected on average a profit of 23 cents per share.Millipore Corp, a life sciences specialist, gained 5.5 per cent to $93.79 after the company said it was in the process of evaluating its strategic options, including a potential sale or merger.It was reported on Monday that rival Thermo Fisher Scientific had made an unsolicited bid for Millipore worth about $6bn.Arena Pharmaceuticals jumped 1.2 per cent to $3.19 on news that the Food and Drug Administration had accepted its application for lorcaserin, its experimental obesity drug.The company said it expected to find out in the following weeks when the FDA would make a final drug approval decision.Pfizer strengthened 0.8 per cent to $17.81 following the approval by the FDA of a new version of its Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal bacteria in children.Also, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that that any children who have not yet been vaccinated with Prevnar should be vaccinated with the new version.H&R Block, a leading tax return preparer, was one of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index.The shares lost 12.2 per cent to $17.32 after the company said it would fail to achieve its previous earnings forecasts.Rising unemployment had curtailed tax returns and more people were choosing to complete their own to save money, the company said. The stock’s target price was cut by S&P Equity from $23 to $19 and rated “hold”.Rival Jackson Hewitt Tax Service was also down 3.7 per cent to $2.36.Shares in BGC Partners, a broker focused on over-the-counter trading, gained 17.8 per cent to $5.03 after forecasting higher first-quarter earnings than analysts had expected.Tobacco group Altria gained 1.5 per cent to $20.26 on news that it had raised its regular quarterly dividend by 2.9 per cent.In the food and restaurant sector, Papa John‘s, a leading pizza maker, rose 7.2 per cent to $24.88, the most in two months, as the company posted fourth-quarter earnings that comfortably beat average analyst estimates.Rival Domino’s Pizza was also up by 2.4 per cent to $12.43, continuing its steady rise since the start of the year.Restaurant chain operator Darden Restaurants gained 0.9 per cent to $40.99 as the stock’s target price was raised by analysts at Credit Suisse from $37 to $44..

The ADP National Employment Report showed that employers in the private sector cut 254,000 jobs from payrolls in September after cutting a revised 277,000 jobs in August. Analysts expected a reduction of 200,000 jobs.Investors were nervously awaiting Friday’s report on the unemployment rate.The S&P 500 eventually closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,057.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 9,712.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.1 per cent to 2,122.42. But Wall Street still recorded its seventh straight monthly gain and has risen about 15 per cent over the last quarter. The Dow also notched up it biggest quarterly rise since the fourth quarter of 1998.“Watching today’s trading in equity markets reminds me of watching a marathon runner heading for a finish line with no energy left, aiming just to finish the race,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC markets. “With the third quarter ending today, it appears in some ways that equities are continuing to mark time before quarter end and the big data points due later this week.”Industrial stocks led the market lower throughout the day on fears about the pace of economic recovery. Alcoa dropped 1.4 per cent to $13.12 and United States Steel lost
2.6 per cent to $44.37.American Superconductor rose 10.5 per cent to $33.54 after the company said late on Tuesday that it had signed a contract with China’s Sinovel Wind to provide electrical components for use in wind turbines.Jabil Circuit, the electronics maker, posted better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, mainly due to cost cuts.The company has said it expects to cut about 4,500 jobs as part of a restructuring programme. Its shares gained 9.2 per cent to $13.41.Financial stocks also dragged the market lower. CIT Group fell 45 per cent to $1.21 after reports that the group was nearing a plan that would be likely to hand the commercial lender over to its bondholders.CIT, which specialises in lending to retailers and other middle-market companies, is said to be preparing an exchange offer that would eliminate up to
40 per cent of its more than $30bn in outstanding debt.Bank of America lost 1.4 per cent to $16.92 after announcing a deal to sell a long-term asset management business, which makes up its Columbia Management division, to Ameriprise Financial for about $1bn. Ameriprise rose 12.3 per cent to $36.33.However, Nike, the largest athletic shoemaker, helped lift the market from the opening bell.Late on Tuesday, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings after cost cuts offset declining revenues in key markets such as the US and China. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $64.70.Darden Restaurants, which owns the Red Lobster chain, also beat analyst estimates when it reported its first-quarter earnings. However, its shares fell 5.6 per cent to $34.13 after
the group’s forecast disappointed analysts.Saks fell 4.9 per cent to $6.82 after the luxury department store chain said it would offer as much as $100m in shares.In a regulatory filing posted late on Tuesday, the group said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt.Discovery Laboratories struck an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration over its experimental lung drug, sending the company’s shares

54;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2009-06-24T20:52:07Z;Wall St pares gains after Fed decision;;US stocks lost most of their early gains on Wednesday afternoon after investors reacted negatively to uncertainty at the Federal Reserve.Equities traded higher throughout the morning, but received a double blow in the afternoon.Representative Darrell Issa, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee accused Fed chairman Ben Bernanke of a “cover up” regarding disclosures over Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch last year.The Fed then released the results of its latest Open Market Committee, and a perceived lack of boldness in its inflation outlook led some investors to question whether Mr Bernanke’s position might be making the Fed cautious.“The statement really didn’t say anything,” said John Lekas, portfolio manager at Leader Capital. It was “less hawkish on inflation than it normally would have been” due to Bernanke’s position being called into question.The questions over the deal also made the position of Ken Lewis, Bank of America’s chief executive, vulnerable, and the bank’s shares dropped 2.5 per cent in the afternoon. It managed to hold on to some of the morning’s impressive gains though, closing 1 per cent up at $12.35.There remained some support for stocks from Oracle’s profits and positive economic data.The software maker earlier reported sales and profits that topped Wall Street estimates and its shares gained 7 per cent to $21.26.Other technology companies also felt the benefit and Microsoft rose 0.6 per cent to $23.47.On a busy day for economic data, the markets were reassured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which upgraded its forecasts for US growth for 2009 and 2010.Stocks were given added impetus by figures showing that durable goods orders unexpectedly rose in May.Lower demand for cars had been expected to drag the number down and the figures helped Fordclimb 1.8 per cent to $5.63.Meanwhile, materials producers and industrial companies performed well.Metals stocks continued Tuesday’s recovery following a sharp sell-off on Monday, boosted by the durable goods numbers and higher commodity prices.Alcoa, which produces aluminium, rose 2.1 per cent to $10.21 while Free-port McMoRan, the copper miner, which was upgraded by Friedman Billings Ramsey, picked up 3.4 per cent to $48.80.The materials sector was initially given an extra boost by results from Monsanto, the agricultural group, which beat estimates with its quarterly earnings.But the shares fell 4 per cent to $76.16 after the group said gross profit from its Roundup herbicide could fall 50 per cent on increased competition.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent to 900.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 1.6 per cent higher at 1,792.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent, however, to 8,299.86. The morning’s gains had come despite figures showing the number of new home sales unexpectedly fell in May.“The fact that the market completely shrugged off the new home sales data had me stunned,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.Financial stocks were higher after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week as interest rates dropped.They then continued to climb in spite of suffering a brief dip on the new home sales data.Wells Fargo ended 1.1 higher at $23.17. Citigroupalso advanced, helped by the news that it intends to increase employees’ base salaries in 2009 as part of an effort to retain top talent. Its shares climbed 1 per cent to $3.04.Meanwhile, Darden Restaurants, which owns US mid-market chains, including Olive Garden, also beat earnings estimates but the shares fell as it warned 2010 would be worse than hoped. The stock lost 3.2 per cent to $31.94.There was more bad news from supermarket operator SuperValu, which warned lower customer spending would mean substantially lower quarterly profits than expected. The shares fell 12 per cent to $13.81.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7,642.6 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,486.16.Banks were the biggest risers, having also been boosted by reports from Bloomberg that the Treasury was ready to expand the term asset-backed relief program (Talf) also to help clear balance sheets. The troubled Citigroup lifted 22.7 per cent to $3.08.Bank of America, whose chief executive, Ken Lewis, earlier said would be able to repay $45bn in government money from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), picked up 17.2 per cent to $7.35.Fifth Third gained after it declared a dividend of $0.01 a share, helping to push its stock up 13.9 per cent to $2.22.Insurers also felt the benefit of the Fed’s boldness, with Metlife rising 25.8 per cent to 25.17 and Prudential gaining 19 per cent to $24.02.Morgan Stanley fell, however, after JPMorgan, as part of its new coverage of the company, said that it would need more capital. It dropped 0.6 per cent to $23.68.“The Fed needed to act with buying these assets and injecting money into the banks by printing money to capitalise the banks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But others were more sceptical about the effectiveness of the Fed’s plan. Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group, said it could actually be bad news for stocks. “I don’t think that many people would view that as a good thing, especially when China has said it is already concerned about US debt. There could be some serious consequences if we were to anger China.”The technology sector continued its recent good performance after it emerged IBM was in advanced talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for $10 per share, more than double Tuesday’s closing price. The news sent shares in Sun soaring 77.5 per cent to $8.82 while IBM slipped 2 per cent to $91.01.“The recent buying of tech stocks shows we have hit the bottom. You wouldn’t buy growth stocks if you didn’t think the economy was going to recover,” said Mr Pado.The Fed’s move came despite data released on Wednesday morning showing consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Corporate earnings from General Mills, the food producer which makes Cheerios, came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 11.4 per cent to $47.55.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 18.6 per cent to $35.47.Gains in industrial stocks were limited after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 1.7 per cent to $37.57, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, gained 1.9 per cent to $27.33.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, rose 5 per cent to $35.22. The shares had suffered earlier after JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per share.Energy stocks put a moderate drag on the market’s gains, rising only slightly after oil prices came off their recent lows. Chevron picked up 1.6 per cent to $66.36 and Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $69.16. The shares were hit in part by profit taking, with the sector having gained more than10 per cent between the beginning of last week and the end of Tuesday.
56;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2009-03-18T13:03:11Z;Wall St anxious before Fed decision;;Reports of a possible major acquisition were not able to tempt US investors out of their caution on Wednesday morning as equities markets waited for details from the Federal Reserve on what action would be taken on asset purchase schemes.IBM was reported in the Wall Street Journal as being in talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for at least $6.5bn, nearly 100 per cent above its market capitalisation at the end of Tuesday’s trading. The news sent shares in Sun up 66 per cent to $8.25 while IBM slipped 3.1 per cent to $89.99 before the bell. The companies refused to comment.The increased activity in the tech sector helped futures for the Nasdaq Composite index outperform those for the benchmark S&P 500 index or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Less than an hour before the opening bell, futures for the Nasdaq were 3 points down at 1,187.2, while those for the S&P were 5.8 points lower at 769.5 while the Dow Jones lost 68 points to 7,286. On a fair value basis, however, which takes into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract, both the S&P and Nasdaq were higher.Hopes for “quantitative easing” from the Federal Reserve were fading on Wednesday, but investors were still waiting to hear if it might buy long-term Treasury bills in an effort to stimulate the economy.Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Such a step may act to further soothe credit markets already calmed somewhat by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who mixed upbeat comments about the economy over the long-term with an understanding of what is needed to get from here to there in comments during a rare interview with CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ on Sunday.”The Fed may be less anxious to get into such asset purchase schemes after data released on Wednesday morning showed consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Mortgage applications were also higher, adding to the confidence given to financial and homebuilder stocks on Monday by data showing more new houses were started in February than had been predicted.Corporate earnings from General Mills on Wednesday came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 3.5 per cent to $51.81 in pre-market trade.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 10.4 per cent to $33.00 before the bell.Industrial stocks looked set for falls after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, fell 0.8 per cent before the open to $36.64, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, fell 1.8 per cent to $26.35.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, fell 1.8 per cent to $32.95 on the news from China. The company was also hit when JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per cent.Bad news from China also weighed on Coca-Cola before the bell, as the company said it was “disappointed” by the Chinese government’s rejection of a $2.3bn bid for China Huiyuan Juice Group. Its shares lost 1.1 per cent to $41.01.European stocks were down slightly ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.4 per cent lower at 712.96. Asian equity markets rallied for a fifth day, with the Nikkei 225 closing 0.3 per cent higher at 7,972.17.Bond yields were flat ahead of the Fed’s announcement. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 2 basis points to 1.013 per cent, while that on a 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 3.007 per cent.The dollar was higher against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.39.Gold was trading $1.09 lower at $905.45 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices were $0.49 at $48.67 a barrel.
57;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2008-06-25T20:47:02Z;Strong gains for S&P as Fed holds rates;;US stocks rose the most in two weeks on Wednesday, as a rally in financials and falling oil prices cheered investors while the Federal Reserve did nothing to spook markets, keeping interest rates on hold in a widely expected decision.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,321.97 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat at 11,811.83. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.4 per cent to 2,401.26.The day began on a strong note. Darden Restaurants, the operator behind the Olive Garden restaurant chain, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations and also increased its dividend 11 per cent.Those results and a $2 drop in oil prices helped consumer discretionary stocks advance 1.5 per cent. Darden rose 7.1 per cent to $33.83 while Macy’s and Family Dollar Storesadded 3.4 per cent to $20.06 and 3.9 per cent to $19.90 respectively.Meanwhile, Dean Foods, the dairy processor, said second-quarter earnings would be higher than forecast thanks to the strength in its milk business. Dean Foods rose 9.4 per cent to $20.12, helping the consumer staples sector to a 1.2 per cent gain.Still, analysts warned that shares in consumer-facing companies were likely to struggle as the second-quarter earnings season gets under way.Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at Citigroup, said: “We believe there could be another round of downward earnings per share revisions in the near-term, as Street consensus does not appear to fully reflect an appropriate outlook on consumer spending amid current macro headwinds.”Equity markets held onto their gains after the Fed kept a key interest rate on hold at 2 per cent and noted increasing risks of inflation.Matt King, chief investment strategist for Bell Investment Advisors, said: “The market didn’t have much of a reaction as it was all pretty much as expected…The Fed has been preparing the market for interest rate hikes but I will believe it when I see it.”On Tuesday, stocks fell after a report showed slumping consumer confidence and a profit warning from industrial bellwether UPS. Financials had rallied despite that data and they continued to gain on Wednesday, rising as much as 3.4 per cent as investors bought back into heavily sold regional banking stocks before falling back to close up 0.4 per cent.Zions Bancorp was among the biggest gainers, adding 5.3 per cent to $32.64 after the Salt Lake City-based lender said it would not cut its dividend or raise dilutive capital. The bank added that credit quality for loans in California had “begun to stabilise”.Mastercard also made ground after it agreed to pay up to $1.8bn to settle claims that it blocked banks from issuing American Express cards. Mastercard added 3.4 per cent to $289.79 but American Express fell 2.8 per cent to $40.94 after commenting that credit indicators were deteriorating faster than expected.The technology sector received a boost from analyst upgrades and the pull-back in oil. Overnight, forecasts from Jabil Circuit topped estimates and the outlook prompted analysts at Merrill Lynch to advise buying shares in the mobile phone maker.Jabil Circuit led the gainers, jumping 15.6 per cent to $16.57 and it was followed higher by Advanced Micro Devices and Symantec which added 3 per cent to $6.43 and 2.6 per cent to $19.98 respectively.In other earnings news, Monsanto beat estimates as farmers spent more on fertiliser to take advantage of record prices for agricultural commodities. Monsanto also raised its full-year earnings guidance, but the shares, which have doubled in the past year, fell 3 per cent to $131.52.In the background, housing data showing that sales of new homes fell 2.5 per cent in May were largely offset by news that Congress was on the verge of approving legislation to overhaul mortgage financing and potentially rescue hundreds of thousands of homeowners from foreclosure. Homebuilders rose 0.2 per cent.By the close, eight of the 10 major industry groups on the S&P 500 were in the black. Only energy and industrial stocks were down, falling 0.5 per cent each after oil lost ground and Goldman Sachs recommended selling shares in Boeing arguing that a slowing economy would dent orders.Boeing slumped 6.9 per cent to $69.64 dragging aerospace stocks down 3.1 per cent.
58;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2008-06-24T21:29:15Z;US stocks hit lowest level in three months;;US stocks hit their lowest level in three months on Tuesday as investors weighed a handful of mixed earnings reports, a rally in financials and new data showing the continuation of a slump in house prices and consumer confidence.The day began in downbeat fashion after UPS, the world’s largest shipping carrier, cut its earnings expectations for the second quarter, blaming slowing US growth and higher fuel costs. UPS is often seen as an industrial bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the broader economy.Last week, rival FedExsimilarly disappointed markets when it posted an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss. Together, these results will heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.UPS lost 6 per cent to $62.26 while FedEx slipped 0.2 per cent to $79.98, helping to drag the industrials sector down 1.3 per cent.Markets took another downward leg after the release of data showing a further record decline in house prices and tumbling consumer confidence.Estimate-beating first-quarter results and full-year forecasts from food retailer Kroger helped offset some of that bad news, boosting the consumer staples sector and broader equity indices – but only for a time.Kroger added 7 per cent to $27.82 and was followed higher by Safeway and Supervalu which climbed 2.6 per cent to $29.65 and 3 per cent to $31.35 respectively. The consumer staples sector rose 0.2 per cent as a whole.The benchmark S&P 500 wavered between gains and losses but eventually closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,314.29 points – its lowest level since mid-March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 11,807.43 while the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.7 per cent to 2,368.28.Analysts had expected trading to be subdued ahead of Wednesday’s decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve but the main indices have instead been notably choppy so far this week.In spite of the volatility, some observers found reason for optimism. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said recent market weakness could be a prelude to a recovery in the second half as the lagged impact of Fed easing, the fiscal stimulus and attractive valuations took effect.“We are in the middle of a healthy seasonal correction but if we retest the mid-March lows and bounce back we will have set up a nice triple bottom . . . and I think we could see record highs for equity markets in the next six to 12 months.”In the background, financials provided a rare fillip to market sentiment, shrugging off another round of analyst downgrades to climb 2.5 per cent after retesting five-year lows.The most heavily sold banks and brokerages were among the biggest gainers. SunTrust Bank advanced 4.1 per cent to $37.40, Lehman Brothers rose 6.8 per cent to $24.35 and Wells Fargo climbed 3.9 per cent to $25.20. Wachovia also made ground, rising 5.6 per cent to $17.86 after it said it had hired Goldman Sachs to assess its loan portfolio.Even the consumer discretionary sector, initially hit hard by the latest data, just about held its own. Eastman Kodak led the way, soaring 13.7 per cent to $14.03 after the photography company said its board had authorised a $1bn share repurchase. Over the past year, however, Eastman shares have lost about half of their value.Starbucks and Darden Restaurants were also among the gainers, adding 1.7 per cent to $16.57 and 3.1 per cent to $31.60 respectively.Homebuilders proved im­pervious to the housing statistics, rallying after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the sector with an outperform rating on Centex, DR Horton and others. Centex and DR Horton advanced 7.5 per cent to $15.15 and 7.3 per cent to $12.62 respectively.But inflation worries have become increasingly acute in recent weeks, a trend that looks set to continue as producers pass on higher input costs.Dow Chemical said it would raise prices by up to 25 per cent and institute freight surcharges to combat high energy prices. The price rises are the second in a month. Dow fell 2.8 per cent to $36.58 while the material sector was the worst performer in the S&P 500, losing 2.5 per cent – its biggest one day loss since the start of the month.
59;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
60;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2008-06-06T20:47:48Z;Jump in jobless rate pummels Wall Street;;Wall street stocks fell the most since February on Friday after oil prices spiked and the unemployment rate jumped by the most in 22 years in May, reviving fears that the economy is heading for a recession.The US shed jobs for a fifth straight month in May - although fewer than than expected - but the jobless rate increased from 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent - the biggest monthly jump since February 1986.The employment data are of particular significance. Personal savings are almost exhausted in the US and credit availability is much reduced, with the result that consumers – and the broader economy – are more dependent than ever on their pay cheques.Leo Kamp, chief economist at financial services company TIAA-CREF, said: “Equity markets had a big adverse reaction to the jump in the unemployment rate as it pointed to continued recessionary-like conditions in the US economy.“Moreover, we also saw a jump in the oil price and all of that weighed heavily on markets as people fled from riskier assets like stocks and bought into Treasuries.”The jobs data, rocketing oil prices and more bad news from financials dragged all 10 leading industry groups on the S&P 500 into the red. The financials suffered their biggest one day fall since November 2007 while industrial and consumer discretionary sectors lost 3.7 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at 1,3605.69, down 3.1 per cent on Friday and 2.1 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 3.1 per cent on Friday to 12,209.81 - its biggest one day fall since February 2007. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3 per cent to 2,474.56.US equity markets had an uneven run during the week. The rebounded sharply on Thursday but for the most part were depressed by nagging concerns about the credit and housing crises and uncertainty over the outlook for inflation and interest rates.In the early part of the week trading was dominated by the woes of Lehman Brothers, as analysts speculated about large second-quarter losses, possible capital raisings and drew veiled parallels with the fortunes of Bear Stearns.Shares in Lehman, which have lost about 55 per cent of their value in the past year, fell 8.9 per cent to $32.29 over the week.On Wednesday, Moody’s said it might downgrade the credit ratings of the two largest bond insurers. A day later S&P did just that. Ambac and MBIA fell 22.7 per cent to $2.35 and 20.3 per cent to $5.44 respectively over the week.The negative momentum accelerated on Friday after reports that the SEC was investigating insurer AIG, while concerns about rising mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures also hurt the broader sector.AIG fell 6.8 per cent to $33.93, while Washington Mutual fell 12.5 per cent to $7.53 on Friday. The financial sector as a whole slumped 5 per cent on Friday and gave up 5.2 per cent over the week. The KBW banking index hit new five-year lowsIn the background, gyrations in oil and commodity prices caused energy and material stocks to swing between gains and losses during the week.Oil’s rise to record highs on Friday pushed both sectors to slender losses for the week however, as concerns that high prices would curtial demand weighed against hopes for higher future profits.Exxon Mobil lost 2.2 per cent to $86.79 and while Chevron added 0.4 per cent respectively to $99.50 over the week.Monsanto added 6.6 per cent to $135.76 while US Steel rose 4.4 per cent to $180.27 over the week.Those moves hit consumer-facing companies, swamping the results of a rally on Thursday, sparked by better-than-expected May retail sales data.“The consumer is 70 per cent of the economy,” Mr Kamp said, “and with the consumer weak that doesn’t bode very well for earnings growth or for equity markets.”On Friday, Darden Restaurants declined 5 per cent to $32.16, JC Penney dropped 4.9 per cent to $38.57 and Office Depot slid 7.2 per cent to $12.08.In industrials, United Technologies and General Electric fell 4.2 per cent to $67.01 and 3.4 per cent to $30.02.
61;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2006-09-25T12:37:53Z;Wall St lower on further evidence of slowdown;;Wall Street finished the week lower on Friday, as investor relief over the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged was countered by fresh evidence of slowing economic growth.Large-cap technology stocks made some of the most dramatic moves during the week. Yahoo slumped 13 per cent over the five days to $25.52, wiping out the previous eight weeks of gains. The company said third-quarter results would be at the bottom end of their previously forecast range due to slowing advertising revenue.Oracle provided a counterweight to Yahoo’s slump, climbing 7.4 per cent to $17.54. On Wednesday, the software maker reported a 29 per cent increase in first quarter profits, as its chief executive said the company was gaining market share from German rival SAP.Hewlett-Packard shed 3 per cent to $35.11 over the week as its controversial investigation into boardroom leaks to the media began to unnerve investors. News reports said that chief executive Mark Hurd may have had a greater role in the investigation than had previously been thought.Microsoft dipped 0.7 per cent to $26.66. However, the stock has now gained 25 per cent since the middle of June and is back in positive territory for the year.Media group Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times, surged 9.8 per cent to $33.99, its best week in more than two years, after it appointed a special committee to oversee a business review that might lead to a sale of some assets or a leveraged buyout of the group.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent for the week at 1,314.78, a loss on the day of 0.3 per cent, or 3.25 points. On Wednesday, the index briefly hit its highest level in more than five years. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower on the week, losing 0.8 per cent, or 18.82 points, on the day to 2,218.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week down 0.5 per cent, a loss of 0.2 per cent, or 25.13 points, on the day at 11,508.10.Stocks made a brief rally on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent. However, on Thursday the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index fell sharply, increasing investor unease that economic growth was slowing faster than had been thought.“The run-up to this point has been driven by an expectation that the Fed will stop raising rates and get the cooling in the economy they’re looking for,” said Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck.“The price you’re paying for that is uncertainty about how much softening there will be in the economy. A soft landing is something that the Fed cannot engineer. It’s out of their hands.”Fears of a slowdown in manufacturing affected Caterpillar, which sank 4.1 per cent to $62.77 – the week’s worst performance in the Dow. United Technologies, also suffered, losing 3.6 per cent to $62.30.General Motors tumbled 3.3 per cent to $30.62 on reports that talks on a possible alliance with Nissan and Renault had made little progress.Symbol Technologies, a maker of barcode scanners and mobile computers, surged 15.2 per cent to $14.64 after Motorola agreed to buy the company for $3.9bn.Darden Restaurants leapt 9.3 per cent to $42.38 after its first quarter profits beat analyst estimates and it raised earnings guidance for 2006 on bullish forecasts for revenue from its Olive Garden chain of Italian-themed restaurants.Home improvement retailer Home Depot suffered from the slowing housing market, sinking 3.4 per cent to $35.96. The stock has fallen 11 per cent since the beginning of the year.Medical device maker Boston Scientific reported preliminary sales and earnings figures for the third quarter that came in below analyst estimates. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock from “overweight” to “underweight”, and the shares tumbled 8.5 per cent to $14.85.First Data, provider of electronic payment systems, sank 9.3 per cent to $40.49. Early in the week, its Western Union subsidiary – which the company plans to spin off – said income growth would be sluggish in coming years, as immigrants who use the service to send money to relatives grow concerned about government scrutiny of wire transfers.
62;DRI;Darden Restaurants;2006-09-21T14:49:29Z;Wall Street led higher by Oracle;;US stocks closed higher on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged and strong earnings from Oracle buoyed sentiment.Software maker Oracle reported a 29 per cent rise in its first quarter profits, as the company’s chief executive claimed it was gaining market share from rival SAP. Its shares surged 11.2 per cent to a five-year high point of $17.93.Morgan Stanley rose 0.7 per cent to $72.35 after it reported a better-than-expected 59 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings. The results helped lift other investment banks. Legg Mason added 3.3 per cent to $100.22, and Bear Stearns gained 3.2 per cent to $139.50.Darden Restaurants pushed up 6.8 per cent to $41.50 after it reported that first-quarter earnings rose 3.5 per cent and raised its earnings guidance for 2006, based on bullish forecasts for revenue at its Olive Garden restaurant chain. It was the biggest daily gain for the shares since December.NCR rose 5.3 per cent to $38.14, after it announced its data analysis unit Teradata had won a contract to support logistics centres for the US Navy.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent, or 6.86 points, at 1,325.17, at one point in the day reaching its highest level since February 2001.The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4 per cent, or 30.52 points, at 2,252.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent, or 72.28 points, to 11,613.19 – within 110 points of its historic high point.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee on Wednesday decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 5.25 per cent“The moderation in economic growth appears to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market,” said the Federal Reserve, adding that inflation pressures seemed “likely to moderate over time”.The major indices pulled slightly off their highs immediately following the Fed’s decision.“They remain committed to inflation control as job number one,” said Stuart Schweitzer, Global Markets Strategist for JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.
