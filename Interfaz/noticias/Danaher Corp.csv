0;DHR;Danaher Corp;2019-02-25T15:20:23Z;General Electric agrees sale of life sciences unit in $21bn deal;Chief says more assets to be sold as break-up of industrial conglomerate continues;General Electric’s new chief executive took his biggest step towards breaking up the storied conglomerate by agreeing a $21bn all-cash deal to sell most of its life sciences business and signalling more disposals were in the pipeline.Larry Culp, the former Danaher chief executive who took over at GE in October, sold the biopharma business to his former company at a price exceeding earlier estimates, sending GE shares sharply higher as investors bet he would be better able to manage the company’s imposing debt load.In an interview, Mr Culp said securing a high price for the biopharma unit, which provides tools for medical research and the development of advanced therapies, would enable GE to be more patient in selling off other businesses.“The dynamic changes a little bit,” he told the Financial Times. “Formerly, it looked as if we were a little bit desperate. Today, it’s that we’re on a much better footing.”Mr Culp also indicated that the planned initial public offering of GE’s healthcare business would not happen this year, and might be abandoned altogether.“We have no less urgency today, but we do have a little bit more flexibility,” Mr Culp said. “And the dynamics change in favour of the GE shareholder.”Mr Culp took over as chief executive after the short, 15-month tenure of John Flannery, vowing to more quickly overhaul the struggling industrial giant. Last year GE announced a plan to focus on just two sectors, aviation and the power industry, and had been working towards spinning off its healthcare division, which includes life sciences.In addition to Monday’s announced sale to Danaher, Mr Culp last month settled a longstanding US Department of Justice investigation into GE’s role in the 2008 financial crisis, convincing many investors he would be more decisive than his predecessors in drawing a line under one of the darkest periods in the company’s storied history.Shares in GE are up more than two-thirds since hitting decade-long lows in December, and they jumped another 15 per cent on Monday morning after the deal was announced. Shares later pared some of their gains and were up 9 per cent in afternoon trading.GE’s biopharma business has annual revenues of about $3bn, about two-thirds of the total sales of the life sciences operations.The total value of the sale to Danaher was $21.4bn, with $21bn of that in cash. That price, equivalent to seven times annual revenues, shows the high level of interest in medical technology businesses. Analysts had suggested that the entire life sciences operation could be worth $20bn to $25bn.Rene Lipsch, the lead analyst on GE at Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said proceeds from the sale would be more than enough both to cover $14bn in debt repayments that it expected over the next two years, and to contribute $4bn of equity to GE Capital, its financial services business.At the same time, Mr Lipsch added, GE now looked likely to retain access to the earnings and cash flows of the remaining healthcare businesses for longer than expected if it had gone ahead with the IPO this year.GE will retain its other main life sciences business, pharmaceutical diagnostics, which it sees as a better fit with its medical equipment such as scanners.Mr Culp said last month the company was aiming to raise more than $30bn from selling stakes in the healthcare division, in the oilfield services group Baker Hughes and in the transport equipment company Wabtec. The Danaher deal alone takes GE two-thirds of the way to that target.Mr Culp has set a goal of reducing GE’s net debt, excluding its financial services operations and its pension fund deficit, to 2.5 times its industrial earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Mr Culp said the planned IPO of the remaining healthcare operations, which have annual revenues of about $17bn, was no longer scheduled for this year, and might not happen at all. “The path that we were on to a second half IPO is one that we will not be on,” he said. “Could it happen? Sure. Is it the only option on the table? No.”The company’s market valuation has more than halved over the past two years, as investors and analysts have fretted about its high debt levels and legacy insurance liabilities from operations the group exited in the mid-2000s. Analysts at Moody’s said late last week that the asset sales would help GE contend with “the possible need to further increase GE Capital’s statutory insurance reserves for long-term care policies”.Mr Culp said GE was “making progress” on tackling its operational problems, which have included years of big losses in the division that makes gas turbines and other equipment for the power industry. He said the company would give more details on its view of the outlook for 2019 on a call scheduled for March 14.GE will also this week publish its annual report and 10-K filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Mr Culp said would show improvements in how the company presented its financial information.“It’s better, simpler, clearer,” he said. “It’s by no means perfect, but hopefully it’s responding to some of the concerns indicated by shareholders.”Danaher said it would finance its acquisition through a new $3bn stock issuance, as well as cash on its balance sheet, new debt and credit facilities. The two companies expect to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. PJT, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs offered financial advice to GE, while law firm Paul Weiss provided legal counsel. Barclays and Kirkland & Ellis advised Danaher.
1;DHR;Danaher Corp;2018-06-26T18:44:02Z;Breaking up is easy to do. For GE, now comes the hard part;John Flannery’s focus shifts to improving the performance of the remaining businesses;Among the stack of announcements made by General Electric on Tuesday, perhaps the most telling was the appointment of Larry Culp as the group’s new lead independent director.It was a signal of the company’s priorities now: after a Herculean effort to pare down its portfolio, GE now wants to concentrate on getting its operational performance right.As John Flannery, GE’s chief executive, put it on a call with analysts, “his experience fits extremely well with the changes we’re making at the company”.Mr Culp was for 14 years the chief executive of Danaher, the US industrial conglomerate, where he was spectacularly successful.Under his leadership the company spent almost $25bn on acquisitions, and applied his management techniques to improve performance. The Danaher Business System, as it is known, was first developed in the mid-1980s but showed its most impressive results under Mr Culp. Since the start of 2000, Danaher’s shares have risen more than tenfold, while GE’s have dropped by about 70 per cent.Mr Culp is perhaps the closest parallel in the 21st century to Jack Welch, the widely admired chief executive of GE between 1981 and 2001, who used acquisitions to build the group into the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.At GE, however, his task will be to oversee Mr Flannery’s efforts — not in another acquisition spree, but in improving the performance of the remaining fragments of the sprawling group that Mr Welch put together.For most of the 17 years since Mr Welch stepped down, the task of GE chief executives has been to dismantle the structures built by their predecessors. Jeff Immelt, who held the post from 2001 to last year, sold businesses including plastics, insurance and entertainment, culminating in the 2015 decision to sell almost all of the financial services operations that had at one time provided more than half the group’s profit.But Mr Immelt also chose to build up some divisions: paying $9.5bn for the UK’s Amersham in 2004 to develop the healthcare business, spending $10bn on the energy operations of Alstom in 2015, and making bolt-on acquisitions in oilfield services that ended with the merger with Baker Hughes last year.The dealmaking was great for GE’s advisers. Banks that worked with GE on its deals, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley, earned hundreds of millions of dollars for their advice since 2000, data from Thomson Reuters showed. Coupled with the work Wall Street offered underwriting debt, equity and loans for the group, GE proved a critical client. Since the turn of the century, it has paid more than $6bn in fees, according to the data provider.For GE shareholders, however, the results have been less impressive and Mr Flannery’s decisions reflect that. He has decided to spin off the healthcare division and offload GE’s 62.5 per cent stake in Baker Hughes, and has ordered 12,000 job cuts at the power equipment division that includes the old Alstom businesses.The company’s problems have in part been caused by strategic mis-steps. Mr Immelt chose to build up the oilfield services operations shortly before the price of crude went into a protracted downturn. The Alstom deal strengthened GE in coal-fired and gas-fired power just as plunging costs made renewable energy a genuine threat.But GE has also suffered from poor execution. The power division miscalculated the strength of the market, leading to a 45 per cent slump in profits last year.Part of the problem, Mr Flannery has argued, has been that GE was simply too large and too complex for any management team to control properly. He has been pushing decision-making authority down to the divisions, and cutting the role and cost of the group’s central functions.“We are fundamentally inverting the company to make the business units the centre of gravity,” he told analysts on Tuesday.The new company will be much more focused, on aero-engines and other aircraft parts, equipment for the power industry and renewable energy, particularly wind. But Mr Flannery now must prove that what he is calling “a strong, exciting and growing GE built on operational execution and robust industrial logic” will actually demonstrate improved performance.The cash being raised from sales of assets and businesses will strengthen GE’s balance sheet and cut its debts. While analysts at credit rating agency S&P Global warned they expected to downgrade the company’s debt, those at Moody’s took a more sanguine view.“There was urgency for GE to achieve substantial improvements in financial condition, in particular to generate the amount of cash flow expected for an enterprise of its breadth,” Moody’s said.Slimming down the group will create problems of its own, however. Joe Ritchie, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, warned the sale of the healthcare unit would “remove one of the most stable earnings streams” within the company’s portfolio of companies.The initial market reaction to GE’s plans was laudatory. By noon in New York the shares were up 7.5 per cent at $13.71. But the sale of GE’s financial services operations was also acclaimed by analysts when Mr Immelt announced it in 2015. Making a success of Mr Flannery’s strategy will mean delivering the operational improvements he wants to see in the long term.

Siemens is marketing its Healthineers medical technology unit to investors as a growth business “well prepared to take advantage of paradigm shifts”. The small print details the side-effects.Revenue growth in recent years has averaged a hardly scintillating 3 per cent, around the same as global GDP. At a jargon-laden capital markets day on Tuesday, it offered a similar prognosis: 3-4 per cent sales growth in 2018. The German conglomerate plans to float the unit in Frankfurt by end-June. Analysts value it at €30bn-€40bn.The in vitro diagnostics part of the business is at a key stage. Siemens spent heavily to build it up, but it has lost market share. Much rests on a new system, Atellica, but the lab equipment is only being rolled out now; the real money will be made from 2020 on sales of consumables and services.Beyond that, Healthineers needs to bulk up in the newer frontier of molecular diagnostics. This is likely be expensive. US rival Danaher paid 44 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for Cepheid in 2016. Siemens will endow Healthineers with an improved capital structure when it separates, giving it more capability for acquisitions.Keeping the patient hydrated in the meantime is the imaging business: number one worldwide with a large installed base of scanners and X-ray machines and fat margins from services. This will underpin profits and a proposed payout ratio of 50-60 per cent of net income. But the market for such big-ticket items is slower growing, while competition from revitalised rivals and Chinese entrants may erode margins. Promised cost savings of €240m a year may help offset that.Healthineers covets multiples commanded by medical technology groups such as Danaher at 18 times enterprise value to ebitda. That would be within reach at the top of the range for the Siemens offshoot. But it needs to achieve a paradigm shift of its own to justify such an upgrade.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

3;DHR;Danaher Corp;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Danaher strikes $4bn deal for Cepheid;;US healthcare and industrial group Danaher has struck a $4bn deal to acquire US global molecular diagnostics group Cepheid.Danaher will acquire all of Cepheid’s outstanding shares, paying $53 apiece.The deal gives Cepheid an enterprise value of $4bn, including debt.The company “develops, manufactures, and markets accurate and easy to use molecular systems and tests”.Molecular diagnostics involves analysing genes to detect risks of disease.Danaher’s President and chief executive, Thomas Joyce, said:We expect Cepheid to be an excellent complement to our existing Diagnostics businesses and to expand our runway for growth across the platform. Cepheid’s extensive installed base, test menu and innovative product offering contribute to its market leadership in molecular diagnostics and we expect it to strengthen our position in this high-growth segment.Cepheid, which is based in Sunnyvale, California racked up revenues of $539m in 2015, “with double-digit year-on-year organic revenue growth”.The deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, while the Cepheid board has “unanimously recommended that Cepheid shareholders approve the transaction”.
4;DHR;Danaher Corp;2015-05-13T16:57:33Z;Danaher: filtered out;Industrial conglomerates can succeed without attaching a bank;It just so happens that a successful conglomerate does not have to have a rollicking bank on the side (looking at you, General Electric) to drive spectacular returns. It is excusable not to have heard of industrial group Danaher until Tuesday, when it spent $14bn in cash to buy filtration company Pall Corporation. There is no Danaher brand per se. Rather it is a collection of the $44bn of businesses it has bought since 2000 in a handful of industries — from environmental and water equipment to laboratory test kit and dental products. That sounds plain, but over the past decade Danaher’s total shareholder return has been 203 per cent.Its secret sauce is something called the Danaher Business System, which sounds like the usual vacuous corporate-speak. But the method has produced returns, allowing Danaher to wring cost savings out of businesses that are not growing quickly. Between 2012 and its forecast for 2015, annual organic revenue growth will average about 3 per cent. But earnings per share will have jumped about 10 per cent each year.The Pall deal is in some ways a departure for Danaher. Like much of Danaher’s business, Pall makes money from “consumables” — filtration products that are used and then reordered, creating a steady income. But the Pall deal is big compared to previous buyouts, which have been in the $1bn to $6bn range. Pall is also expensive at 21 times cash flow.Still, Danaher shares rose a few percentage points on news of the deal. That may be because of another announcement the company made. Danaher will ditch its conglomerate status by separating into two listed companies. One will be a life sciences company with $16bn in revenue (including Pall), the other will house the remaining industrial businesses. Life science companies trade at higher valuations. It seems that even the best conglomerates can sometimes struggle to get the credit they crave.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
5;DHR;Danaher Corp;2015-05-13T16:46:22Z;Danaher to buy Pall in $13.8bn cash deal;US industrial and healthcare equipment company to snap up maker of water filtration systems;Danaher, a US industrial and healthcare equipment company, is to acquire Pall, a maker of water-filtration systems, in a $13.8bn all-cash deal.Announcing the merger on Tuesday, Danaher also said it would split itself into a science and technology company, including Pall, and an industrial company before the end of next year.The science and technology arm, which will retain the Danaher name, will add Pall to Danaher’s dental, life sciences and water quality businesses, which combined had revenues of about $16.5bn last year, the company said.The businesses being spun into the new industrial company, which takes the name NewCo, had revenues of about $6bn last year.The price of $127.20 a share represents a 28 per cent premium to Pall’s closing price on Monday, before the Wall Street Journal reported Pall may sell itself.Ryan Mendy, chief operating officer of The Edge Consulting Group, a corporate research company, said investors should welcome the deal because Danaher had “basically cleaned up its business”.“Danaher had a handful of unrelated businesses with absolutely no synergies whatsoever,” he said.Shares in Danaher — with a market capitalisation of about $62bn — rose 2 per cent on Wednesday. Pall’s share price climbed 5 per cent to $124.25.Acquiring Pall would “likely please” Danaher’s investors because it would complement Danaher’s water quality unit, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note last week.Industrial conglomerates can succeed without attaching a bankContinue readingPall is the largest “pure-play fluid filtration asset” in the public arena and has a scarcity value as one of the few leading bioprocessing properties in a rapidly consolidating space, they wrote.For the fiscal year that ended in July 2014, Pall generated revenues of $2.8bn.Pall’s “best in class technology” makes it the “premier brand in the filtration industry”, Thomas Joyce, Danaher’s chief executive, said.The deal “strengthens our life sciences position in the strategically attractive, high-growth biopharmaceutical market.”*This article has been amended to clarify Mr Mendy’s title.
6;DHR;Danaher Corp;2015-03-11T12:47:38Z;Real Domino effect will be higher investment in digital printing;Brother pays premium to discourage bidding war;Domino Printing Sciences appears to be reaching its own “sell-by” date as a listed company.In the City, the group has been so low-key it makes Rexam seem positively flamboyant. But just as the drinks can group attracted attention from halfway around the world with a bid of £4.3bn from US rival Ball, so the printing group has been identified as desirable by Japanese group Brother, which is prepared to pay £1bn in cash to snap up its digital, barcode and expiry date expertise.Unsurprisingly, the Domino board is recommending the offer of 915p a share, which comes with the bonus of the 14.76p-a-share final dividend. A scheme of arrangement to win shareholder approval shortens the timescale for any other interested party to make an alternative offer.Yet Brother is paying the sort of premium that would discourage others from joining in even if the process lasted a year and a day. Though Domino’s shares closed well above the offer price at 941p, that offer is still 27 per cent above Tuesday’s close.In multiple terms it is also generous, valuing the group on a forward p/e of about 24 times. Analysts at Barclays say that in 2004 UK printing group Lynx was bought by Danaher for a price equivalent to a p/e of 20 times. And that was after the US group had won a bidding war against ITW.Although Brother and its putative new division both have the word “printers” in their business models, they are in such different parts of the market that the Japanese group is not even talking vaguely about cost synergies. It is simply a move to buy some growth.Investment bankers hope the deal will renew M&A interest in FTSE 250 industrial engineers and similar. Xaar, the profit-warning-hit industrial printer, has already been mentioned as a possible target. More imaginative speculation reaches as far as Spectris, which makes electrical equipment.But this hope is expressed every time a mid-cap industrial receives a bid, and is realised less often. Instead, the real impact may be felt further afield. If Brother’s deep pockets can fund the UK group’s expansion in the fast-growing digital printing market where its size has held it back so far, then its large US rivals, Danaher and Dover, may need to step up their own investment plans to defend their market positions. Still, cheaper than launching a counterbid.Negative energyCairn Energy has been highlighting how senior Indian politicians recognise the “negative impact” of retrospective taxation on investor sentiment.Meanwhile, investors have been making their own negative impact on the oil explorer’s value after the group received a $1.6bn tax bill from New Delhi. Cairn’s share price closed 16 per cent lower on Wednesday, at 153.7p.No wonder the Scottish group sounds sore. Its response is not to turn to the all-too-familiar terrain of the Indian courts in which other multinationals have contested tax claims, but to navigate the uncharted waters of the UK-India investment treaty.This treaty says that, if the two sides cannot agree within six months, then the dispute goes to an international panel of three wise persons to reach a majority verdict. One arbitrator is appointed by each side, and the two then agree who the chairman should be. The president of the International Court of Justice acts as backstop, just in case there is no outbreak of amity and sweet reason.For both parties, however, the most damaging feature of this tax bill is its element of surprise. It goes against the trend of recent ministerial comment, suggesting that such public statements are not a reliable guide to the government’s views. As such, it exacerbates the unpredictability that is already part of the problem.For Cairn, it raises the question: what was the point of months’ of engagement by executives with the Indian authorities?Cairn insists that the Indian government can have recourse only to its Indian subsidiary, rather than the group as a whole. Even so, its current inability to sell its $700m stake in Cairn India, which analysts had pencilled in for this year, is bad news enough. When Arun Jaitley, India’s finance minister, visits the UK this week, he should be glad he is travelling to London, not Edinburgh.Boohoo’s buyback“So last year,” is rarely a term of praise in the fashion world. Certainly Boohoo.com seems to have little time for last spring’s styles. The online retailer raised £50m when it floated in March last year. Now it wants authority from shareholders to buy back up to 10 per cent of the share capital because it feels it has too much cash — £54m — sitting about on the balance sheet.At Wednesday’s closing share price — less than half the group’s debut value — a 10 per cent buyback would amount to £30m. That is more than half the amount it raised just 12 months ago and would reduce the free float that is not extensive now at 53 per cent.A buyback would be one way of boosting earnings per share. But investors should ask the management why this admirable aim cannot be achieved by investing the cash more heavily in the business.alison.smith@ft.com
7;DHR;Danaher Corp;2014-10-15T17:01:14Z;Reverse Morris Bust;;This probably isn’t the week to be announcing transformative M&A — as infrastructure software provider NetScout has discovered the hard way. It announced a rare Reverse Morris Trust transaction on Monday where it would combine with the communications unit of the conglomerate Danaher, a key rival. In an RMT deal, one company will spin off a division and simultaneously merge it with a smaller company. The rub is that it remains tax-free to both companies and shareholders as long as the shareholders of the spinning conglomerate own a majority of the new company’s shares.Here’s how NetScout shares have reacted since Monday.That’s an aggregate loss in value of nearly $400m for a deal that should have synergies and is supposed to boost earnings per share, according to management. Both companies provide something called “network and application performance management”– essentially making corporate computing networks run better. The Danaher unit sells to internet service providers, an area where NetScout is weaker.One theory is that shareholders of Danaher, an industrial company with a market cap of $50bn, won’t be excited to be holding shares in a pure, publicly-traded software company. Per the terms of the transaction, Danaher is to own 60 per cent of the new company. Based on NetScout’s Friday share price, that valued the Danaher business at $2.6bn. That value is down to $2.1bn with the slide in NetScout shares.Danaher shareholders may have an safety hatch, however: NetScout shareholders have to approve the deal. Based on the way its shares have traded their assent is hardly guaranteed.A glance at the short list of RMT deals show that most occurred among companies in the same industry.The lesson of this transaction is to think carefully, not just about strategic benefits of a share swap, but also how different shareholder bases will react.
8;DHR;Danaher Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
9;DHR;Danaher Corp;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Carlyle in exclusive talks to buy J&J blood testing unit;;Carlyle has entered exclusive talks with Johnson & Johnson to buy its blood testing unit in what would be about a $4bn deal, edging out a competing offer from Blackstone and its strategic partner Danaher Corp, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.The exclusivity expires in mid-January, at which time the US alternative investment group hopes to have completed its due diligence on the unit, according to the two people.Spokesmen for Blackstone and Carlyle declined to comment.A deal is not guaranteed, but if successful, it would go into Carlyle’s flagship US buyout fund which is under the wing of Bill Conway, one of the groups three founders and a respected investor in the small world of the mega buyout firms.Carlyle has been very active in the healthcare space as have competitors including Blackstone and KKR. It already owns PPD, a drug trials firm as well as Manorcare, a chain of nursing homes.Like its rivals, Carlyle has been frustrated by the lack of buying opportunities and the high valuations of public companies at a time when the cost of debt has been at record lows.“With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and asset prices being bid up, the investment environment in the United States has become increasingly competitive,” the three founders of Carlyle noted in a year-end letter to limited partners seen by the Financial Times. “Despite a more difficult investment environment in the United States, we continued to find creative ways to deploy capital.”While record-low interest rates have helped to finance buyouts, they have also made companies reluctant to sell either themselves or divisions, at least partly because they don’t know what they would do with the proceeds from any sale given those low rates.Carlyle has also been among the most active of the major private equity groups in returning money to investors. In the year ending September 30, it returned about $12bn to investors in its private equity funds through a mix of sales, listings and follow on equity offers, and expected to have listed 12 companies by year-end, according to the letter.Private equity groups have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, which has led to a liquidity-driven surge in the stock market. That has aided the environment for listings, a favoured exit avenue for private equity.At the same time the groups have hedged against any future interest rate rise by shifting the floating-rate debt they borrow into fixed-rate debt.
10;DHR;Danaher Corp;2012-10-10T18:28:41Z;Bain Capital buys Apex Tool for $1.6bn;;Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said it would acquire Apex Tool for about $1.6bn, the second big US hardware deal announced in two days.Apex Tool, a joint venture formed in 2010 by Danaher Corp and Cooper Industries, is a leading manufacturer of power tools, drill chunks and soldering products.Danaher and Cooper own equal shares of Apex Tool, which is based in Sparks, Maryland, and the sale to Bain will allow each company to shed a non-core asset. At the joint venture’s inception, the two companies combined their tools businesses into a consolidated operation.“With the support of Danaher and Cooper, we’ve succeeded in combining two premier tool manufacturers into a single world-class company,” said Steve Breitzka, Apex Tool chief executive, who will continue to lead the company, on Wednesday.A wave of disposals, led by industrials groups, has led to divestitures accounting for a record share of deal volume this year. Dealmakers expect the trend to continue, with more tool deals in particular.On Tuesday Stanley Black & Decker, a rival of Apex Tool, sold its hardware and home improvement unit to Spectrum Brands for $1.4bn in cash.The deal gives both Danaher and Cooper welcome room to focus on their core businesses.Danaher in February acquired Beckman Coulter, a diagnostic equipment maker, for $6.8bn, part of the group’s continued push into the healthcare and life sciences market. Cooper is in the process of combining with Eaton Corp, after their $11.8bn deal was announced in May, a move that will see the new group focus on industrial components instead of consumer goods.Bain, meanwhile, has been an active acquirer of divisions being disposed of by big groups. In 2010 it paid $1.6bn to Dow Chemical for the Styron basic plastics unit. And later that year the private equity group joined with Advent International to pay $2.7bn for Royal Bank of Scotland’s credit card processing group.“We’ve been impressed with the global platform of market leading positions that the Apex Tool team have been able to build. In the market, Apex Tool is known for its long tradition of quality and manufacturing excellence and portfolio of well-known tools brands,” said Seth Meisel, a managing director at Bain.Barclays and RBC Capital advised Bain, with Kirkland & Ellis providing legal counsel. Goldman Sachs advised Apex Tool.
11;DHR;Danaher Corp;2012-03-06T21:14:44Z;Meggitt seeks out new markets and products;;Meggitt will seek more acquisitions in the sensor, aircraft engine and energy sectors as it builds on its growth and operational performance of last year.Terry Twigger, chief executive, said the aerospace and defence engineering company would use acquisitions to gain new products as well as new markets. “We would rather be a consolidator than to be consolidated,” he said, noting though that a takeover of Meggitt was never out of the question given it is a publicly traded company.Mr Twigger has gone a fair way to make it more difficult for any would-be suitor, with growth in all three of the company’s main businesses last year.Meggitt was particularly buoyed by the civil aviation industry’s push to improve fuel efficiency. But it also proved it could exploit its engineering prowess in aerospace and defence to capture newer markets, such as energy where organic revenues rose 28 per cent.Even its defence division, which is facing budget cuts in the US as well as the end of a decade of the spoils of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, managed 5 per cent organic revenue growth.Meggitt said on Tuesday its order book last year grew 26 per cent, while its overall revenue was £1.46bn, up 25 per cent and pre-tax profit was up 31 per cent at £226m. Earnings per share were 23.8p, up 20 per cent and the company increased its dividend 14 per cent to 10.5p – a sign of Mr Twigger’s confidence for solid cash flow this year.The results were largely in line with expectations, though some commentators noted Meggitt’s forecast could prove optimistic.“We are slightly more cautious than Meggitt’s outlook for civil aftermarket and defence revenue,” said Celine Fornaro of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Part of Meggitt’s success last year came from quickly integrating Pacific Scientific Aerospace, which it bought from Danaher in April in order to add fire and smoke suppression to its portfolio of equipment that detects and protects against fire.Savings in the past nine months hit $6.5m, well above the $4m target. Meggitt expects the swift realisation of synergies to continue and has increased its 2014 cost savings target 60 per cent to $22.4m.
12;DHR;Danaher Corp;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;US industrials saddle up for bumpy 2012;;Confronted by an unsettled global outlook for 2012, leading US industrial companies are turning inward to boost performance, cutting costs and restructuring their businesses in an attempt to raise earnings on what could be a bumpy journey.In the past month or so, a dozen leading US industrial groups have provided guardedly optimistic forecasts for next year, arguing that a mix of exposure to faster growing markets, acquisitions and productivity improvements will help them to power through any slowdown.Manufacturing companies will need to work hard to stay ahead of a volatile global economy. Weak spots include Europe, which may already be in recession, and potentially China, where the government is faced with a real estate bubble.In a sign of what to expect, Alcoa, which on Monday opens the US reporting season, last week unveiled aggressive moves to cut costs affecting 12 per cent of its aluminium smelting capacity.On average, US industrial companies are expecting lower revenue growth in 2012 than last year but higher earnings growth through increased volumes.For the fourth quarter of last year, analysts on average expect the industrial sector to report earnings 7.2 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 2010, roughly in line with growth for the market as a whole, according to S&P Capital IQ. Analysts expect that pace to accelerate this year, but the economic outlook suggests that pickup is far from certain.Even in the US, where recent data have pointed to unexpected economic strength, there are reasons for caution. Richard Fearon, chief financial officer of Eaton, the manufacturer of industrial equipment, noted recently that economists were unusually divided on the outlook.Given the political deadlock in Washington, “it’s hard to figure out exactly where we end up”, he told investors late last year. “That is a note of caution that I think most large companies have about 2012. And I think we are all planning in a pretty conservative way.”Global uncertainty is already taking its toll. Last month, Emerson Electric, a widely respected conglomerate, convened a hasty conference call to warn that its revenues in the first quarter of 2012 would be down 3-5 per cent compared to the same period a year earlier, though maintaining its full year guidance.“It’s clearly extraordinary times out there, a lot of moving parts,” David Farr, chief executive of Emerson, told investors.Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners said the move was partly due to company-specific problems and the impact of the recent floods in Thailand but noted that it triggered alarm bells nonetheless.“What we fear most is that all the companies who have provided guidance in the last [few] weeks have to substantially backpedal due to much worse macro conditions than they anticipated,” he said, though adding that for the moment industrials were maintaining capital expenditures.Some industrial companies have already decided to cut costs further to prepare for this uncertain future. Emerson, Danaher and a number of others have said they will modestly increase spending on restructuring in 2012 while others such as Honeywell expect to benefit from action in late 2011.Alcoa is planning to shut down temporarily 5 per cent of its smelting capacity, and close permanently a further 7 per cent that had been in temporary shutdown. Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive, described the moves as “difficult but necessary steps to improve Alcoa’s competitiveness, preserve and grow shareholder value and protect jobs.”Lawrence Culp, chief executive of Danaher, the acquisitive conglomerate, says the company is already running a modified version of its 2008 playbook, targeting market share, cutting costs and using cash to make deals. “We’re just trying to be nimble …not be draconian and preparing for the apocalypse,” he told investors in December.Some analysts worry about a lack of urgency. In a note to investors in mid-December, Barclays Capital said many industrial groups seemed to have run out of ideas and warned that investors were losing faith.However, if it looks as though margins – already at record highs in the industrial sector – are coming under pressure, companies say they will take more radical action. “We’ll try to read and react to what happens [in] the next couple of weeks,” says Mr Culp, “[to see] if we need to take a more conservative posture”.Another tactic for securing earnings growth in turbulent markets will be through acquisitions. Danaher expects to have about $5bn available to make deals in the next two years, and Morgan Stanley estimates that conglomerates will have about $90bn for deals and share repurchases through 2014.“Industrial companies will remain active in looking at larger deals, but are focused on transactions that generate significant synergies, rather than on further diversification,” said Larry Hamdan, head of global industrials M&A at Barclays Capital.This article is subject to a correction and has been amended.
13;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-11-03T19:39:19Z;Ex-Army pilot due to land in Shanks’ hot seat;;Shanks, the waste management group, has appointed a former Army helicopter pilot and consultant as chief executive, as it seeks to take advantage of European Union initiatives to increase recycling.Peter Dilnot, who runs the Middle East business of Danaher Corporation, an industrial and healthcare conglomerate, will join the FTSE 250 company next February.Tom Drury, his predecessor, announced his intention to quit the Milton Keynes-based business in June, citing the pressure of commuting along the M6 to his home in Knutsford, Cheshire. He left in September.Shanks, which employs more than 4,000 people across Northern Europe and Canada, said EU requirements to reduce the amount of waste going into landfill had driven underlying pre-tax profits up by 20 per cent in the six months ending September 30 from £20.8m on revenue up 11 per cent to £398m.The group has been focused on producing renewable energy from waste rather than simply burying it since selling its landfill sites to the private equity group Terra Firma in 2004.With landfill taxes rising by £8 to £64 a tonne in April next year, Chris Surch, acting chief executive of Shanks, said the UK was a focus for growth. Just 40 per cent of waste is recycled in the UK, up from 6 per cent in the mid 1990s, but it lags behind the Benelux countries, its biggest market, where more than 80 per cent of rubbish is reused. “We’re doing well out of landfill tax going up and are confident about the future,” Mr Surch said.In Britain, its programme to service local authorities continues to pick up work and margins have improved from 4.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent.The group has anaerobic digestion plants, which convert food and garden waste into electricity, in Amsterdam, Glasgow, and Ontario in Canada. Two other plants are under construction in Bicester, Oxfordshire, and east London as part of a £150m investment programme launched in March,Mr Dilnot, 42, spent seven years at the Boston Consulting Group, working in industrial and sales and marketing practices worldwide. Before BCG Mr Dilnot was an Army officer trained as an helicopter pilot, and subsequently served with Nato and the UN.John Lawson, at Investec, said in a note: “Shanks is trading well and, despite the present economic uncertainty, we believe that the strong structural growth story (with some strong legislative drivers) remains intact and the investment programme is delivering on the targeted returns. Given a more stable economic backdrop, earnings could grow much faster than we presently forecast, we believe.”Shares in Shanks, which raised its dividend by 10 per cent to 1.1p, closed up 5.6 per cent at 114.1p
14;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-10-21T21:58:46Z;Global demand boosts GE industrial revenues;;General Electric, the US conglomerate, reported a sharp increase in third-quarter industrial revenues and predicted continued momentum in 2012, but operating margins slipped, prompting concerns about the profitability of its core businesses.In the three months to the end of September, industrial revenues rose 19 per cent to about $23.4bn, thanks to recent acquisitions and strong international demand compared with 2010, while total revenues were flat at about $35.4bn.GE’s third-quarter results, reported on Friday, were complicated by a number of one-off events, but net income attributable to shareholders rose 18 per cent to $2.3bn, or about 22 cents per share, up 22 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier.GE said industrial operating profit margins fell from 16.5 per cent in 2010 to 13.7 per cent due to lower prices for its wind turbines and the initial costs of some acquisitions.“The third quarter for industrial was mostly what we’d call ‘profitless prosperity’,” Scott Davis of Barclays Capital wrote in a note to clients. “GE gained share … outgrew all of its key competitors but at what cost? Margins on new equipment … were very weak.”GE was optimistic about the outlook. Executives argued that its financial unit would continue to generate substantial profits in 2012, while its industrial businesses would benefit from recent acquisitions, new products and a $191bn order backlog.“Our two big businesses, aviation and energy, [have] extremely strong backlogs, tremendous product profiles, really good geographic mix … So, our belief is we ought to see very attractive organic growth and expanding margins industrially in 2012,” said Jeff Immelt, chief executive of GE.“We’re planning on a slow-growth developed world [and] continued high-growth developing world based on the businesses we’re in,” said Keith Sherin, GE chief financial officer. “We’re in heavy infrastructure and that’s where those capital expenditures are being made in those growth regions.”GE’s bullishness contrasts with more cautious statements by its industrial peers. On Friday, Honeywell, another US conglomerate, reported strong profits and revenues thanks to demand for its aerospace products but noted growing uncertainty over the economic outlook.In response, Honeywell, and other major industrial conglomerates including United Technologies and Danaher intend to focus on restructuring, trimming workers and consolidating factories in order to cut costs and boost margins.“It is the smart thing to do in an increasingly uncertain economic environment. In just the last three months we have seen continued downward revisions in global GDP forecasts. You can’t ignore that stuff. The economy matters,” said David Anderson, chief financial officer of Honeywell.By the close, GE shares were down 1.9 per cent to $16.31. Over the year to date GE shares have dropped about 10 per cent, compared with a 2 per cent loss for the S&P 500 index.
15;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-09-12T12:57:03Z;Charter / Colfax;Offer falls short of knockout blow to Melrose;The financial world might be in meltdown, but engineers are made of stronger stuff. Colfax Corp’s 910p-a-share offer for Charter International, most of it in cash, throws down the gauntlet to Melrose, which had been eyeing the UK engineering and welding group without ever committing itself. Colfax’s offer has won over the Charter board – and why not, given that it values the valves-to-welding group at £1.5bn? But it is not the knockout offer Charter investors were expecting.Colfax is far smaller than Charter but it has enormous firepower as the bidding vehicle of the billionaire industrialists Steven and Mitchell Rales. They own 42 per cent of the Maryland-based group and are underwriting a good chunk of the cash. They may want Charter as part of a plan to turn Colfax into a mini-Danaher, the $30bn manufacturing group they founded.Their offer is a 48 per cent premium to Charter’s undisturbed share price before Melrose approached and 13 per cent above Charter’s closing price on Friday. It is also about 10 per cent higher than the roughly 813p level at which Melrose’s indicative cash-and-shares offer – pitched at 850p a share but steadily leaking value – was trading on Friday. So it is odd that Colfax has complicated its offer with a share component – it is structured as 80 per cent cash and 20 per cent stock. Some UK investors may not be able to hold Colfax paper for technical reasons and Colfax shares were 10 per cent lower on Monday, cutting the headline value of its offer to nearer 890p. That leaves the door slightly ajar for Melrose.Charter chairman Lars Emilson has played a weak hand well since a June profit warning. Melrose may be able to return with a revised offer – its leverage is just 1.2 per cent of operating profit. But beware choppy markets: this is a race where it may ultimately pay to come second.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
16;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-09-06T22:39:57Z;Dealmaking duos compete for Charter;;The takeover battle for Charter International, the FTSE 250 engineering group, has pitted two of the industrial sector’s most well-known dealmaking duos against each other.From the US come Mitchell and Steven Rales, the publicity-shy brothers whose success in building a manufacturing empire has helped them join the ranks of the world’s richest men.On the UK side, the bidders are Christopher Miller and David Roper, known in the City as the turnround specialists who run Melrose, the quoted bid vehicle.The Melrose pair had appeared to be closing in on their latest target last week after making a sweetened £1.42bn ($2.27bn) cash and shares approach for Charter that prompted the maker of compressors and welding kit to open its books.But the Rales have since emerged as a rival suitor. Colfax, the pump maker named after a primary school they attended, disclosed on Sunday it too was in talks with Charter about an all-cash offer. The Maryland-based company has only a small UK presence and market capitalisation of $1bn. But investors who doubt its potential to make a serious tilt at Charter would be overlooking the backing of the Rales, who have a 42 per cent stake.“Nobody seems to be aware of the fact that they’ve created more shareholder value than [Warren Buffett’s] Berkshire Hathaway over any time period you’d care to look at,” says Mark Wilson, analyst at Collins Stewart, describing Colfax as “the real deal”.The Rales are best known for founding Danaher, the conglomerate that makes products such as microscopes and water treatment equipment. Its market capitalisation is 30 times greater than that of Colfax.Earlier this year, Danaher secured its biggest deal yet when it trumped several private equity consortiums with a $6.8bn offer for Beckman Coulter, a diagnostic equipment maker. Some analysts were cautious about that deal, highlighting Beckman’s apparently modest revenue growth potential. Still, Danaher shareholders have done well during the years.Meanwhile, the Rales – who branched out from their father’s property venture in 1979 – have amassed fortunes of about $2.5bn each, according to Forbes.Rather than simply seeking to snap up apparently undervalued companies, the brothers prefer to inject into their newly acquired businesses a rigorous style of management, based on the famous Toyota Production System – a lean industrial process devised by the carmaker that emphasises efficient manufacturing methods by cutting down on waste. For Dan Pryor, senior vice-president of strategy and business development at Colfax who has worked with the Rales for 13 years, a key part of their success lies in their management style.“While they are clearly very interested shareholders, operationally they are very hands-off leaders,” he says. “What differentiates them …is a willingness to face what’s actually happening …and have an intelligent debate based on facts about it.”In spite of the possibility of an all-cash offer, Charter shareholders seem underwhelmed. The shares have slipped 9p so far this week to 777p – significantly beneath Melrose’s 850p approach.
17;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-09-05T15:26:57Z;Colfax / Charter: industry-shaping takeover;Acquisitive US engineering group will have to raise mooted offer;"Sparks are flying as never before in the world of welding. A bidding war is shaping up for Charter International, now that the acquisitive US engineering group Colfax Corp has come out of hiding to say that it might make an all-cash offer. If that happens, it will have to be a knockout blow to dislodge an indicative cash-and-shares offer already tabled by Melrose, a UK-based private equity-style vehicle. The Melrose offer values Charter at 850p a share; Colfax may need to top 900p. It looks like a tall order for the US group (market value $1bn), which is barely half the size of Charter (a bid-inflated £1.3bn).Just because Colfax is small does not mean it cannot afford to enter the race. That would be to underestimate Steven and Mitchell Rales, the billionaire brothers who own 42 per cent of Colfax (and a chunk of the $30bn Danaher manufacturing group). Colfax says existing shareholders are ready to finance any offer. An all-cash bid would have certainty; Melrose’s offer has been leaking value since it was increased last week. Only about a third is in cash, and its share price – 281.1p on Monday – is starting to discount heavy equity issuance.There are fewer synergies between Colfax and Charter, however. The former is not present in welding, which accounts for about two-thirds of Charter’s 2010 revenues of £1.7bn, though the fit between the US group’s core fluids-handling business and Charter’s Howden air and gas handling looks good. Both companies are also diversified internationally: almost all of Charter’s revenue, and three-quarters of Colfax’s, is earned outside its home market.Charter shares, trading at 15 times earnings, up from 9 before Melrose approached in June, look fully valued. So Colfax must find a lot of cash to land a knockout blow. This industry-shaping takeover battle still looks like Melrose’s to lose.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
18;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-07-06T22:22:34Z;Axis-Shield rejects £230m offer from US rival;;Shares in Axis-Shield leapt 49 per cent on Wednesday after the Scotland-based diagnostics group said it had rejected a £230m ($367m) offer from US rival Alere, arguing that it “fundamentally undervalues” the company.Alere – known as Inverness Medical Innovations until last year – made the “unsolicited and highly preliminary approach” on June 7, Axis-Shield said. The non-binding cash offer of 460p a share represented a premium of 37 per cent to Tuesday’s closing price, and 45 per cent to the average closing price over the past six months.It was unanimously rejected last month by the board of Axis-Shield, which makes machines to test for diabetes and other conditions, after discussions with legal and financial advisers.Alere, which has made more than 60 acquisitions in the last seven years, remained interested in acquiring Axis-Shield, said a person close to the US company. “The main concern is to talk to the management, because they think there’s scope for coming to an agreement,” said the person. “It’s hard to understand why Axis-Shield haven’t been prepared to engage in discussion, when they’ve made a very handsome cash offer.”Analysts said although Alere’s offer might look generous – valuing Axis-Shield at 44 times last year’s earnings – the Dundee-based company would be boosted by new product launches over the next year.A new lipids panel will allow physicians to use Axis-Shield’s point-of-care machines to test for both cholesterol and diabetes. It is expected to be introduced in Europe late this year, and in the US in 2012.However, Alere’s willingness to pay a high premium for Axis-Shield could be diminished by concerns that the product’s US launch might be held up by regulators, and by a sense that the company has underperformed expectations in the past, said people familiar with the situation. Alere decided to wait until a trading update by Axis-Shield on Monday before making its interest public.In the update, Axis-Shield said revenue had increased by about 10 per cent in the first half of the year, and it was “confident about the trading outlook for the remainder of the year”.Julie Simmonds, at Collins Stewart, estimated the new panel would add about £13m to Axis-Shield’s turnover by 2013, compared with last year’s group revenue of £96.7m.The new revenue stream would “be very profitable because you’re adding a new function to an existing device”, she added.A successful offer would need to be at least 530p, and an offer above 600p was possible, said Seb Jantet, at Investec. “This is a shot across the bows – it’s not [Alere’s] final offer,” he said. “There is a potential for a bidding war – companies like Siemens, Abbott [Laboratories] and Danaher might be interested,” he added.The shares closed 153p higher at 500p.
19;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-05-19T21:58:38Z;Thermo Fisher to pay €2.47bn for Phadia;;Thermo Fisher, the US medical equipment company, has agreed to buy Phadia, an allergy diagnosis company, from private equity group Cinven for €2.47bn ($3.54bn), including debt.The cash deal caps an acquisitive period for Thermo, which this year completed the purchase of Dionex, another laboratory equipment maker, and has looked at a variety of other assets in the sector.The purchase of Phadia, which specialises in in-vitro allergy testing, is the group’s largest deal since the 2006 merger between Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific.Marc Casper, chief executive of Thermo Fisher, said Phadia would add to the company’s speciality diagnostics offering.“From a market perspective, Phadia has significant growth opportunities in the large, under-penetrated US market and can leverage our strong presence in emerging geographies to further accelerate growth,” he said.The company last year lost out to Germany’s Merck in the $7.2bn sale of Millipore and this year was linked to the auction of Beckman Coulter, eventually sold to Danaher for $5.8bn.Thermo Fisher shares rose 3.76 per cent to $65.10 in morning trade on Thursday. The company said it expected the deal to be accretive immediately.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said the acquisition could boost Thermo’s long-term growth rate. The deal will also bring Thermo $15m in cost savings and about $20m of additional revenue by 2014.Barclays Capital advised Thermo Fisher, while Goldman Sachs advised Phadia.Cinven bought Phadia in 2007 for €1.29bn, including debt. Under Cinven’s stewardship, the Swedish company has lifted its research and development spending and strongly expanded its market share in the US, China and India. Last year, the company generated ebitda of €149m.Stuart McAlpine, partner at Cinven, told the Financial Times that the group had more than tripled its €300m-plus equity investment in the company.The price achieved for Phadia reflected an earnings multiple of 15 times forecast 2011 operating profit, he added, compared with the 13 times that Cinven initially paid.The sale of Phadia highlights attempts by Europe’s largest private equity groups to shed chunks of existing portfolios ahead of their next fundraising wave.

This sent the stock up 11.9 per cent to $15.56, a nine-month high.The news buoyed related stocks. Hewlett-Packard was up 2.1 per cent to $48.99 while Apple gained 0.9 per cent to $363.13. The S&P technology sector was up 1 per cent.That helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,336.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 12,288.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,825.56.The S&P has now doubled since March 9 2009 when the index reached its intra-day nadir of 666.79.Back in the last cyclical low for the S&P in 2002, the index took more than five years to double. This time it took less than two years.In that time, the financial sector has bounced back 175 per cent, the industrial sector has gained 146 per cent while technology stocks have rallied 134.5 per cent.“Back then, we were pricing in Armageddon, whereas right now we are pricing a recovery,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Also helping to lift sentiment in the markets was a spate of deal activity.Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, agreed to pay $20.1bn in cash, or $74 a share, for Genzyme in the biggest takeover in the pharmaceutical sector since 2009. Genzyme was up 1.1 per cent to $75.09.Elsewhere, Family Dollar Stores was up 21.1 per cent to $53.25 after Trian, an investment group, made an offer for the discount retailer of $55 to $60 per share, valuing the company at up to $7bn.This is the latest in a series of mergers for Wall Street over the past few weeks. On Monday, General Electric announced an energy acquisition worth $2.8bn. On Tuesday NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, confirmed a merger with Deutsche Börse, the German exchange.The previous weeks saw Ensco, the UK oil services provider, saying it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn while Danaher, the US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn. Rumours are swirling that Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is in talks with Starbucks over a potential partnership. Green Mountain has gained almost 30 per cent in February to $42.72.Economic news in the session was mixed. Data showed that US home construction had risen 14.6 per cent in January to its highest level since September, in a positive indicator for the downtrodden housing sector. But these numbers were boosted by multi-family homes, a volatile part of the housing market.Separate figures showed that industrial production had unexpectedly fallen 0.1 per cent in January, short of the 0.5 per cent rise expected. But this was mitigated by a rise in manufacturing output, which increased by 0.3 per cent. “More important than the aggregate figure was the report that manufacturing output increased,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Elsewhere, producer price index data showed that wholesale prices in the US had climbed during January to their highest in more than two years, raising possible worries about inflation.Investors were somewhat cheered as minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee showed officials more optimistic about the strength of the US economy. The GDP outlook was revised upwards.In earnings news, Abercrombie & Fitch was up 7.6 per cent to $57.46 after reporting that its profit almost doubled in its fiscal fourth quarter. The clothing chain said business had improved in the US and that overseas revenue had continued to grow.Deere, the world’s biggest tractor maker by sales, rose 2.4 per cent to $95.86 after reporting that earnings had more than doubled in the first quarter.Comcast, the largest US cable provider, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and said it would raise its dividend by 19 per cent and increase is share buy-back programme. This sent its shares up by 4 per cent to $25.13.
21;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-02-11T23:12:02Z;Wall St gains as consumer confidence rises;;Kraft Foods lost ground after lowering its full-year earnings forecast but the wider markets were up after healthy consumer confidence data and the resignation of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt.The world’s second-largest food company by sales forecast that 2011 earnings would come in below expectations, sending the shares down 1.5 per cent to $30.66.Operating income for the fourth-quarter was also disappointing, brought down by the integration costs from Kraft’s acquisition of Cadbury, a UK confectioner, last year.But the S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,329.15, a 2½-year high, paring earlier losses after data from the University of Michigan showed that consumer confidence rose in February. This helped the index post a weekly gain of 1.4 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 12,273.26, up 1.5 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.7 per cent to 2,809.44, a gain of 1.4 per cent over the last five days.Markets were given a further lift after Hosni Mubarak stepped down as president of Egypt, ending the uncertainty that has worried the markets for 18 days. The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 2.6 per cent to 15.68.But the gains following the resignation were modest as investors struggled to work out long-term effects. “This is a short-term release for the markets, but it could be a long-term negative. We know we are losing a friend, but are we gaining an enemy?” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.Biotechnology stocks lost ground after Cephalon said its profits had fallen in the fourth quarter and that it had received a subpoena from the US Postal Service’s investigative arm seeking information about its cancer-pain drug Fentora.The shares were down 2.6 per cent to $58.56. Related stock Amgen lost 1 per cent to $53.74.In other earnings news, Expedia, the online travel company, reported a 30 per cent drop in net income for the fourth quarter. This fell short of expectations and sent shares down 17.1 per cent to $21.31. Bank of America Merrill Lynch also cut its recommendation to “neutral” from “buy”.Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator, saw a successful first day of trading after its initial public offering. The shares were up 3.5 per cent to $31.05 after the largest private equity-backed US offering at $30 a share, valuing the company at $21bn.US shares in Nokia were down 14 per cent to $9.36 after it announced a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft to make Windows its main phone operating system to compete against Apple and Google in the smartphone market.But investors in Apple and Google were unruffled, with Apple up 0.7 per cent to $356.85, while Google rose 1.3 per cent to $624.50. Microsoft, however, was down 0.9 per cent to $27.25.The wider markets were given little direction from the Commerce Department’s balance of payments data for December. The figures showed that the US trade deficit had widened more than economists had expected at the end of the year. However, exports as well as imports continued to rise, pointing to a strengthening economic recovery late last year.The week was dominated by a spate of deal activity which drove the S&P higher. In other earnings news, Panera Bread, a bakery chain, jumped 16.5 per cent to $116.11 after the company lifted its full-year earnings estimate for 2011 to as much as $4.45 a share.Another restaurant chain, Chipotle Mexican Grill, rose 4.7 per cent to $268.73 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings on an adjusted basis of $1.47, beating the average estimate of $1.30.On Monday Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore drilling company.Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn.Danaher was up 5.3 per cent to $51.61 over the week while Beckman Coulter was up 0.2 per cent to $82.78. Pride International gained 0.7 per cent to $40.08.This mergers and acquisition theme continued on Wednesday when NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange. NYSE gained 13.5 per cent to $38.31 over the week.Strong earnings results from McDonald’s and Walt Disney, up 3.7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over the week, also helped the wider market push forward to 2½-year highs.
22;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-02-08T22:50:35Z;Small business confidence lifts Wall Street;;"McDonald’s led gains for US equities as the wider markets edged up on news that small business confidence had risen to its highest level in three years.But disappointing earnings reports from smaller companies and a fall in energy stocks due to an interest rate rise in China pared gains for the session.McDonald’s, the world’s largest burger chain by sales, saw strong gains after reporting same-store sales had unexpectedly risen by 5.3 per cent in January compared with the same period a year earlier. The stock climbed 2.6 per cent to $75.36.The news lifted the restaurant sector. Starbucks was up 2.4 per cent to $33.12 while the S&P consumer services index was up 1.8 per cent to 306.96. This helped Wall Street add to the 2½-year highs reached on Monday.The S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher to 1,324.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,233.15 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent at 2,797.05.Also helping to lift markets was data from the National Federation of Independent Business showing that US small business confidence was at its highest level since December 2007.But the survey also showed that small businesses remained cautious about hiring and the group was far from jubilant about the future prospect for small business.“While recent political rhetoric favours small business, it is belied by the actions of policymakers whose new policies and activities almost exclusively support big businesses,” said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Small Business. “While the economy is moving forward, albeit at a snail’s pace, it is not nearly fast enough to dramatically improve the unemployment situation, which continues to languish.”Also tempering sentiment on Wall Street was some lacklustre earnings news.Principal Financial, the life assurer, released disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares down 4.3 per cent to $32.24. The group reported a profit of $199.3m, or 62 cents a share, up 40 per cent from the previous year but short of the 68 cents predicted by analysts.Elsewhere, NYSE Euro-next, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, said fourth-quarter net profit had fallen 20 per cent as trading volumes in the US and Europe slowed. This sent shares in the group down 1 per cent to $33.41.The energy sector saw the greatest losses in the session on news that China had raised interest rates in an effort to combat domestic inflation.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group in the world, was down 0.9 per cent to $88.04 while Halliburton lost 2.6 per cent to $44.97.This was the third time that China had raised its benchmark interest rate since October and it sent the S&P energy index down 0.5 per cent to 552.71.The wider markets were not dragged down by the rate rise, however, as many investors saw the move as both expected and even necessary.“The Chinese keeping inflation under control is positive for US equities,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial. “It is only if investors think they are pulling back too hard that equities will really start to react badly.”In deal news, Kindred Healthcare agreed to acquire RehabCare Group in a move the companies said would create the largest US post-acute healthcare services group. The $900m deal sent shares in Kindred Healthcare up 28.3 per cent to $25; RehabCare Group shares climbed 45.5 per cent to $37.05.Herley Industries, a defence contractor, agreed to be acquired by Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for about $270m. This sent shares in Herley up 16.3 per cent to $18.89 while Kratos shares were flat at $14.01.Conexant Systems, the semiconductor maker, jumped 17.9 per cent to $2.47 after saying Golden Gate Private Equity had offered to buy it for $2.35 to $2.45 a share.These deals follow on from a series of bigger deals in the previous session. On Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore driller by number of rigs. Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn."
23;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-02-07T23:20:36Z;Danaher to buy Beckman for $6.8bn;;Danaher, the acquisitive US conglomerate, has launched its biggest takeover deal, agreeing to buy Beckman Coulter, a diagnostic equipment maker, for $6.8bn, as it seeks to expand in the life sciences testing market.Beckman in effect put itself up for sale in December after a damaging product recall and the sudden departure of its chief executive. Danaher trumped several private equity consortia to clinch the deal and analysts said a rival bidder was unlikely.The $83.50-a-share cash offer marks an 11 per cent premium to Beckman’s share price on ­Friday and a 45 per cent premium to its undisturbed share price. The deal values Beckman’s equity at about $5.8bn and the company at $6.8bn including debt.While investors broadly welcomed the deal, some analysts were cautious, noting that Beckman had modest revenue growth potential and that previous large scale healthcare deals had produced mixed results.Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse said that industrial conglomerates including General Electric and Siemens had made large deals in the sector, but the record of their healthcare businesses beating expectations was “uneven”.If the deal goes through, it would be Danaher’s largest by value, according to Bloomberg. Until now its biggest purchase was the 2007 acquisition of Tektronix, a test and measurement company, for about $2.8bn.Danaher, which makes everything from household tools to dental equipment and had revenues of $13.2bn in 2010, has developed a reputation as a savvy buyer, integrator and seller. I n recent years it has ­purchased several healthcare companies.The group plans to fold the business into its life sciences segment, alongside brand names including Leica and AB Sciex, boosting its revenues from healthcare to about 47 per cent of total sales.Beckman makes testing equipment for hospitals and laboratories and has annual sales of about $3.7bn, according to ­Danaher. Beckman reported net profits of $150.3m for the nine months to September 30.Danaher expects to generate cost savings of about $250m, in part by improving Beckman’s information technology systems and securing better procurement prices.About a quarter of the deal will be paid for with cash and 60 per cent will come from new and assumed debt. Danaher will pay for the remaining 15 per cent by issuing more than $1bn of equity. It will be structured as a tender offer and is expected to close in the first half of 2011.Danaher expects the deal to boost earnings by five cents to 10 cents per share in the first year, excluding merger related charges, and 25-30 cents in 2012.Danaher’s shares, which have jumped about 35 per cent over the past year, climbed 2.1 per cent to $49.03 on Monday, while Beckman’s shares rose 9.9 per cent to $82.65.
24;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-02-07T22:25:22Z;Deal news boosts Wall Street;;"US equities rose to fresh 30-month highs as a string of deal announcements lifted sentiment and sparked hopes that more merger activity would follow.In the biggest deal of the session, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore drilling company.The combined company will have 74 rigs round the world. Pride International jumped 15.7 per cent to $39.80 on the news after Ensco said it would pay $41.60 a share, a 21 per cent premium on Pride’s closing price on Friday.US shares in Ensco were down 4.2 per cent to $52.13 but, nevertheless, the news helped to lift the sector.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group in the world, was up 0.6 per cent to $89.83 while National
Oilwell Varco gained 1.7 per cent to $77.71, also helped by high energy prices as oil continued to hover around $100 a barrel.In a slightly smaller deal, Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn.This sent shares in Danaher up 2.2 per cent to $49.03, while Beckman Coulter rose 10 per cent to $82.65.Danaher will pay $83.50 a share in a tender offer for Beckman’s shares, an 11
per cent premium on Beckman’s closing price on
Friday and 45 per cent above the company’s stock price before rumours of the deal surfaced in early December.The mergers and acquisitions activity helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,319.05.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,783.99 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,161.63.Sentiment in the markets continued to rise following strong economic data and earnings results last week that pushed the S&P
and the Dow indices up above the 1,300 and 12,000 levels respectively for the first time since 2008.“US markets experienced some encouraging economic data in the form of ISM non-manufacturing services, ADP employment and initial jobless claims,” said David Buik, of BGC Partners.“Plus [there was] better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from the likes of ExxonMobil, Pfizer, Marathon Oil, Time Warner, Visa, Dow Chemical,
Kellogg, MasterCard and Viacom.“Not even Friday’s employment data, badly affected by the snow, failed to quell enthusiasm,” he added.Financial stocks saw some of the strongest gains in the session, led by CNA Financial, a commercial insurer, which rose 8.8 per cent to $30.19 after posting earnings up 23 per cent and reinstating its dividend.Bank of America added 2.7 per cent to $14.67 while American Express gained 2.3 per cent to $44.82. American International Group, the insurer, was up 5.4 per cent to $42.18. The S&P financials index advanced 1.5 per cent to 226.93.Materials stocks rose in the session as copper, considered a bellwether of economic activity because of its industrial and construction use, hit a record above $10,100 a tonne.Alcoa, the world’s largest producer of aluminium, gained 1.1 per cent to $17.32 while the S&P materials index added 0.5 per cent to 247.57.In other deal news, AOL lost ground after announcing it was buying theHuffington Post, the news website, for $315m. AOL has recently been building a network of specialist websites including TechCrunch, Endgadget and Patch,
but this is the biggest acquisition yet. Its shares were down 3.4 per cent to $21.19.Under the terms of the deal, Arianna Huffington, who founded the website, will run a new AOL division that will integrate all AOL and Huffington Post
content.Investors were also awaiting the announcement of a takeover of Genzyme, the US pharmaceuticals company, by its French competitor Sanofi-Aventis.The two parties held talks at the weekend but as yet no announcement has been made.According to reports in the Financial Times, the two parties are in the process of finalising the terms of a modest cash increase to Sanofi-Aventis’ proposed $69-a-share bid. Genzyme shares gained 0.8 per cent to $74.02.Chesapeake Energy ad-vanced 4 per cent to $31.27 after the company said it would sell natural gas concerns and two energy companies for about $5bn."
25;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-02-07T21:24:02Z;Danaher / Beckman Coulter;Lawrence Culp’s acquisitive streak is just part of a growing wave;Lawrence Culp’s acquisitive streak is in full swing. Last month the chief executive of Danaher, the US conglomerate, spent $470m acquiring EskoArtwork, the Belgian software maker. On Monday, he announced the purchase of Beckman Coulter, the maker of medical diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn including debt. At $83.50 per share – about 45 per cent above Beckman’s undisturbed share price – it appears rich. But given the target’s hefty 46 per cent operating margin and the potential synergies, it is fair.Danaher, with its biggest ever acquisition, is just part of a growing wave. Indeed, mergers and acquisitions have come back into vogue almost as quickly as they fell out. The roughly $650bn of global M&A deals done last quarter was about one-third higher than the previous quarter, according to Mergermarket. Even excluding the US Treasury’s $48bn sale of its AIG stake, the fourth quarter comfortably outperformed all others during the year. And with $170bn worth locked in during January, the pace is accelerating.Among others, three statistics make it an ideal breeding season for M&A. First, businesses are cheap. The enterprise value of companies in the S&P 500 is still below 10 times their forward-looking earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation – a similar level to the depths of the financial downturn, according to Bloomberg. At the same time, the S&P 500’s earnings per share forecast for the coming year is back to pre-crisis levels, while cash flow per share is more than one-third higher.Even though half of all M&A deals fail to achieve their goals, and in spite of the large premium paid for Beckman, investors in Danaher pushed the share price up 3 per cent on Monday. For now, their confidence that the M&A market has been tilted in their favour appears justified.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
26;DHR;Danaher Corp;2011-01-18T18:40:46Z;Deal lifts Meggitt’s aircraft role;;Meggitt, the British engineering group, is to buy Pacific Scientific Aerospace in a $685m (£428m) deal that will boost the company’s role in supplying components to aircraft programmes, including Boeing’s 787 and Airbus’s A380.The deal will be funded by a share placing of about $400m, with the remainder paid from Meggitt’s existing debt facilities.Last year, PSA had revenues of $378m and $79m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The price tag represents a multiple of 8.7 times 2010 ebitda.PSA makes aviation safety equipment such as smoke detectors, emergency battery systems and seat belts. The company, whose revenues are split equally between defence and civil customers, is being sold by Danaher Corporation, the US engineering and technology conglomerate, in an all-cash transaction.“PSA is a bread-and-butter Meggitt business,” said Terry Twigger, chief executive of the UK group.“It is the sole supplier for a lot of products and has high after-market sales, which is similar to us.”Mr Twigger estimated that after the acquisition the amount of Meggitt equipment in civil and military aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and A400M could quadruple, albeit to a low overall percentage – less than 2 per cent – of the build cost of the aircraft.The equity placing, which was completed on Tuesday, saw the issue of 69.8m new shares, representing about 10 per cent of the existing share capital. The gross proceeds of the placing were £251m. Merrill Lynch Bank of America acted as sole bookrunner.Shares in Meggitt closed down 2.9p at 367.6p.FT CommentThis is Meggitt’s largest acquisition since 2007, when the group paid $1.8bn for K&F Industries, the US manufacturer of wheels and brakes for aircraft. Then, as now, the group financed part of the purchase with a rights issue. At the time, Mr Twigger received some criticism for overpaying, although the deal proved to be a good one, yielding greater cost savings than had been forecast. Tuesday’s deal looks relatively good value. Pacific Scientific Aerospace is smaller than the K&F acquisition and, at 8.7 times ebitda, Meggitt does not appear to have overpaid. The group expects $5m in cost savings this year, increasing to $18m a year by 2014, for a one-off cost of $32m. Meggitt shares trade on about 12.5 times 2011 earnings, slightly above Cobham, another UK aerospace group, which trades on 11 times forward earnings. The growth prospects for the company look solid, but the 30 per cent share growth in the past year and the need for investors to digest the PSA acquisition mean that would-be buyers should not expect a further jump in the shares in the coming months.
27;DHR;Danaher Corp;2010-12-27T19:06:14Z;Drive for efficiencies leaves jobs unreplaced;;"When Jim McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, emerged from a meeting between Barack Obama, US president, and 20 of the nation’s top business leaders this month, he struck a bullish note.Mr Obama had asked the executives to step up their investment in the US to aid job creation, and Mr McNerney duly obliged.The aircraft maker plans to create 4,000-5,000 jobs next year, he said – up to half the number of positions the company cut during the downturn.While the Boeing chief’s optimism is sure to be welcomed in the White House and in Seattle and South Carolina, where the jobs will be added, few expect his plans to be repeated across the US manufacturing sector.In a number of recent outlooks for 2011, US industrial companies have taken a cautious approach, emphasising both a steady rebound in revenues even as they pursue rigorous measures to cut costs and improve margins.3M, the diversified manufacturer, forecast organic sales growth of 5.5-7.5 per cent in 2011, undershooting Wall Street expectations, while United Technologies, another industrial conglomerate, forecast 3-5 per cent organic growth, even though both companies expect their earnings to grow by up to 14 per cent.Behind the disparity between sales growth and earnings lies one reason industrial companies are still not hiring: the downturn forced them to cut jobs and implement more efficient production systems, in the process removing excess capacity and increasing productivity.Louis Chênevert, chief executive of United Technologies, noted at a recent investor conference that
the company had become “pretty good at doing more with less” in terms of
capital equipment and labour.Mr Chênevert said: “There is no doubt that as we see economic growth resume we are going to adjust the workforce but there is still a lot of opportunity to drive productivity internally without adding too much workforce”.Navistar International, the US’s biggest manufacturer by sales of medium-sized trucks, expects sales to grow 25 per cent next year but plans to increase its workforce by only 5 per cent.Dan Ustian, chief executive, says that dynamic has wider implications: many of the more than 2m US manufacturing jobs lost during the recession are gone for good.Mr Ustian says: “We were forced into efficiencies.“Even if we were to get back to the position of two or three years ago, we wouldn’t hire as many people back.”In part Boeing’s upbeat approach to hiring in the US is a function of its unique status as the US’s biggest exporter. It can build in the US because its products are high-value, extremely mobile and dollar-denominated, and so it benefits from the fall in the US currency.By contrast, faced with rapid growth in emerging markets, big industrial multinationals have established operations globally to reduce the risk posed by foreign exchange fluctuations and win local political and consumer support for their products.Companies such as Caterpillar, the maker of earthmoving equipment, will focus much of their investment next year in emerging markets, principally China and India.The company is building a new hydraulic excavator facility in Wujiang that aims to start production in 2012, and has plans for
a new large engine factory opening in Tianjin in
2013 and an expansion of
its Xuzhou excavator plant to be completed by 2014.Cost pressures also play a role in decisions to invest in and procure from developing markets.United Technologies, for example, plans to shift more work outside the US, to low-cost countries such as Poland and Mexico, because it typically pays 25 to 30 per cent less for parts built there.One big trend for 2011 could well be for cash to be spent on mergers and acquisitions instead.For companies such as General Electric, a year of solid cash flows, cautious capital expenditures and cheap debt has produced a pile of cash to invest in acquisitions that could supplement organic growth.The conglomerate expects to generate as much as $30bn by 2013 that could be used for dividends, stock buy-backs and deals. This year it has agreed acquisitions worth about $4bn, mainly in the energy sector.Acquisitive companies such as Danaher – which owns a stable of brands including manufacturers of dental and test-and-measurement products – are also on the lookout for deals. The group expects to spend $4bn in the next 18 months.Analysts at Nomura estimated in a recent research report that the global non-financial sector was generating about $1,400bn of free cash flow each year, drawing “considerable attention” to capital allocation decisions.Nomura said that while investors tended to reward companies that increased dividends and buy-backs at the bottom of the cycle, historical analysis showed that as the economy recovered they bid up the shares of companies that did deals and made capital expenditures.Nomura wrote: “If stock markets continue to recover, and multiples rise, we think investors will look more favourably upon companies that are willing and able to reinvest in their businesses”."
28;DHR;Danaher Corp;2010-12-21T20:15:44Z;It’s no big deal as investors eye 2011;;In what has been a stop-start year for dealmaking, one sector of the market has proved notably tough: the megamerger.Despite a recovery in the global economy and benign financing markets, deals valued at more than $10bn remained hard to come by during the year, with five of the 10 largest announced during the fourth quarter. One of the biggest deals this year was America Movil buying Carso Global Telecom for about $28bn.Blockbuster deals made up just 14 per cent of overall activity this year, according to Mergermarket. This is a sharp drop from close to 30 per cent in the previous two years. Bankers argue that, while the backdrop for a continued increase in M&A activity remains positive, 2011 could follow a similar pattern.Jeff Kaplan, global head of M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said he was not anticipating a big uptick next year, but a steady resumption of activity across sectors and regions.“Factors such as cash on balance sheets, strong financial markets and limitations on growth will continue to drive activity, though larger deals will likely be selective rather than commonplace,” said Mr Kaplan.This warning is pertinent after a year in which several would-be acquirers saw attempts at sealing large deals derailed by shareholder opposition or a regulatory backlash.Prudential came under fire from investors after it tried to spend $35.5bn in cash on snapping up the Asian assets of AIG, the US insurer. Shareholders baulked at the price and the execution risks attached to the deal, which was finally scuppered, sending a cautionary note to other chief executives contemplating significant moves.“In this environment, you also have to be mindful of what your shareholders will support,” said Bruce Evans, head of M&A for the Americas at Deutsche Bank. “That is why most of what we will continue to see are smart, bread-and-butter deals.”Bankers are also expecting more shareholder activism next year as impatient investors in search of returns push cash-rich companies into spending their funds on acquisitions.Knight Vinke Asset Management last week raised its voting stake in Kesa Electricals to 11.9 per cent to become the retailer’s second-biggest shareholder, prompting speculation that the activist investor might push for a sale of the Comet electronics chain.As well as dealing with vigilant shareholders, cross-border bidders are likely to face a rise of resource nationalism, as countries rich in oil, gas and other natural resources look to boost their share of profits, potentially limiting supply and blocking foreign bidders.A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said Australia was right to propose a mining profit tax, while China is planning to extend a tax on oil, gas and coal output from one province to the entire nation.BHP Billiton felt this when Canadian regulators ruled in November that the miner’s $39bn offer for PotashCorp of Saskatchewan would not be of “net benefit” to the country.Earlier this week, Safran, the biggest shareholder in Ingenico, which is 30 per cent owned by the French government, opposed a $1.9bn takeover offer from Danaher of the US. This followed comments from Eric Besson, French industry minister, who said Ingenico, a maker of payment terminals, was considered to be an essential part of the French electronics industry.Desperation for growth, however, means companies have little choice but to keep trying to tie up deals. BHP – which has failed to seal three multibillion-dollar deals in two years, spending about $900m in bid costs in the process – has said it will not give up its pursuit of strategic resources.But in M&A, timing is everything. “Interest rates and funding costs may well start to rise in the second half of 2011 – offering an added incentive for CEOs to strike deals whilst they can still access low-cost, long-term funding,” said William Vereker, co-head of global investment banking at Nomura.That might make those chief executives of multinationals who are keen to pursue corporate bulk for bulk’s sake think twice about pulling the trigger on large, cross-border deals. That can only be good for shareholders who have seen several M&A cycles that have spawned value-destroying transactions.
29;DHR;Danaher Corp;2010-12-21T00:21:58Z;Danaher move for Ingenico blocked;;The French government has scuppered an attempted takeover by the US’s Danaher of Ingenico, a leading maker of payment terminals, calling the company “essential” to France’s electronics industry.Eric Besson, France’s industry minister, blocked the bid because Danaher had not given guarantees on keeping jobs, research and development and sensitive biometric technology in France.“The government is fully aware of the strategic nature of this business, Ingenico, for the French electronics industry,” Mr Besson told LCI television on Monday.Ingenico said on Friday it had received an offer from an unnamed bidder of €28 per share, valuing the company at €1.44bn ($1.88bn). The bidder was Danaher, according to several sources.Ingenico had been in talks for several months with potential buyers, including private equity groups Bain Capital and Blackstone. The company launched a formal tender process which resulted in Danaher’s informal offer.However, Danaher was unable to make a final binding offer following last-minute objections at a board meeting on Friday night from Ingenico’s largest shareholder, Safran.Safran, an aerospace and electronics group which is 30.2 per cent owned by the French state, had supported a sale of Ingenico, but changed its decision after Mr Besson appealed to Jean-Paul Herteman, its chief executive.A spokesman for Mr Besson said a deal could still win government backing if Danaher provided the necessary guarantees on jobs and technology. The French government objected to the deal partly because of Ingenico’s sensitive biometric technology, even though this is only a small part of the company’s business.Mr Besson’s intervention raises the prospect of renewed “economic nationalism” in France.Some observers pointed out that Safran is itself bidding for L-1, a US company specialising in biometric identification technology.They pointed out that France raised no objections to the sale of the payment terminals business of Gemalto to Verifone of the US, even though the French state, through the Fonds stratégique d’investissement, a sovereign welfare fund, has a stake.President Nicolas Sarkozy has vowed to prevent so-called “strategic” French companies from falling into the hands of “ foreign predators”.

The unit could fetch $2bn.JPMorgan has been appointed to help AstraZeneca manage the sales and has started contacting potential buyers.The divestment marks the latest attempt by the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical group led by David Brennan, chief executive, to generate cash as it struggles to cope with patent expiries and refocus on its core drug development activities.Astra Tech’s products include dental implants, a catheter for bladder dysfunction, blood filtration and a breathing aid for people with pulmonary disease. It could offer potential both to private equity groups and other medical companies seeking to broaden their product ranges at a time of growing interest in over-the-counter sales as well as devices, which are less tightly regulated than pharmaceuticals.AstraZeneca is facing a steep fall in sales in the coming years as patents expire on some of its most successful drugs and it struggles to find replacements.The company has stood out from many of its peers by resisting diversification into consumer healthcare, animal health and other less risky niches than patented drugs, although it said this year that it would expand off-patent generic drug sales in some markets.Bloomberg reported the launch of the sales process, adding that the company was also considering selling a chain of outpatient cancer centres it owns in the US.One person familiar with the industry pointed to 3M and Danaher as possible buyers of dental businesses in the US, adding that other pharmaceutical companies could look at the unit as they seek to diversify their businesses.Possible buyers in Switzerland for implants include Nobel Biocare and Straumann. Astra Tech is based in Sweden and had sales of €374m ($507m) last year. Both JPMorgan and AstraZeneca declined to comment.
31;DHR;Danaher Corp;2010-07-20T22:00:01Z;Danaher to sell aerospace unit;;Danaher, the acquisitive US conglomerate, is seeking to sell its aerospace and defence businesses as the tools-to-technology company prepares to make further buys in high-growth areas.Danaher, which has a market value of about $24bn, has been canvassing strategic buyers and private equity groups for several months, according to people familiar with the situation.Having struggled to find a buyer for its entire aerospace and defence unit, which could be worth around $1bn, the company is considering splitting the business between various parties, they added.Danaher has made its name as a buyer, purchasing more than 100 companies since 1995, and selling only 17 smaller businesses, according to data from Dealogic.The move to sell its aerospace and defence operations comes even as the serial acquirer adds further to its portfolio. The company in February completed a $1.1bn deal to buy Ab Sciex and Molecular Devices, two makers of instruments and technology for life sciences research.Lawrence Culp, Danaher’s president and chief executive, said on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in April that “we continue to believe the M&A environment is very attractive and we currently have more than $2bn of additional M&A spending capacity to expand and strengthen our portfolio.”The company is focused on higher-growth areas, including medical technology, life sciences and diagnostics.Mr Culp added that the company typically does a dozen deals each year, with one of those likely to be a larger transaction, of about $1bn or more.Analysts at Deutsche Bank noted in May that Danaher has a successful track record in integrating and improving the performance of acquired assets. “We believe that Danaher will be able to generate significant value at this stage of the cycle,” they wrote.Shares in Danaher fell 0.74 per cent on Tuesday in morning trading in New York to $37.41. The stock is close to flat this year. The company did not respond to requests for comment.One analyst noted that Danaher has previously suggested it considers its aerospace and defence business, with sales of about $700m, non-core.The businesses sit within the company’s industrial technologies segment and make a broad array of products including smoke detection and fire suppression systems and submarine periscopes and sensors.Danaher entered the sector principally through its acquisitions of Pacific Scientific and Kollmorgen in 1998 and 2000 respectively but has bolted on a number of other units since then. The company is due to report its second-quarter results on Thursday.
32;DHR;Danaher Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."

——————————————————————————————————–In an effort to streamline its exposure to the aerospace and defense sector, Danaher (NYSE:DHR) is selling its Pacific Scientific subsidiary, three sources familiar with the situation told mergermarket.According to one of the sources, the Washington, DC-based conglomerate hired Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor for the divestiture.Danaher did not return calls for comment while Goldman Sachs declined comment on market rumors or speculation.A teaser on Pacific Scientific has been out for approximately two weeks, the second source claimed, adding that a preliminary proposal on the business is due within the next week.A limited number of parties, believed to be entirely strategic, were contacted in relation to the divestiture, said the first source. The two additional sources said financial sponsors would be interested in the Danaher division, speculating that private equity suitors may be contacted if the process widens.The second source said Pacific Scientific has EBITDA of approximately USD 130m, adding that the business could command a multiple in the ballpark of 8x EBITDA. This source characterized Pacific Scientific as a “hodge podge” of different businesses including aerospace and defense assets as well as fire safety equipment.Potential buyers for Pacific Scientific could include actuation companies such as Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Eaton (NYSE:ETN), Moog (NYSE:MOG.A), Curtiss-Wright (NYSE:CW) and Woodward Governor (NASDAQ:WGOV), said the third source.——————————————————————————————————–For more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@mergermarket.com or call EMEA: + 44 (0)20 7059 6105 Americas: +1 212 686-5277 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9730"
34;DHR;Danaher Corp;2010-03-30T21:01:57Z;US stocks up slightly on home prices rise;;US stocks closed marginally higher on Tuesday as investors mostly discounted slightly better-than-expected home price and consumer confidence data.The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index rose by 0.3 per cent in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, the eighth increase in as many months.Unadjusted data showed a 0.4 per cent decline. Home prices typically move lower in the winter months when demand is relatively light.The index was down 0.7 per cent from last January, the smallest year-on-year decrease in three years.Meanwhile, US consumer confidence figures for March were better than expected. The index increased from 46.4 last month to 52.5.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,173.27, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent higher at 10,907.42 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent at 2,410.69.Reaction to the payrolls report will be delayed given that US equity markets will be closed on Friday.Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, said: “It is not unusual for markets to trade sideways before important macro data.“The unemployment situation hasn’t improved quite as much as people expected it to.”But as stocks continue to plod steadily higher, “it’s a good market for people trying to make a few dollars,” he said.Apple was up 1.5 per cent to $235.85 – a record high – on a report that the company was developing two new iPhone models, including a CDMA version that could work on the Verizon Wireless network.Verizon Communications climbed 2.6 per cent to $31.23. AT&T, the telecommunication services provider that has exclusively offered the iPhone since its launch in 2007, was down 2.1 per cent to $25.95.Large cap financials were lower across the board.Citigroup was down 2.2 per cent at $4.09, JP Morgan Chase was 0.6 per cent lower at $44.58, Goldman Sachs lost 1.5 per cent to $171.38 and Bank of America was off 1.6 per cent to $17.76.Energy stocks pulled back. ExxonMobil declined 0.4 per cent to $67.05 and Chevron lost 0.1 per cent at $75.30.Danaher, a diversified US manufacturing company, that makes Craftsman tools, among other products, was 4.5 per cent higher at $80.88 as it increased its first-quarter earnings forecasts to 90 cents a share or more.The consensus analyst estimate had been 83 cents a share.Other industrials in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also higher. 3M climbed 3.6 per cent to $84.28 and Emerson Electric rallied 2 per cent to $50.81.Qualcomm, a maker of mobile phone chips, added 0.9 per cent to $42.13 as the stock’s target price was increased from $52 to $54 by Deutsche Bank, with a “buy” rating maintained.Diagnostic products maker Myriad Genetics lost 4.8 per cent to $23.70 as a US Federal Court ruled that its patents on two human genes associated with breast and ovarian cancers were invalid.Knight Capital, a leading US broker, declined 2.9 per cent to $15.56 on news that it had bought Urban Financial Group, an originator of residential mortgage loans for an undisclosed sum.“This deal takes Knight in a new direction, moving away from the core competency of agency brokerage into origination in the mortgage market as the company continues to diversify its product set and build out its fixed income capabilities,” wrote Chris Allen, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in a note to clients.BJ’s Wholesale Club, a discount warehouse chain, rose 1.5 per cent to $37.20 as the company said that it had increased its stock repurchase programme by $200m.As of yesterday, a total of $272m was available to the company for share repurchases.Synaptics, a maker of touch pads for electronic devices, gained 4.5 per cent to $27.48 even as the stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “outperform” at Cowen & Co, citing slower future growth in phone sales.
35;DHR;Danaher Corp;2009-12-19T00:58:10Z;Danaher to take over Genetix;;Biotechnology group Genetix is set to be taken over by Danaher, following a bid from the US diversified manufacturer that values the Hampshire-based company at more than £63m ($102m).The 85p a share all-cash offer represents a 35 per cent premium to the stock’s closing price on Thursday evening, and a 56 per cent premium to the average share price over the past 12 months.Genetix has no debt. It specialises in three areas: software to analyse cancer-diseased tissue, microscope equipment and software, and machines and services to develop antibodies in cancer-focused cell biology.Danaher’s diversified product range includes drill chucks, mechanics’ tools, vehicle braking systems, tool storage boxes, tyre-changing equipment, voting machines and the printing devices used in ATMs. It also owns Leica Microsystems, a maker of micoscopes, which is one of the three companies that share the Leica brand. It is into this Leica division that Genetix will be integrated.Friday’s move marks a further expansion of Danaher’s interests in medical technology. In 2006, the group paid $2bn in cash to acquire Sybron, a maker of speciality dental products. Later that same year, the group beat two rivals in a $520m bid for Vision Systems, an Australian medical device maker.“We’ve had very good growth and strong business development over the last 10 years or so, and that strategy has been very successful but the only thing that was not moving was the share price,” said Charles de Rohan, chief executive of Genetix, which had been in discussions with an number of suitors since August.“So we started with a formal process on how to maximise value for the shareholder. Along with Danaher, we held discussions with a number of others and concluded that Danaher and Leica in particular were very much the best opportunity for us to give certainty to shareholders, and Leica and Danaher represents very good growth potential for the business.”Shares in Genetix, which fell as low as 40½p last autumn, gained 29¾p to close at 81¾p on Friday.
36;DHR;Danaher Corp;2008-12-09T00:19:55Z;Dow Chemical to axe 5,000 jobs;;Dow Chemical, one of the world’s largest chemicals groups, is to cut 5,000 jobs, or 11 per cent of its workforce, close 20 plants in the US and Europe and leave idle a further 180 in an effort to preserve cash and withstand the global economic downturn.The deep cuts, which will cost Dow $700m this year and are intended to yield a similar level of cost savings by 2010, underline the pain felt by manufacturers caught between the credit crunch and the economic slowdown.Over the past few weeks, several multinationals, such as chemicals group DuPont, have slashed jobs and cut costs. On Monday, the conglomerate 3M announced 1,800 redundancies, while rival Danaher said it would cut 1,700 jobs and close 13 factories. Anheuser-Busch, the world’s largest brewer, announced 1,400 redundancies in the US.The measures announced by Dow, a bellwether of global industry, will deepen fears over rising unemployment in the US and Europe.Andrew Liveris, Dow’s chief executive, said the closure and idling of plants would affect about 30 per cent of the company’s production base and would be concentrated in high-cost regions such as the US and Europe.He said part of the reason for the aggressive cost-cutting was the need to pay for the $15.3bn all-cash takeover of Rohm & Haas, a speciality chemicals maker. He suggested that movements in currencies since the deal was announced in July could lead to a change in the terms, but Dow remained committed to closing the transaction.Asked if Dow could use shares to pay for part of the acquisition, Mr Liveris said: “We have examined all sorts of ways to look at the Rohm & Haas transaction in the context of today’s economic circumstances.”About 2,000 of the job cuts would come from the sale of non-core businesses. The move is part of Mr Liveris’s long-standing strategy of selling low-margin units such as commodity plastics and investing in higher-growth sectors such as the materials used in the technology industry.Investors welcomed the moves and Dow’s pledge not to cut its dividend. The company’s shares rose 7.2 per cent to $20.37.Mr Liveris was adamant that the latest cost-cutting measures, coupled with a drive to reduce research spending by $600m and working capital by $2bn, would enable Dow to keep its dividend intact. The company’s pay-out has not been cut since 1912 – a run of 388 consecutive quarters.“We will not break that streak. Not Dow. Not on my watch,” Mr Liveris said.
37;DHR;Danaher Corp;2008-12-08T21:43:45Z;Manufacturers’ grim outlooks spark new fears;;Large US manufacturers could unleash a wave of bad news in coming weeks after two of the biggest diversified companies in the sector lowered their profit forecasts on Monday, underlining the depth of the problems facing the industry.3M, one of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, said it was cutting its earnings forecast for this year by about 6 per cent and issued guidance for next year well below expectations, while Illinois Tool Works, the engineering group, slashed its fourth-quarter earnings outlook by about 40 per cent.Other industrial companies could follow their lead. United Technologies and Danaher are due to give forecasts for next year on Thursday, while Honeywell, General Electric and ITT are due to issue their expectations for earnings next week.US factory orders fell by the most in eight years in October, according to US government data released last week that also recorded the third consecutive month of decline.Citing the “turbulent global economy”, 3M dropped its guidance for earnings-per-share for 2008 from $5.40-$5.48 to $5.10-$5.15 and said profits for 2009 would be $4.50-$4.95 per share, behind analysts’ forecasts of about $5.39.The company said it had already cut 1,800 jobs in the US, western Europe and Japan – saving $170m – and indicated that more redundancies were likely. “During these difficult economic times, we will continue to aggressively manage our costs,” said George Buckley, chairman, president and chief executive. “We are prepared to implement additional restructuring as economic conditions dictate.”3M said it was expecting a 10 per cent decrease in organic volume in the fourth quarter and a fall of between 3 per cent and 7 per cent in 2009. The company said currency translation would reduce sales by 6 per cent to 7 per cent next year.Illinois Tool Works said the downward revision of its earnings forecast “reflects significant further weakening in North American and international end markets, the negative impact from currency translation and higher than originally anticipated restructuring costs”.The company said it expected fourth-quarter earnings to be in the range of 44 cents to 52 cents per share, compared with the 74 cents to 82 cents it advised in October.“This new forecast assumes a total company revenue decrease of 7 per cent to 9 per cent,” ITW said.● Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, said on Monday it planned to cut about 1,400 jobs in the US, will not fill 250 vacant positions and will eliminate 415 contractor jobs. The company said the redundancies will incur pre-tax expenses of about $197m.
38;DHR;Danaher Corp;2008-07-17T20:35:53Z;Wall Street rallies on banks’ earnings;;The S&P 500 rallied for a second session on Thursday and edged back out of bear market territory as better-than-expected results from JPMorgan and another sharp drop in oil prices cheered investors.The day began in ebullient mood with stocks rising sharply after a number of leading banks and fund managers reported results.JPMorgan said profit fell 52 per cent to $2bn due to costs from the takeover of Bear Stearns in March and mortgage-related writedowns. But that was a smaller fall than expected.Shares in JPMorgan rose 13.5 per cent to $40.80, adding to the biggest one-day gain in almost six years that they made on Wednesday.PNC Financial Services Group, the Pittsburgh-based bank, and BlackRock, the asset manager, also posted better-than-expected earnings, while Merrill Lynch soothed investors by selling its stake in Bloomberg back to the data and services company for $4.5bn.PNC rose 13.5 per cent to $65.75, BlackRock added 16.2 per cent to $207.98 and Merrill advanced 9.8 per cent to $30.73.An exception to the positive news was the Bank of New York Mellon, which said second-quarter profits slumped 31 per cent to $309m on costs related to certain tax issues. Its shares fell 7.3 per cent to $35.42.The financial sector as a whole jumped 6.1 per cent in early trading while an index of investment banking shares rose 7.3 per cent.Analysts warned that any relief rally was likely to be short-lived. A number of them downgraded or cut their earnings forecasts for Wells Fargo, whose estimate-beating results on Wednesday spurred the biggest ever gain in financial shares and the biggest one-day rally on the S&P 500 since April.Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup analyst, said: “We expect to see a pick up in dilutive capital raises in the third quarter and increased concerns about spillover into commercial credit quality, which should continue to pressure [banking] stocks.”The benchmark S&P 500 pared gains late in the day but still closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,259.97 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.8 per cent to 11,438.92 points, while the Nasdaq Composite finished 1.2 per cent higher at 2,312.30 points.In the past few weeks, earnings reports have been one of the only bright spots in an avalanche of bad news centring on the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.With 11 per cent of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter earnings so far, 72 per cent have beat expectations, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The number is even more surprising given that 34 per cent of the companies that have reported were financials.Outside of the financial sector, earnings reports were mixed on Thursday however. Danaher and United Technologies both beat analysts’ quarterly earnings expectations thanks in part to solid overseas sales and a weaker dollar. Danaher rose 6.2 per cent to $80.90, while United climbed 5.9 per cent to $64.70.Textron, however, held the sector to a 1.5 per cent gain after it noted rising energy costs and the weaker economy and forecast third-quarter profits that fell short of expectations. Textron slid 5.9 per cent to $43.25.Coca-Cola also disappointed investors. The world’s largest soft-drink maker said second-quarter profit fell after writedowns at its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. Coca-Cola holds a 35 per cent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises.Coca-Cola fell 3.8 per cent to $50.34 while Coca-Cola Enterprises, which posted a $3.17bn second-quarter loss, fell 0.1 per cent to $16.83.Those results, and poor same-store sales forecasts from Safeway, knocked the consumer staples sector into the red. Safeway fell 10.8 per cent to $26.78, while the sector lost 0.5 per cent.Market gains were also limited by some poor macro-economic data showing moderately higher rates of unemployment and further weakness in the housing sector.In the background, oil prices fell for a third day, helping consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks.Carnival rose 9.7 per cent to $36.42, while General Motors climbed 11.9 per cent to $12.85. Sherwin-Williams also rose 12.3 per cent to $53.86 after the paint retailer said second-quarter profit fell less than analysts estimated.
39;DHR;Danaher Corp;2008-04-17T20:47:45Z;Wall Street rebound lead by financials;;In a muted session of trading US stock markets went sideways on Thursday as investors weighed a mixed batch of earnings reports and an unlikely rally in the downtrodden financial and consumer discretionary sectors offset losses in healthcare and industrials.Highlighting the ambivalence of much of the day’s earnings news were industrial conglomerates including United Technologies Corp, Danaher and Textron. The trio posted estimate-beating first-quarter profits but cautious outlook statements from UTC and Danaher dented the stocks.UTC fell 2.5 per cent to $70.79, Danaher lost 3.5 per cent to $74.16 and Textron dropped 2.8 per cent to $60.44, dragging the S&P industrials sector down 0.8 per cent.Pfizer also stumbled. The shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $20.40 after the drugmaker said first-quarter profits fell as generic medicines cut into its sales.The news hit competitors Eli Lilly and Merck, which fell 2.2 per cent to $51.39 and 2.7 per cent to $39.22 respectively, knocking 0.8 per cent off the healthcare sector.Meanwhile, a pessimistic outlook statement from Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone company, hurt US rival Motorola, whose shares slid 1.6 per cent to $9.05.By the close, however, a rally in financials helped markets limp into positive territory for a third day in a row. The benchmark S&P 500 index ended the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,365.54.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 2,341.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat for the day at 12,620.16.Positive earnings news from IBM overnight and Google after the close on Thursday which both beat expectations, helped extend a rally in technology stocks that began on Wednesday when bellwether Intel released strong results and forecasts.IBM climbed 2.2 per cent to $123.08. Google said first-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent as expansion abroad more than compensated for a slowdown in advertising spending in the US. Google shares surged 11.8 per cent to $502.66 in after-hours trade.There were other bright spots on Thursday. Trading in the financial sector began in desultory fashion after Merrill Lynch reported its third quarterly loss in a row on $6.5bn of writedowns and said it would slash jobs to reduce costs.But that was broadly in-line with expectations and, by the close, investors had shrugged off the bad news sending Merrill shares, which have lost about half their value in the past year, up 4.1 per cent to $46.71.Its peers, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, rose 4.6 per cent to $43.64 and 2.2 per cent to $46.42 respectively, while the S&P Financials index gained 1.4 per cent.MGIC, the biggest US mortgage insurer, soared 19 per cent to $12.49 after it lost less money in the first quarter than expected. Be-leagured bond insurers Ambac and MBIA also made ground, adding 8.7 per cent to $5.76 and 9.1 per cent to $12.71 respectively.Supervalu, the second-biggest US supermarket chain, gained 5.3 per cent to $30.60 after it said fourth-quarter profit rose more than analysts had estimated.Leggett & Platt led the consumer discretionary sector 0.4 per cent higher. Shares in the maker of supports for car seats jumped 14.6 per cent to $16.45 on an analyst upgrade.So far this year, the S&P 500 has fallen about 7 per cent as investors worry that a slowing US economy will begin to dent corporate profits. Analysts predict that first-quarter earnings will drop 12.3 per cent in total – a number many see as still too optimistic.For the most part investors skipped past a series of economic reports released on Thursday morning that added depressing details – rising unemployment and a slump in manufacturing activity – to the picture, of stagnation in the US.Materials stocks were also in focus on Thursday. Citigroup cut US Steel from “buy” to “hold”, knocking the shares 0.4 per cent to $154.78.JPMorgan cut International Flavors & Fragrances from “neutral” to “underweight”, sending the shares down 3.2 per cent to $44.65.Wednesday’s biggest gainers also fell.

40;DHR;Danaher Corp;2008-01-28T05:50:44Z;Jobs: Keep an eye on the storm clouds;;Business schools are keeping their fingers crossed that the credit squeeze affecting markets has not caused severe damage to the MBA recruitment scene, even in the financial sector.The September 2007 round of full-time recruitment – for MBA programme participants graduating this year – generally went well, with descriptions such as “surprisingly robust” coming from the schools’ careers services staff.But there is a sense of nervousness when it comes to predicting the final outcome of the September round as the on-campus presentations and opportunities have to be turned into real job offers, some of which may not be made until the following year.And there are concerns, too, over whether the effects of the credit squeeze could spread beyond the financial sector and into the general economy, which may take the wind out of MBA recruiters’ sails.“The career horizon is bright, but everyone needs to keep their eye on the storm clouds,” says Joseph Palumbo, executive director of the career development centre at York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto.At Columbia Business School in New York, the main message from Regina Resnick, managing director of the school’s career management centre, is cautious optimism.“We are being very attentive to the marketplace and sensitive to what is going on,” she says. “We are continuing to reach out aggressively to [an ever wider range of] recruiters, and are reminding students not to put all their efforts into just one market but to look for opportunities across a range of industries and functions.”In Europe, Diane Morgan, director of career services at London Business School, says she detected a general feeling of nervousness in September and October: there were some indications that students were prepared to accept an offer earlier than usual. On the other hand, LBS had more company recruiters on campus than ever, “so the nervousness felt by everyone was not necessarily matched by a decrease in opportunities”, says Ms Morgan.Companies’ longer-term recruitment concerns are still a priority, irrespective of the events of July and August. “There is a recognition that these are associate-level programmes that are recruiting leaders of the future,” she says.There remains, too, a shortage of leadership within organisations, says Mr Palumbo, and this puts a premium on MBAs with five to 10 years of experience who can be leaders straight away. He adds that companies are struggling to find the right people, and as a result behaved quite differently last year: “They are getting more aggressive, investing more in their brand on campus, trying to get here sooner and to recruit in more innovative ways.”Some of the largest employers turned up on campus in the third week of August, the earliest ever, and before even the students had arrived, says Mr Palumbo.One sector that was continuing to show a strong interest in MBA recruitment during the September round was consulting, says Ms Resnick at Columbia. There were also more consumer packaged-goods companies on campus compared with the previous year, and more companies offering marketing opportunities.At New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, there were growing opportunities in strategic consulting at the top firms, according to Pamela Mittman, assistant dean of career services. There was also growth in a variety of industries with which NYU Stern has an advantage because of its location, such as retail and luxury, and media and entertainment.“We have been building relationships with the media industry for some time – but some of the retail and luxury and technology recruiters were new [to the full-time recruitment round],” says Ms Mittman. The school has been working hard at building links with these sectors, she says, while the students themselves have been doing a “terrific job” building relationships with the retail sector.LBS, too, saw a broadening of interest from the consultancy sector, with smaller, specialist firms wanting to engage with the school through jobs postings or careers fairs, complementing the regular presence of the Big Four and the mid-sized firms.In industry, there has been a greater diversity of companies engaging with LBS, says David Morris, business development manager in the careers services department. Nike, the US sports shoes and apparel group, came to the school for the first time last year, hiring MBAs for its new European management programme.Manufacturing also put in “a bit of a comeback”, says Ms Morgan, with companies such as Danaher, the diversified US technology products company, and Whirlpool, the US white goods company, coming to the school. “We are seeing interest on the student side in general management posts at companies making tangible products,” she says, “and that is matched by the interest of the companies themselves [in recruiting MBAs]”.In North America, healthcare organisations are starting to wake up to the need for MBA recruitment, says Mr Palumbo, following behind the pharmaceutical sector. Hospitals and medical businesses represent a huge opportunity for MBAs, he says.Another fast-growing area for MBA recruitment in North America is related to sustainability, says Mr Palumbo. Interest in this was previously limited to sectors with a direct impact on the environment but this has spread to others such as banking and consulting, where advisers on sustainability are in demand.The internship round can also provide indicators on the health of the MBA recruitment scene and the confidence of students. Ms Resnick says a very high percentage of second-year students came back from their internships with job offers. However, she adds, there is anecdotal evidence that the volatility of the markets convinced a number to accept the offers more quickly than normal – rather than going to more interviews later in the year.The next pointers will emerge through February and March as the recruitment of this year’s interns is completed. Schools are reporting a normal, or even higher, level of interest from recruiters in booking slots for on-campus presentations or attending career fairs.“There has been a significant increase in on-campus interviews over last year, and that is excluding all of the off-campus contacts arranged by less traditional recruiters,” says Ms Mittman at NYU Stern. “The students seem pleased and the recruiters seem exceptionally happy. One interviewed 26 students in one day, and said it would be happy to hire 22 of them, if it were able to extend that many offers.”The big question for MBA recruitment over the coming months is posed by Mr Palumbo: “Will the slowdown spread from wholesale banking to other parts of banking and then to all other parts of the economy as credit gets tighter?”If that were to happen soon, the recruiters that have been delaying making offers – whether through caution this year or because they prefer a “just-in-time” approach anyway – could decide not to hire at all.Ms Mittman says some of the non-traditional recruiters that base their hiring on need will continue to make job offers in March and June anyway.But she does not think the traditional recruiters – the investment banks, consulting and consumer packaged goods companies that determine their numbers quite early – will postpone their decisions.“It may happen that recruiters will choose to limit the number they hire, then come back to recruit again,” says Ms Mittman. “We have seen that happen in years where there has been uncertainty. But so far there is no indication that they won’t hire as many as in the past. All of us are aware of what is happening in the markets, but we haven’t seen any effect on campus.”
41;DHR;Danaher Corp;2008-01-15T08:33:10Z;Whatman shares surge on bid interest;;Four US bidders, including General Electric, and Danaher, are vying to win control of Whatman, the laboratory equipment company, which provides DNA technology to the police.Whatman, which has appointed Goldman Sachs to run the sale process, held the second round of the auction last week. A preferred suitor could be chosen by the end of the month.Parker Hannifin, the US group which owns a life sciences unit, and Millipore, the multinational bioscience company that provides technologies and services for the discovery, development and production of therapeutic drugs, are also bidding for the UK company.The auction, which could see Whatman valued at more than £300m, comes three months after Kieran Murphy, its chief executive, announced a restructuring of the business, following the completion of a strategic review.At the same time, the three largest shareholders of Whatman – JO Hambro, Schroders and Hermes – asked the board to consider any offers for the company.Whatman confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it had received a number of approaches about an offer for the entire share capital of the company but declined to say who the talks were with. The shares had the biggest one-day rise in 8 years when they opened at 269p, up 59p or 28.6 per cent on Tuesday.Whatman on Monday forecast that its full-year revenues would match 2006’s total of £116m, at constant exchange rates. In a trading statement the company said its order book at the end of December was £16m, an increase of 44 per cent compared with 2006.Whatman also said that it had met the conditions of its share buyback, which is due to begin in March, and that the restructuring announced in September by Mr Murphy was on target to meet its operational milestones.As part of Mr Murphy’s restructuring, the company said it would buy back shares, restructure its manufacturing base and shift part of its operations to China. Other initiatives included closing at least one of its facilities, and increasing R&D investment in its core business from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in particular membrane technologies.Bob Thian, who has been chairman of Whatman since 2002, announced that he would resign from the board this May. His son-in-law, Richard Campbell-Breeden, is a banker at Goldman Sachs but has stepped aside from the process.
42;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-10-23T09:42:10Z;Promina agrees A$7.9bn offer by Suncorp;;Suncorp Metway, the Australian financial services group, on Monday said it had reached a formal agreement to buy domestic insurer Promina for A$7.9bn in cash and equity, creating a A$20bn group to challenge IAG, Australia’s biggest general insurer.Suncorp will sell as much as A$1.9bn of stock to fund the deal, which values Promina at A$7.65 a share, the Brisbane-based company said in a statement. If approved, would be the largest acquisition in Australia’s financial services industry since 2000 when Commonwealth Bank paid A$9.6bn for Colonial.Shares in Suncorp plummeted 5.7 per cent to A$21.41 on news of the deal, their biggest fall in more than a year. Promina shares rose 1.9 per cent to A$6.92.Shane Fitzgerald, an insurance analyst with JP Morgan in Sydney, said Suncorp’s share fall was due to the removal of a “takeover speculation premium” for the company.Shares in the Brisbane-based banking and insurance hybrid have risen in recent weeks – an usual move as the price of a bidder’s shares normally fall – on mounting speculation that the offer could be derailed by a competing bid for Suncorp.Westpac, one of Australia’s four biggest banks, was considered a potential bidder, along with HBOS and local bank St George.There was also speculation of one bank teaming up with an insurer such as German-backed Allianz or QBE, which had previously indicated interest in Suncorp’s insurance operations.However, the possibility of such a bid had been scuttled by a “poison pill” provision in Monday’s merger agreement requiring any bidder for Suncorp to also acquire Promina, Mr Fitzgerald said.“Anyone interested in Suncorp would be looking at its banking operations, so a general insurance company like Promina wouldn’t fit its strategy.”Mr Fitzgerald said the high value of the offer made another offer unlikely for Sydney-based Promina, which was formed in 2003 when it was floated by Royal & Sun Alliance, the UK group.“It’s a very, very big price particularly as the general insurance sector has moved past its peek earnings cycle. And no one else in the insurance sector has a financial services component like Suncorp so they couldn’t get the same synergies.”Suncorp said it expected to generate at least A$225m in savings a year from the takeover.Under the offer, Promina investors - who will own 30 per cent of the combined group if they approve the merger in February - will receive A$1.8 in cash and 0.2618 in Suncorp shares for each of their shares.Some analysts have said the takeover could face close scrutiny from competition regulators since it could lead to three groups controlling around 75 per cent of the national house and car insurance market.But John Mulcahy, chief executive of Suncorp, said the proposed takeover wouldn’t harm competition in local markets.“It’s a very competitive environment being in general insurance. We think putting these two organizations together will create a strong organization that will compete against a very strong set of competitors,” he told a media briefing in Sydney.Citigroup and Carnegie Wylie are advising Suncorp, while Promina is taking advise from Goldman Sachs JB Were and Macquarie Bank.News of the agreement came as Vision Systems, the Australian medical technology company, on Monday formally recommended a $520m takeover offer from Danaher Corp, the US industrial conglomerate, in the absence of a higher offer.Danaher outbid two other US firms for Vision Systems, whose Biosystems arm sells automated machines to pathology hospitals and laboratories.
43;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-10-10T11:10:58Z;Two bidders drop out of Vision fight;;Danaher, a US diversified manufacturer with a growing medical technology business, looks set to gain control of Vision Systems after two American rivals effectively pulled out of the takeover battle.Ventana Medical Systems, which made the initial offer for Vision that triggered the three-way takeover race, said it would withdraw, expressing disappointment at missing ``this particular opportunity.’’Cytyc, which made a A$600m bid which was rejected by Vision’s board, said Tuesday it would not improve its offer, but would keep it on the table and urged Vision shareholders to endorse it.Both Ventana and Cytyc maintain substantial stakes in Vision which they acquired on the open market and that could make it more difficult for Danaher to delist Vision.Danaher is hoping to boost its pathology diagnostics business by gaining full control of Vision, but it has made its offer conditional upon receiving 50.1 per cent of Vision’s equity.Vision shares fell 2.9 per cent to A$3.71 Tuesday amid disappointment among investors that the takeover battle was coming to a close. Still the share price has rallied in recent weeks, after the company was valued in Ventana’s original offer at A$2.13 per share.The takeover battle for Vision comes as intense takeover activity shakes up the Australian healthcare sector as companies such as Vision attract interest because of their pipeline of new products and the country’s aging population.Separately, Australian Pharmaceutical Industries is expected to reject an unsolicited A$566m offer from Sigma Pharmaceuticals, made last Friday. Analysts expect another bidder could soon enter the arena.The API board told shareholders that it would evaluate Sigma’s bid, but noted that it was valuing API at a discount to its current share price. API shares rose 1.5 per cent Tuesday to A$2.66.
44;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-10-09T08:41:52Z;Danaher takes lead in Vision Systems fight;;Danaher, a US diversified manufacturer that has been expanding into medical technology, yesterday trumped its two rivals in the battle to acquire Vision Systems with an agreed A$700m offer for the Australian supplier of medical devices.Danaher’s move came as a surprise because the company had been discussing joining forces with one of the other bidders - Ventana Medical Systems, also of the US.Philip Whitehead, Danaher’s vice-president for corporate development, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the negotiations with Ventana were mutually ended “as soon as we concluded it wasn’t going anywhere.’’ He did not elaborate.Instead, Danaher is offering A$3.75 per share share for Vision. The takeover battle has sparked a rally in the share price of Vision, which rose 31 cents yesterday to close at A$3.82, up 8.8 per cent. The initial offer, made by Ventana, had valued Vision at A$2.13 per share.Washington-based Danaher’s offer is conditional upon 50.1 per cent of the shares being tendered.It also still faces tough negotiations with Ventana and Cytyc, which have already acquired significant stakes in Vision on the open market that could prevent Danaher from delisting Vision.Cytyc holds 13.5 per cent, while Ventana has 12 per cent. Mr Whitehead said Danaher hoped to gain full control, but was also ready to work with powerful and competing minority shareholders. ”Obviously our hope is that we will get full and 100 per cent control. But it [the situation] is what it is,’’ he said.The board of Vision, which recently rejected a A$600m bid from Cytyc, recommended that shareholders should accept Danaher’s offer in the absence of another improved bid.The three-way jockeying to gain control of Vision comes amid frenzied takeover activity in the Australian healthcare sector.CVC Capital Partners recently agreed to pay A$2.7bn for DCA, which runs hospitals for the elderly and X-ray clinics, while Hospira, a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories , offered A$2.5bn in cash for Mayne Pharma, an Australian supplier of generic drugs. Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API) is also considering a takeover offer from Sigma Pharmaceuticals.Although Danaher joined the takeover battle after its two rivals, the group insisted yesterday that it had been eyeing Vision for some time, as a way to boost Leica Microsystems, its pathology diagnostics business. Mr Whitehead said that Leica was operating in “a fast-growing, very interesting and lucrative market.’’Danaher, whose activities range from measurement devices to laser-marking technology used by companies to identify their goods, has made several acquisitions in recent years. Mr Whitehead said a takeover of Vision would probably not satiate the group’s appetite for more takeovers.
45;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-10-03T00:37:12Z;Ventana and Danaher eye joint Vision bid;;The takeover battle for Vision Systems, an Australian supplier of medical technology, intensified after two US companies said they might join forces to trump a competitor’s improved bid.Ventana Medical Systems and Danaher said they were considering a “potential co-operative effort” to thwart US-based Cytyc, which is raising its offer for Australia’s Vision to A$692m (US$517m), or A$3.25 a share.Ventana last week acquired a stake of 12 per cent in Vision that could give it a blocking minority over a competing takeover offer by Cytyc. So far, Danaher has only been conducting due diligence on Vision and has yet to table a bid.The tussle to gain control of Vision has sparked a rally in its share price since Ventana’s initial takeover offer of A$2.13 per share in August. On Monday Vision shares closed 14 per cent higher at A$3.60, with some analysts expecting other companies still enter the race.The bid battle comes after CVC Capital Partners last month agreed to pay A$2.7bn for DCA, which runs hospitals for the elderly and X-ray clinics, setting a new record for a private equity transaction in Australia.Hospira, the US pharmaceuticals group, last month said it was in advanced talks to acquire Mayne Pharma, the Australian injectable drugs specialist, in a deal worth about US$2bn.Ventana started the take-over battle for Vision with a A$450.7m friendly offer, which was then trumped by Cytyc with a A$497m counter-bid. On Monday, Vision recommended shareholders reject Cytyc’s improved bid, a decision that was clearly designed to encourage higher offers.Vision said it would accept Cytyc’s offer if it did not receive a higher proposal within an “acceptable” timeframe. However, Ventana and Danaher warned on Sunday that there was no guarantee that their talks would lead to a joint offer.Analysts at JP Morgan said in a recent research note that companies with a strong presence in clinical diagnostics would be able to derive the most synergies from buying Vision. They also noted that the Australian group, which has launched new medical devices in recent months, could be attractive for “a very large number of companies worldwide”.Meanwhile, shares in Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (API), another possible takeover target, rebounded on Monday after tumbling at the end of last week following a profit warning.API has sought to cool expectations of an imminent takeover by telling shareholders that it had only held informal talks with unnamed parties over ownership issues.Shares in API rose 3 per cent to A$2.39 on Monday, after losing 5.5 per cent on Friday.

47;DHR;Danaher Corp;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Danaher in agreed deal to buy Sybron for $2bn;;Danaher, the US manufacturing company, on Wednesday provided further evidence of its strategy to expand in higher-growth businesses when it agreed to buy Sybron Dental Specialties, a dental products group, for $2bn in cash.The deal comes only a few months after Danaher’s failed attempt to acquire First Technology, the British maker of gas-sensing equipment and crash test dummies, which ultimately was sold to Honeywell International.By acquiring Sybron, Danaher will be taking control of a company with $650m in annual revenues derived from the manufacturing of products used in orthodontics and endodontics - or root canal treatment.The move by Danaher comes as a number of US industrial groups - including General Electric - have been attempting to reposition their companies in favour of higher-growth businesses. GE’s acquisition of the UK’s Amersham, announced in late 2003, fit that model.Danaher, which is based in Washington DC, is paying $47 per share for Sybron, valuing the target at a 13 per cent premium over its market value on Tuesday night. The deal, structured as a cash tender offer, also includes the assumption by Danaher of about $200m of Sybron debt.Danaher also said that first quarter revenues were $2.1bn, or 17.4 per cent more than the same period last year. Earnings per share for Danaher - whose businesses include industrial tools and electronic testing devices - were expected to be in the upper end of the previously estimated range of $0.61 to $0.64.Danaher’s shares moved up 1.3 per cent to $66.20 in morning trading yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of $20.3bn.Danaher was advised by lawyers at Wachtell Lipton.

48;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-01-27T00:08:35Z;Honeywell earnings up 107% for quarter;;The global aerospace boom has driven Honeywell to its strongest performance since its failed 2001 takeover by General Electric as earnings more than doubled.Fourth quarter results for the US industrial conglomerate beat expectations, with earnings per share up 107 per cent to 62 cents or $520m. Sales rose 10 per cent to $7.3bn and Honeywell increased its guidance for performance this year.But the turnaround of a company only recently dogged with slow growth and expensive asbestos liabilities has failed to ignite much enthusiasm among shareholders. Shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $37.41 on Thursday, helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average recover some of the losses it made after GE’s disappointing numbers last Friday.Executives concede it has been difficult to persuade investors that the turnaround is lasting. “Our trading multiple has come up but it’s still below the average of our peers and is particularly low on a forward basis,” said finance director Dave Anderson in an interview. “We are slowly building confidence - one quarter at a time - and we think it is eventually going to be noticed by the market.”One weak spot in the fourth quarter was slow growth in the turbocharger business, which had previously benefitted from the adoption of diesel engines in the European car market.The company has also come under pressure from analysts to justify the price paid for some recent acquisitions - most recently First Technology, a UK company which Honeywell is buying for £406m ($727m) after a bidding war with rival US manufacturer Danaher.Citing UK Takeover Code restrictions, Honeywell declined to detail its synergy estimates, but said the deal should meet its internal requirements for becoming earnings-enhancing by the second year.Instead, the company focused on the strong growth in its aerospace and automation and controls businesses and a successful restructuring of its speciality materials division.It raised its 2006 earnings estimates by five cents per share at the low end of the range due to lower-than-expected pension costs, and predicted sales of more than $30bn.

50;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-01-20T21:34:11Z;Danaher triggers battle for First Technology;;A bidding war erupted for First Technology, a UK maker of gas sensors and crash test dummies, after US group Danaher trumped Honeywell with a £251m cash offer.First Technology had accepted a £207m offer from Honeywell last month. But Fred Westlake, First Technology chairman, said Danaher’s 330p-a-share offer represented not just a substantial premium to Honeywell but “a superior strategic fit” for the business. First Technology shares jumped 27.4 per cent to 351p as the market appeared to expect a further round of counter-offers between the two US corporations.Both groups are keen to acquire the UK company’s world-leading gas detection products.It also emerged that Hg Capital, a private equity business, had made an initial approach to First Technology.Honeywell declined to comment but analysts said the undertakings lined up by Danaher were weak enough to allow Honeywell back into the bidding. Aberforth Partners, with 10 per cent of First Technology shares, has given Danaher a binding undertaking. Danaher also has contractual undertakings from a further 8 per cent of shareholders to sell to the Washington-based handtool maker.But Morley, with 9.9 per cent of the shares, has given other suitors seven days from the tabling of Danaher’s offer – expected next week – to make a revised offer. It will then back a further Danaher counter-offer if it is at least 5 per cent higher. Meanwhile, Sterling Investment Group, Artemis Investment Management and Jupiter Asset Management, which between them hold 13 per cent of the shares, are pledged to back Honeywell if it matches any competing offer.Jonathan Hurn, analyst with Bridgewell Securities, said the scene was now set for “two weeks of intense activity, with a competing offer from Honeywell possibly coming as early as next week”. David Larkham, analyst with Arden Partners, said there was achance Honeywell could “pay above the current price, and it won’t be over then.”First Technology broke banking covenants and issued three successive profit warnings last year. It made a pre-tax loss of £20.6m in the 12 months to October 31 on turnover of £79.1m, after a sharp drop in sales of automotive products.DrKW is acting as financial adviser for First Technology.
51;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-01-20T20:44:49Z;Lombard: Why UK minnows appeal to US giants;;The playbook – as the Americans would call it – for US bids for UK industrial companies is pretty well-thumbed by now, and Danaher, which on Friday trumped Honeywell’s bid for First Technology, has written a couple of its chapters.First principle of interest to investors: keep a close eye on undervalued European companies sitting on valuable technology.Honeywell, Danaher and others seem to be making a habit of bolting on companies active in complementary areas. Second principle: do not assume that the opening offer – or even the counter-bid – will be the last word.Danaher, a Washington DC-based manufacturer of industrial tools, instruments and components, has been here before. In 2004, it exercised second-mover advantage over a compatriot by stepping in with a successful counter-bid for Linx Printing Technologies, a UK manufacturer of high-speed printing equipment that had previously accepted an offer from Illinois Tool Works. Danaher’s bid was pitched at a 17 per cent premium to ITW’s.Its offer for First Technology, which makes gas sensors and crash-test dummies, is 20 per cent higher than Honeywell’s.First Technology, like Linx, had a summer marred by a profit warning and then a winter of bid talks. Its fragile financial state is one reason why this bid is unlikely to follow the pattern of last year’s takeover battle for Domnick Hunter, the UK filtration technology company.Shareholders there found themselves in the middle of a contest between Parker Hannifin and its American rival Eaton, which only finished after six price increases had added a further 16 per cent to the original offer and left Parker with the prize. But Domnick Hunter was in better shape than First Technology.While shareholders would be wise to sit tight for a possible Honeywell counter-offer, they should not expect this fight to last many rounds.Managers that disappoint their shareholders are inviting trouble. Managers that disappoint repeatedly are inviting execution.The saga at SkyePharma, the pharmaceuticals company, is turning into a case study in how not to handle a company in the admittedly choppy waters of drug development.Analysts think Flutiform, Skye- Pharma’s asthma treatment, has promise. But by failing last year to get a licensing deal for the drug and then launching a deeply discounted rights issue to self-fund the product through the next stage of trials, management sacrificed the confidence of a group of large shareholders. Their disgruntlement was whipped into dissent by the disappearance both of a formal offer and then the much-touted alternatives last week and, finally, by the management’s attempt to appoint two new executives, allegedly without consultation. Now, dubbing themselves the Requisitionists, the dissident shareholders have launched a plan to oust Ian Gowrie-Smith, chairman.Activism sometimes has a bad name. But this attempt is more than mere self-interested interference.The shareholders say they have lined up Bob Thian, an experienced pharmaceuticals executive, to replace Mr Gowrie-Smith. He would presumably move quickly to appoint a new chief executive. SkyePharma has the products. Now what it needs is an injection of experience and a transfusion of new blood.Business often depicts itself as sinking in a swamp of regulation, assailed by acronyms. Last year’s pan-European Thomson/Extel survey of investment professionals indicated marked concern – particularly on the part of UK quoted companies – about the difficulties of communicating the effect of the switch to International Financial Reporting Standards and the degree of change that the new regime was likely to inflict.But once IFRS are bedded down at British companies, the new standards – combined with European regulation to improve transparency and voluntary adoption of an operating and financial review – should provide opportunities for companies to explain themselves better.Investment relations directors who gathered at a conference organised by Real IR magazine this week said they had spent much of the past year simply educating shareholders about the changes imposed by IFRS.But in due course, the improved comparability of accounts should mean that investors and analysts come to meetings better-informed about the nuts and bolts of company performance.Rather than laboriously having to unpick historical numbers, companies should be able to spend more time explaining what they are doing and why. Of course, shareholders are unlikely to let any IR director get away with peddling flim-flam in place of hard data – but it is at least heartening to hear business talking in positive terms about what may lie on the other side of the regulatory swamp.
52;DHR;Danaher Corp;2006-01-20T14:22:26Z;January 20: JP Morgan Cazenove sex emails;;January 20: Thank you to everyone who kindly sent me Robert Imlah’s emails. This 25-year-old banker at JP Morgan Cazenove has been suspended after sending emails from his office computer in which he discusses his sexual encounters. In one, a friend salutes his boasts by calling him “immi the pimp Daddy”. I’m afraid that’s all I’ll tell you about them, though. We discussed it in the newsroom and decided not to publish them. They’re pretty silly.A group of SkyePharma shareholders has called an EGM to oust Ian Gowrie-Smith, the company’s chairman and founder. The group, representing 13 per cent of the stock, is led by North Atlantic Value and includes Morley and Insight. They want to replace Gowrie-Smith with Bob Thian, who is a veteran of the pharmaceuticals industry but is currently chairman of Southern Water and Whatman. Over the past few months, several shareholders have voiced disappointment with the management team, for example over its failure to win a licensing deal for Flutiform. They have also voiced their concern about the subsequent deeply discounted rights issue to self-fund the product through Phase III trials. The more recent mess over whether the company was being bid for or not has only added to their concerns.Another great story: a bidding war has erupted for First Technology, maker of crash test dummies. The company had already been bid for by Honeywell at the end of last year. Now, another American, Danaher, has offered £251m, trumping the earlier bid by £44m. Danaher is offering 330p a share but First Technology shares are up just over 72p at 347.6p. Two American’s bidding against each other for a rather overlooked British engineer has echoes of last year’s battle for Domnick Hunter.Two other situations to keep a close eye on: F&C Asset Management shares are up 10 per cent on bid rumours, and London Stock Exchange shares are up another 29p at 705.5p on hopes Nasdaq will bid. As I said yesterday, I think they’re interested. And you can read more about it tonight on FT.com in John Authers’ On Wall Street column.
53;DHR;Danaher Corp;2005-08-15T08:45:24Z;Hexagon increases offer for Leica Geosystems;;Hexagon, the Swedish engineering group, has raised its hostile bid for Leica Geosystems by 31.4 per cent surpassing the offer from rival Danaher of the US last month.As a result of the bid, Leica shares jumped over 11 per cent to SFr572 in early trading.The new cash and equity bid amounts to SFr 573 per share in the Swiss measuring equipment company, based on Hexagon’s closing share price on Friday, up from the original bid of SFr436 per share.The new bid values Leica at over SFr1.44bn ($1.15bn).Last month Hexagon said it would not raise its offer but has changed its mind having seen Leica’s prospectus. The company said on Monday that the document had “convinced Hexagon that the initial valuation of the industrial synergies and the growth potential of Leica were too modest”.At the end of July, Leica recommended a higher $950m bid from Danaher, the US conglomerate, to its shareholders ahead of Hexagon’s original $840m offer. The new bid exceeds Danaher’s offer by 14.5 per cent.The new bid will consist of SFr440 in cash and 5 series Hexagon B shares.In early trading, Hexagon shares were down 2.5 per cent at SKr155.
54;DHR;Danaher Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
