The deal values Viridor, a division of FTSE 250-listed water and waste company Pennon Group, at 18.5 times its earnings in the year to March 2019.The acquisition by KKR’s infrastructure fund comes at a time when global M&A has ground to a near-halt as markets are roiled by the impact of the virus outbreak. Many dealmakers are unable to attend in-person meetings for due diligence and debt markets are struggling. Viridor is “incredibly resilient, incredibly defensive and supported by long-term contracts with local authorities,” said James Gordon, a member of KKR’s European infrastructure team.The private equity firm said it has a “very interesting opportunity to grow the business and . . . generate more sustainable waste treatment options for the UK,” he said. Pennon Group’s shares closed up 3.5 per cent at £11.23.The group decided to proceed with KKR’s offer despite having higher rival bids because it was the most certain in the current climate, said two people familiar with the matter. Banks have agreed to finance the debt for the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.The company will be relatively sheltered from the effects of the pandemic because of its long-term contracts with local authorities, which last as long as 25 years, the people said. KKR could potentially own the business for the next 15 years. Viridor, which has 1,200 employees, operates recycling, energy-from-waste and landfill facilities and runs a waste collection service. It has been for sale since September when the company announced a strategic review.The deal values Viridor at £4.2bn and Pennon expects net cash proceeds of £3.7bn after taking account of costs and debt, it said in a statement. It will use this to reduce its debt, pay shareholders and hold back some funds for future investment, it said, adding that KKR may pay it a further £200m “contingent on future events and outcomes”.Last year Viridor reported pre-tax profit of £88m on revenues of £852m.It is one of the largest deals in the water sector since Australian infrastructure bank Macquarie sold its 26 per cent stake in Thames Water for £1.35bn in 2017. Two investors in Yorkshire Water, which supplies water and sewage services to about 5m people and 130,000 businesses, have been trying to sell their stakes since 2017 but have failed to strike a deal.Colm Gibson, managing director at Berkeley Research Group, said it was part of a long-term trend for water companies to “slim down and focus on their core business”.The transaction, which Pennon’s board has approved, is expected to complete this summer subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Barclays and Morgan Stanley advised Pennon on the deal. 
1;WM;Waste Management;2020-03-03T16:25:23Z;There is green gold in shorter supply chains and reshored rubbish;Polluter-pay policies will soon help incentivise developed world recycling;The case for relocating manufacturing closer to demand is growing, especially as risks from global pandemics, weather anomalies and geopolitical tensions rise. Shutdowns due to the coronavirus in key manufacturing hubs, such as China or South Korea, have exposed just how vulnerable global supply chains are.But there is another equally good reason to rethink the nature of our global supply chains: sustainability.For most of this century, China’s lower labour and energy costs made it hard for western recycling and paper processing centres to compete. Outsourcing made even more sense, given that inbound container ships bearing Chinese goods were empty on the outbound and thus available to carry trash cheaply on their return trips.Two years ago, however, China shocked the world when it decided it was no longer prepared to be a dumping ground for the developed world’s trash.It raised the quality threshold for acceptable materials to levels that were impossibly high for anyone in the west to achieve. For the recycling industry, the move equated to the sort of supply chain shock that most other sectors are only just getting a flavour of now.The industry was initially very creative at finding new homes for the volumes locked out of China. But it soon transpired that many of them lacked the facilities and skills to deal with the rubbish responsibly. To curtail the environmental damage inflicted by irresponsible processing, countries including Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia soon followed China in lifting quality standards to restrictive levels. A glut of recycling rubbish with nowhere to go has been building up ever since.In the past few months, the recycled paper market has begun to take the brunt of the pressure. Prices for mixed paper and cardboard collapsed late last year. They are negative now, meaning that paper mills have to be paid to take rubbish they previously paid for.In Australia — which was particularly dependent on Chinese waste processing — the problem is so bad that local authorities have stopped asking for paper to be sorted altogether. There is simply no point.Meanwhile, in countries that still have their own paper processing capacity, such as the UK, mills are dictating increasingly tough standards. This could have knock-on effects on local councils. Many are committed to multiyear contracts for commingled pick-ups, which means they can’t easily improve quality by forcing households to do more of the sorting at home.But even if that happened, it seems unlikely that better-sorted rubbish can solve the long-term problem. As one senior waste practitioner told me, the old globalised recycling set-up represented a harmonious and virtuous circle. After all, China’s export-led economy was flooding the west with the cheap disposable goods that were contributing to our ballooning waste problem. But as the world’s manufacturing hub, China was also best positioned to make use of the recovered material.Investing in domestic sorting and processing is all very well. But for it to work, the real solution lies in generating final demand for the reprocessed materials domestically. That’s hard when the manufacturing and packaging activity occur abroad.On that front there is hope. New producer responsibility policies, to be introduced over the next few years in the UK and EU, pass the liability of pollution to the manufacturer. This could stimulate that demand, and reshoring.The theory is that if developed world corporations are made responsible for the pollution associated with the full lifecycle of their products, that would remove the cost advantage of using suppliers from areas with lower environmental standards.That, in turn, creates an incentive to bring production and packaging activity closer to the source of recyclable material. To compete, the developing world would then have an economic incentive to raise environmental standards for its export-focused manufacturing.This might finally end the not-at-all virtuous circle of the west effectively outsourcing pollution to the developing world every time it raises its own domestic standards.izabella.kaminska@ft.com
2;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Rich People’s Problems: Coal fires go up in smoke ;"A roaring fire used to be comforting; now it makes you a pariah";Incoming! Within days of his reappointment as environment secretary, George Eustice announced a daft (sadly not draft) policy. Phase out the sale of house coal and wet wood in England.Apparently, it’s all about saving the environment and improving air quality. Since this ban will affect rural areas (those in urban areas have the 1956 Clean Air Act to fall back on) one has to question his priorities.Given the current state of the nation, perhaps this is a smoke screen to hide the ministerial incompetence that’s allowed significant housebuilding on flood plains or the inactivity that’s seen rivers go undredged with flood defences unfunded?But they’re not just coming for our coal fires and wood burning stoves. Elsewhere on Planet Woke, assaults on my senses, activities and habits continue. My favourite incandescent lightbulbs are no more, and halogens are next in the banishment queue. Their replacement LEDs throw off a light so harsh I look 103 and my interior decor appears green.Petrol is, apparently, the devil’s own fuel. Despite using my combustion engine vehicles solely for high days and holy days, my weekend cars are being taxed more (and they might unfreeze fuel duty in next month’s Budget).Next, they’ll be after my swimming pool, given the huge amounts of gas monstered by the two boilers used to heat it. But my pool means I don’t have to haul my carcass three minutes down to the sea and risk catching a chill. Soon they’ll be telling me I shouldn’t concentrate so much water in one place. Or call time on the ultimate pariah-making device, my beloved five-door Aga. I leave it on 24/7, even in the summer, because there’s no better way to bake or roast a potato.Anyway, why would you want to ban coal? Setting aside its incredible industrial revolution legacy, my collection of Great Western Railway jigsaw puzzles act as a reminder of its once glorious industrial past.Our roads are clogged by the school run, minicab apps powering fleets of ghastly Toyota Priuses and belching vans delivering all our internet shoppingThe gentle fizz and pop released as you eject the contents of the scuttle into the fireplace is wondrous. It’s a slow burning fuel so there’s time for a pre-luncheon walk. The aroma that pervades is unmistakable. There’s something almost pipe-like in its quality.On a very cold day, when the air pressure is high and the temperature low, the smoke that emanates from your chimney hangs in the air wafting gently, filling your nostrils with a comforting, homely and familiar smoky perfume. Cue the cor anglais of Dvorak’s New World symphony (that’s the Hovis ad music to you).If you ban this fuel, you end another element of British life. And say goodbye to the intense warmth it generates while the final preparations can be made for a delicious lunch. I’m thinking roasted wing rib of beef, served rare, with roast potatoes (done in the Aga, obvs), Yorkshire puddings and English mustard. And no — there is not a vegan option. I do wonder if the politicians who develop these insane policies have ever left their urban landscape. So you ban burning coal and wet wood. How are you going to enforce that?And what about the ultimate pyromaniac pleasure, the garden bonfire? Is that next for a ban? Or is this an attempt by the government to finish off the coal and forestry industries once and for all?My friends are mostly an urban lot so couldn’t give two figs about a coal or wood-burning fire — unless they’re going to the pub or staying at Soho Farmhouse. They’re struggling to appease their brainwashed children by selecting hybrid or electric cars, deploying hemp shopping bags and ordering weekly “organic” veg boxes while serving a range of supper options because of this food allergy or that dietary preference.Of course they’ll fastidiously recycle every possible bottle and can, forgetting that people once used to drink water out of taps or actually chopped lettuce themselves. It’s all a nonsense, because they’re still flying to the Alps while there’s enough snow to ski or jetting off to the Maldives before they vanish under water. So how can they justify this behaviour? Carbon offset, darling! And anyway, “we’ve all got to start somewhere”.But the measures to clean up our air or reduce emissions continue to baffle me. We were told we couldn’t have diesel cars, so prices plummeted and jobs were lost. We sold our diesel cars (not to scrap, but to people who liked the idea of a cheap top-end motor) and bought new environmentally friendly ones instead that took a huge amount of energy to make.At least we save on the congestion charge, something we were told would improve the quality of the air we breathe. Yet our roads are clogged by the school run, minicab apps powering fleets of ghastly Toyota Priuses and belching vans delivering all our internet shopping.When I was growing up, we walked to school, had electric milk floats deliver milk in reusable glass bottles and turned our bog rolls and washing up liquid bottles into spaceships. Those with money never worried about conspicuous consumption unless their bank account couldn’t cope with excessive spending, travel or new stuff. How times change! Generation Z is eager to bleat on about how we’re all heading towards extinction, yet the takeaways still come to the door because Netflix can’t be disturbed and Amazon still delivers, creating even more packaging waste because it’s much more convenient. Since Jeff Bezos has set up a $10bn fund to fund climate change action, it’s all fine.Meanwhile, plastic packaging is disappearing from everything in the supermarket, leaving customers to juggle loose produce into bags they have to pay for. I always forget to take them with me when I go (I have a life, not a bag for life). And I was getting some ferocious side-eye in Pret the other morning as the only person who wasn’t clutching a mouldy looking cork-covered reusable cup. As much as I want to resist, perhaps we simply have to agree to implement these futile measures. For now, I think I’ll put half a cow and some potatoes in the oven, light the coal fire and take a chair down to the beach and see if I can stop the tide from coming in.James Max is a property expert and radio presenter.

3;WM;Waste Management;2020-02-15T05:00:52Z;Electric vehicles: battery overload;To avoid old batteries ending up in landfill sites, recycling on a huge scale will be necessary;"The scramble to electrify the world’s vehicles is storing up a problem that could give advocates a nasty shock. Safely dealing with a looming glut of used EV batteries will require a drastic expansion of current recycling facilities. The lithium-ion batteries employed in today’s electric vehicles are expected to have a useful life of up to a decade. After that, the batteries either need to be repurposed for alternative use or recycled. By 2026 global recycling needs could outstrip existing capacity by almost 10 times.Finding an alternative use is the first choice; batteries can be used in homes to store power generated from solar panels, for example. Even so that might extend their lifespan by just five years. To avoid batteries ending up in landfill sites, recycling will be necessary.A conservative eight-year estimate of battery life could mean 1.1m batteries or 274,000 tonnes of material — metals such as nickel and cobalt — globally in need of recycling or re-use by 2025. That could rise to more than 3m units or 800,000 tonnes in 2026. This would dwarf current recycling capacity, estimated at 85,000 tonnes per year evenly split between Europe and China.A new 20,000-tonne recycling facility could cost up to $200m and take at least five years to design and build, analysts estimate. Groups such as Umicore of Belgium, with existing capacity of 7,500 tonnes, should begin expanding in the next few years. Safe disposal of waste is an necessary speed bump to a hopeful, rapid take-up of electric vehicles.Is battery recycling the next boom industry? Or is the world ignoring a potential problem?

4;WM;Waste Management;2020-02-12T05:00:36Z;Surge in plastics production defies environmental backlash;Cheap shale gas has fed an investment boom in products that often end up as waste. Has the petrochemicals industry miscalculated?;"Along the banks of the Ohio River in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, giant cranes whir overhead as thousands of construction workers toil away at what will be one of the largest plastic factories in the world.Once complete, the citadel of smokestacks and pipeworks will churn out 1.6m tonnes a year of pellets for manufacturers in a wide range of industries. They will then make things such as shrink wrap, shampoo bottles and garden furniture which remain popular products in spite of an environmental backlash against plastic. The multibillion-dollar Royal Dutch Shell plant, on the site of an old zinc smelter in the American rust-belt, is the biggest investment in the state since the second world war and further evidence of a hydrocarbon-based manufacturing revival in the US.“We’re taking shale gas from the Marcellus and Utica fields [in north-east US],” says Hilary Mercer, the executive in charge of the development. “Then we’re converting it, first from ethane into ethylene, then into polyethylene.”The Ohio River complex is one of many hotspots in a 21st century plastics boom, even as consumers across the western world turn against the material.Over the past decade, an unprecedented wave of expenditure — at least $200bn, according to the American Chemistry Council — has been pledged by companies including ExxonMobil, Dow and BP for new chemical production facilities like Shell’s to take advantage of the shale rush in North America. These rock formations have gifted not just cheap natural gas, but also the raw materials for petrochemicals: the basic building blocks of products like paints, adhesives, dyes, detergents, fertilisers and, of course, plastics. At a time when the oil industry is gripped by fears that demand for petrol will collapse in an era of electric vehicles, many hydrocarbon producers are betting on petrochemicals — and in particular, plastics — to fill the gap. But doubts are emerging about the wisdom of a huge expansion in capacity that will leave the world awash in products that can take hundreds of years to decay. Images of oceans and rivers clogged up with discarded single-use plastic have raised public awareness about the impact on the environment and human health. This poses a conundrum for producers chasing maximum sales of a versatile substance for which the main ingredient is cheap and abundant.Unless it is seen to respond to these concerns, the industry risks falling foul of public opinion, changes in investor strategy or government clampdowns. Authorities from Brussels to Beijing are already imposing bans on disposable plastic items.“Plastics is the most egregious example of a gap between what the industry is expecting and what society demands,” says Kingsmill Bond, energy strategist at Carbon Tracker, a think-tank. “The risk to investors is that [plastics companies] are building for demand that may not come.”At the same time as the supply splurge, trade tensions and a weak global economy have contributed to a slump in prices for many plastic grades, squeezing profits at petrochemical producers. Campaigners fear this could hold back industry efforts to take greater responsibility for plastic waste and develop eco-friendly substitutes.Prices for high-density polyethylene, one of the biggest selling plastics, recently fell to their lowest levels in a decade in the US and China and for five years in Europe, according to ICIS, a market information service.“You have lower than expected growth, this big capacity increase and trade wars. On top of that you have the drip-drip of the plastic rubbish crisis. That’s hitting polyethylene, because most of it goes for single-use throwaway applications like plastic film, bottles and pouches,” says John Richardson, a senior consultant for Asia at ICIS. When the shale revolution took off in North America more than a decade ago, it promised a plentiful and cheap source of oil and gas that would rival Middle Eastern producers and put the US on a course towards energy independence.Just as profound was its impact on the country’s petrochemicals industry. The shale extraction method of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, generates byproducts known as natural gas liquids, among them ethane and propane. Around the US Gulf Coast new crackers, facilities where ethane and propane are broken down into smaller molecules, have sprung up. The resulting ethylene and propylene are joined up inside reactors into long-chain polymers that form the two most important commodity plastics. Polyethylene (PE) is the most common, used in everything from shopping bags to bottles, tubes and laminates. Polypropylene (PP) is found in car interiors, carpets and crisp packets. And with more output than the domestic market can absorb, US producers have turned to China and other growth economies for buyers. “Historically, North America had not been a major exporter of polyethylene for a long time, or an exporter of petrochemicals in general,” says Mark Lashier, chief executive of Chevron Phillips Chemical. “But the ability to access feedstocks like the gases coming out of the Permian [basin in south-west US] creates economics that allow North American assets to compete with anywhere in the world.”The effects have stretched as far as Europe. With North Sea oil supplies dwindling, Ineos in 2016 became the first chemicals company to ship shale-origin ethane across the Atlantic to feed its plants and is now spending €3bn on new facilities, including the continent’s first new cracker in 20 years. Yet shale is not the only factor. For oil majors, the petrochemicals business many wanted to walk away from a generation ago is now seen as a way to offset volatile oil markets.With fuel consumption in transport forecast to peak towards the end of the 2020s, it also offers the industry a hedge against the impact of electric vehicles. And as living standards rise in developing countries, plastics demand is expected to outpace wider growthin the global economy.“Petrochemicals are rapidly becoming the largest driver of global oil consumption,” said a report published by the International Energy Agency in 2018. “They are set to account for more than a third of the growth in oil demand to 2030, and nearly half to 2050.” Giant complexes costing billions of dollars are under way in Russia, India, the Middle East and China, as many integrated energy groups prioritise chemicals. South Africa’s Sasol, for instance, has declared it will not invest in any new refineries or gas-to-liquid plants because of what chief executive Fleetwood Grobler described as the “sunset of the energy industry”. “The whole megatrend with respect to urbanisation, population growth and expansion of the middle class really points to growth in chemicals, rather than the energy sector,” he says. For a period, everything came together and petrochemicals producers enjoyed record profits. But the good times are now over. ExxonMobil’s chemical business sank into a loss in the fourth quarter of last year, weaker chemicals margins contributed to a drop in earnings at Shell, and BP reported a fall in profits at its petrochemicals division. The trade war hit the plastics market just as a number of new facilities were cranking up. Chinese tariffs on certain key grades of US-made PE, imposed in August 2018, had the intended effect. American exports of the plastic to China fell in the first nine months of last year, forcing US producers to find other buyers.The surplus of material spewing on to global markets fuelled what was already a downwards trajectory in prices. Even more significant for producers is the difference between input costs and selling prices that are a proxy for profitability. Producers’ margins have almost halved in the US for high-density PE, since touching peaks in 2017. At European facilities, using naphtha as their feedstock, margins fell by more than three-quarters by the end of 2019; and were in negative territory in Asia, according to ICIS.“The outlook broadly for the chemicals market at the moment isn’t great,” says Alan Gelder of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. “Now we’re on a steep downward slope. We think margins will continue to compress for the next few years.”Hurting the most are producers in Asia which rely on more expensive, oil-derived naphtha feedstock, though even US facilities fed with ethane have seen profits contract. “Asian prices across the board for all grades of polyethylene have come down tremendously,” says Hassan Ahmed, an investment analyst at Alembic Global Advisors. “They’re sitting at break-even to negative margin levels. If those margins continue for a couple more months you will start seeing capacity curtailment and shutdowns.”Many observers see the downturn as cyclical. Demand for plastics has grown faster than for any other bulk material such as steel, aluminium or cement over the past 50 years, nearly doubling since the millennium alone, the IEA says. Yet a regulatory backlash, coupled with moves by consumer brands to increase the recycled content in their packaging, or switch into different materials like cardboard or glass, threatens to eat into demand for virgin plastic resins.China last month unveiled curbs on products like disposable and non-degradable carrier bags, plastic straws and wrapping for deliveries of online purchases. ICIS says the move could hit 9.4 per cent of what is the biggest polyethylene market. It followed an EU decision to ban single-use items such as cutlery, straws and cotton buds by 2021. With Alembic Global Advisors estimating that only 14 to 16 per cent of global waste plastic is recycled, there is reason to believe the overall impact of these measures and moves towards reuse will be muted. If that rate jumped to one-third, it would still only make a tiny dent in demand, leaving annual growth at 3.5 per cent and equivalent to 10m to 11m tonnes a year, says Mr Ahmed. “I think it’s much more a PR battle for the chemicals companies than it is an actual demand threat,” he says. In a region like Europe, packaging accounts for almost two-fifths of resin consumption. Even if demand for such products falls, the use of plastics for more durable applications — like cars, household goods and medical devices — is only set to continue rising. Critics argue that chemical companies’ spending on more sustainable materials and waste reduction programmes is a drop in the ocean, accusing the sector of a “greenwashing” campaign. The scope of state action against plastic waste is only likely to broaden, with implications for businesses in the supply chain. “We’ve only just scratched the surface of what can be done,” says Carbon Tracker’s Mr Bond. “We think [the plastics industry] is deeply vulnerable to these wider changes.”The question is whether the industry will be willing to adapt to commercially unproven chemistry after investing billions on plants that meet proven demand for conventional plastics.For Rob Buurman at Recycling Netwerk, a Dutch NGO, as long as hydrocarbon-based production continues to rise, alternative materials such as bioplastics will struggle to compete. “We have so many single-use plastics because it costs basically nothing to produce; that will make it extremely difficult to develop other types of economy that for example rely on reuse,” he says. However, there are encouraging signs. “What we’ve seen latterly is the cost of bio-based material coming down, but also the willingness of the customer to pay more because consumer demand is increasing,” says Tom Crotty, a director at Ineos. “They are willing to pay a premium, or brand owners are willing to take a hit to protect their brand image. We’re starting to see the equation work as those two things meet in the middle.”Ultimately, the goal for some companies of a closed loop from production to waste will rely on making chemical recycling a commercial reality. Unlike mechanical methods, which chop up plastic waste for melting, this breaks down polymers into their constituent molecules, and by eliminating quality issues it promises pellets of the same standard as virgin resin.Industry figures say that rather than facilities becoming redundant as a result, the more modern assets could be adapted in order to become compatible with this recycled feedstock.“That’s the goal,” says Nigel Davis of ICIS. “Taking the plastic back to the monomer to achieve sustainable production.” The chemicals industry is renewing efforts to develop sustainable alternatives to traditional plastics. First developed in the 19th century, bioplastics have once again captured the imagination of chemical engineers and start-ups. But despite the appealing sound of the name, they are not a panacea.Bio-based polymers made from renewable sources, such as sugar cane or starch, have a smaller carbon footprint than hydrocarbon-based varieties. Biodegradable plastics, meanwhile, sometimes require specific conditions to decompose. If buried deep in landfill without oxygen, some may emit methane — a powerful greenhouse gas.A key challenge is in replicating the strength and versatility of conventional plastics. But perhaps the greatest obstacle to widespread adoption of “green” plastics is not technical but economic. Their higher cost is the main reason they account for only a fraction of overall plastics production: price is the determining factor for commodity resin buyers.Even cheaper recycled plastics are rising in price due to tight supply, which could either dampen uptake or mean greater expense for brands or the consumer. For the first time in 10 years, recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used for drinks bottles became more expensive in Europe than regular PET in 2019, according to S&P Global Platts. "
5;WM;Waste Management;2020-01-16T13:52:36Z;Nestlé vows to boost spending on recycled packaging ;Consumer goods groups face growing backlash over impact of plastic pollution ;"Nestlé has pledged to spend up to $2bn to increase the use of recycled plastics in its food packaging, making the biggest public financial commitment among consumer goods giants to tackling the problem of plastic pollution. The world’s biggest food company by sales said on Thursday that it wanted to cut its use of virgin plastics, which are made using fossil fuels, by one-third by 2025, which builds on earlier commitments to make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable by then.That falls short of rival Unilever’s goal of halving its reliance on non-recycled plastics by 2025, while also reducing the amount of plastic packaging it produces annually by about 14 per cent. Unilever has not said how much it will spend on its efforts. Meanwhile family-controlled Mars is aiming for a 25 per cent cut in virgin plastic use, and PepsiCo is targeting 20 per cent for its beverage business.But most of the 66 consumer goods makers have made voluntary commitments under a project led by environmental charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which aims to create a “circular economy” for plastics in which they never become waste.Nestlé said three-quarters of the money would cover the extra cost of food-grade recycled plastics, while about $250m would be allocated to a venture capital fund to invest in sustainable packaging start-ups and advanced recycling technologies.“Making recycled plastics safe for food is an enormous challenge for our industry,” said chief executive Mark Schneider. “That is why in addition to minimising plastics use and collecting waste, we want to close the loop and make more plastics infinitely recyclable.”The moves are a sign of how looming regulations and consumer concerns about ocean pollution and climate change are prompting makers of food, drink and other consumer staples to change their practices. But experts and industry executives warn that change will be slow and costly, given that companies from different sectors from waste processing to petrochemicals need to work together, and recycling systems remain patchy globally. The world’s largest consumer groups are still using little recycled plastic in their packaging, and are very far from meeting their own green targets.Nestlé is one of the laggards; it used only 2 per cent recycled plastic in its 1.7m tonnes of plastic packaging last year. Meanwhile, Unilever is at “less than 1 per cent”, and Mars is not using any recycled material at all. Coca-Cola is the furthest along, but still managed only to use 9 per cent recycled content in the 3m tonnes of plastic packaging it churns out a year.Sander Defruyt, who heads the Ellen MacArthur plastics project, welcomed Nestlé’s moves. “The financial investment they are making is major, and the virgin plastic reduction they are targeting of roughly 500,000 tonnes a year will keep quite a few barrels of oils in the ground,” he said. “We hope more companies follow.”"
6;WM;Waste Management;2020-01-13T21:38:19Z;Pennon/Viridor: waste high;Mooted enterprise value of 18 times ebitda looks rich;There is money in those rubbish mounds. Pennon, the FTSE 250 water and waste group, reportedly hopes to sell the latter part of its business, Viridor, for around £4bn. Recycling is all the rage. Even so, a mooted enterprise value of 18 times last year’s adjusted ebitda looks rich. Talks with private equity house KKR did not result in a deal.Viridor burns waste and puts out energy. Bulls characterise it as an infrastructure asset with a steady stream of profitable, index-linked long-term contracts. Those are attractive in an era of ready cash but low returns. Viridor’s £1bn in net debt leaves scope for more leverage.There is potential for growth, too. Pennon predicts long-term demand for “energy recovery facilities” (ERFs) will exceed UK capacity by about seven million tonnes a year to 2035. Some new 23 ERFs are needed to close the gap, it says, with more sites still if recycling rates do not improve.Viridor’s valuation is going up almost as quickly as rubbish in an incinerator, however. Before the £4bn price tag was rumoured on Sunday, analysts put Viridor’s enterprise value at around £3.1bn. Three months ago after Pennon announced a strategic review the consensus figure was closer to £2.7bn. Listed waste management peers trade on less lofty multiples: Veolia at 9 times trailing earnings, Biffa at 8 times and Renewi at 6 times.Is that implicit price inflation just hot air? Earnings at Viridor have been rising. That could justify a fuller valuation. After five years of sucking up investment from South West Water, Pennon’s other business, Viridor is starting to generate cash. At a price of £3.5bn, Investec’s Martin Young puts it on a 14 times multiple, not out of line with other utilities such as National Grid and Severn Trent.That should be the top price of any buyer. Energy from waste is a more volatile business, for now, than the established utilities. Competition could impact future growth. Private equity investors may have cash to burn. They should not throw it all at Viridor.Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly. Please sign up here.
7;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
8;WM;Waste Management;2020-01-10T05:01:08Z;What happens to your old laptop? The growing problem of e-waste;Globally, we produce 50m tonnes of toxic electronic waste every year — and the UK is one of the worst offenders;"Monday morning, and a sorry bunch of tangled cables, a broken coffee machine and a single clip-on light is all there is inside the metal crates at Veolia, a noisy recycling depot where residents of the London borough of Southwark drop off broken or unwanted electrical devices. But the week has only just started. Already a family is unloading a van packed to the roof: a standing lamp with a floral shade, a microwave, a hairdryer.The depot is gateway to a countrywide recycling process. The family’s discarded items will either be handed over to charities for repair or shredded into parts and recycled, making their way back into the market as components in new electronic items.This facility is one of the biggest of its kind in the UK, and it diverts more than 95 per cent of Southwark’s waste — from more than 140,000 homes — away from landfill. Among its load, the plant processes several hundred tonnes of electronic waste — or e-waste — a year. But on a global scale, very little makes it this far.E-waste is the fastest-growing element of the world’s domestic waste stream, according to a 2017 report by the UN’s Global E-waste Monitor. Some 50m metric tonnes will be produced annually this year — about 7kg for every person in the world. Just 20 per cent will be collected and recycled.The rest is undocumented, meaning it likely ends up in landfill, incinerated, traded illegally or processed in a substandard way. That means hazardous substances spilling into the environment, poisoning the ground and people living nearby.“Once e-equipment becomes waste, it is hazardous. If you just dumped it in the environment, it would cause a problem,” says Richard Kirkman, chief technology and innovation officer at Veolia. Kirkman has spent the past 20 years working in the waste sector, and has amassed knowledge about seemingly every recycling process out there. But when he started, he says, everything was going to landfill. “Things have got much better [over time].”Heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium — commonly found in LCD screens, refrigerators and air-conditioning units — as well as chemicals such as CFCs and flame retardants found in plastics can contaminate soil, pollute water and enter the food chain.Research last year by Basel Action Network, an NGO, linked toxic e-waste shipped from Europe to contaminated chicken eggs in Agbogbloshie — a Ghanaian scrapyard where 80,000 residents subsist by retrieving metals from electrical waste. Eating just one egg from a hen foraging in the scrapyard would exceed the European Food Safety Authority’s tolerable daily intake for chlorinated dioxins 220-fold.24.9kgThe amount of e-waste the UK produced per person in 201619.4kgThe amount of e-waste the US produced per person in 20166.1kgThe amount of e-waste the world produced per person in 2016These toxic substances mean that defunct electronics are designated hazardous waste by the EU, which bans exports of this kind to non-OECD countries. But the European Environment Agency estimates that Europe still illegally exports 1.3m tonnes of e-waste each year.An investigation in 2019 by Basel Action Network found that the UK is the worst offender in Europe for illegal e-waste exports to developing countries, with most of its load going to Africa.The e-waste problem in the UK is particularly bad. The country produces 24.9kg a person a year — nearly 10kg more than the EU average, according to a recent report from the Environmental Audit Committee. In 2018, 1.2m tonnes of electrical devices were sold in the UK, and 500,000 tonnes made it to recycling centres.Some appliances are more likely to be recycled than others. The recycling rate for big appliances, such as fridges and cookers, is about 80 per cent. That is because they are harder to dispose of and eventually get picked up, even when they are dumped by the kerb. Of small appliances, however, barely one in five makes it to the recycling centre.Because items such as toasters and hairdryers fit into household bins, more often than not it is easier to chuck them than to take them to a recycling centre or arrange collection from the council over the phone. The challenge, says Kirkman, is to make all electronic items recyclable and offer easy ways to do it, such as doorstep collection.Across the world, governments are trying different ways to reduce e-waste and limit the amount that ends up in landfill. For some time, EU countries have operated a one-for-one take-back system — which means that distributors need to take back, for free, an older version of any equipment they sell you. But since the rapid rise of online retailers, this has been harder to implement.New York has RTS (Retail Track Systems), a phone app that allows customers to schedule pick-ups — or “Uber for trash”. In China, the UN Development Programme worked with internet company Baidu to develop another mobile app called Baidu Recycle, connecting users to certified disposal and recycling facilities.Most electronic waste that makes its way to the Southwark recycling centre is shipped off for more specialised treatment. Small televisions are sent to a plant in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, one of the UK’s leading dedicated e-waste processing facilities. HDPE plastics — such as those found in plastic bottles — are sent to a Dagenham plant, metals to the main reprocessing metal mills and lightbulbs go to a facility that Veolia operates in Limay, outside Paris.“There are lots of different types of plastic in a coffee maker,” says Kirkman, which can complicate the process. In the end, all e-waste needs to be reduced to core metals. “It’s a bit like a mining activity,” he says.Recycling facilities must adapt all the time. For example, one tonne of fluorescent tubes currently pass through Veolia every year, to be processed in its facility in France. There, the ends are cut off, the insides sucked out and its mercury dust is recycled to make new lightbulbs.But in a few years’ time, LED lightbulbs will start to be brought in to the recycling centre (their lifespan is about 10 years — and they have been popular for about seven years). A completely new process will need to be designed to deal with them. Every now and then, Kirkman says, the company reaches a “tipping point” — and all the machinery and tech has to be replaced.In a plant in the Midlands, robots have been programmed to dismantle flatscreen TVs, extracting precious metals such as cobalt or lithium, whose deposits are limited and increasingly valuable. “One of the hardest things about recycling is that you are not sure how [the manufacturers] made it,” says Kirkman.Veolia is trying to encourage companies to include this information on their devices. It could be a file with instructions readable by robots that could then proceed with the dismantling, making the process “easier, cheaper and more circular”. However, manufacturers have so far kept a close guard on the design of their products.Many pressure groups and lawmakers have concluded that improving recycling rates will not be sufficient to tackle the global e-waste problem. Increasingly, they are advocating for the right to repair. In October, the EU adopted a package of design measures to make household appliances more repairable.Starting from March 2021, manufacturers selling certain household appliances will have to ensure that spare parts are available for a number of years after their product has launched; that their items can be easily disassembled (and so use screws not glue); and that they provide access to technical information to repair professionals. The rules cover appliances including refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers and televisions. But they do not extend to IT equipment such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones.The move is ambitious, says Chloé Fayole, programme and strategy director at ECOS, a network of 49 environmental NGOs in Brussels that campaigns for the right to repair. But ECOS’s next challenge is to push for the rules to extend to IT products, so that smartphones and laptops can be repaired and their batteries replaced more easily. “The road to a new product is very easy, and the road to a successful repair very difficult,” says Martine Postma, founder and director of Repair Café International Foundation, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. Since its first repair event in Amsterdam in 2009, the organisation has grown to nearly 2,000 repair groups in 35 countries around the world.Now, it wants to collect more data about electronic gadgets, to see if it can plot “weak points” in design that could help manufacturers make them more repairable.So far, their data shows the Philips Senseo coffee machine is the most common item brought in to Dutch Repair Cafés. “It appears there is often the same thing that breaks in the coffee machine,” says Postma — a component in the water tank.Philips says it was already aware of the fault when the Repair Café contacted them about it; and that all Senseo models made from the third quarter of 2014 no longer have this problem.In a room off the high street in Tooting, south London, an army of fixers is busy helping people give their electronics a longer life. “Where there are children around, there’s always going to be something stuck inside,” says Mike Grahn, as he pores over the broken CD player he is slowly dismantling. Grahn is “head fixer” at the event, where volunteers mend broken consumer electronic equipment for free.Welcome to a new newsletter for smart people interested in the property market and curious about design, architecture and interiors. Every Friday, in your inbox.Sign up here with one clickThe machine’s owner is a father of two little boys, who are playing happily nearby. After a few minutes of fiddling, Grahn pulls a tatty playing card from the disc drive. “Aha!”The event is co-organised by the Restart Project, which operates in nearly 150 locations around the world, half of which are in the UK. “It is about improving our relationship with electronics,” says Janet Gunter, project co-founder and an activist in what she calls “ICT4D” — information technology for development. She started Restart in 2012 with a friend after becoming upset by attitudes to domestic electronic waste.Its efforts are now focused on laptops. “We are going through and categorising the software and hardware faults to see what reduces the life cycle of these products,” says Gunter. She hopes their findings will help regulators come up with new requirements.Both Gunter and Postma are confident that the data-collection exercise will have an impact on policy and manufacturing. Postma points out that, thanks to the efforts of organisations such as hers, the idea of a circular economy is becoming more popular, and repairs more mainstream, no longer the preserve of hardcore environmentalists and activists. “Now is the time when the change has to really start happening.”LCD TVs contain fluorescent backlights. When these are recycled, robots extract any hazardous substances, such as mercury, from them and segregate the TVs’ different plastics, metals and the circuit board. Many of these elements can be reprocessed and used in new products.The refrigerants — fluids and oil inside the motor — are drained and the motor itself is cut out and recycled. Then, in a sealed oxygen-free chamber, the gases from the fridge’s insulation foam are extracted. Next, the fridge is shredded in a machine resembling a big kitchen blender.Batteries are first shredded or hammered (depending on their size) and the contents are then submerged in caustic water to neutralise the electrolytes. Metals are recovered and sold. The solution is filtered so that the carbon can be recovered and pressed into sheets.The lithium from the solution is converted into lithium carbonate in the form of fine white powder. After further processing, it is used to make sulphur-dioxide batteries.Follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.

9;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Supporting your local high street is the easiest way to go green;Buying online might be tempting but we cannot be sustainable without some inconvenience;There’s nothing like the holiday period to make you realise just how big your environmental footprint is. From the endless packaging, wrapping paper and wasted food to the electricity commandeered by festive lighting, for many, Christmas is a time when consumption is celebrated for consumption’s sake. But this Christmas I learnt how to keep a check on it all without wanting, Scrooge-like, to destroy the holiday altogether. Forgoing online shopping on sites like Amazon and Ocado in favour of the local high street can make a real difference in terms of plastic consumption, fuel expenditure and the purchase of excess food that is never eaten.Supporting the shops on your high street as much as you can is probably one of the easiest and greenest things you can do. Especially if, like me, you only live a five-minute walk away and are able-bodied enough to carry groceries. There’s no doubt it’s expensive relative to the bargains you can get online or in car-friendly supermarkets. But, as we are finally learning, there is more to the cost of produce than simply the price.There are also worthwhile offsets based on the sheer friction of having to go to the high street and carry your purchases home. Click-happy impulse purchases don’t happen when you’re limited to what you can comfortably transport in person. That makes shopping more informed and discerning, saving on waste.There are other advantages, too.If you’re lucky, the local grocer, fishmonger, butcher and delicatessen will provide a fantastic range of seasonal local produce, which saves on the energy expended in flying in stuff from halfway across the world. What’s more, goods are often freely displayed and then wrapped in biodegradable paper for taking home. Compare and contrast that with the huge amounts of packaging and fuel expended in online delivery. From the endless cardboard boxes to the polystyrene and bubble wrap on non-perishable purchases and the never-ending single-use plastic on anything fresh. Then consider unbundled deliveries, which can see products ordered simultaneously delivered separately and at different times. And last but not least, the fact that the information technology sector, especially servers, uses huge amounts of power in its own right, pushing it close to the levels consumed by the airline industry. If shopping on Amazon makes you feel guilty (and it should, since the company emitted 44.4m metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2018), but you go ahead with it anyway for convenience’s sake, it is worth considering that it’s very unlikely we can move ahead with environmental goals without making our lives more inconvenient. Inconvenience is at the heart of sustainability. Former US vice-president Al Gore inadvertently acknowledged this when he named his 2006 climate awareness film An Inconvenient Truth.Convenience, however, is relative. If we all slow down together to compensate for the additional time needed to do things more sustainably, there’s nothing really lost in terms of relative performance. On the contrary, there are benefits to be gained as well.My grandmother used to buy sauerkraut from large reusable barrels in local markets in Poland. She’d bring her own glass jar for the purpose. She’d then pop along the high street to source food for the next few days, taking it all home in her granny trolley. In doing so, she not only did her shopping, she got the lowdown on what was happening in the local community. She also enjoyed a sense of belonging and purpose and got some very useful moderate exercise.All of this suggests that supporting the local high street should become the green thing to do. By helping to foster a sense of local community, it gives people a vested interest in maintaining and looking after the local habitat. It’s not that we have to entirely abandon online convenience. Just that we have the means and choice to be flexible. Simply doing a bit more shopping on the high street is enough to make a difference.So let 2020 be the year the high street makes a comeback for the environment’s sake. The revival of the granny shopping trolley is optional.izabella.kaminska@ft.comFor many of us, ‘shop local’ isn’t an option / From Dr Jennifer M. Jones, Hunts Cross, Liverpool, UK
10;WM;Waste Management;2019-12-30T00:01:16Z;Ethical sales rise as UK consumers go sustainable;Research by the Co-op shows tenfold increase in two decades;Sales of ethical goods and services in the UK have increased almost tenfold in 20 years to hit record highs, according to the Co-operative Group.The retailer said consumer spending on sustainable products reached £29.7bn in 2018, up from £3.1bn in 1999 when it first started tracking them. Overall household consumption has merely doubled in that period while inflation rose 52 per cent, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.Jo Whitfield, Co-op Food chief executive, said consumers had persuaded businesses to embrace everything from free range eggs to Fairtrade bananas. Governments have pushed them to buy energy efficient lightbulbs and clean energy with bans or subsidies.Ms Whitfield said: “We should rightly celebrate the growth that we’ve seen in ethical markets in the UK over the last 20 years.“UK businesses and NGOs [non governmental organisations] have pioneered many of these developments and today we have multibillion pound markets that either didn’t exist or if they did, other mainstream businesses were unconvinced of their potential to succeed.”There are some warning signs. Although sales of alternative-fuelled vehicles grew in 2018 to £3.6bn from £3.1bn in 2017, sales of the most fuel efficient diesel and petrol cars fell by £312m as more people opted for SUVs, which give out greater volumes of CO2 than medium-sized and battery powered cars.Sales of Fairtrade products, which guarantee a minimum price to producers, also dropped in 2018 by 7.5 per cent to £1.6bn as retailers ditched the official standard on some products in favour of their own schemes. The Co-op’s ethical spending figures include vegan and organic food, sustainable fish, ethically sourced cosmetics, second hand clothing and bicycles. As well as using retail sales data, it surveys a panel of 2,000 people. Its headline data include spending in charity shops, donations to sustainability charities such as green groups and money that customers said they actively chose to spend on the local high street rather than online or out of town.Those categories have increased from £8.1bn in 1999 to £11.5bn since 1999. “Back in 1999 community and charity spending made up the bulk of the total. It was often the only way to shop ethically. Now there are so many opportunities,” said Co-op. The Co-op has also announced it is to recycle plastic film for the first time. Few local authorities collect items such as crisp packets and the wrap used on vegetables and ready meals because it is hard to deal with.The Co-op, which produces more than 750m pieces of plastic film each year, said that from the summer it will collect used plastic from its own stores to take to a recycler. Only a fifth of the 2.3m tonnes of plastic placed on the UK market every year is being recycled, with 1.2m tonnes of plastic packaging used for consumer goods ending up in landfill.
11;WM;Waste Management;2019-12-05T04:00:35Z;Why ‘zero landfill’ remains a distant dream for computers;A lot of corporate kit can be recycled, although ever sleeker designs don’t help;"When Margaret Thatcher cut the ribbon on the new Crittal Windows headquarters in Braintree, Essex, in 1990 — one of her last acts as UK prime minister — few would have foreseen that the huge facility would one day specialise in handling a different type of windows.The East Anglian factory is now one of the largest facilities for refurbishing, breaking up and recycling old corporate computing hardware, as well as wiping off old software, such as Microsoft Windows, from the hard drives. RDC, the company that owns the site, handles more than 1m computer items a year. Between 75 per cent and 85 per cent of the old kit is spruced up and resold; much of the rest is broken up for parts.Old computers make up only a portion of the annual 50m-tonne global e-waste pile but, like smartphones, the rapid rise in consumer demand for faster models, brighter screens and flashier designs means that the lifespan of the average office desktop and consumer laptop is getting shorter. That rapid turnover, combined with the possibility of recycling a significant proportion of each machine, opens a potentially viable niche within the circular economy — and RDC is not alone in hoping to fill it.Restore, one of RDC’s rivals, is a listed business that specialises in storing boxes of old documents in locations such as cold-war aircraft hangars. It also handles office moves, including the FT’s recent return to its former headquarters near St Paul’s Cathedral in London, and offers IT recycling services.Anyone walking past the old FT office on the banks of the Thames after the move would have seen cages full of old computers that had been scanned and tagged and were ready to be sent to Restore’s factory in Bedford, where they would be cleaned up and resold or broken up for parts. Anything particularly decrepit would go straight to Southampton to be shipped to Germany and smelted down to extract the copper and gold from the old circuit boards.That does not mean second-hand computers are a gold mine. Charles Bligh, Restore’s chief executive, says a computer’s value drops to a fifth of its original price within a year. Laptops in particular can prove to be worthless if the customer wants the hard drive to be not only wiped but drilled through.Restore turns around about half a million items a year in Bedford to put back into the system. Mr Bligh estimates that the UK IT resale market is worth £350m, with Restore accounting for £20m. It has sought to expand by acquiring specialist companies to recycle the microwaves and fridges that businesses also abandon when they relocate.Gerry Hackett, who runs RDC, agrees that there is a massive circular economy opportunity coming “straight off the bat” in computing but cautions that stitching together a global IT value recovery player is not simple.Mr Hackett ran a travelling second-hand computer auction in the 1980s that proved so successful that at one point his company was named as a top 20 PC maker due to the amount of equipment it was reselling. Yet, he found that he was increasingly left with job lots of “old toot” that he ended up paying local people to get rid of. It is a problem that has persisted even as the equipment has become more sophisticated.Almost 260m PCs were shipped in 2018, so it remains a huge market for the IT industry. Yet computers are still not designed to be reused or recycled, according to the specialists who do the work. If anything, the thinner and smaller designs that have emerged in recent years make refurbishment harder, as disassembling and replacing parts in such sleek devices is more time-consuming.Mr Hackett argues that, despite the positive stories about the reuse of metals mined from e-waste, hard plastic still represents a problem for anyone in the second-hand market claiming to have a “zero landfill policy”.Companies such as Coolrec, a division of UK listed company Renewi, use hard plastic chipped out of e-waste to make vacuum cleaners and coffee machines. But it is not yet financially viable for the plastic byproducts from old computer keyboards, mice and monitors to be made usable in this way. Much of the plastic goes to fuel the smelting furnaces — in Germany and elsewhere — that extract the metals from old devices.Mr Hackett says that UK companies used to ship millions of tonnes of plastic to China, which has now stopped accepting it. “That is a fundamental problem. There are holes in that recycling story,” he says.Regulators have long taken an interest in e-waste and monitor UK ports for attempts to smuggle out containers of broken monitors. Companies are required to wipe data from computers, which drives a lot of equipment to the specialist companies; so too does the EU’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, introduced in 2003, which makes electronics manufacturers and distributors responsible for disposing of old kit.Mr Bligh predicts further progress in refurbishing and recycling old computers, but says that tackling the problem of e-waste still requires a shift in thinking away from the “‘this is no longer our problem’ mentality” of many consumers and businesses.“The stats are horrifying. This needs to be a more regulated industry, which is a strange thing for a chief executive to say, but there are a lot of rogue operators,” he says. “Companies themselves need to take the environmental side of this seriously.”"
12;WM;Waste Management;2019-12-05T04:00:35Z;Fashion that’s tailored for a fragile planet;A new cohort of consumers is looking for clothes that don’t wreck the environment;"In a lab outside Cambridge, England, lives an earthworm who is too skinny. His guardians, scientists Bas Boots and Dannielle Green, explain the reason: earthworms in soil that contains microplastics — defined as fragments of plastic that are less that 5mm in size — show stunted growth.Underweight earthworms point to a bigger problem, say the scientists, who work at Anglia Ruskin University. Ecosystems are becoming less healthy because of a pollutant that researchers are only now beginning to understand. A study published in April, for example, found that plastic particles are carried by the wind even to remote and supposedly pristine areas.Microplastics come from various places, but clothing is a significant source. When you wash a fleece jacket, hundreds of thousands of microplastic fragments break off and head down the drain. A 2017 analysis by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that clothes release half a million tons of microfibres into the ocean every year.The waste problem in fashion is on an almost unfathomable scale. One garbage truck full of clothing is incinerated or deposited into a landfill every second, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity whose mission is to promote the circular economy. Some luxury brands deliberately burn unsold stock, rather than discounting it, in order to preserve their exclusivity: in 2018 British fashion house Burberry noted in its annual report that it had “physically destroyed” £28.6m in unsold goods, prompting outrage from investors and environmentalists.In response, Burberry announced that it would instead expand its efforts to reuse, donate or recycle its unsold stock. That is only fitting for a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative, which aims to make the clothing industry adopt circular-economy principles.This involves more than donating unwanted items to the charity shop. Everything from materials and dyes to manufacturing and distribution needs to be conceived with a renewable life­cycle in mind. “Clothes that go on the market need to be made from safe and renewable materials if the aim is that the [material] used stays within the economy,” says Francois Souchet, the head of Make Fashion Circular. That may mean steering away from blended fabrics, which are harder to recycle than pure cotton or pure nylon garments.“The key thing is, on the one side you want to get the products and materials right,” Mr Souchet says. “You also want to get the business side right, so the industry can work without relying on producing ever more products.”A study by McKinsey, the management consultancy, found that 78 per cent of sourcing managers said sustainability would be a significant factor considered by consumers purchasing mass-market apparel. Businesses ignore such attitudes at their peril.Last year Reebok introduced a line of footwear made from plant-based materials that are sustainably sourced and biodegradable. “In the not so distant past, people would dismiss sustainability by saying, ‘everyone wants it but no one wants to pay for it’,” says Bill McInnis, head of Reebok Future. “That was likely true a few years ago, but we’re seeing this new generation of consumers beginning to demand it.”Mr Souchet thinks basics offer the biggest opportunity for more durable fashion. “Essentials are a very large part of what the industry is producing,” he says. “Not the quick, trendy side of fashion.”One business focusing on that area is Teemill, based on the Isle of Wight. A platform that allows other brands to print and create their own garments, it prides itself on operating its own circular economy. Most of its clothes are jersey cotton basics. “Tees, tops and pants are all made out of jersey,” says co-founder Mart Drake-Knight. “We’re not going to take on sequins.”Mr Drake-Knight and his brother, Rob, founded their original T-shirt brand, Rapanui, in 2008 because they could not find clothing that did not harm the environment. The small operation was based in their parents’ garden, and had only limited resources. “We literally could not afford waste,” Mr Drake-Knight recalls.Teemill allows Rapanui’s supply chain and technology to be used more widely; the company takes a percentage of each item ordered. “It’s naive to think that everyone in the world is going to stop and buy Rapanui,” Mr Drake-Knight says. “If you want something to be utilised, you have to share it.”Some luxury brands burn unsold stock, rather than discounting it, in order to preserve their exclusivityInstead of building up stock, Teemill produces an article of clothing only when it has been ordered. Sizing options are explicitly defined online and refined in the light of customer data, which cuts the number of returns. “People have a good sense of what size they think they are, but [high street] brands have a really bad idea,” Mr Drake-Knight says.When a Teemill item reaches the end of its life, a code on the care tag generates a mailing label so that it can be posted back; Teemill then gives credit towards a future order. Each worn item that is returned is broken down and remilled into second-generation clothing. Because cotton fibres shorten with reprocessing, the thread is slightly thicker, and the shirts are heavier.“It’s a massive, obsessive engineering product that’s designed out all the waste,” says Mr Drake-Knight. Citing the theory of marginal gains, he says it is not one single process change that has made Teemill sustainable: “It’s 50 things that make you one per cent better.”His philosophy is echoed by Cyndi Rhoades of Worn Again, another UK business that is trying to apply circular-economy principles to clothing. “It’s an ecosystem of all the players in the textile supply chain, the brand, and the consumers,” she says. “We can’t have circularity unless consumers return textiles into circulation.”Worn Again is developing techniques for turning both pure and blended polyester and cotton textiles back into their original materials, with dyes and contaminants stripped out on the way. It plans to allow its technology to be licensed by other businesses. Ms Rhoades believes textiles are one of the most important frontiers in the circular fashion economy, because less than 1 per cent of recycled textiles are converted into new, wearable materials; instead they are “downcycled” into insulation and other products.“If we can create a process that uses textiles as feedstock for new textiles, then we wouldn’t have to use virgin materials ever again,” she says.That goal remains some way off, which has made funding tricky at times. But as sustainability becomes an increasingly hot-button issue, she is optimistic about the circular economy’s biggest challenge: getting consumers to participate. “There is no circular if we keep throwing stuff away,” she says.Mr Drake-Knight says he is excited by how fast the circular economy model is taking off. “H&M and Adidas say they’re going to be circular by 2030, but we’ve already done it, and lots of start-ups are starting to do it.”Last year Teemill shipped 1m T-shirts. “We’ve proven that you can do circular economy at scale,” Mr Drake-Knight says.This article has been amended since first publication to reflect the fact that, at the time Burberry burned its unused stock, it had already committed itself to pursue environmental sustainability and to reduce waste"
13;WM;Waste Management;2019-12-05T04:00:35Z;Can we overcome the curse of the single-use sachet?;Businesses say they are willing, but a circular economy for plastics is a tough goal;"In the Philippines, a social enterprise called Green Antz Builders has developed a system to turn the small plastic sachets that wash up and litter the archipelago’s beaches into dark grey bricks, which can then be used to build schools and homes.The start-up pays people from local communities to gather up the empty single-use packets of shampoo, toothpaste, detergent and coffee that have become a waste scourge and turns them into something useful.The Green Antz project is an elegant solution built on the principles of the so-called circular economy, which refers to a system in which materials and products keep their value by being reused or recycled rather than thrown away. But its small scale means that it cannot offset the damage caused by consumer goods giants such as Nestlé and Unilever that continue to market products in single-use plastic packaging.The sachet, which was created to serve low-income people in developing countries, has become a symbol of the global plastic crisis. Given their small size and plastic-metal laminate composition, it is not economical to recycle sachets; instead they often leak into the environment, adding to the plastic clogging the oceans, or ending up in landfills.The companies say they are looking for fixes, such as experimenting with new designs and materials, piloting reuse schemes, and funding the development of advanced recycling technologies. But none has agreed to phase out single-serve sachets, on the grounds that they facilitate access in poor countries and that alternatives could cause even greater greenhouse gas emissions.Whether the industry can fix the sachet problem will be a key test of whether it is really possible to create a circular economy for plastics — and of whether the sustainability promises made by consumer goods companies and packaging makers are mere greenwashing.“Sachets are the most visible face of litter in any developing market,” admits Pradeep Banerjee, who heads the supply chain for Unilever’s Indian subsidiary. “But they are [a] very efficient means to get items of everyday use to remote areas of the country . . . if you have to transport one litre of a fluid, a plastic bottle would give 10 times the carbon footprint of a lighter sachet. It’s not going to be an easy nut to crack.”If the sachet is among the hardest types of plastic packaging to which to apply a circular economy model, one of the easiest should be the plastic bottle, pumped out by the millions of tons a year by companies such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Danone. That is because it is standardised, made out of a simple material — PET — and has a resale value.Although PET has a higher recycling rate than any other type of plastic, only 7 per cent of it is recycled into bottles — the rest is “down-cycled” into industrial uses in carpets or apparel. Globally, less than half of PET bottles are actually collected for recycling, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a non-profit that is leading a cross-industry project to promote a circular economy for plastics. That is better than the average, however: only 14 per cent of plastic packaging is collected for recycling globally, and the figure drops further when losses during sorting and reprocessing are factored in. In the end, only about 5 per cent of the value of plastic packaging is retained for subsequent use.In contrast, the global recycling rate for paper stands at 58 per cent, while that for iron and steel is between 70 and 90 per cent.It is a far cry from the vision of a true circular economy for plastics. But Sander Defruyt, who heads the Ellen MacArthur New Plastics Economy project, which began four years ago, says he sees signs that change is afoot. About 400 consumer goods makers, packaging producers, retailers, and recycling companies have signed up to voluntary commitments to spur more recycling, reuse and reduction of plastic through to 2025. “We started by bringing the whole value chain together,” he says. “There is a lot of preparative work happening behind the scenes.”New technologies known as chemical recycling may offer solutions if their cost can be brought down. Unlike traditional mechanical recycling, which grinds plastic into pieces that can be used to make new items — which is what Green Antz does — chemical recycling breaks plastics down into their constituent polymers. This overcomes many of the shortcomings of traditional recycling, where the material that results is not as clear or as strong as virgin plastic.Small companies such as Carbios of France and Loop Industries of Canada are working on these techniques, as are big businesses including Unilever and Nestlé. Some are collaborating: the chemicals giant Dow will use a new technique developed by Dutch company Fuenix Ecogy Group to “crack” plastic into a form that can be used in a fresh round of manufacturing. Jeff Wooster, Dow’s global sustainability director, says the partnership shows how things are changing in the industry.“Today we only have a small offering of products that are made of recycled content, but we are serious about expanding it and making this a real business,” he says. “Dow’s end goal is to transform our business model to be in line with circular economy principles, as many companies are trying to do.”They will have their work cut out. While Mr Defruyt of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation insists that substantial change must be achieved in the next few years, he acknowledges the scale of the task. “There is no real handbook for how to change a global industry,” he says."
14;WM;Waste Management;2019-12-02T00:01:16Z;Tories plastic waste pledge a ‘half measure’, say action groups;Greenpeace says more drastic action needed to stop rubbish dumping on poorer nations;The Conservative party’s election manifesto pledge to ban the export of plastic waste to developing countries has been criticised as a “half measure” that would do little to stop the UK “offshoring” its rubbish.The Tories have promised to ban exports of plastic waste to countries not in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by an unspecified date.With the UK’s general election less than two weeks away all the UK’s parties are vowing to step up their commitment to tackling climate change and other environmental issues in a bid to attract younger voters.But campaign groups said the commitment by the Tories on plastic waste was not firm enough.Sam Chetan-Welsh, senior political adviser at Greenpeace, said: “If this government really wants to stop dumping plastic garbage on other countries, then we should have plastic reduction targets enshrined in law.”The majority of the UK’s plastic waste now goes to members of the group of 36 OECD countries, which include Turkey, Mexico and Chile. In the year to September, these countries imported 62 per cent of Britain’s unwanted plastic, up from 37 per cent in the same period last year.Turkey took the most plastic waste of any country worldwide, doubling its imports compared with last year to 106,471 tonnes — more than a quarter of the UK’s total unwanted plastic. The latest OECD data, from 2017, shows that Turkey sends 90 per cent of waste to landfill.Tim Grabiel, a lawyer at the Environmental Investigation Agency, said it was “no secret that countries such as Turkey have limited infrastructure and capacity to deal with the plastic waste crossing into their borders in an environmentally and socially responsible manner.”The Tories “could and should have gone much further” by banning exports to all countries without developed recycling capacities, he added.Labour and the Liberal Democrats pledged to end all plastic waste exports, though only the Lib Dems set a deadline, of 2030.The world generates 2bn tonnes of waste every year, only 13.5 per cent of which is recycled, according to the World Bank. Nevertheless, exporting waste has become big business, with countries sending what they don’t want to others who sort and process it for recycling, reuse or to be used as fuel.But material sent overseas often ends up in landfill or strewn across beaches if countries are overwhelmed by how much arrives, errors are made or the waste is unusable.In 2017, China — formerly the centre of the global recycling trade — abruptly banned the import of certain waste products, including plastics, because too much “dirty” or “hazardous” waste was arriving. Malaysia, which was the biggest importer of the UK’s plastic waste in 2018, started sending shipments back this year.Julian Kirby, lead plastic pollution campaigner at charity Friends of the Earth, said being a high-income country “certainly does not guarantee that you’re dealing with waste properly.”Defra declined to comment, citing purdah rules during the general election campaign. The Conservative Party did not respond to a request for comment.
15;WM;Waste Management;2019-11-17T15:12:14Z;Nuclear liabilities need to be put in clearer perspective;Clean-up and waste storage are not the barriers they sometimes seem;"“Everyone knows that midday desert sun can be harmful if you live in it without protection,” wrote David MacKay, the late scientific adviser to the UK energy department, “And everyone knows that moonlight is essentially harmless.”Yet moonlight and sunshine are made up of the same photons. The former is simply harmless because it is 400,000 times less bright than sunshine.“Nuclear radiation can be like sunlight, and it can be like moonlight,” Prof MacKay noted. “There are levels of radiation that are lethal, and levels of radiation that are essentially harmless.” The key lies in discerning which is which.This may seem uncontroversial; a mere recital of well-worn scientific fact. But you won’t find much trace of it in the public debate about nuclear power. Here, radiation is always “harmful” or “toxic”, and the risks and liabilities associated with handling such material seen as prone to balloon without control.Hence the gnawing worries about the back-end costs of dismantling old facilities and the risks associated with storing spent fuel for substantial periods. These threaten to stifle future investment in nuclear technology. But how realistic are these fears?Let’s start with the costs of cleaning up old facilities. Admittedly, Britain’s record in this area is poor. The estimated cost of decommissioning the first generation of facilities — a task far from complete — stands at about £120bn. That is a pretty vast bill when you think the Magnox stations only generated about a tenth of the UK’s electricity in those early years.But it is worth also looking at where this number comes from. About three-quarters relates to the experimental and military facilities constructed at Sellafield in Cumbria in the 1940s and 1950s. These used processes that left big nuclear messes and were built without much thought to how they would ever be dismantled. The priority was manufacturing fissile material for nuclear bombs.Britain also provided for this obligation in the most expensive manner possible. Rather than create a sinking fund to pay for the clean-up, it left the tab for future taxpayers to meet.Future decommissioning will be done more rationally. The switch from idiosyncratic early reactor designs to widely used ones makes the facilities more dismantlable. The UK’s next planned reactors — at Hinkley Point in Somerset — will have a sinking fund from day one to provide for the clean-up — a job its owner, French state-backed energy utility EDF, estimates can be done for about 3 per cent of revenues (£2 to £3 per MWh) over their 60-year life.Sceptics may quibble that we can’t know that this can actually be done. But a glance at the US (where 14 plants have now been decommissioned) suggests it is not unreasonable.Despite collecting between just $1 to $2 per MWh — less than the Hinkley number — utilities have assembled two-thirds of the sum needed to decommission the entire US fleet over the next two to three decades. An industry has sprung up competing to pull down old reactors. In a recent deal, a decommissioning company, Holtec, took over a plant at Oyster Creek, New Jersey, lock stock and barrel, on the basis that the accumulated fund would pay for the job.Of course, decommissioning is only one part of the story. In many ways the bigger barrier to a sustainable nuclear industry is the absence of somewhere to put the high-level waste. Many countries, including Britain, have failed to persuade local communities that depositaries buried deep underground can be safe in the long term. That is because of fears about storing material that could remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. But without such facilities, it is hard to see the industry surviving in the long run.And here is where MacKay and the science come back in. It’s one of nuclear’s paradoxes that the most dangerous radiation comes from isotopes with very short half-lives that hence decay rapidly. Those that last longest don’t emit much radiation.To see how little, take some analysis the Finnish authorities did when they did secure agreement for a national depositary a few years ago (the first country to do so).The Finns looked at the impact of waste leaking from the facility after 1,000 years on someone living directly above it, whose food and water all came from the most contaminated plot of land. The conclusion? That person was likely to receive a dose of 0.00018 millisieverts per year; equivalent to the radiation from eating two bananas.Nuclear power may not be without risk. But it remains one of the few technologies the world presently has for reliably generating zero-carbon electricity. Even renewables generate their own pollution. And unlike radioactive isotopes, the harmful chemicals in solar panels do not quickly decay.Decommissioning and storage should be manageable problems. It would be bizarre to scrap nuclear over what are prejudices, not real costs and risks.Uncertainties surround spent nuclear fuel disposal / From Dr Paul Dorfman, et al"
16;WM;Waste Management;2019-11-01T05:00:46Z;Forget fast fashion, would you wear food waste fashion?;Corn husks, mushrooms and even potatoes are being converted into green clothes and accessories;"Every two years, people go for an eye test and their prescription changes and they chuck away their old frames and get new ones,” says Tom Broughton, founder of the London-based eyewear brand Cubitts. “Most glasses are made from cellulose acetate, so even though it’s not plastic it’s not from Mother Earth and doesn’t biodegrade. We’ve been looking for an alternative to acetate.”Waste not, want not, so the age-old adage goes. It’s certainly true for Broughton, who recently unveiled a 10-piece collection of opticals and sunglasses crafted from waste materials including corn husks and mushrooms in a bid to reduce his brand’s impact on the planet. Due to appear in stores in January, the Cubitts Redux line includes chunky round spectacles with a corrugated surface that look a bit like they could be crafted from wood (they’re actually made from corn starch), and rectangular frames with a textured mid-brown finish that are derived from potatoes and old coffee grounds. “The potatoes come from a company that works with McCain’s chip offcuts,” he says.Single-use plastics and discarded fishing nets were among the first materials to be recycled into luxury products, but now food waste is getting the sustainable spin. US designer Mara Hoffman crafts all her buttons from tree nuts, while Hugo Boss and Veja sell sneakers made from repurposed pineapple leaves and corn starch, and Italian start-up Orange Fiber makes silk from scraps of citrus peel which has been used for Salvatore Ferragamo’s slinky floral printed scarves and dresses.Stella McCartney, who has long been a champion of sustainable alternative fabrics, has recently partnered with Bolt Threads, a Californian company that was last year valued at $700m and makes buttery vegan leathers out of mushrooms. For spring/summer 2019, McCartney offered gauzy vests and T-shirts crafted from vegan silk made from yeast, and leather trousers in earthy mustards and burgundy hues.Meanwhile, LVMH’s wine and spirits platform Clos19 has teamed up with London charity Refettorio Felix to host supper clubs where stellar chefs such as Skye Gyngell serve up three-course dinners using only waste produce — tickets cost £90, and each event sells out almost instantly. It’s a movement happening across different lifestyle categories from dining to beauty and fashion. “Food waste is definitely trending right now,” says Lisa Carolan, founder of the first waste-free wellness resort Our Retreat, in Sardinia; she introduced a waste-free policy after discovering that 1.3bn tons of food is wasted annually. (The figure is expected to rise to 2.2bn by 2025, according to the United Nations.) From upwards of £1,450, guests can enjoy six days of mindfulness, meditation and day trips out to sea on a private yacht, accompanied by lunches that use up leftovers from the night before. “Carrot salads are made into vegan cakes, avocado is blitzed into guacamole, leftover raw cauliflower salad can be made into pizza base,” says Carolan. “We’ve had a positive response from our guests.”Clos19’s supper clubs — and Cubitts’ glasses — salvage what would “otherwise go in the dustbin,” says Clos19’s founder Stéphanie Watine Arnault. She adds, “I was horrified when I learnt the statistics that one-third of the food grown or produced in the world is discarded.” She says her luxury supper clubs help to change people’s attitudes around waste by turning it into meals made by Michelin-starred chefs. “We work with suppliers [to source food] which can’t be sold — this can be as simple as incorrect size, shape or cut,” she says. “For me, these supper clubs show that with a little more thought we can all minimise how much we trash.”The growing demand for natural skincare and plastic-free packaging has seen the beauty industry wake up to waste too. Earlier this year, The Body Shop unveiled a collection of cleansers and moisturisers crafted from organic, wonky carrots that are too crooked to sell in supermarkets. Cowshed’s packaging is made from repurposed sugar cane while London-based brands UpCircle and MontaMonta have both partnered with coffee shops across the British capital to turn used coffee grounds into scrubs and serums that are sold at Cult Beauty and Liberty. Coffee is rich in antioxidants, and the caffeine is said to also boost collagen production. The grounds are readily available — according to Allegra World Coffee Portal, analysts of the global sector, the UK coffee trade was worth £10.1bn in 2018, with independent outlets serving 10.5m cups of coffee per week.“The supply of the material is plentiful,” says Broughton, of his potato glasses — one of his most successful product trials based on its likeness to acetate in terms of durability and mouldability. “Particularly in this country, we eat a lot of chips. Chips Board, the clever company we work with, take the stuff that’s too small to constitute a chip by McCain’s standards and turn it into board using heat and pressure,” he says. Helmed by four recent graduates, the London-based start-up company normally make the boards for computer processors. “On its own, the material looks nice-ish,” he says. “You wouldn’t say it was beautiful, but you wouldn’t think it looks like potatoes either. We experimented with other materials to make it look more interesting — we sprinkled coffee grounds into it which made it a bit more prismatic and to give texture. He adds, “the appearance is really important, because there’s no point making something from an alternative material like mushrooms if no one wants to wear it.”Using food waste in fashion has its downsides, though. Broughton’s mushroom glasses didn’t pass the brand’s standards testing; the material — called mycelium, which is also used in vegan leathers — proved too flimsy and impractical. Similarly, Veja’s leather-look material crafted from corn waste was originally used in its sleek Campo tennis trainer, but had to be switched to its signature V10 basketball sneaker after the designers realised the process of meshing it to the vulcanised sole was damaging the fibre. “It has to spend an hour and 10 minutes in the oven at 200 degrees to glue the sole to the upper,” says co-founder Sébastien Kopp. “We’ve had to switch it to a shoe that stitches the sole on instead — we can only use it for sewn shoes. It was a bitter learning curve.”In recent years, as the fashion industry has started to wake up to the impact of garment production on the planet (being the second most polluting industry after oil), sustainability has become a buzzword. “There’s a lot of greenwashing around right now,” says Broughton.“Sustainable” and “ethical” have come to be blanket terms that have, to some extent, lost meaning with consumers because the details regarding production are abstract.“It’s so nuanced,” Broughton adds.Waste, on the other hand, is a new term being championed by numerous brands — it’s more specific and direct when used as a marketing tool. “Circulatory doesn’t have that same pull with customers,” says Broughton, “whereas waste does because they can visualise it. That’s one of the reasons that plastic has played into our minds and hearts, because people have all these visual images of non-biodegradable plastics floating in the ocean and turtles swimming in it. People just think food is biodegradable and goes back into the earth, but they’re not thinking of the impact the production of it has had.” The word waste, argues Broughton, is a new way of repackaging the sustainability message in a way customers can understand.The Body Shop unveiled a collection of cleansers and moisturisers crafted from organic, wonky carrots“We opted to see the value in waste, rather than the waste in it,” says Mike Schlebach, co-founder of the South African label Sealand — it’s just one of a number of labels to adopt the term into its key marketing messaging. Other brands and businesses to utilise the waste-free catchphrase include London-based ELV Denim — which repurposes old jeans in its designs — and Kering’s Worn Again Technologies, which breaks down used materials to make new ones. While Sealand doesn’t use food waste, it does use old yacht sails that would otherwise end up in a landfill, turning them into backpacks and tote bags stocked on Mr Porter. “Waste [as a luxury term] is being reconsidered,” he says. “We’re intercepting it prior to landfill — we’re proud to champion it.”Broughton thinks the way to get customers rethinking waste — and its value — is literally to transform it in front of their eyes. “We want someone to be able to bring in their old plastic bags or other waste from home, put them into a shredder that turns them into pellets, and those pellets can be turned into frames to make your own glasses,” he says. He says the brand isn’t far off introducing such tech to stores.“We want to emphasise that our own trash can also become our own treasure,” says Watine Arnault. “We all have a responsibility to reconsider our attitude to waste.”Follow @financialtimesfashion on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.

17;WM;Waste Management;2019-10-31T05:00:50Z;Can we break our addiction to plastic? The future of packaging;As public pressure grows, consumer giants and start-ups are racing to find a replacement;Every week or two, Magali Sartre, a 44-year-old who lives in Paris, goes online to grocery shop. She clicks on orange juice, olive oil, tea, pasta, cookies and crackers — a typical order for herself, her two young children and her husband, which she tops up with trips to a nearby organic shop, butcher and cheesemonger. But when the delivery arrives, it looks anything but typical. Packed in a padded tote bag with thick foam dividers, the pasta and loose tea are in stainless steel reusable containers and the orange juice is in a glass bottle. There are no plastic bags or ice packs in sight. Once the family has finished with an item, the packaging goes back in the tote for collection, cleaning and — eventually — refilling. Sartre is one of the early customers of Loop, a new company that seeks to eliminate waste by teaming up with well-known brands such as Häagen-Dazs ice cream, Dove soap and Crest mouthwash to make their packaging reusable. Now in trials with tens of thousands of people in Paris and across the US, the company aims to create a radically new shopping model in which packaging becomes durable, reusable, valuable and sometimes even beautiful, instead of something to be immediately thrown away. The start-up is working both with multinationals such as Nestlé, Unilever, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo and the supermarkets that distribute their wares. The concept appealed to Sartre, who uses the service to teach her seven- and nine-year-old children about how their consumption habits affect the environment. “I’m pretty militant about it,” she admits. “I really want to show as a consumer that I don’t want any more plastic, and send a message to big companies that I’m ready to spend money to back another model of consumption that is more in line with my values.” Sartre is in the vanguard of a burgeoning consumer movement against plastic packaging that has begun to spur change at the world’s biggest makers of food, drink and household products. Industry executives say that vocal customers have pushed concerns about climate change and pollution up the agenda to the point where big businesses can no longer ignore them. Pressure has only intensified since 2017 when the BBC nature documentary Blue Planet II showed how staggering amounts of plastic — eight million tons a year according to the US environmental advocacy group Ocean Conservancy — were ending up in our seas, killing albatross chicks and entangling sea turtles. In what was soon dubbed the “Blue Planet effect”, consumers began to complain about plastic forks and berate brands online for what they saw as excessive packaging. “We can already see that consumers, especially younger ones, really care about sustainability issues, so to remain relevant we need to change,” says Alan Jope, the chief executive of Unilever. But even as green campaigners want the industry to go further faster, executives warn that there are real challenges to reducing our reliance on plastics. Switching to glass and metal often means higher greenhouse gas emissions because of their heavier weight. Plastic is light, versatile, cheap and durable — allowing companies to maximise shelf life while minimising manufacturing and transport costs. Roughly a quarter of the 348 million tons of annual plastic production worldwide now goes into packaging, according to Plastics Europe and UK conservation charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, making it the single biggest use of the material ahead of buildings, textiles or transportation.While the companies, scientists and entrepreneurs who spoke to the Financial Times agreed change is coming, they had widely differing views on what exactly the future should look like. Some are focused on making the plastic they use more recyclable. Others believe materials such as coated paper, fibre and cardboard could take its place in many cases. Still others think a more wholesale transformation of how we buy and consume products is needed. Each approach would have radically different implications in terms of costs, benefits and convenience, both for companies and consumers. Entrepreneur Tom Szaky, 37, who came up with the idea for Loop, became an authority on waste management after founding TerraCycle in 2001, a company in New Jersey that recycles difficult-to-dispose-of-items on behalf of big companies. He believes that real change will come only when people turn against the very idea of disposability. “If our mission is to eliminate waste, then recycling is not the long-term solution, it is only a Band-Aid,” says Szaky. “We need to completely rethink our relationship to products and how we shop. We need 100 ideas like Loop.”The modern plastics industry began in 1907, when Belgian chemist Leo Hendrik Baekeland invented the first plastic resin made of synthetic materials. Humans had used naturally derived plastics for thousands of years, making them out of cellulose from plants, animal horns and spider silk. But Baekeland’s invention was cheaper, safer and easier to manufacture.A Life magazine cover from 1955 shows a family gleefully throwing a plethora of disposable items above their heads. “The objects flying through the air in this picture would take 40 hours to clean, except that no housewife need bother,” the text read. “They are all meant to be thrown away after use.” An era of convenience beckoned as companies started churning out disposable nappies, garbage bags and styrofoam plates. Today, roughly 6 per cent of global fossil-fuel consumption goes into making plastic, and that is expected to increase to 20 per cent by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency.Plastic has become the go-to for packaging goods. A cucumber wrapped in the material lasts two weeks compared with just three days unwrapped, reports the Flexible Packaging Association. The share of plastics in packaging increased from 17 per cent in 2000 to 25 per cent in 2015, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has done extensive work on how to fix plastic ­pollution. Most of this is used once and discarded — costing $80bn to $120bn annually and flooding a global recycling system that simply cannot handle the stuff. As footage of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and sea turtles choking on plastic straws has spread, people are taking notice. According to a YouGov poll from April, nearly half of Britons feel guilty about the amount of plastic they use and more than 80 per cent are actively trying to reduce waste. In many parts of the world, regulation is also tightening. Some 127 countries have placed limits on plastic bags, while the EU will ban a range of items by 2021, including cutlery, plates and straws. The UK government has made proposals to tax packaging that does not contain enough recycled content and wants to make manufacturers responsible for the full cost of managing their waste.If our mission is to eliminate waste, then recycling is not the long-term solution. We need to completely rethink our relationship to products and how we shopNowhere is our collective plastic addiction more visible than in the supermarket. Most of Britain’s chains, including Tesco, Sainsbury and Iceland, are experimenting with ways to reduce reliance on disposable plastic packaging. Starting in June, Waitrose ran a test in its Oxford store to study the effects of removing plastic from 200 product lines, while encouraging people to bring in their own containers.The difference was immediately apparent in the fruit and vegetable aisles: fresh lettuce lay in homespun-looking wooden crates, carrots were jumbled up in another and tomatoes were arrayed in cardboard punnets. Light-green compostable bags were available for customers to pick out produce in the quantities they desired. Nearby was a bulk food section where customers could buy wine and beer in refillable jugs, or rice, pasta, beans and other staples in refillable containers. Shoppers left feedback on white comment cards hung to the wall: “It would be even better if there were more things in the bulk section,” wrote one. “Funnels needed for decanting into jars!” Another welcomed the experiment: “Really hope you continue and spread to other stores.”What did not look all that different, however, was the middle of the store. When it came to household products, biscuits, cereals and pet food, the aisles remained a festival of plastic.When big retailers weigh up changing their shops they have to study the impact on the entire operation. Will consumers actually bring in their own containers or will they see it as a hassle? How much extra labour is required? And what about food waste? The latter is a major concern: about a third of food produced for human consumption is currently lost or wasted globally, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Yet there is a disconnect between consumer perception and scientific reality in this regard. “One ton of food waste has the impact of three tons of packaging waste when it comes to climate change,” says Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis. “So if you start from a place where you demonise all plastic but then you waste more food, that will actually be worse.”Waitrose is still studying the data from the Oxford trial and is particularly interested in its impact on fruit and vegetable suppliers. They would have to make significant changes to how they pick and pack if the supermarket decided it wanted to get rid of packaging in the produce section of all of its stores. “We spent 25 years in this country building up a supply chain to bring convenience and low prices to consumers,” says Tor Harris, head of sustainability. “That is not to say we can’t change it to go back to how it was before, but we need to recognise that [such changes] might have unexpected consequences.” Other newcomers do not want to wait for the gatekeepers in the supermarkets — and their suppliers — to change. Entrepreneur Angus Grahame came up with the idea for Splosh, which delivers concentrated household cleaners, laundry soap and body wash by mail. Since these are supplied in small plastic pouches and then diluted at home, Splosh cuts down plastic and transportation costs.Grahame claims the company has about 20,000 customers and has not been able to keep up with demand. “We are a small Welsh company fighting in an industry of giants with a radically different business model,” he says. “People are prepared to cut out plastic and do good for the environment up to the point where it affects their lifestyle. So we need to make Splosh appeal to consumers on convenience, price and quality or it will end up being only for eco-warrior types.”The challenges of replacing plastic mean that big consumer goods companies are putting much of their efforts into another approach, namely reducing the environmental impact of the packaging they do use. That can mean designing it from the outset so as to maximise the chances that it will be recycled, slimming it down to use less plastic or getting rid of combinations of materials that are hard to recycle.Along the banks of Lake Geneva, in the Swiss town of Lausanne, Nestlé recently opened a research centre dedicated to the development of what it calls “functional, safe and environmentally friendly” packaging. In laboratories equipped with white work benches and state of the art chemistry equipment, some 50 scientists are searching for new ways to package brands such as KitKat chocolate bars, Perrier water and Purina pet food. They work with start-ups and outside experts, as well as packaging companies that have been Nestlé’s traditional suppliers. But the world’s biggest food and drink company does not see its mission as getting rid of plastic, says Véronique Cremades, head of sustainable packaging. “We believe there is good plastic and bad plastic, and making packaging more recyclable is just as important as moving to new materials,” she says. “Our vision is for a waste-free future where no Nestlé products end up as litter or in landfills.” Like the other consumer goods giants, however, Nestlé is very far from that point: it produces 1.7 million tonnes of plastic packaging a year, third to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo among companies that voluntarily disclose how much plastic packaging they use. Nestlé has been methodically going through its portfolio to evaluate how it can make packaging more sustainable but it is a time-consuming task. It took the company nearly two years to remove all the plastic from the dozens of types of packaging used on Smarties chocolate globally — everything from production lines, quality testing and consumer response had to be taken into account. “In the past, we would design the product packaging with many factors in mind, and its environmental impact was only one of them,” says Cremades. “What is different now is that we are having to re-engineer our whole portfolio of products with these principles in mind. We are all going back to school here.” Similar initiatives are under way elsewhere. About 400 consumer goods makers, packaging producers, retailers and companies in the recycling industry are taking part in an ambitious project led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that aims to create a “circular economy”, in which plastic never becomes waste. Participants — who pay to join — say the regular workshops have turned into a laboratory, bringing together people who once rarely spoke to one another. Companies in the project have committed to using more recycled content in their packaging, a key step in giving recyclers and waste companies a reason to process the stuff. But they have a very long way to go. “It’s not enough to just think about recycling, they have to think more fundamentally about their supply chain and the product design so as to need less packaging in the first place,” says Sander Defruyt, who heads the project. Take Coca-Cola. Despite standardising its bottles to be more recyclable, only 9 per cent of the plastic packaging that it uses annually is made from recycled material. Others are doing even worse: Unilever says less than 1 per cent of the plastic it used for packaging last year was recycled, while Nestlé used 2 per cent. One issue is that designers and marketers often balk at the quality and look of recycled plastic. “It often comes in shades of grey, and consumers aren’t used to seeing that,” says one designer. “It’s up to us to explain to them why the packaging looks different.”At Waitrose, everyone agreed on getting rid of black plastic ready-meal trays, as machines at waste-sorting facilities cannot see them, making recycling impossible. However, the marketers disliked the appearance of the pink, light-green and beige recycled plastic trays devised as alternatives. Eventually the sustainability side won, but only after trials proved that consumers did not mind. The new multicoloured trays are now being rolled out nationally — accompanied with small shelf signs to explain why they look different — in a move that will prevent 500 tons of black plastic ending up in landfill or incineration each year. Other problems are harder to crack. No one yet has a fix for the crisp bag — its thin layers of flexible plastic and metal are ideal for keeping your Doritos or Walkers fresh and crunchy but make them impractical to recycle. “The real problem is that the technology to recycle plastic films just doesn’t exist,” says Mark Miodownik, a professor of material science at University College London, referring to the plastic in clingfilm, plastic bags, produce bags and multimaterial sachets.Then there is the toothpaste tube. Colgate-Palmolive, the world’s biggest toothpaste maker, has spent five years working on a recyclable tube. We currently use roughly 20 billion tubes annually, all of which end up in landfills or incinerated.To make the tube easily recyclable, Colgate had to get rid of the thin layer of aluminium inside and pick a type of plastic known as HDPE that was already being reprocessed by waste-management companies. The polymer scientists tested dozens of recipes before finding one that allows people to comfortably squeeze out the toothpaste, protects the product and meets the demands of high-speed production. More than 100 production lines in 21 factories worldwide will need to be retooled. Colgate will start selling the new tube on its Tom’s of Maine brand early next year, says Tom Heaslip, the company’s head of global packaging, but it will take until 2025 to roll it out to other brands: “The conversions take time.”Unfortunately, Colgate-Palmolive’s efforts will only pay off if it can convince waste-management companies to see the tubes as valuable enough to collect and recycle. “Dealing with the recycling system is a bigger challenge than getting the science of the tube right,” says Heaslip.Although few in the industry admit it, the reality is that plastic recycling rates globally are woefully low. About 8.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced since the 1950s, but research shows that only 9 per cent has been recycled. The remainder has ended up in landfill, the ocean or loose in the environment. High-income countries often ship their waste around the world for recycling but some of it is dumped instead, a problem that intensified last year when China closed its doors to waste imports. Unlike glass or metal, plastic packaging cannot be recycled ad infinitum because it degrades in quality. While scientists are working on so-called advanced recycling techniques to overcome this problem, they are not yet commercially viable. In the meantime, only 14 per cent of plastic packaging is even collected for recycling.One ton of food waste has the impact of three tons of packaging waste. If you start from a place where you demonise all plastic but then you waste more food, that will be worseThis reality has led green campaigners to argue that corporate pledges to make packaging recyclable are a cop-out. They would rather industry reduce the volume of plastic used instead. To date, only one big consumer goods company has committed to do so: Unilever aims to reduce annual use of plastic packaging by about 14 per cent by 2025. “It behoves the plastic industry to confuse people. Recycling is bullshit. It is a fig leaf of consumerism — a way to appease our guilt,” says Siân Sutherland, who co-founded the advocacy group A Plastic Planet. “We just need to find a way to use less plastic packaging. It’s a temporary use for a permanent material, and that’s never going to be OK.” Sutherland is not alone in calling for the industry to step up. Almost half the 65,000 people in 24 countries surveyed by Kantar in September 2019 named consumer goods companies as the most responsible for taking action on plastics, ahead of governments or retailers.Sutherland took this message to hostile territory in September: a packaging industry conference in London. In a cavernous hall, manufacturers of perfume bottles, thick colourful cardboard boxes, shiny ribbons and plastic pump bottles in every size and shape occupied hundreds of stands. As they hawked their wares, there was a lot of plastic. Everywhere. Tucked at the back was Sutherland’s “Plastic Free Land”, where the activist had brought together six exhibitors. They are part of a wider movement of start-ups and established players that are trying to mimic plastic’s best qualities while using coated-paper products, wood, cardboard or cellulose-based fibre. Among them was Sirane, a Shropshire-based company that has created a line of coated paper-based pouches and wrappers. Founder Simon Balderson, a bespectacled physicist whose company employs 400 people and has five factories, says they had more success working with upstart brands than corporate giants. He pointed to a bright pink pouch of nutty granola from gut health start-up Troo, and a lemon-meringue bar from Flower & White. “Start-up brands are willing to take more risks with their packaging and make going plastic-free part of the branding,” he says. Nearby, brothers Sam and Will Boex explained how their passion for surfing and experience of transporting boards around the world (always wrapped in plastic) led them to invent an extensible latticed cardboard packaging sleeve. Their Flexi-Hex packaging is now sold to various industries that need to protect large items for shipping.It behoves the plastic industry to confuse people. Recycling is bullshit. It is a fig leaf of consumerism — a way to appease our guilt. We just need to find a way to use less plastic packagingOthers are going down a different route: making plastic out of biologically derived materials such as corn, sugar cane, potato starch or cellulose from seaweed or trees. With $46m in venture funding, Israel-based start-up Tipa has developed a compostable flexible plastic film made of bio-materials that can be used to package everything from coffee beans to fresh carrots. Notpla, a London-based start-up, has pioneered an edible, home-­compostable film made of seaweed, which can be used to package drinks or sauces. Early trials have included handing out water pouches at the London marathon, Glenlivet whisky pods at a cocktail festival and replacing plastic ketchup packets in orders from Just Eat, the UK’s largest takeaway delivery platform. As they are not made from fossil fuels, such bio-based plastics result in lower carbon emissions — but that does not mean that all of them simply break down if they end up in the ocean. Most need to be composted for 12 weeks at industrial facilities, using temperatures of 55C-60C, high humidity and oxygen. While the UK has some infrastructure for industrial composting, many facilities still do not regularly accept solid objects such as bio-based plastic cups. In other countries the infrastructure might not be in place at all. A UK parliamentary study published in September voiced concerns: “In the backlash against plastic, other materials are being increasingly used as substitutes in food and drink packaging. We are concerned that such actions are being taken without proper consideration of wider environmental consequences, such as higher carbon emissions.”Miodownik, the University College London professor, argues that bioplastics are not the solution. “I’m all for us weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels, but it doesn’t make sense to make a new polymer that there isn’t a recycling system for,” he says, referring to PLA, a common type of bioplastic. “It’s a crazy thing to bring on the market.” The deeper you delve into the problem of plastic packaging, the more you start to realise that there is very little consensus on solutions. Every answer has a rebuttal. Recycling is good! No, it’s broken. Paper is the answer! It will never work as well as plastic. Technology will save us! It will take years to be commercially viable. Taxes and regulation are needed! Government intervention is ineffective. There are a few things, however, that people do agree on. Consumers need to be on board or even the best-intentioned efforts will fail. Coaxing out new behaviour requires learning by trial and error, something that does not come naturally to massive consumer goods companies. An executive at Unilever says that its research shows only about 15 per cent of customers care enough about environmental issues to change their buying habits, while a further 50 per cent will only change if it comes at no extra cost or hassle for them. “Our job is to find solutions that will work for that majority of customers, the great masses, not the extremes,” he says. “That is how we can have real impact.”The other point of consensus is that more experimentation is needed with new models that encourage the reuse of packaging.The Ellen MacArthur Foundation examined more than 100 such initiatives in a recent report, from reusable coffee cup schemes to bulk grocery shopping, and found that they offered benefits such as brand loyalty and cost savings to customers and companies. More than 40 big companies, including Mars Inc, PepsiCo and Unilever, are now experimenting with reusable packaging, according to the foundation.Loop founder Tom Szaky hopes that his online shopping service can show the viability of such models, shifting packaging from being a waste product owned by the consumer to an asset that belongs to the manufacturer. Tesco is expected to launch Loop in February, followed by retailers in the US, Canada, Germany and Japan. “My dream is for Loop to be a global platform for reuse,” he says. “It can be the engine to help brands and retailers enable this profound change of moving to a world where waste does not exist.”Much will depend on whether this new breed of refill and reuse products can appeal to shoppers who value low cost and convenience above all else. In all the anti-plastic mania, people seem to forget a key lesson, says Miodownik, namely to consider the entire life of a product from manufacturing to consumption to its disposal as waste.“There is no such thing as a sustainable material. There are only sustainable systems,” he says. “People don’t think in terms of systems but that’s the only way.” Leila Abboud is the FT’s consumer industries correspondentFollow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

18;WM;Waste Management;2019-10-23T23:00:27Z;Consumer goods giants fall short on plastic pledges;Data show very little packaging is being made from recycled material;The world’s largest consumer groups are still using very little recycled plastic in their packaging, highlighting how far they are from meeting their own green targets amid a growing public backlash over the material polluting oceans and swelling landfills. A new report released on Thursday by the not-for-profit Ellen MacArthur Foundation shows how companies such as Nestlé, PepsiCo, and Unilever must accelerate efforts if they are to keep voluntary pledges made to reach 25 per cent recycled content in their plastic packaging by 2025. Even the top performer on the use of recycled plastic, Coca-Cola, only managed to use 9 per cent recycled content in its plastic packaging last year. The US drinks maker has sought to standardise the materials, colours, and caps of its bottles to make them easier to recycle. But it still churns out almost 3m tonnes of plastic packaging a year, nearly all of it made from virgin plastics. The next best-performer was France’s Danone, which used 6.4 per cent recycled plastic in the 820,000 tonnes of the material it uses annually for packaging. It has a large bottled water business with its Evian and Volvic brands, so is helped by the fact that the PET plastic used for water bottles is relatively simple and cheap to recycle.Among the laggards are Nestlé, the world’s biggest food and drinks maker by revenue, which used only 2 per cent recycled plastic in its 1.7m tonnes of plastic packaging last year. Meanwhile, Unilever is at “less than 1 per cent”, and Mars is not using any recycled material at all. Foodmakers have a harder task because much of the packaging they use, such as crisp packets, chocolate wrappers, and pet food pouches, are simply not cost-effective to recycle.Sander Defruyt, who heads the Ellen MacArthur project, said that while the usage of recycled content was very low, it was positive that consumer goods groups had committed to increase their use of recycled plastic. “A lot of plastic recycling today results in quality losses, which means the material is only good for use in construction or industry and not for food and drink packaging,” he explained. “Changing that will require a massive step up in investment both for the companies and for the recycling industry, which needs to build additional capacity and improve technologies.”The figures were disclosed voluntarily by the companies themselves after their first year as members of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy project. The initiative, which has about 400 signatories, aims to create a so-called circular economy for plastics in which the material never ends up as waste in landfills or polluting the environment.But the picture is incomplete because the companies do not have to publish all the data they share with the foundation, nor is the data audited. Some big consumer companies such as Procter & Gamble and Anheuser-Busch InBev are not involved, and others that are members like Walmart and Carrefour decline to publish data. Under pressure from consumers, household brands are rethinking their use of plastic packaging, which they have long favoured for its low cost, durability, and how it protects goods and extends shelf life. Regulation is also tightening with plastic bag bans already in force in 127 countries and higher taxes on waste looming in Europe.Packaging is the biggest single use of plastic, accounting for more than a quarter of global demand.Beyond pledging to make packaging more recyclable and increasing the use of recycled content, the only consumer goods company that has pledged to actually use less of the stuff is Unilever. It aims to cut its total plastic packaging use by 14 per cent, or 100,000 tonnes, by 2025. Some retailers have set reduction targets though, such as UK grocer J Sainsbury and Germany’s Schwarz Group, which owns discounter Lidl.“We want to see more companies setting targets for absolute reductions,” said Mr Defruyt. “We will not recycle our way out of this problem.”
19;WM;Waste Management;2019-10-15T03:00:30Z;McDonald’s and Starbucks pour millions into eco-friendly cup hunt;Chains struggle to find mass produced alternatives amid global plastic crackdown;McDonald’s and Starbucks are pouring millions of dollars into developing eco-friendly alternatives to disposable coffee cups while struggling to find products that can be mass produced, as a global crackdown on plastic gathers pace.Six sustainable packaging businesses pitched their products before the two chains as well as venture investors at an event last month in New York, held during the UN general assembly meetings where the environment was high on the agenda.Styled after the popular television show Shark Tank, which involves entrepreneurs pitching their products to investors, the event was part of a broader project that McDonald’s and Starbucks have contributed $15m to in partnership with Closed Loop Partners, which pursues sustainable investments.The sums spent are a tiny fraction of the profits of $5.9bn and $4.5bn that McDonald’s and Starbucks reported respectively last year. Both companies said they have made additional investments in eco-friendly packaging from their research and development budgets, but declined to give a specific amountsDespite their name, conventional paper cups for coffee, soup and other hot liquids are not easily recyclable as their inside lining is made of plastic to prevent leaks. Polystyrene foam cups are also not recyclable.As soon as we scale up we will be price competitivePackaging has become a risk to the fast-food industry which is under pressure from consumers and shareholders to curb the use of plastic. Earlier this year, the European Parliament approved a law to ban a range of single-use plastic items, including straws and drink stirrers, while France is scheduled to ban single-use plastic coffee cups in 2020. The Californian city of Berkeley is also set to introduce a 25-cent fee tax on disposable coffee cups.Those companies that have bet on new products which tap into the growing environmental awareness of consumers have been rewarded. Bunge, one of the world’s oldest agribusinesses, has seen the value of its stake in plant-based burger maker Beyond Meat soar. Bunge’s venture capital arm invested before Beyond Meat’s flotation on the Nasdaq this year.Venture capitalists are also pushing into the sustainable packaging sector. Abe Minkara, director of business development at Mark Cuban Companies, a collection of businesses owned by the eponymous investor, said he was interested in compostable products. “The material-based solutions are definitely going to be more scalable,” Mr Minkara said. “The closed loop systems are great, but there is a certain behavioural element that is required for that programme to be successful.”Kate Daly, a managing director at Closed Loop Partners, said solving the sustainable cups problem can pay off in other areas. “We see it as a huge opportunity to take the lessons learned from this project and apply them to other sustainable food packaging opportunities,” she said.However, fast-food companies are struggling to find a sustainable solution that works on a large scale.“It is all about scalability,” said Jessica Marshall, sustainability manager at McDonald’s, who attended the event in New York. The group has pledged to recycle packaging at all its stores globally by 2025.Earlier this year, 44 per cent of Starbucks shareholders supported a motion calling on the company to report on its efforts to develop sustainable packaging.“We know our cups remain one of our biggest environmental challenges,” said Jane Tsilas, global packaging solutions manager at the Seattle-based group. It is evaluating the cup designs presented in New York last month to determine which it may develop further.Experts say there are two broad approaches to solving the coffee cup problem. The first involves reusing the same cups: UK-based CupClub provides cups to retailers that can be picked up, cleaned and dropped off again. Meanwhile, RECUP, a company in Germany, has partnered with McDonald’s stores in the country for a cup deposit system.However, this option requires customers to be disciplined recyclers and to change their habits. The alternative is to create cups that are recyclable or compostable. US-based Footprint and Colombier of Finland have produced liners that help with this but these products can be expensive.“As soon as we scale up we will be price competitive,” said Henrik Bjornberg, chairman of Colombier. He said the company wants to open a facility in North America to produce cups as well as a second processing machine in Finland.Three businesses at the New York event presented cups that could be exchanged for reuse while the other three had developed cups that can be recycled or composted.About 300,000 tonnes of drinks cups and lids are consumed each year in the EU with about 40,000 tonnes dropped as litter, according to a European Commission report published last year.
20;WM;Waste Management;2019-10-07T03:34:52Z;Creation of a circular economy will require extreme action;Radical thinking is needed in how we buy and discard goods;The contents of an average household’s rubbish bin has changed in recent decades: it now contains more Amazon boxes, for example, and more plastics. But the biggest trend in trash is simply that we are producing much, much more of it.At present the world creates 2bn tonnes of solid waste a year: this is expected to rise to 3.4bn tonnes by 2050, according to the World Bank.“The current economy model of take, make and waste is massively extractive,” says Andrew Morlet, chief executive of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “We get very little utility and we have seen a massive rise in disposability, which is an easy way to extract value. The waste created is absolutely huge,” he says.A new generation of entrepreneurs is trying to do something radical — eliminate waste altogether.“We have a real problem right now. About 70 per cent of the stuff people throw out ends up in landfill even though it is perfectly usable,” says John Atcheson, chief executive of Stuffstr, a London start-up.His company’s solution is to put a price on used goods. Instead of donating or discarding unwanted clothes, Stuffstr takes them away and pays you for the privilege. It then resells or recycles them, depending on the kind of product and its condition.Retailers pay Stuffstr to provide a repurchasing service for their customers. In a trial with the John Lewis & Partners store chain last year, customers who participated sold back a fifth of their purchases, on average, from the past five years.“We want to resell it and get it to someone who will use it,” says Mr Atcheson.Disposable consumption has created a huge amount of waste, he says. This can change if consumers buy products designed to last longer and sell these when they are done.‘We are starting to now realise that the notion of everything being disposable . . . is no longer viable’By stimulating demand for longer-lasting products, he hopes manufacturers will respond by producing such goods.“We want people to get into a completely different mindset. By putting a price on every single item, you give consumers an incentive to buy differently,” Mr Atcheson says.This is just one aspect of achieving a “circular economy”, which refers to a system in which materials and products are reused and recycled, rather than thrown away. The EU has embraced the concept and its circular economy strategy, adopted last year, includes a 65 per cent target for recycling and reuse by 2035.A more circular economy is beneficial beyond reducing rubbish — it also cuts greenhouse gas emissions, according to Mr Morlet. “For us to be able to achieve climate objectives, it is not just about renewable energy and energy efficiency . . . the circular economy is essential,” he says.The way materials are made and used accounts for 45 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.The emissions from industrial production of cement, plastics, steel and aluminium would have to be cut to almost nothing for the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2050, a goal it is expected to adopt later this year. The study estimates that emissions from these materials could be cut by 40 per cent just by reusing and recycling more of these goods.At the moment “we are seeing peak disposability,” says Mr Morlet, but that is changing. “We are starting to realise that the notion of everything being disposable . . . is no longer viable.”If the circular economy takes off, then by 2050 purchasing and disposal will be radically different to today. Imagine buying clothes that last for years, shopping for food using refillable containers or buying a home made with reused material.Today’s world is a long way from that — but it may be starting to shift.
21;WM;Waste Management;2019-10-07T03:34:52Z;Tech companies on front foot in push to recycle;Apple says its ‘biggest improvement’ to the iPhone is how it re-uses materials;By 2050, plastic-eating drones the size of ships will roam the oceans autonomously, collecting debris in much the same way that the Roomba, a vacuum cleaner robot, sucks up dog hair in a living room.This distant reality is already taking shape. The Ocean Cleanup, a small Dutch start-up that aims to rid the world’s oceans of plastic, recently completed a six-week test that used a giant parachute to collect waste from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — an 80,000-tonne area of plastic that is three times the size of France.The risk of such a vision, however, is that consumers will depend on technology to save the planet when the more obvious answer is to consume less and reuse more.“The real solution to this lies on land not in the ocean,” says George Leonard, chief scientist at the Ocean Conservancy, a Washington-based environmental group.The organisation estimates that 8m tonnes of plastic flow from land into the ocean every year. That is equivalent to one New York City garbage truck full of plastic dumping its contents into the ocean every minute, for a year.Moreover, this ocean waste cannot be recycled. “The plastic they have collected is not being miraculously turned back into usable products. Most of it is degraded and broken down. You can’t do much with it: you’re either burying it in landfill or burning it,” says Mr Leonard.With such stark statistics, our environmental trajectory looks unlikely to take us to an idyllic state by 2050. But that could change as consumers and businesses become keen to take action.“The chances of governments, academia and the private sector doing something about it [recycling] has gone way up in the past two years,” says Dan Helfrich, chief executive of Deloitte Consulting. “That gives me confidence. The conversation has gone from narrow activist to mainstream importance, and when [that happens] the rhetoric slows and the action accelerates.”One of the most popular consumer items ever — the iPhone — is an example of how business is responding to the call.The “biggest improvement” Apple has made to the smartphone since 2007 is not the quality of the camera, speed of the processor or any other feature. Instead, it is the “material reuse and closed-loop manufacturing, which was not something that even the genius engineers who innovated the first iPhone would have thought of,” Lisa Jackson, vice-president of environment and social initiatives at Apple, tells the Financial Times.We are designing our products knowing we will get them back somedayClosed-loop manufacturing, in which industry repeatedly re-uses materials to conserve resources and lower its carbon footprint, is gaining momentum. By 2050, a “circular economy” — in which products and materials are reused rather than thrown away — could be so normal that making consumer electronics will not require any mining.Last year Apple unveiled Daisy, a robot that can break down 200 iPhones an hour for their components to be recovered and reused. In the iPhone 11, Apple used recycled rare earth elements — a group of 17 metals widely used in electronics but whose mining and processing is particularly carbon-intensive — to build its Taptic Engine, which enables the device’s screen to mimic the push of a button.Recycling rare earth elements in high-end consumer products had been dismissed as unrealistic just a few years earlier. “It was classic Apple,” says Ms Jackson, the former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency. “Our people get excited when we’re told something isn’t possible.”By 2050, further advances in recycling should make it possible for computers to be made entirely from recycled parts — including microchips which require a demanding level of purity, says David Lear, Dell’s vice-president of sustainability.“We are designing our products knowing we will get them back someday,” he says. “And I’m going to be able to pull materials from other industries, too . . . So we don’t need to dig any more holes or process any more fossil fuels or plastics, metals or aluminium.”Dell is already making progress, albeit on a small scale. Last year the Texas-based PC and software group partnered with entrepreneurs in India to begin making “pollution ink” by capturing diesel exhaust fumes from generators — one of the largest pollutants in the country. This was then turned into ink for its packaging.For many brands, creating a more sustainable supply chain may be more expensive.At present, for example, businesses can save money by using less expensive plastic bags. These, however, are only cheaper because no one is paying the end-of-life costs, says venture capitalist Daniel Oros. The plastic bag often ends up in the ocean — creating an infinitely more expensive problem.Business incentives could change if consumers stop thinking in terms of cost in the most narrow sense and instead consider sustainable solutions, says Brenda Haitema Arjona, head of Asia at First Mile, a start-up that collects plastics from poor communities and turns them into materials for high-end goods.“This is the only way forward,” she says. “People must be willing to spend a little bit more on something because it’s been recycled or because they know it has replaceable parts.”
22;WM;Waste Management;2019-10-06T23:01:12Z;Unilever vows to reduce use of plastic packaging;First time big consumer goods group commits to numerical target in cutting absolute plastic packaging use;Unilever has pledged to reduce the amount of plastic packaging it produces annually by about 14 per cent by 2025 across all its brands from Dove soap to Lipton tea, and to halve its reliance on non-recycled plastics. The Anglo-Dutch company also said it would invest over the same timeframe to improve waste collection and processing in the countries where it operates, which could include partnerships with recycling companies or directly paying for the collection of its packaging. The moves are a sign of how looming regulations and consumer concerns about ocean pollution and climate change are prompting makers of food, drink and other consumer staples to change their practices.It is also the first time a big consumer goods company has committed to a numerical target to reduce absolute plastic packaging use, although some retailers, such as Sainsbury’s in the UK, have done so.But campaigners and academics have said the industry must go further and faster, given the scale of the environmental problems and persistently low rates of recycling in much of the world. This demands a fundamental rethink in our approach to our packaging and productsSome 127 countries have placed limits on plastic bags, according to the UN, while the EU has banned a range of single-use plastic items — such as cutlery, plates and straws — by 2021. The UK is considering a draft law to tax packaging that does not include 30 per cent of recycled content.Roughly 200 consumer goods makers, packaging producers, and retailers have made voluntary commitments under a project led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation that aims to create “circular economy” for plastics, in which they never become waste. Started in 2018, the project has encouraged companies, including Unilever, Coca-Cola, and Nestlé to accelerate their efforts and disclose some data on plastics. Although audited data on packaging is scarce — because companies are not required to disclose it — Unilever has said it produces 700,000 tonnes of plastic packaging annually. This puts it in fifth place among companies which have voluntarily disclosed their figures, after Coca-Cola with 3m tonnes a year, Nestlé with 1.7m tonnes, Danone with 750,000, and Tetra Pak with 721,000. Unilever’s new pledges complement two earlier ones to use 25 per cent recycled plastic in its packaging and to make all plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. The company said it was on track to meet those commitments, but it declined to say how much money it would spend overall on the efforts. “This demands a fundamental rethink in our approach to our packaging and products,” said chief executive Alan Jope. “It requires us to introduce new and innovative packaging materials and scale up new business models, like re-use and re-fill formats, at an unprecedented speed and intensity.”Packaging is the biggest single use of plastic, accounting for more than a quarter of global demand, according to a study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Campaigners have identified the global trade in plastic waste as a main culprit in marine litter, because the industrialised world has for years shipped much of its plastic “recyclables” to developing countries, which often lack capacity to process the material.Sian Sutherland, a green campaigner who co-founded advocacy group A Plastic Planet, welcomed Unilever’s new commitments, which she described as “some serious plastic reduction”, but said industry overall must be much bolder.“Plastic pollution is increasing daily and we need absolute urgency in turning off the plastic tap. Recycled plastic is still only one step away from the bin, incinerator, landfill or ocean,” she said. 
23;WM;Waste Management;2019-09-12T23:07:12Z;Sainsbury’s to halve plastic packaging after consumer pressure;Supermarket to use more alternative materials and refillable containers by 2025;Britain’s second-biggest supermarket chain Sainsbury’s has promised to halve the plastic packaging in its stores by 2025, making what it called an “ambitious” commitment to address an issue growing in importance to consumers. The new target covers all branded food packaging, Sainsbury’s own-label products and plastics used across the retailer’s operations, such as when it wraps pallets for transport.It differs from larger rival Tesco’s efforts because it focuses on plastic packaging specifically, and places less emphasis on merely making packaging recyclable. Only Iceland, a smaller supermarket chain and frozen food specialist, has made a similar promise to get rid of plastic in all its own-branded products by the end of 2023.Given uneven rates of recycling in the UK and well-documented problems with plastic waste being exported to developing countries, green campaigners question whether putting recycling at the centre of corporate efforts on packaging is the best solution.To meet the goal, Sainsbury’s said it would switch to alternative materials, use lighter-weight plastics and introduce refillable packaging in a larger number of its stores. After “rigorous analysis of its plastic footprint”, the company said it believed the areas with biggest impact would be plastic milk bottles, packaging for fruit and vegetables, fizzy drinks, water and fruit juices.“We can’t do this on our own and we will be asking our suppliers and our customers to work with us to help us make this important change,” said chief executive Mike Coupe in a statement.The challenge food manufacturers and retailers face is how to strip out plastic packaging while not sacrificing shelf life or endangering food safety. They must also be mindful not to inadvertently increase food waste, which experts have already singled out as a big problem that pushes up greenhouse gas emissions and uses land and resources.Sainsbury’s uses about 120,000 tonnes of plastics a year, compared with Tesco’s 252,586 tonnes in 2017 and Iceland’s 11,500 tonnes in 2018. National retailers’ plastic output is dwarfed however by that of large makers of packaged food. Nestlé produced 1.7m tonnes last year, while Unilever stood at 610,000 tonnes. Pressure on retailers to change has come from shoppers, and has only intensified since 2017 when the BBC broadcast a nature documentary called Blue Planet II that highlighted the problem of plastics in oceans. Executives in the food and drinks sector now speak of the “Blue Planet effect” and have had to react as once common items such as plastic bags and straws suddenly fall out of favour or are banned.The EU has agreed to ban a range of single-use plastic items, including cutlery, straws and food containers, by 2021 in an attempt to spur the industry to move to greener alternatives. Siân Sutherland, who co-founded A Plastic Planet, a campaign group aimed at spurring business to cut their use of the material, questioned whether Sainsbury’s pledge to halve plastic by 2025 went far enough given the scale of the problem. “Pacts, pledges, policies, promises. We are overwhelmed with plastic goals that are so far in the future,” she said. “Supermarkets globally have tremendous power. They need to step up and use it to accelerate change.”
24;WM;Waste Management;2019-09-04T03:49:38Z;Invent a greener milk carton for the world;Tetra Pak’s innovation overtook the glass bottle but it needs to be improved;"The humble milk carton has been part of our lives for so long that it is easy to forget that it was a marvel when it first appeared in 1952. Tetra Pak’s technology made a billionaire of Hans Rausing, scion of the company’s Swedish founding family, who died last week at the age of 93.The Tetra Pak cartons, made from layers of paperboard and polyethylene, soon displaced glass bottles because they were far lighter and could easily be stacked and distributed. Its aseptic carton, with a layer of aluminium foil that allowed heat-treated milk to remain fresh, followed in 1961.But every technology has drawbacks and Rausing died at the moment when those of plastic are becoming distressingly obvious. Landfills are stuffed with bottles and cartons, and trillions of pieces of plastic float in the world’s oceans. What happens to the 189bn Tetra Pak containers made last year as they are discarded?Carton makers such as Tetra Pak and SIG Combibloc of Germany are far from the only contributors to the ballooning volumes of packaging waste. In some ways, they are encouraging recycling. But the rise of the carton shows how complex and difficult is the environmental challenge.The case for cartons is simple: they may be better than the alternatives. They are easy to transport and a study for German carton makers found that they have 78 per cent less climate impact than glass bottles. They also contain 75 per cent paper and only about 20 per cent plastic.When collected and taken back to a specialist mill, they are also fairly recyclable. Their various layers separate out into paper, plastic and aluminium fibres when pulped in liquid, allowing the paper fibre to be mixed with virgin wood pulp and turned into cardboard boxes, tissues and the like.This is the good news; the rest is less hopeful. First, recycling is far from universal even in Europe, which has a better record than the US. Only 47 per cent of materials from the 37bn beverage cartons made for European countries in 2016 were recycled.Cartons are also prone to a broader paradox — as economies advance, people tend to recycle more but also to consume more. Croatia’s overall recycling rate for packaging in 2016 was 55 per cent, compared with Germany’s 71 per cent, but the average German generated four times as much packaging waste as the average Croatian.This is a frightening prospect on a global scale. McKinsey & Co, the consultancy firm, estimates that China will comprise 28 per cent of the global packaging market by 2022 and emerging economies such as Vietnam suffer from widespread dumping not only of plastic bottles but of cartons.Second, paperboard is easier to recycle than the plastic, or the 4 per cent aluminium content of aseptic cartons. In theory, the plastic and aluminium fibres that emerge from the soup of old cartons can be turned to other uses — the metal can become material for roofing tiles, while the polymer can be melted into pellets for gas heating or steam.In practice, this only happens patchily and, as one study put it, “complete recycling in the strict sense is currently not feasible for beverage cartons”. A carton is carefully bonded and constructed, often with a plastic lid and a straw fixed to the side; what Tetra Pak has joined together is not easily put asunder.Consumer consciousness of plastic waste is rising sharply, thanks to campaigns against ocean pollution. But people still like the convenience of cartons and they offer many benefits, including access to fresh milk and juice in countries without sophisticated supply chains and refrigeration.This means companies such as Tetra Pak need to do more to make their products not only useful but also sustainable. In the short term, that involves stronger links with recycling mills and waste companies to ensure that the containers they pump into the world are returned and reused.Tetra Pak last year agreed a partnership with Veolia, the French waste management group, to recycle more polymer and aluminium fibres from cartons for industrial use in Europe. Along with other carton makers, it is also increasing its use of recycled and environmentally approved raw materials, such as wood pulp from certified forests.In the long term, the company faces a huge technological challenge to get to what it says is its ultimate aim — to construct cartons entirely out of renewable materials, including recycled plastic. Cartons would then no longer require fresh supplies of polymer from oil and gas refineries.It sounds improbable but innovation in materials science was what originally enabled the milk carton. That also took a long time to perfect from the first idea of creating a tetrahedral paper carton in 1944 to the manufacture of aseptic containers 17 years later. As Hans Rausing’s father, Ruben, observed: “Doing something that nobody else has done before is actually quite hard.”The multilayer carton turned out to be a far more useful invention than even the Rausings realised at the time. But, like plastic bottles and aluminium cans, it was imperfect. Making it greener is a worthwhile project.john.gapper@ft.comMake supermarkets and petrol stations re-use hubs / From Giles Dixon, Kew, Richmond-upon-Thames, UK"
25;WM;Waste Management;2019-08-23T09:00:27Z;Global recycling crisis should be a wake-up call ;The sharply reduced trade in waste could boost efforts towards reuse;Producing more waste and recycled materials than could be processed at home did not previously create problems for developed countries. The excess was simply exported to poorer countries, mainly in Asia. But now, more than 18 months since China ended its decades-old status as the world’s largest importer of waste, the system is still struggling to adjust. Waste and recycling imports were initially diverted elsewhere in Asia but this provoked a widespread backlash and trade has slowed sharply. The growing inconvenience — and cost — of dealing with trash closer to home may, however, be the wake-up call the world needs to reduce the amount of rubbish generated and act more responsibly on recycling. Shipping waste around the world was never a sustainable system. Canada was forced to repatriate a five-year-old shipment of rubbish from the Philippines at its own cost earlier this year. Malaysia also returned waste while Thailand, Vietnam and several other countries tightened controls to limit waste imports. Contaminated materials — and the resulting burning of hazardous waste — was one factor in the shift. The sharp increase in volume following China’s ban added to the pressure. On top of growing environmental concerns a political element came into play. China and other Asian countries no longer want to be seen as the junkyard for other richer countries. The shifts in global recycling trade, coupled with the growing evidence of the environmental impact of non-recyclable materials, such as some plastics, have triggered increasing efforts to tackle the waste problem. Proposals to achieve greater reuse of materials — the idea of a more circular economy — have gained traction. Companies such as AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer, already uses returnable bottles for nearly half of its drinks. More ambitious targets are in place for 2025. Another example is Nestle’s recent breakthrough that allows confectionery to be wrapped in paper rather than plastic. If replicated on sufficient scale these initiatives could make a difference to both plastic pollution and reuse.Legislation can also help. EU countries face targets for 50 per cent municipal recycling by next year, rising to 65 per cent by 2030, and 75 per cent for packaging waste. Single-use plastics, such as straws and stirrers, will be banned across the EU within the next two years. But for each measure the alternatives need to be carefully considered. Sales of single-use plastic bags dropped 90 per cent since the 2015 introduction of a small charge in England. The switch to more durable, heavier plastic bags has, however, left doubts about any drop in the overall weight of plastics bags sold. A better understanding of the impact pollution is having on the environment will help consumers. The BBC’s Blue Planet nature documentary has already raised awareness of plastics pollution. Coverage of the 80-day swim of the great pacific garbage patch may also help. Consumers can influence manufacturers by choosing more environmentally responsible products. For manufacturers, governments can skew cost incentives towards using more recyclable and reusable materials. Only by reducing waste through reuse and investing in recycling facilities at home can any hope of a sustainable solution to the world’s broken recycling system be achieved. Sending more waste to landfill would be a tragedy. China’s crackdown on imported waste has highlighted the unsustainable nature of this trade. The world must turn this into an opportunity for change.

26;WM;Waste Management;2019-08-07T22:00:26Z;China tries to tackle its growing rubbish pile;Billions in investment needed to process expected surge in household waste;"As the world’s most-populous nation, China also has the world’s biggest household waste problem and it is going to get much worse. By 2025, China’s urban residents, currently about 830m people, will generate 510m tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) every year, according to World Bank estimates. On a per-capita, basis, that amounts to 1.7kg a day, 67 per cent more than in 2012 when the urban population was registered at 512m. Urbanites will still produce less than Americans, who are the biggest waste generators of the major economies, but the sheer size of China’s population means that east Asia will continue to lead the world in waste generation into the middle of this century. After years of planning, pilot projects and procrastination, the government is finally getting serious about cleaning up this massive environmental problem. Shanghai, China’s financial capital and its second-biggest city, kicked off a nationwide campaign of compulsory waste sorting on July 1. Shanghai is one of 46 pilot cities tasked with building a comprehensive waste sorting and processing system by the end of 2020. More than 300 cities at or above prefecture level have been ordered to do so by 2025. President Xi Jinping, whose administration has identified China’s environmental clean-up as one of three “critical battles”, has weighed in, exhorting residents to sort their rubbish and reminding them it is “an important embodiment of the level of civic-mindedness”. China’s domestic waste mountain has been growing exponentially as the country has urbanised and as consumption has become the main driver of economic growth. The ministry of ecology and environment estimates that the domestic waste generated annually in 202 Chinese cities doubled in the two decades to 2017 to 202m tonnes. Shanghai residents are now grumbling because they have been forced to sort their rubbish into four categories — food, recyclable, hazardous and residual — and dispose of it at specific times of the day and in special disposal locations. Non-compliance incurs a fine of up to Rmb200 ($28) for individuals and a maximum of Rmb50,000 for companies (bin sales have surged — Alibaba estimates Shanghai residents accounted for a fifth of the Rmb250m in bins bought on its Tmall and Taobao platforms in June alone). As recently as 2016, 63 per cent of China’s urban household waste was still dumped in landfill sites while 35 per cent was incinerated, according to Forward Intelligence, a Shenzhen-based market research company, but demand for land resources and pushback from the public mean that landfill is no longer a viable long-term option. The new waste sorting campaign will require investment of Rmb7.6bn in Shanghai alone by 2020, according to Shanghai-based brokerage Orient Securities. Three-quarters of this will go towards waste treatment, including incineration and recycling facilities, and disposal of food waste. Big domestic players in the industry include Jiangsu Welle Environment, which specialises in the treatment of kitchen waste; Fujian Longma Environmental Sanitation Equipment, which makes waste collection and transport vehicles; and Infore Environment Technology Group, which produces solid waste treatment equipment. Across the 300 cities involved in the campaign, which covers 500m people and 125m households, Orient Securities estimates that investment of at least Rmb200bn will be required, based on Shanghai’s experience. Just over half of that will need to be spent on building new facilities for treating food waste, which accounts for 50-60 per cent of household waste. Despite the potential for new business, an index of 18 companies involved in recycling compiled by data provider Wind Info has underperformed the broader market this year. There is uncertainty whether local authorities can build facilities quickly enough to keep up with demand and meet central government targets. China produced nearly 100m tonnes of kitchen waste in 2017, 273,000 tonnes a day, but existing capacity was able to handle less than 10 per cent of that, says Zhu Chunyang, an analyst with China Merchants Securities. Shanghai recently finished the second phase of the Laogang Renewable Resource Recycling Centre, which it claims is Asia’s biggest solid waste treatment plant. The facility is capable of processing almost 3m tonnes of waste per year, a third of all rubbish generated in the city. The expansion has added eight incinerators that can process about 6,000 tonnes of waste daily. As a byproduct of the incineration process, the plant also produces heat, and slag from the burnt waste is used in building materials, such as bricks and cement. Veolia is one of the foreign companies also gunning for waste-to-energy projects in China, including Shanghai, where it operates an MSW incineration plant in the Jiangqiao district. China is betting big on incineration, having pledged to dispose of a third of its waste through waste-to-energy plants by 2030. Although best-in-class incinerators do not pose a threat to the environment, public opposition to new plants is increasing as locals fear they will be built with substandard pollution controls and belch out toxic emissions. Earlier this year, thousands of residents took to the streets of Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province, to protest against a planned waste incineration plant. The government has been trying to push waste sorting and recycling for decades — Beijing and Shanghai were among eight pilot cities picked for waste sorting in 1998 — but has been stymied by a lack of investment in infrastructure by local governments and a shortage of capacity to sort waste, which meant it often ended up dumped in the same landfill regardless of whether it was recyclable. As an upper-middle income country, China is a relatively bad recycler, according to data compiled by risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, though the US is by far the world’s worst offender in terms of its contributions to the global waste crisis. The biggest challenge for the government is to change mindsets and convince people of the need to recycle correctly, said Liu Jianguo, a professor at Tsinghua University's school of environment in Beijing. The government should introduce incentives but also legislate to address the problem of low public participation, such as making waste sorting a legal obligation, Mr Liu said. This is starting at a local level — some areas of Beijing have installed public rubbish bins with facial recognition technology to identify users. Correctly disposing of rubbish earns points which can be redeemed against purchases of daily consumer goods. Local authorities also need to offer fiscal subsidies and tax incentives to companies involved in waste sorting and recycling to incentivise them, and to start educating the younger generation about the importance of recycling, he said. “It took decades for developed countries to popularise waste sorting — it’s a long-term process and China can only proceed step by step,” Mr Liu added.— Kelly Zang is a contributor to FT Confidential ResearchscoutAsia is a corporate data and news service from Nikkei and the Financial Times, providing in-depth information about more than 660,000 companies across more than 20 countries in east Asia, south Asia and Asean.

27;WM;Waste Management;2019-07-15T04:00:42Z;Investors must look hard at the future of plastics;As consumers reject single-use items, the sector predicts rising demand and huge expansion;Newton Abbot aims to be a plastic-free community. The Devon town is one of 569 communities in Britain to have joined a campaign led by environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage to stamp out single-use plastic. The nearby towns of Dawlish, Ashburton and Bovey Tracey are already accredited.Efforts such as this build on the public’s awareness of plastic pollution, heightened by programmes such as the BBC’s War on Plastic series, fronted by Anita Rani and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.Consumers are demanding less throwaway plastic, such as the toys that come with McDonald’s Happy Meals. They also want more information on whether an item can be recycled, and for supermarkets and their suppliers to switch to reuse and refill systems.Government at local and national level is tackling plastic pollution, using targets for recycling and restrictions on particular single-use items.Against this backdrop, the plastics industry is intent on expansion, driven by cheap shale gas and an expectation of rising demand from millennials and consumers in emerging markets.This conundrum, and its implications for the petrochemical and fossil fuel industries, has received little attention from investors.They have focused instead on the companies most immediately at risk from the backlash against plastic: those involved in single-use packaging.The Plastic Solutions Investor Alliance, set up last year by US non-profit As You Sow, is concentrating its engagement on consumer goods companies Nestlé, Pepsi Co, Procter & Gamble and Unilever. Nearly 40 investors have signed up, including Aviva, Axa, Candriam, Hermes, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum and Robeco.The focus is on a move from single-use plastic to reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging. The alliance is also asking for more transparency from the industry: for example about the extent of leakage into the environment of plastic pellets, used to make nearly all plastic products.Another initiative, the Plastic Investor Working Group, consisting of 29 global investors and convened by the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, is looking at the risks and opportunities associated with plastics.There is also the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has gained more than 350 signatories since its launch in October 2018, including several financial institutions. It aims to create a “circular economy” for plastics, in which they never become waste.There is an assumption in this that the plastics industry can continue to grow, provided it deals with its waste problem. Indeed, the petrochemical industry is expected to take up the slack in oil demand over the long term as renewables replace fossil fuels in transportation and energy production. It will account for more than a third of the growth in world oil demand to 2030, and nearly half to 2050, according to the International Energy Agency.The American Chemistry Council reports that $204bn of new investments in petrochemical infrastructure have been announced since 2010, half of which has been completed or is under construction.Some suggest this might be overdoing it. “If consumer demand for plastics grows more slowly than the industry expects, the industry would suffer from global overcapacity, which could significantly affect profitability for this very capital intensive industry,” said Legal & General Investment Management in a note last year. This is a risk investors should recognise, the fund manager said.Carbon emissions associated with the plastics industry are another red flag, as governments worldwide join in the declaration of a climate emergency.In 2019, the production and incineration of plastic will produce greenhouse gases equivalent to 189 500MW coal power stations, according to the Center for International Environmental Law. It concludes the only sure way to reduce the climate impact from the plastics industry is to stop production growing and to keep fossil fuels in the ground.In Newton Abbot, resident Betina Winkler, one of the organisers of the plastic-free initiative, reports on progress since signing up in May. The nearby technical college has moved to compostable lunch trays instead of plastic, stopped using plastic cutlery and it plans to stop selling drinks in plastic bottles.Time, perhaps, for investors to read the writing on the wall?
28;WM;Waste Management;2019-07-14T04:00:27Z;Plastic packaging: bottling it;Environmental damage is shifting from an externality to a business cost;The idealistic hero of the 1967 film The Graduate was horrified by talk of “a great future in plastics”. He was ahead of his time. Plastic, an emblem of postwar consumerism, is triggering a spasm of disgust. Developing nations are rejecting paper waste shipments contaminated with plastic. Disposable bags are prohibited, restricted or taxed in 127 countries. Plastic racket wrappers were banned from this year’s Wimbledon tennis tournament.Some 350m tonnes of plastic are produced every year. The damage to marine life, fisheries and tourism — along with the impact of greenhouse gases produced in manufacturing — exceeds the industry’s $40bn annual profits, McKinsey calculates.Environmental damage is shifting from an externality to a business cost. The trend creates opportunities as well as threats. Coca-Cola plans to collect and recycle the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells globally by 2030. That is good news for Norway-based Tomra, which dominates the market for vending machines that collect containers for recycling. Its shares have tripled over the past three years. Companies are also trying to find fixes. Small quoted groups like Carbios of France and Loop Industries of Canada are working on breaking down plastics into their constituents, which are converted into new materials. Oil giant BP describes chemical recycling as a “game changer”. It plans to commercialise its technology by 2025. Will such innovation, together with a big recycling push, be enough to fend off a ban? In the case of plastic bottles, Barclays thinks it will. Recycling rates in developed countries should reach 70 per cent by 2030. Manufacturers are counting on continued growth. They are adding record amounts of capacity to the North American market.That is foolhardy. Makers of rival materials, like energy-intense aluminium, hope to grab market share. The boss of US-based can maker Ball Corporation sees canned still water as the “next big frontier”. He may be outflanked by rivals whose packaging appears greener. Brewer Carlsberg recently unveiled a wood fibre bottle.Plastic is light, versatile, cheap and robust. But single-use products are becoming socially unacceptable. Today, like the disaffected twentysomething in The Graduate, many young people wince at the word “plastics”. They would no sooner carry a plastic water bottle than wear a mink coat.
29;WM;Waste Management;2019-07-08T04:01:37Z;Waste-to-energy: panacea for Asia’s pollution problem or a load of rubbish?;Technologies will stem trash tides but as a source of renewable energy their utility is limited;Liu Xiao spends her weeks visiting sludge and organic waste treatment plants across China. The travel can be tiring but as a technical and policy adviser on waste management she must help implement President Xi Jinping’s vision of a “beautiful China”.Ms Liu’s job is to provide technical assistance to governments and companies trialling the next generation of waste-to-energy technology: methane capture.The equipment is sophisticated but the underlying principle simple. When organic waste decomposes in an oxygen-free environment such as landfill, it emits methane — a powerful greenhouse gas. The technology allows the gas to be collected and used as fuel to generate electricity, rather than escaping into the atmosphere.China’s 30-year economic boom and improvement in living standards has led to a surge in urban waste. It is now the world’s biggest producer of rubbish, after surpassing the US in 2004. It is also a leading processor of waste from overseas. In parts of China this has left a legacy of soil and air pollution. As the country grows richer, there is growing pressure to clean up.China launched its “No-Waste City” programme in December, aimed at curbing solid-waste generation and encouraging recycling across 10 cities. The pilot project represents a shift away from landfill or incineration towards a less hazardous, integrated waste system for the future.Methane capture is not new but widescale adoption in the world’s most populous country has the potential to reduce ground pollution as well as helping to satisfy the country’s growing hunger for energy.China produces more than 280m tonnes of municipal waste a year, according to official data. About 60 per cent of this ends up in sanitised landfill, with the remainder burnt or biochemically treated. With the pace of urbanisation showing no signs of abating and living standards continuing to rise, the deluge threatens to overwhelm waste management infrastructure.280mThe number of tonnes of Chinese municipal waste produced a yearThe government is rethinking its approach to waste treatment. China’s five-year economic plan to 2021 extended its commitment to the “circular economy”, a model aimed at cutting waste while extracting as much value as possible from recycling. For years a dumping ground for overseas rubbish, the country heavily restricted waste imports last year and a full ban is expected in 2020.The strategy also aligns with China’s climate goals. Beijing has pledged to cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60-65 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and to increase non-fossil fuel energy sources to 20 per cent of total consumption.Mostly, however, waste-to-energy still means incineration — a practice that can produce heavy metals and toxins that leach into soil and water supplies. China is innovating on incinerator technology that will not need waste to be presorted and, while not yet proven, aims to generate electricity without emitting pollution, says Jennifer Turner, director of the China Environment Forum at US think-tank the Wilson Center. But she warns: “We should be suspicious of silver bullets.”60%The proportion of waste that still ends up in landfill facilitiesShenzhen, north of Hong Kong, is building the world’s largest waste-to-energy plant, capable of burning 5,000 tonnes of refuse a day. But at the same time, the city is subsidising anaerobic digestion treatment plants for restaurant waste. Across China there are more than 50 such plants, which use microorganisms to break organic materials down into biofertiliser and biogas that is eventually burnt for energy or heating.Local residents are concerned by the environmental impact of waste treatment facilities. In response, China’s incineration sector spent nearly 50 per cent of the total investment on pollutant control and public education, according to the China Association of Urban Environment Sanitation.“The concerns over coal and the concerns over the impact of waste-to-energy plants are similar in the eyes of local communities,” says Courtney Weatherby, an analyst with the Stimson Center, another US think-tank.Biogas trials are springing up across the region, for instance in Thailand, as urban planners generally still view incineration as the solution.China’s example demonstrates a wider affliction gripping south-east Asia. Since introducing its waste import curbs, neighbouring countries have picked up the slack. In the past six months plastic imports have risen 56 per cent in Indonesia, twofold in Vietnam and 1,370 per cent in Thailand.Meanwhile, energy consumption in Asia is soaring, with most of it coming from coal, peat and oil. Between 2018 and 2030, a further 21m people in Asean countries are expected to gain access to electricity, according to Euromonitor, a market research provider.Maria Coronado Robles, a consultant at Euromonitor, says waste-to-energy projects can help ease these pressures. “[These trends] are expected to have tremendous impact on air quality and municipal waste management, and pose a threat to human health and wellbeing. A significant investment in waste management and energy infrastructure [will be required],” she says.Waste is unlikely ever to fuel a large proportion of the region’s energy. China’s 7GW of installed waste-to-energy capacity constitutes less than 1 per cent of the country’s total energy supply. However, the heat emitted as a byproduct could prove significant.“As the circular economy develops, you might find industrial communities will work with the waste-to-energy suppliers to make use of the heat,” Ms Weatherby says.At the plants Ms Liu visits, she says energy has become a “key cash flow” for local businesses. Companies make money from waste treatment fees, with the government paying private treatment companies Rmb300 ($43) per tonne of waste, as well as from generating electricity from the captured biogas and selling it back to the grid.But despite the potential benefits, significant challenges remain.One is a lack of private investment. The International Energy Agency estimates that south-east Asian countries need an annual $100bn in energy investment until 2030 to meet demand — about twice the current level, says Ms Weatherby.A lack of widespread education around recycling and the need to sort waste into different categories as exists in Taiwan and Japan, is another challenge. “In many ways, I think China did the world a favour by turning back boats because it brought attention to the waste issue,” she says. “Now it is a problem of politics, not just energy.”
30;WM;Waste Management;2019-07-02T22:45:40Z;Nestlé wrapper breakthrough hailed in fight against plastic;Environmentally friendly paper packaging described as ‘world first’ technology;Nestlé has claimed a breakthrough in the fight against plastic waste after finding a way to wrap a confectionery bar in recyclable paper, and the world’s largest food company has promised to share what it has described as “world-first” technology.Unlike previous attempts to make environmentally-friendly packaging, products wrapped in the paper developed in York can pass through a high-speed production line without ripping and stay fresh for nine months.The wrapper is being used for the world’s largest food company’s YES! fruit bars and nut bars but could work on other products.The Swiss group said that it had not patented the technology and it would allow others to use it from April next year. “It is not in our interest to hold on to this. We want the industry to use paper,” said Jas Scott de Martinville, the company’s global confectionery research and development leader.Consumer goods makers are under pressure to do more to reduce the waste their businesses generate. Many of them, including Nestlé have made voluntary pledges to make all of their plastic packaging reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025, as part of an effort being led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity.Nestlé has not revealed what proportion of the millions of tonnes of packaging it uses annually is recyclable. Nearly one-third is plastic, with a large proportion of this from the company’s bottled water business, which sells brands like Buxton, Vittel, and San Pellegrino.The environmental impact of plastic has burst into public consciousness recently, accelerated in the UK by the BBC’s Blue Planet nature documentary in 2017 that showed how plastics were polluting the oceans and killing wildlife. Further pressure is coming from the EU, which has passed legislation banning single-use plastic products like straws and cutlery, as well as from national governments, which are ramping up taxes and regulation to tackle the problem of waste.A global analysis published in 2017 estimated that 8.3bn tonnes of plastic has been produced since the second world war. About four-fifths has been dumped as waste, while just 9 per cent has been recycled.Nestlé’s new paper wrapper has a polymer coating that makes it waterproof, sealable and robust enough to survive the production line, transport and storage. But the company said it was recyclable and degrades within six months in the ocean.Bruce Funnell, the head of packaging in York, said: “For this to be viable it had to run on existing equipment and at high speed.” The production line handles 300 bars a minute and has only had minor tweaks to accommodate the paper packaging. Nevertheless, the cost of each wrapper is higher.Nestlé is hoping to convince environmentally conscious consumers to pay £1.20 a bar, or around 50 per cent more than alternatives, for a healthier product that is “recyclable by design”. YES! was launched last September, is available in several EU countries and will soon be launched globally: the new wrapper is already in production.The paper itself comes from certified sustainable sources. The company would not reveal how much it cost to develop but said it spends £1.7bn annually on R&D. It said it was too soon to assess the full carbon footprint of paper versus plastic. “There is no panacea,” said Mr Funnell,Erwin Reisner, head of the Centre for Circular Economy Approaches to Eliminate Plastic Waste at Cambridge university, said the packaging was an “important step forward”.“It will put pressure on other manufacturers,” he said, but stressed the key was to make plastic reusable and recyclable.Even that will not immediately solve the vast problem, however, because experts say that the world’s recycling system is broken. When consumers in rich countries separate their rubbish they often make errors that render the material unusable. Meanwhile the countries in Asia that do the bulk of waste recycling are increasingly rejecting it, with much ending up in landfill.

The amendment was approved in late February by the National Legislative Assembly, the then military government’s rubber-stamp parliament, to create a business-friendly environment, according to the government. It was one of many laws the outgoing military junta rushed through parliament before a contentious general election in late March.Under the amended rules, only industrial companies with more than 50 employees and machinery exceeding 50 horsepower are subject to monitoring for waste discharge and anti-pollution measures. Previously, the law applied to any industrial site with seven or more workers and machinery of at least five horsepower.Environmentalists say factories that employ fewer than 50 people will be exempt from mandatory five-year licensing requirements and will escape pollution monitoring by the Department of Industrial Works.This article is from the Nikkei Asian Review, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs.

The new factory act “will increase non-transparency and corruption”, said Penchom Saetang, head of Ecological Alert and Recovery-Thailand, a local green group. “Thai authorities need to revise the new Factory Act based on views from public consultations.”Analysts expect more than 40 per cent of the country’s 60,500 registered Thai and foreign-owned factories to benefit from the looser rules. These include the seven Thai companies that hold licences to import electronic waste for recycling.“The new Factory Act opens the doors for companies to invest in factories and plants that will result in the country becoming more polluted,” said Supaporn Malailoy, manager of the Enlaw Foundation, a local environmental advocacy group. “There is concern that the local authorities who will give factories permits to operate may lack specialisation in assessing the environmental impacts of the factories.”The change in the law follows an earlier push by the junta to ease pollution rules three years ago that also angered environmentalists, under order number 4/2559. The edict suspended planning laws in towns and cities that restricted the opening of toxic and heavily polluting waste disposal projects in areas where people live and in areas zoned for farming.According to Earth Foundation, another Thai green group, three provinces near Bangkok where industry is expanding highlight how investors have capitalised on the waste trade. Chancheng Sao, south-east of Bangkok, now has 159 plastic waste-processing plants; Samut Prakarn, south of the capital, has 663 plants; and Samut Sakorn, also to the south, has 924 plants, the group said.Somnuck Jongmeewasin, an academic at Silpakorn University International College in Bangkok, said order 4/2559 had increased the number of waste-processing plants across the country because “it only needs permission from local authorities to give a green light to set up a factory in a community”. This easily led to “corruption between the local government officials and the companies”, he added.The Thai government in April approved a draft of a long-term plan to reduce plastic waste, including a ban on the use of plastics in products such as straws and cups by 2022. But experts warn the new Factory Act could undermine such efforts and worsen the already serious plastic waste problem.According to a recent study by international environmental pressure group Greenpeace, Thailand’s plastic waste imports rose from about 70,000 tons in 2016 to 481,000 tons by 2018.That surge was mirrored across south-east Asia where plastic waste imports over the same period grew by “a staggering 171 per cent to 2,265,962 tons from 836,529 tons”, according to the study, Southeast Asia’s Struggle Against The Plastic Waste Trade. According to Greenpeace, “That’s equivalent to around 423,544 20ft shipping containers.”The rise of south-east Asia as a dumping ground for plastic waste was fuelled by China’s decision to ban the import of plastic waste, along with textile and metal scrap. By the time the ban came into force in January 2018, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam had emerged as alternative sites for plastic waste imports, Greenpeace said.The waves of plastic waste landing on south-east Asian shores only add to the region’s own mountain of trash. Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have been ranked by the Ocean Conservancy, a global environmental lobby, among the top five countries tossing plastic into the sea. China was the worst polluter, the group revealed in a 2017 study.The controversy over waste imports has produced some results, at least on paper. Regional leaders who met for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Bangkok on June 22 and 23 pledged to strengthen actions at the national and regional level to “prevent and significantly reduce marine debris”.Environmentalists welcomed this first step by the 10 members of Asean. But they contend that the promise requires teeth, with Greenpeace calling for “imposing an immediate ban on all imports of plastic waste, even those meant for recycling”.A version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on June 26, 2019. ©2019 Nikkei Inc.

32;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
33;WM;Waste Management;2019-07-01T03:30:37Z;Gold rush 2.0: Jewellers mine mobiles for precious metals;Big jewellery brands and boutiques are turning to e-waste to source their materials;The world faces a health and environmental crisis if no action is taken to tackle an explosion in electrical and electronic waste as ever more appliances and gadgets are consumed and discarded.Humanity is expected to produce 120m tonnes of “e-waste” a year by 2050, up from about 50m tonnes today, according to a UN report launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year. Only a fifth of appliances and devices are currently recycled, with the bulk of the often-toxic items ending up in landfill or incinerated.Yet electronic waste often contains valuable metals such as gold, silver and copper — there is 100 times more gold in a tonne of discarded mobile phones than in a tonne of gold ore, according to the report.The jewellery industry, which accounts for about half of gold demand and a fifth of silver, can play its part in the global drive for a more sustainable economy, by sourcing more materials that are recycled in a way that harms neither the environment nor people.The e-waste generated worldwide each year has a material value of $62.5bn — three times the annual production of the world’s silver mines and more than the gross domestic product of most countries, according to the report published by the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy and the UN’s E-Waste Coalition, a group of seven UN agencies.The next gold rush will not be in the hills of California but the landfill sites of urban citiesThe UN is working to promote the economic opportunities of a circular economy, where waste is reused. Most recently it partnered with the Nigerian government on a $15m initiative to support the country in setting up the infrastructure for industrial-scale e-waste recycling.There are health and environmental factors to consider, too. In Asia and Africa in particular, people are risking their health and lives to obtain precious metals from waste — for example through the use of dangerous extraction chemicals, unprotected, at refuse sites — and earning only a subsistence living.Countries across south-east Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam and most recently the Philippines, are pushing back against a deluge of unwanted e-waste and plastic from Europe, the US and Australia.Meanwhile, the jewellery industry is showing signs of greater commitment to change — even if that means paying more for raw materials.From its store in the Place Vendôme in Paris, the heart of the luxury jewellery sector, new fine jewellery house Courbet has put ethical sustainability at the centre of its business and only uses lab-grown diamonds and gold recycled from e-waste.It was initially difficult for the jeweller to find a suitable company recycling e-waste, according to Charlotte Daehn, a spokesperson for Courbet. “But we now have a wonderful partner we can trust,” she says. “At first we were using recycled gold whose origin was not as clear as we wanted. The gold we now use costs us about 10 per cent more but, as we work with lab-grown diamonds that are less expensive, in the end we manage to have a price that is in the average for the jewellery of the Place Vendôme, even a little bit less.”Danish high-street jewellery brand Pandora has also been on a sustainability drive. For the 112m pieces of jewellery it made last year, 88 per cent of the 250 tonnes of silver it bought was recycled and all of the 65kg of gold, with about 50 per cent coming from electronic waste.“Fair trade-certified gold supply is too limited to cover global demand, whereas the recycled supply of especially silver is much more reliable,” says Jon-Paul Daniel, Pandora’s vice-president of procurement.Smaller-scale artisan jewellers are also using e-waste. Ashley Heather initially sourced her silver from waste photographic chemicals, but as darkroom photography became less popular and demand for her minimalist pieces grew, “e-waste presented itself as the obvious solution”, the South Africa-based designer says.In the Netherlands, Nowa (which stands for ‘no waste’) creates necklaces and bracelets in gold and silver extracted from old mobile phones. Nowa started shipping its jewellery in May, having raised €14,000 through crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.The mobile phones are sourced by fellow Dutch company Closing the Loop, which has partnered with entrepreneurs in Africa and Asia to create recovery networks to collect scrap handsets for recycling. The company says it has collected more than 2m mobiles.According to the World Gold Council, 190,000 tonnes of the planet’s 244,000 tonnes in gold reserves have already been mined. The UN estimates that e-waste accounts for 7 per cent of all gold extracted.“The next gold rush will not be in the hills of California but the landfill sites of urban cities,” says Sandra Wilson, a jeweller and academic based at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. She has been working alongside scientists at Edinburgh university who are developing a non-toxic method of extracting gold from e-waste.About 90 per cent of the world’s e-waste is illegally traded or dumped each year, Ms Wilson adds, with a high proportion handled by the informal market in India.She believes part of the answer lies in formalised recycling. She is developing a project called Urban Gold Rush, connecting metallurgy partners in Varanasi and Mumbai with local jewellery artisans to encourage the use of gold and copper recovered in formalised recycling to create new jewellery.The recycling push could get a further boost next year. At the Tokyo Olympics, all 5,000 or so medals handed to athletes will be made using metals extracted from e-waste donated by Japanese consumers, placing the issue firmly on the global stage.
34;WM;Waste Management;2019-06-11T22:00:24Z;Wooden beer bottles and paper straws — Japan shifts from plastic;Transition creates opportunities for the nation’s declining paper industry;As the digital age gives people fewer reasons to use paper, the material has nevertheless found itself in the global spotlight.Last month, more than 180 countries agreed to tougher rules for shipping non-recyclable plastic waste across national borders. This means more countries like Japan, the world’s second-biggest producer per capita of plastic waste after the US, will have to deal with their non-recyclables at home instead of shipping them to other countries.It is a welcome shift for Japan’s paper industry, which has faced steadily shrinking demand. According to the Japan Paper Association, domestic demand shrank to 14.69m tons in 2017 from 16.59m tons in 2011. Manufacturers are now coming up with new ways to supplant plastic products in everything from straws to shampoo containers.“The shift from plastic to paper will continue,” said Motoshi Muraoka, partner at NTT Data Institute of Management and Consulting. “It’s an unstoppable wave.”Suppliers will have to move fast as retailers and other businesses close to the consumer move away from plastic.Last July, coffee-chain giant Starbucks declared it would ban disposable plastic straws at all its stores by 2020. After the company’s announcement, McDonald’s, Legoland theme park operator Merlin Entertainment and other big hospitality brands switched to paper straws.Nippon Paper Industries last year unveiled a paper straw prototype that it says solves old problems. Many paper straws have an odour that alters beverages’ flavour, and most have trouble standing up to the rigours of having liquid sucked through them. They get soggy, a drawback Nippon Paper has addressed with technology.But cost is still an obstacle. Paper straws currently cost five to 10 times more than their plastic counterparts at retail. Nippon Paper is working to trim production costs.This article is from the Nikkei Asian Review, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan.Subscribe | Group subscriptionsThe company will also seek to commercialise a paper alternative to the pouches that hold refills of household detergents, soaps and shampoos. Up to now, container makers have shied away from paper products for kitchen and bathroom use due to the soggy factor.Nippon Paper expects its Spops containers to replace refillable plastic and aluminium pouches. Spops containers are mostly cardboard, look a little like a milk carton and are designed as cartridges that can fit into and be removed from plastic dispensers, with no scissors required.Japan’s market for shampoo in refill pouches is estimated to be worth about ¥300bn ($2.72bn). Nippon Paper wants Spops to make up about 20 per cent of that. It aims to get the cartons on the shelves by the end of the year.The company is positioning the product as a growth driver in the digital era, which has been marked by receding demand for Nippon Paper’s flagship products, printing paper and newsprint.The growing demand for paper containers is creating opportunities elsewhere. Hokuetsu Package in October added a printing facility to its plant in Ibaraki Prefecture. It sells base paper to container makers after printing product names and patterns on the paper. Its existing facilities have mainly processed milk containers.The new equipment has increased Hokuetsu Package’s printing capacity by just over 10 per cent, allowing it to keep up with increased demand for other beverage and food containers as well as for paper trays.Despite the innovations, “there are still many challenges to be overcome before paper can replace plastic”, a paper industry representative said. High on that list are paper’s low resistance to water and heat. In many cases, these problems are being overcome by coating the insides of paper containers with plastic.The extent to which paper products will replace plastic also remains unclear. “The plastic free movement is a big opportunity for us,” a spokesman at Nippon Paper told Nikkei. “But to cover the decline in paper demand, we have to see if the replacement of plastic will expand beyond just straws and tableware.”Japanese paper makers are not the only ones trying to replace plastic. Their US and European rivals are coming up with their own solutions.Kotkamills, a long-established paper company in Finland, has developed a paper coffee cup that does not have an inside coating, something that is usually considered necessary. This will be “a game changer” for the industry, said Markku Hamalainen, chief executive.Danish packaging company EcoXpac has developed a biodegradable Green Fiber Bottle, which is made from wood fibre, in partnership with brewer Carlsberg. The glassless, plasticless bottle will hit stores on a trial basis by the end of this year.Ranpak, a big US packaging materials maker, is selling a substitute for all the gel packs that help Japanese consumers keep cake and other refrigerated foods cold on the way home. The packs are made of sustainably sourced wood, and can also replace styrofoam and plastic packaging materials.The US company expects the packs, which are naturally degradable, to ring up sales of ¥100m in Japan by 2020.While paper alternatives to plastic products are expected to experience greater demand in the coming years, they will not be cheap. “Compared with plastic straws, paper ones are expensive,” a food service company executive said.It will also become important for paper suppliers to say how they procure their wood, the raw material of paper.ESG investors — those who put their money into companies that mind how they impact the environment and society, and that also have good corporate governance records — might be influencing the shift from plastic to paper.If paper companies are to appeal to these investors, it will be important for them to get a certification that shows wood is sourced in an environmentally, socially and economically sound manner.Nikkei staff writer Nana Shibata contributed to this reportA version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on May 31. ©2019 Nikkei Inc.

35;WM;Waste Management;2019-05-31T15:05:50Z;Philippines forces Canada to take back its rubbish;Repatriation is victory for Duterte and signifies growing push against developed world’s waste;The Philippines has forced Canada to repatriate a large shipment of five-year-old rubbish at its own cost, handing a political victory to President Rodrigo Duterte at a time when south-east Asian countries are increasingly rejecting the foreign waste arriving on their shores.After an escalating dispute that saw the populist president of the Philippines threaten “war” and withdraw Manila’s ambassador to Ottawa, Canada agreed to bring home the 69 containers of rubbish.The waste was loaded on to a ship on Thursday at Subic Bay, the former US military base. The ship set sail early on Friday and Canada said it was expected to reach British Columbia by the end of June.“The government of Canada is taking all the necessary measures to ensure safe and environmentally sound transport, handling and disposal of the waste in Canada,” a government spokesman told the Financial Times on Friday.Earlier this week Teddy Locsin Jr, the sharp-tongued Philippine foreign secretary, warned on Twitter that if there were any delays to the process, “I will screw you dry,” adding: “Don’t provoke me.”The emotive dispute over waste material is part of a widening backlash in south-east Asia, and coincides with a broader push to rein in the global trade in plastic recyclables, which environmental groups say has been abused by exporters, importers and officials in the countries receiving the rubbish.This week, Malaysia said it was returning 3,000 tonnes of unrecyclable waste to the US, Canada and Saudi Arabia. “Garbage is being traded under the pretext of recycling,” said Yeo Bee Yin, the Malaysian environment minister.The Canadian rubbish, shipped to the Philippines in 2013-14 by a now-bankrupt private company, was labelled as goods for recycling, but included low-grade plastic, diapers and electronic and medical waste, according to campaigners.“What we are getting is the detritus of the waste industry of other countries,” said Lea Guerrero, country director for Greenpeace in the Philippines. Ottawa had formerly said it wanted to ship back the waste by the end of June. However, Mr Duterte wanted it out sooner, and was prepared to pay to ship it across the Pacific and would dump it in Canadian waters if necessary. Civil society groups had been pressing their government to take action for years, and picketed Canada’s embassy in recent weeks.About 50 environmental activists who have been pressing for action for years gathered at Subic on Thursday to “bid the rubbish farewell”, carrying a replica of a red shipping container emblazoned with the words “Good riddance!”“It has been nearly six years we have been waiting for this to happen,” Aileen Lucero, national co-ordinator of the EcoWaste Coalition, told the FT by telephone.Activists believe the high-profile case represents a fraction of the refuse being sent to the Philippines and other south-east Asian countries. “Our groups think this is the tip of the iceberg,” said Ms Guerrero. “There are a lot of other cases we don’t know about.” Some Filipinos believe Mr Duterte took up the cudgel on the Canadian waste because Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has criticised his human rights record. It could also be a useful diversion from criticism that he is too soft on China. Mr Duterte made his remarks about “war” shortly before flying to Beijing in April for a conference on the Belt and Road Initiative where he signed more than a dozen business deals. “He is under intense criticism for his policy on China, so maybe this will appease criticism, by standing up to the west in particular,” said Von Hernandez, global co-ordinator of Break Free from Plastic, one of the non-governmental organisations that pushed Canada to take back the rubbish. Other countries are cracking down on imports of plastic waste, including Thailand, which plans to ban foreign plastic scrap imports by 2021. China was previously the world’s biggest importer of plastic waste until a ban in early 2018 sent much of the material flooding into south-east Asia instead. While some plastic scrap has commercial value — it can be recycled into plastic pellets for which there is a market — shipments of “mixed plastics” often contain contaminated material that is not economically viable to recycle, and ends up being incinerated or dumped in landfills. The growing concern over ocean plastics, combined with the surge of plastic waste into countries that lack the capacity to process it, has led to a push to tighten restrictions on the global trade. Earlier this month, plastic waste was added to the list of controlled substances governed by the Basel Convention, the UN accord governing trade in toxic waste, which will greatly curb the global trade in plastic when the provision takes effect in January 2021. The new rule, proposed by Norway, will effectively ban the US, one of the world’s largest waste producers that is not a signatory to the agreement, from exporting any plastic scrap to countries covered by the ban.“You’re talking about mountains and mountains of waste that will now be restricted,” said Jim Puckett, head of the Basel Action Network, a non-profit that lobbied in favour of the new rule. “Now recyclers, if they want to export, will have to sort everything.”Follow on Twitter: @JohnReedwrites, @lesliehookThis article has been amended to reflect the fact that Justin Trudeau is Canada’s prime minister
36;WM;Waste Management;2019-05-28T10:23:37Z;Malaysia to return 3,000 tonnes of contaminated plastic waste;Country is latest in south-east Asia to clamp down on rubbish imports;Malaysia will return 3,000 tonnes of plastic waste to countries including the US, Canada and Saudi Arabia, amid a broadening clampdown on imports of improperly labelled rubbish across south-east Asia. Yeo Bee Yin, environment minister, said the country would return the shipments of contaminated plastic rubbish — non-recyclable or low quality plastic — to avoid the “dumping” of waste in Malaysia from the rest of the world. “Garbage is traded under the pretext of recycling,” she said. “Malaysians are forced to suffer poor air quality due to open burning of plastics which leads to health hazard, polluted rivers, illegal landfills and a host of other related problems.”South-east Asian countries vastly increased their share of plastic waste management after China, which had been the centre of the global recycling trade, abruptly halted imports of recycled materials at the end of 2017.But Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia have reportedly been deluged with so much waste that their recycling systems have been overwhelmed. Rubbish has often been dumped or discarded, only to end up as marine litter. Ms Yeo told the Financial Times in February that China’s ban “opened our eyes to the problem” that existed but nobody was aware of in Malaysia. “The entire world just could not cope with the plastic waste that is generated and of course Malaysia is one of the victims in terms of influx.”Ms Yeo argued that establishing a standardised labelling system that differentiates between high and low quality plastic scraps is essential.“This is not only our problem, it is all around the world,” she said. “If they don’t come to south-east Asia they will go to Africa, everywhere”. Ms Yeo added that an international treaty on plastics was required.Malaysia’s environment ministry on Tuesday referred to one unnamed UK recycling company that “exported more than 50,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste in about 1,000 containers for the past two years”. It urged developed countries to investigate their “management of plastic waste” and “stop shipping the garbage out to the developing countries”.Kuala Lumpur banned imports of contaminated plastic waste in October 2018, and returned five containers of waste to Spain last month. The environment ministry said an inspection process of containers was taking place to weed out material that was wrongly classified as recyclable. Malaysia’s move comes as the Philippines is embroiled in a fierce diplomatic dispute with Canada over waste shipments between 2013 and 2014 that were falsely labelled as recyclable material. Canada missed a May 15 deadline to retrieve the rubbish and Manila recalled its ambassador to Ottawa. President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to ship the waste back into Canadian territorial waters, while Ottawa has insisted it will complete the transfer by the end of June. Abishek Balasubramanian at GA Circular, a Singapore-based sustainability consultancy, called it a “blessing in disguise” for the waste-producing countries. “In the long run such local ecosystems — with collection and recycling within the same country — are typically more resilient than those that depend on international trade,” he said.The recent upswing in restrictions on waste comes amid rising concern over the environmental impact of plastic, which now pervades oceans and waterways. A recent study published in Nature, the science journal, found millions of pieces of debris on the remote Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. Some reports estimate that the world’s oceans are littered with 5.25tn of plastic items. Governments in south-east Asia have also been emboldened by a deal earlier this month that incorporated mixed and contaminated plastic waste in the Basel convention, a UN-backed treaty that regulates the movement of hazardous waste. The change was supported by 187 countries, with the notable exception of the US, and means that such exports will require prior consent from the governments of the destination countries. 
37;WM;Waste Management;2019-05-24T03:03:27Z;Entrepreneurs target greener path to success;Ingenuity harnessed to tackle planet’s widespread environmental problems;Can entrepreneurs clean up the planet? The evidence of the damage being inflicted on the world is growing: the UN this month warned that 1m species worldwide faced extinction through climate change and habitat destruction, adding that there were just 12 years left to stop global warming reaching dangerous, irreversible levels.One part of the world that is cleaning up its act is central and eastern Europe. Under communist rule after the second world war, the region relied on heavy industry and dirty coal, and was often careless with its waste.The shift to capitalism since the revolutions of 1989 has increased consumption but also released people’s ingenuity to tackle environmental problems.In Estonia, former government inspector Tõnis Kaasik decided to set up a company after cleaning up a radioactive waste depository in the north-eastern city of Sillamäe.He discovered that there was only one company in the Baltic and Nordic region that recycled batteries, and in 1999 he formed Ecometal to extract the lead acid from batteries. The acid is neutralised and used to produce sodium sulphate, which can be used in detergents and various manufacturing processes. His company also profits by selling the recycled lead back to battery manufacturers. He hired staff who had worked in Estonia’s uranium industry — which fuelled Soviet nuclear power stations — and converted their facilities. Ecometal now serves six countries and recycles 20,000 tonnes of batteries each year, melting them down to produce lead and lead alloys that are 99.99 per cent pure.He has since expanded the company to recycle electronics and plastics and exports across Europe and the Middle East. It has 150 employees and €3.5m annual revenues.Mr Kaasik said membership of the EU had pushed Estonia towards recycling, but that not every government in the bloc was as diligent. “The regulation is the same but implementation is different in different countries.” However, he believes “capitalism is better” than communism at using resources. “We had less waste before but nobody cared about the waste there was.”Although companies are more likely to recycle when it is profitable — such as with batteries — improving a corporate image with the public is another potent driver of change. Public concerns over plastic waste were recently piqued after widely watched TV footage showed turtles tangled in bags and seabirds who had died after consuming plastic microbeads.Erwin Reisner, head of the Centre for Circular Economy Approaches to Eliminate Plastic Waste at Cambridge university in the UK, said that little of the estimated 8bn tonnes of plastic produced since the 1950s had been recycled.His centre is working with almost 20 companies to find alternatives to traditional plastic or ways of reusing it. “There are floods of interest. We do not have the resources to follow through on them all.” He was hopeful that entrepreneurs would find innovativesolutions — but that government action was needed. “Plastic is a victim of its own success. A general increase in taxation on plastic would be a good step to incentivise recycling,” he said.One business in the Czech Republic is already taking measures to cut plastic use. In 1998, nine years after a revolution overthrew communism, husband and wife team František Fabičovic and Radka Prokopová established Alca plast to make products such as shower drains and toilet seats.Ms Prokopová said they were recycling waste from the factory and hoped to make their products — made from plastic or stainless steel — fully recyclable. In Russia, Technonicol co-founder Igor Rybakov said the group had its waste as part of a “win, win, win” strategy — benefiting the business, the Russian population and the planet. “It is the easiest way to reduce cost,” he said. The company he founded with Sergey Kolesnikov is the world’s second-largest maker of mineral wool — a fibre produced from melted volcanic rock that is used for insulation, fire protection, noise and vibration control.The pair ensure that factory offcuts are reused, along with bricks and other waste. They have also started a waste collection service, especially for polystyrene. Mr Kolesnikov hopes to increase Russia’s recycling of polystyrene from 5,000 tonnes annually to at least 50,000 tonnes. Technonicol operates 53 plants in seven countries with six global R&D centres that have also developed an award-winning, affordable house that consumes half the energy of most standard homes.“The future is definitely good,” said Mr Rybakov.
38;WM;Waste Management;2019-05-21T23:01:19Z;UK presses ahead with ban on single-use plastics;Straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds to be banned from April 2020;Plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds will be banned in the UK from next April, the government has confirmed in its latest attempt to stem the flow of waste and promote the use of recyclable materials.The move comes amid a spate of targeted action on the use of single use plastic. On Monday, Amazon-owned retailer Whole Foods said it would remove all plastic straws from its stores in the US, UK and Canada by July of this year.“Urgent and decisive action is needed to tackle plastic pollution and protect our environment,” said Michael Gove, the environment secretary. “These items are often used for just a few minutes but take hundreds of years to break down, ending up in our seas and oceans and harming precious marine life.”The news follows a 13-month consultation on the proposed regulations during which concerns were raised that some people with medical needs and disabilities who rely on plastic straws will be put at risk by the regulation, prompting the government to include exemptions for these groups.When the ban takes effect, shops will not be allowed to display or hand out plastic straws but they will be able to give them out on request. The government said this “strikes the right balance between reducing the environmental impact while protecting the rights of people with medical conditions and disabilities”.More than 80 per cent of people consulted by the government supported a ban on the sale and distribution of plastic straws while 90 per cent supported a ban on drinks stirrers and cotton buds.Sam Chetan-Welsh, political campaigner for environment group Greenpeace UK, welcomed the move but said the moves “only scratch the surface”.He added: “To really tackle the plastic crisis we need bigger bolder action from this government — including targets to radically reduce the production of single-use plastics and an all-inclusive deposit return scheme for drinks containers.”Mr Gove is working to develop a scheme where consumers will have to pay a deposit when purchasing plastic bottles, though the proposal has come under criticism for its narrow scope.Andrew Opie, food and sustainability director at the British Retail Consortium, said many retailers were working to identify how they can reduce reliance on plastics and increase recycling, including ambitions to make 100 per cent of plastic packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.Government research published last year found that in England, an estimated 4.7bn plastic straws, 316m plastic stirrers and 1.8bn plastic-stemmed cotton buds are used each year. About 10 per cent of cotton buds are believed to be flushed down toilets and often end up in waterways and oceans.A global analysis, published in 2017, estimated that 8.3bn tonnes of plastics has been produced since the industry began to expand after the second world war and around four-fifths of this has been dumped as waste, often washing up on coastlines.
39;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;How to meet the challenge of plastic waste;Converting trash to energy could provide a solution to a problem that blights our oceans;The successful conclusion of the UN meeting in Geneva on the reduction and management of plastic waste is a good step forward — even if the agreement reached by 187 countries is somewhat tarnished by the predictable abstention of the US. But there could be even better news to come. Plastic pollution has grown as the use of flexible, lightweight and readily available materials has become an integral part of economic activity across the world. It is impossible now to imagine life without plastics. But as well as the shocking scale of waste dumping in the oceans, highlighted by Sir David Attenborough’s Blue Planet films, there is growing evidence of the impact through the food chain of nanoparticles on human health. The UN agreement, technically an amendment to the Basel Convention on trade in waste, will force countries to monitor and track what they are doing. Implementation will be slow, however. The new rules will take a year to come into force and monitoring disposal across the world will be far from simple. But technology may be about to transform the economics of managing plastic waste in a way that can benefit both the environment and companies in the sector. There is potential for converting it to energy. The idea, of course, is far from new but it does now seem that recent progress opens up a possibility that has long been elusive. The prospect is set out in detail on a new energy technology website, Thunder Said Energy. The process described, using pyrolysis — which is partial combustion in an inert environment — is still in its infancyGlobal plastics production has grown by 5 per cent a year since 1980. At the moment, 85 per cent of this is incinerated, dumped into landfill or ends up in the ocean. The absolute volumes involved grow year on year as the consumption of plastic increases — in cars, cosmetics, computers and many other products. Just 15 per cent of the waste is recycled. Available technologies can only deal with a limited number of the many forms of plastics. For the rest, incineration is possible but produces high volumes of carbon dioxide, while landfill is expensive. So it is hardly surprising that approximately 8m tonnes of plastic waste enters the world’s ocean each year.The potential solution is to put the waste through pyrolysis reactors, which at 300-800 degrees can break down the long carbon molecules. The attraction of the process is that it can, as Thunder says, turn mixed waste back into “oil, waxes, speciality fuels and gas”. Given the volumes of waste available, the amounts of energy produced could be material to the global market. If the science is in place, the challenge is to identify the incentives and detailed policy measures that can ensure it is used.In economic terms, there is potentially a double benefit from technology that can manage plastic waste. The people controlling the process will be paid to take the waste away by those facing ever greater scrutiny of disposal methods. It can then be used to produce new energy supplies. Users can access these without creating further import dependence or sinking into ever greater reliance on a few insecure suppliers. The technology exists and patents are in place. The small companies involved are being watched by the industry — BP in its most recent strategy update wrote that it sees “chemical recycling as a game changer for plastics circularity” and is “developing technologies to lead the market in this space and looking to commercialise these technologies by 2025”. BP will not, of course, be alone in this. Under attack from the climate change lobbyists, the oil and gas majors would love to be seen as the providers of positive solutions. The latest UN agreement can only push on the process — providing a great example of the benefits of combining sensible regulation and the development of the research necessary to identify solutions, which can make the rules economically rational and effective.Many countries have much to gain, not least China whose imports of oil are over 9m barrels a day and whose dumping of waste is one of the main contributors to the global problem. Successful application of pyrolysis in China could both eliminate the dumping of waste and provide a new indigenous source of energy. It is worth stressing that the technology has yet to be confirmed as viable at scale. A degree of caution is justified — but so is a touch of optimism: an immense amount of detailed scientific work is being done to meet our numerous environmental challenges. Predictions of the apocalypse are nothing new, nor are well-intentioned international treaties. But what can make a difference is the combination of great science and the detailed public policy steps that ensure breakthroughs are applied in a timely manner.The writer is an energy commentator for the FT and chair of The Policy Institute at King’s College London
40;WM;Waste Management;2019-05-18T10:00:57Z;Fund managers go to war on plastic waste;Investment groups to challenge companies over packaging and recycling standards;Public awareness of the damage to the world’s oceans and marine environment due to the scourge of plastic waste has soared after David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II television documentary series.Sensing this changing attitude, fund managers have started to take action.Just last week, it was reported that plastic waste had been discovered at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, nearly 11km below the surface of the Pacific Ocean.The first global analysis, published in 2017, estimated that 8.3bn tonnes of plastics has been produced since the industry began to expand after the second world war. About four-fifths has been dumped as waste, while just 9 per cent has been recycled.About 12bn tonnes of plastic waste will end up in landfills or the natural environment by 2050 if current production and waste management trends continue, according to academics at the University of California, University of Georgia and the Sea Education Association in Massachusetts.Investment managers have started to respond to public concern, challenging packaging, consumer and chemical companies on the production and use of plastic as well as stepping up support for recycling and utility companies that deal directly with the problems caused by plastic waste.BMO Global engaged with 27 companies last year on plastic waste, the first concerted effort by the $240bn asset management arm of Bank of Montreal to address the problem. BMO asked the companies to reduce the amount of unnecessary single-use plastic, improve the recyclability of plastic and to redesign packaging to reduce waste.It plans to extend its engagements on plastic waste beyond food, beverage and consumer staples producers to companies operating in the household and personal care sectors.BMO believes that companies will in time have to disclose their entire plastic “footprint” in a similar fashion to carbon footprint reports that provide details of greenhouse gas emissions across an entire organisation.“Plastic waste is a business risk that companies know they will have to address rapidly. We want to see commitments where they don’t exist already, but now implementation is key,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the responsible investment team at BMO GAM.Schroders, the £421bn London-listed asset manager, encountered a lack of data when it began to examine plastics in 2018. This encouraged it to send questionnaires to about 100 companies globally across the packaging, food and beverage, chemicals, waste and recycling sectors.“There was a real dearth of information on the variety of plastics used, the volume of plastics used in packaging, and the use of recycled materials. This makes comparisons between companies in the same sectors problematic,” says Seema Suchak, a sustainable investment analyst at Schroders.Changes in regulations, such as China’s decision in early 2018 to stop importing waste plastic, have helped to raise investor awareness, says Ms Suchak.“Investors know plastic waste is not a theme that is going away. They see bans on plastic bags being introduced all over the world,” she says.MSCI, the index and data analytics provider, hosted a client meeting in London this month to discuss the issue of plastics and plans to hold similar events in Paris and Frankfurt later this year.“Virtually no one was talking about the risks of plastic waste just a few years ago but that is changing very rapidly now,” said Sam Block, a senior ESG researcher at MSCI.“We are measuring the share of company revenues associated with plastics across the packaging, consumer goods and chemicals sectors. We also assess how these companies deal with the risks. Changes in regulations could require companies to reformulate plastic products or even lead them to being shut out of market. Disclosure standards do vary so we have also been using alternative data sources to help refine our model,” said Mr Block.The discovery of more than 400m pieces of plastic debris on the coastline of the remote Cocos (Keeling) Islands has provided more shocking evidence of the scale of the waste problem.Hugely ambitious targets to reduce plastic waste by 2025 have been drawn up by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, founded by the former round the world sailor, in collaboration with UN Environment Programme. This initiative has drawn support from 16 governments, 26 financial institutions and more than 150 companies that produce or consume plastic packaging.The signatories have pledged to eliminate unnecessary plastic and to ensure that remaining plastics are designed to be safely reused, recycled or composted.Signatories from the consumer goods sector include Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Unilever, L’Oréal and Mars.As part of this initiative, six boutique investment companies have pledged to invest a total $275m towards addressing the problems of plastic waste. The investors include Fifth Season Ventures, Closed Loop Partners, Creolus and Ultra Capital.However, no well-known asset management company has signed up yet. Their absence reflects doubts about the scale of the commitments needed to meet the foundation’s ambition to ensure that plastics never become waste, according to a fund manager who did not want to be named.Efforts by governments to improve plastic recycling are accelerating.The Scottish government announced this month that it planned to create the UK’s first deposit return scheme for plastic bottles, which aims to capture 90 per cent of drinks containers for recycling within three years.Maxime Le Floch, an analyst on the £179.4m Impact Opportunities fund run by Hermes, the London-based asset manager, says: “The issue has been that plastic waste was not collected, but there are companies such as Tomra of Norway that can provide solutions to this problem that also offer a compelling investment thesis.”Tomra specialises in reverse vending machines, which are already used in 60 countries to collect used plastic drink containers.Hopes are also growing that chemicals companies will develop compostable, bio-based plastics that can replace some conventional plastics.“Bioplastics have their flaws as they can be more expensive to make and are not yet available in large quantities. Improvements in cellulose conversion technology should enhance the quality, quantity and cost of bioplastics,” says Ms Suchak.Bioplastics also present significant problems. Increased production could lead to higher demand for arable land needed for food production. Carbon emissions from biodegradable plastics could also contribute to climate change.Mr Le Floch says tackling plastic waste requires a multi-dimensional approach.“Bioplastics may look like a good alternative but if they lead to an increase in land use against forests or competing with food crops, then they may not be an appropriate substitute for conventional plastics,” he says.“The issue of plastic waste cannot be looked at just in isolation as the impact of alternatives, such as bioplastics, on the wider environment also needs to be considered.”
41;WM;Waste Management;2019-05-16T13:00:24Z;Millions of pieces of plastic waste found on remote island chain;Beaches on Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean covered with litter;Shocking evidence of the pollution that pervades the world’s oceans has come to light with the discovery that more than 400m pieces of debris litter the coastline of the remote Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The layers of rubbish on the Indian Ocean archipelago weighed an estimated 238 tonnes, and included almost 1m shoes and 373,000 toothbrushes.“The plastics on these beaches came from all over the world,” said Jennifer Lavers, the project leader and a research scientist from the University of Tasmania. “Plastic pollution is now ubiquitous in our oceans, and remote islands are an ideal place to get an objective view of the volume of plastic debris now circling the globe.”The Cocos, a chain of islands 2,000km north-west coast of Australia, lie in the path of an ocean current called the Indonesian Throughflow which runs from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean. The research team analysed a representative sample of 25 sandy and pebble beaches, digging down to a depth of 10cm.“Only 10 per cent of the debris was visible on the surface,” said Dr Lavers. “When you visit a polluted beach you have to remind yourself of the 90 per cent that is likely to be buried beneath the sand.” The findings were published in Scientific Reports.Dr Lavers previously catalogued plastic pollution on the remote and uninhabited Henderson Island in the Pacific. While most of that debris related to fishing, the plastic on the Cocos was largely single-use consumer items such as bottle caps, straws, and shoes.Annett Finger, of Victoria University, another member of the team, estimated that the oceans hold 5.25tn pieces of plastic debris. “The scale of the problem means cleaning up our oceans is currently not possible,” she said. “The only viable solution is to reduce plastic production and consumption while improving waste management to stop this material entering our oceans in the first place.”The Cocos report comes days after the UN placed restrictions on the global trade in plastic waste, which is expected to dramatically reduce imports into developing countries. A recent expedition to the deepest place on earth, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, found traces of plastic waste, almost 11,000 metres below sea-level.Campaigners have identified the global trade in plastic waste as a main culprit in marine litter, because the industrialised world has for years been shipping much of its plastic “recyclables” to developing countries, which often lack the capacity to process all the material.China last year stopped accepting most forms of plastics, triggering a surge of waste into Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. Reports from there suggest that whatever could not be processed was dumped or discarded — often ending up as marine litter.The new UN rules will effectively prevent the US and EU from exporting any mixed plastic waste, as well plastics that are contaminated or unrecyclable — a move that will slash the global plastic waste trade when it comes into effect in January 2021.By adding plastics to the list of controlled substances under the Basel Convention, an international treaty designed to reduce the movements of hazardous waste, the new rule would allow other countries to trade in mixed plastics only if they go through bureaucratic steps to obtain the consent of the country receiving the goods. The US, Argentina and Brazil all lobbied against the change.“It is really going to be a game-changer and dramatically reduce unsustainable plastic trade,” said Jim Puckett, head of the Basel Action Network, a campaign group. He estimates that the new UN rules cover 90 per cent of the historic global plastic waste trade.
42;WM;Waste Management;2019-04-03T22:00:25Z;Vietnam gives way on plastic waste imports;Environmental concerns lose out to industrial needs as economy’s appetite grows;China’s decision to ban imports of plastic waste continues to reverberate. In Vietnam, it has forced the government to choose between protecting either the environment or the domestic economy. The economy has won, for now. Despite fears about growing mountains of waste across the developed world, Beijing’s sudden decision last year to ban waste imports rerouted much of that waste to south-east Asia. In 2018, Thailand and Malaysia became the new depositories of plastic waste from the EU, US and Japan, with Malaysia by far the biggest recipient, taking in 829,000 tonnes. In contrast, plastic waste shipments from the three major exporters to Vietnam dropped 25 per cent from the previous year, the result of the government scrambling midyear to head off a surge in imports. Its decision was made on environmental grounds — Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said he did not want Vietnam to be a “dumping site” for global waste.By December, nearly 19,000 shipping containers of paper, plastics and scrap metal were sitting idle at Vietnam’s main seaports, unable to obtain customs clearance. Despite the first half jump, Vietnam’s imports of plastic waste for the whole of 2018 fell to 381,000 tonnes, slightly below the 2017 figure. But Vietnamese industry needs imported inputs to feed the country’s growing demand for plastic. Plastics manufacturing was a $15.6bn industry last year, equal to 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product, and has been growing at nearly 15 per cent a year since 2010, according to the Vietnam Plastics Association, an industry group. Vietnamese consume 41kg of plastic a year, less than a third of the per capita consumption in Japan and the EU. Vietnam’s petrochemical industry can supply less than 20 per cent of the plastic resins needed by the plastics industry. FPT Securities, a market research firm, says the situation should improve from next year, when two new refineries in the south of the country start operating, although Vietnam will still only be able to meet at most 44 per cent of its own demand. To cover the shortfall, the country has been buying from abroad. It spent over $9bn on plastic resins last year, 20 per cent more than in 2017, from markets with developed oil refining capacity such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia. But the industry can also process plastic resins from imported plastic waste — provided the government is willing to let it in. Recyclers prefer imported to domestic scrap plastic because it is generally better quality and easier to process. This explained the outcry from local plastic recyclers after the suspension of imports. Companies such as Le Tran Plastics and Vinh Thanh Corporation successfully lobbied the government in January to revisit import regulations and permit plastic waste for processing in-country. In relenting, the government said Vietnam would allow imports of plastic waste specifically serving the domestic plastics industry until December 31, 2024. The deadline is later than that imposed by neighbouring Thailand, which has better developed petrochemical capacity and can afford to ban foreign plastic waste from 2021. The deadline is meant to allow time for the domestic waste recycling system to develop. Vietnam does not lack plastic waste. In fact, it is among the world’s top five sources of plastic pollution, generating 1.83m tonnes annually, according to a widely cited 2015 academic study. Plastic waste imports in 2018 were equivalent to less than a tenth of plastic resins importsVietnam’s municipal solid waste has been growing at over 10 per cent annually, a rate that is unlikely to slow given the pace of economic growth. According to the authorities, 90 per cent of domestic waste is buried in landfills or incinerated. The amount of plastic waste that does get recycled is negligible, and mostly handled in villages that do not tend to abide by any regulatory or environmental standards. The Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment estimates that developing the local plastic recycling sector could help to secure half of the inputs needed for the plastics industry. But this requires an overhaul in the management of the entire life cycle of solid waste, including proper collection and sorting at source. The authorities are still grappling with how to devise such a comprehensive action plan. For Vietnamese plastic recyclers, China’s rejection of plastic waste imports presents an opportunity: local companies were previously unable to compete with Chinese firms for cheap, good-quality waste from the west. Plastic waste imports in 2018 were equivalent to less than 10 per cent of plastic resins imports. According to the VPA, there are around 30 recycling businesses licensed for plastic waste imports in Vietnam, although most are small and medium-sized enterprises. But demand for recycled plastics is there, and growing. As well as lowering production costs, environmental concerns are driving demand for recycled plastic. Last year, five of the G7 countries, excluding Japan and the US, pledged to increase the recycled content in plastic products by at least 50 per cent by 2030. Consumer goods multinationals such as Unilever and Coca-Cola are also committed to increasing their use of recycled plastics in packaging. Vietnam is not seeking to become a global recycling hub, but it will keep its doors open to plastic imports to support the domestic industry — at least until it establishes an effective waste management and recycling system to allow more domestic plastic waste to be processed. This is a temporary reprieve for the industry. For the government, it means stepping up monitoring to make sure that imports are going to the plastics industry and that Vietnam does not becoming the “dumping site” that officials fear.scoutAsia is a corporate data and news service from Nikkei and the FT, providing in-depth information about more than 660,000 companies across more than 20 countries in East Asia, South Asia and Asean.

This caused the company to limit production at the plant and warn operating profit would fall by €3m a month.On Friday Renewi said it was updating its outlook for the year ending March 2020 to assume no shipments would be made during the financial year, knocking earnings before interest and tax by around €25m.It also said it would cut its final dividend for the year to March 2019 to 0.5 pence per share, for a total annual dividend of 1.45 pence, compared to 3.05 pence previously. This, plus a “similar reduction” in its dividend in the year to March 2020, would save it €30m, it said.Shares traded down 15 per cent in London on Friday morning, making Renewi the worst performer on the FTSE All-Share index.“We are changing our approach to guidance regarding ATM and we have prudently assumed no such shipments for the purposes of the Group’s financial forecasts for the year ending 31 March 2020,” the company said in a statement.“We are progressing the additional tests required by the Dutch authorities for the resumption of shipments of thermally treated soil from ATM on an interim basis and as an input to a planned new regulatory framework,” it said.Renewi added that while it still expected the authorities to permit shipments to resume under an interim regime during the upcoming financial year, it was “prudent” to update its outlook to assume they would not.
44;WM;Waste Management;2019-03-12T03:32:04Z;Nordics tackle ‘Achilles heel’ of incineration power schemes;Sweden is an unlikely net importer of combustible waste;An experiment in Norway may finally banish concerns about the pollution caused by burning household waste for energy.Norwegian company Norsep is developing a treatment for fly ash — the toxic residue created by cleaning the gases caused by incineration — to neutralise hazardous organochlorines and isolate useful byproducts, such as zinc. It hopes to start a pilot in Oslo in 2021.“We are developing a process that makes fly ash harmless,” says Per Bakke, head of R&D at Norsep. “Without it, incineration is the Achilles heel of waste disposal.”Norsep’s treatment process, one of several being explored in northern Europe, addresses a lingering concern surrounding waste incineration as an energy source. Burning waste is easy — more difficult is cleaning up the gases emitted and making the process an efficient energy source.There is renewed interest in incineration since China restricted imports of recycled waste just over a year ago. Cities in the US and Australia face the prospect of tipping the waste they once sent to China into landfill sites and are looking for alternatives at a time when dumping any waste, but particularly plastics, is under scrutiny.Europe also has a landfill problem, with incineration seen by some as part of the solution. But southern and eastern parts of the EU are “practically devoid” of dedicated incineration capacity and dump 70 per cent of their urban waste in landfill — more than twice the EU average — the European Commission noted recently.Incineration deserves to lose its reputation as a polluter, according to Ella Stengler, managing director of the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants (CEWEP). “Sophisticated flu gas cleaning is now standard,” she says, and there is strict EU legislation and monitoring. For more than a decade it has been illegal to operate incinerators in Europe without this technology, although this is “a big part of the costs”.CEWEP calculates that even if member states comply with existing targets to increase recycling and limit landfill of municipal waste, and even assuming more recycling of commercial waste, the EU will need to cope with 140m tonnes of non-recyclable waste by 2035 — an increase of 40m tonnes.At present, just 1.5 per cent of EU energy demand is met by incineration. Increased efficiency, particularly by using heat more effectively, could raise this to 3 per cent, according to the European Environment Agency.Sweden and Denmark have Europe’s highest per capita capacity for turning waste into energy, after both countries banned landfill around the turn of the century. Both countries import waste for incineration. In 2017, Sweden’s 34 waste-to-energy plants consumed 7.6m tonnes of waste, of which 1.5m came from other European countries.Sweden’s 34 waste-to-energy plants consumed 7.6m tonnes of waste in 2017The Högdalen power station in southern Stockholm embodies the strengths and weaknesses of Sweden’s waste-to-energy system. Built originally beyond the city limits in 1970, its steaming chimney is now surrounded by housing.Every hour, more than 200 trucks laden with household and industrial waste unload their cargo into a vast concrete midden beneath its turbines. With a combustion capacity of 750,000 tonnes a year, the plant heats the equivalent of about 100,000 homes a year.Key to its success is the district heating system of which Högdalen is a part, says Fortum, the Finnish company that co-owns the facility together with Stockholm’s city administration. The company recoups the high cost of cleaning the flu gases by selling both power and heat to homes and businesses. The toxic fly ash is sent to landfill in Norway.“District heating is one of the main reasons that Sweden performs so well on the environment,” says Fortum.Most Swedish cities have a district heating systems, and more than 50 per cent of the demand for domestic heat during the long, cold winter is met in this way. A quarter of district heating is provided by burning waste, according to Jakob Sahlén, a former adviser on energy recovery for the Swedish Waste Management Association.However, there is still more to be done to improve resource management, Mr Sahlén says.“In terms of waste prevention, Sweden is as bad as any industrialised country,” he says. “Waste from energy is a stepping stone. As long as we continue to manufacture products that need to be destroyed, we will still have to do this for some time to come.”A dispute over what to do with the toxic byproducts of burning waste for energy is raising the political temperature in Oslo, which must choose between continuing to dump the fly ash in landfill or take a bet on new technologies for cleaning it up.Signs that Norway’s government will back a new landfill site at Brevik, a village on the Oslo fjord, have led to calls for the Liberal party to quit the ruling coalition.Since the 1990s, Norway has dumped toxic waste into a deep pit on the island of Langøya, south of Oslo. Last year it disposed of more than a 250,000 tonnes of fly ash from Swedish and Danish incinerators.But the site is now almost full, and the company running the landfill is championing Brevik as an alternative. Thanks to the activity of a local limestone firm, Brevik sits on top of 300km of tunnels suitable for storing neutralised fly ash, say supporters of the scheme.Since the plan was floated a few years ago, local people have protested against this “poisonous waste”. In mid-February, their opposition found an echo among the governing Liberals.“If the government opens the mines in Brevik for hazardous waste, then . . . it will be our biggest ever setback, and in such a situation I believe that the Liberals must consider our participation in the government,” Liberal MP Carl-Erik Grimstad told Norwegian media in February.Local representatives of all four of Oslo’s governing parties oppose the plan.NOAH, the company behind the landfill plan, says its disposal methods have been designated as “best available technology” by the EU.“We are not aware of any technology that today can end the need for future landfills, is commercially sustainable and has a satisfactory environmental footprint,” says Anita Sundby, chief commercial officer.Porsgrunn, the municipal authority in Brevik, opposes the landfill scheme, which it says weakens the incentive to find better treatment methods, according to Pål Martin Sand, a lawyer for Porsgrunn Commune.“If a private entity has a lot of landfill space, they won’t think about how to reduce or re-use the fly ash better,” Mr Sand says.“The minister of the environment should not take this decision based on yesterday’s treatment methods.”

It did not provide a regional breakdown of the investments.However, £38m was invested in the Ferrybridge waste-to-energy plant in Yorkshire, according to the report, with several new investments also made in green projects in Ireland and Sweden.Last year, Mark Dooley, GIG’s global head, said the group was targeting £3bn of investment over the next three years.According to its most recent accounts, the Green Investment Bank, the trading name of GIG in Europe and the UK, made a profit of £225m for the year to end of March 2018 compared with £1.5m a year earlier.

I was diving with my father and I saw a gigantic jellyfish and thought it was a mythical creature,” says the Spanish designer Andrea Salinas. “The ocean is a magical but fragile place. We need to protect it. What if our children never know a healthy ocean?”Salinas founded her sustainable swimwear brand Now_Then in Mallorca three years ago, after decades working as a swimwear designer for fast-fashion brands. Having witnessed first-hand the “frenetic pace of garment production and the horrifying impact it has on our planet”, she decided to create swim and surf wear with a difference. Her chic one-pieces, high-waisted bikini bottoms and cropped rash guards are all made from recycled ocean plastic.Salinas is one of a growing number of designers making clothing from waste plastics. Adidas has collaborated with creative marine organisation Parley for the Oceans on sneakers; London-based Riley Uggla, of Riley Studio, creates simple sweatshirts and anoraks from recycled fishing nets. Resortwear designer Carolina K offers plaid-printed sportswear, and New York-based brand Svilu makes super-soft loungewear woven with fibres from recycled plastic bottles. Luxury brands are also getting on board: Breitling has recently unveiled a new watch — the Superocean Héritage II Chronograph 44 Outerknown — that retails for £5,600 and features a strap made from ocean waste.Awareness about the detrimental effects plastic is having on our planet is growing. Last March, scientists discovered that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — a growing accumulation of plastic waste floating in the ocean — was 16 times bigger than previously estimated. Made up of approximately 1.8tn pieces of plastic, it weighs about 800 tonnes and covers an area more than twice the size of France. Micro-particles of plastic have been found in the stomachs of all kinds of fish and seabirds.“We use plastic at a rate that is not controlled,” said Cyrill Gutsch, the founder of Parley for the Oceans, during his acceptance speech at the Fashion Awards in London in December. The company won the special recognition award for innovation for inventing a plastic made from repurposed marine waste. Stella McCartney is just one brand to have used it, in its backpacks and sneakers.According to Gutsch, the fashion industry has a way to go in the great ocean clean-up. Other industries, like beauty, have already been making waves: microbeads were banned last year, and a whole host of sustainable beauty brands has recently sprung up. But fashion is still lagging behind: textile dyeing is the biggest polluter of clean water, and 20-25 per cent of globally produced chemical compounds are used in the textile finishing industry. Clothing made from synthetic materials such as nylon and polyester releases micro-particles of plastic when washed.“In the three months since we launched in September, Riley Studio has managed to upcycle 2,000 plastic bottles and, by using recycled materials, we have been able to save 3,219 litres of oil,” says Riley Studio’s Uggla, who did nine months of research before launching her brand. “Regenerated nylon has exactly the same properties as virgin nylon. But the global-warming impact of producing it is 80 per cent less.”How exactly do you turn plastic into parkas and pants? “Waste such as fishing nets, fabric scraps and industrial plastic are collected from oceans and landfills and sent to plants where they are cleaned and sorted,” says Uggla, whose oversized hoodie is made from three-and-a-half plastic bottles. After it’s been cleaned, the plastic is turned into tiny chips of plastic that are spun into a yarn.Do customers really want clothing made from plastic, though? “More brands are creating pieces that don’t compromise when it comes to style, fit or comfort,” says Britt Cosgrove, co-founder of Svilu. “Customer perception is changing.” Salinas agrees. “Our swim pieces are super-flattering. We say they’re eco-luxe — merging sustainability, function and style,” she says.Using plastic in clothing has actual benefits, too. Not only is recycled nylon lightweight, breathable and flexible (making it “perfect for things such as hot yoga and running”, says Quang Dinh, co-founder of New York-based activewear label Girlfriend Collective), it also gives knitwear increased durability. “By blending a soft natural fibre like wool with recycled plastic, you get the best of both worlds — a lightweight, warm sweater with increased recovery after washing,” says Svilu co-founder Marina Polo. “The plastic helps keep the shape.”And while re-using plastic in clothing is not necessarily new — American outerwear brand Patagonia pioneered the model in 1992 when it made a fleece from recycled polyester — developments in technology mean that brands today don’t have to sacrifice on quality.More and more suppliers are getting into the field. Girlfriend Collective sources its recycled materials from a plant in Taiwan, while Salinas and Uggla get theirs from Italian manufacturer Econyl. Footwear brand Timberland, meanwhile, buys plastic bottles from a recycling plant in Haiti and turns them into soles for its boots.“For the first decade of recycled materials, there was a clear trade-off in performance,” says Matt Dwyer, senior director of materials, innovation and development at Patagonia. “We saw issues with tear strength, piling, and durability of colour — the fabric would bleach in the sun.”Today, some 80 per cent of the brand’s offering is made from recycled plastics. “There’s been a tonne of research and development, so now just about any product, whether it’s a fleece, outerwear or equipment, can be made using recycled materials. Even our most technical outerwear products now contain recycled fibres, without showing any drop in performance.”Swimwear is an ever-growing arena for recycled materials — with brands such as British contemporary label Paper London, Italian swimwear brand Suro and the H&M-owned Arket all now using eco-neoprene in their pieces. “The sea is in our DNA, it’s our way of life,” says Salinas. “If we need the ocean for our brand, we must be respectful towards it and not contribute to the crisis by using virgin materials.”Dinh agrees. “We need to be good stewards of what we have on this earth for future generations to live in.” But with fast fashion still on the rise — 80bn pieces of clothing were produced globally in 2017 — there is still much work to be done.“In 2012, the marine activist Paul Watson told me that the ocean would die in the year 2048,” said Gutsch, of the conversation that first led to the creation of Parley. “Today, Nasa tells us we only have 10 to 12 years left. The fashion industry has to create a new dream.” One that involves the existence of a living, breathing deep blue sea — the perfect vacation backdrop for that sophisticated, sustainable swimsuit, no doubt.Follow @FTStyle on Twitter and @financialtimesfashion on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.

47;WM;Waste Management;2018-12-30T05:00:24Z;China ban on importing contaminated waste leaves Australia awash in rubbish;Policy shift means trash processed for recycling still ends up in landfill;"Dozens of workers sifting through bundles of plastics, cardboard and paper at an Australian recycling centre are at the front line of a global waste crisis sparked by China’s ban on reprocessing contaminated materials.Craig Barker, general manager of Suez Western Australia, says the Chinese move has “taken out effectively 50 per cent of the global capacity for recyclable material to be re-manufactured — it’s removed it overnight.”The French utility is one of thousands of companies struggling to cope with Beijing’s imposition in January of strict limits on the recycling it imports.Australia’s situation is symptomatic of a burgeoning global problem. Countries are awash in the waste previously sent to China, which until recently served as the world’s recycler. As materials pile up in Australia the solution is often to send trash designated for recycling straight to landfill, appalling environmentalists.Suez said China’s policy shift halved the value of recycling it collected in Australia and warned that the nation urgently needed a new national waste strategy, fresh investment and a strong local market for recycled materials if the industry was to remain viable domestically.“We’ve got to reduce reliance on offshore reprocessing and that means building local infrastructure and creating demand for recycled product,” said Mr Barker.He said consumer education was also important to reduce contamination in household recycling.The impact of China’s rules, which restrict imports to recycling with just 0.5 per cent levels of contaminants or lower, has been dramatic, since the vast bulk of material is excluded. In the first half of 2017 China and Hong Kong bought 60 per cent of plastic waste exported by G7 countries, according to data compiled by the Financial Times. This fell to 10 per cent in the same period this year, as companies sought alternative markets, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, or stockpiled recycling materials. China’s ban is one element of a global waste crisis, the result of a surging population, growing urbanisation and a failure to adopt more sustainable practices, including recycling. A World Bank study estimated that global production of waste would rise from today’s rate of 2bn tonnes a year to 3.4bn tonnes by 2050.By that time, the World Economic Forum has predicted, the weight of plastics clogging the world’s oceans will be heavier than that of all the fish in the sea.These global waste problems are mirrored in Australia. Mark Venhoek, Suez Australia chief executive, told a parliamentary inquiry in March that China’s virtual import ban on recycling had sent the industry into “crisis mode”.About 1.3m tonnes of Australian recycling exported to China has been affected, including 35 per cent of plastics and 30 per cent of paper and cardboard. Some of the total was redirected overseas but a government report in October concluded that large volumes of recycled materials ended up in landfill because of contamination and technical restraints on sorting co-mingled waste. In February Remondis, a multinational company, wrote to clients in Melbourne warning them it would have to bury some recycling as “processing centres can no longer send the waste to China”. In April Ipswich council in Queensland warned it would send all its recycling to landfill because of the China crisis, although it later signed a contract with a recycling company under which it would not bury all the material. “The public were outraged at the idea of sorted recycling going to landfill,” said David O’Loughlin, president of the Australian Local Government Association.He said the best way to ensure that recycling was not diverted to landfill was to promote policies to boost the value of such materials, including taxing the use of virgin plastics and incentivising the use of recycled materials.“The government needs to mandate the use of recycled plastics and recycled rubber from tyres in products, such as asphalt we use in road building,” said Mr O’Loughlin. “Virgin plastics are cheaper to make than recycled plastic — so we need to create incentives to use recycled material. More recycling also boosts local job creation.”5,000How many kilometres of rubbish trucks will be needed to remove the waste made each day, in 2025Australia’s federal and state governments are drafting a national waste policy, which aims to recycle more, produce less waste and phase out the use of harmful plastics. But even agreeing on aspirational targets — such as cutting waste by 10 per cent by 2030; increasing recycling and energy recovery from waste to 80 per cent; and using 30 per recycled material — has proved impossible so far.“The opportunity for Australians to see less waste and cleaner natural environments has been hijacked in the name of political opportunism,” said Melissa Price, Australia’s environment minister, after a meeting with her state counterparts this monthThe failure to agree the targets also disappointed the recycling industry, which warns that south-east Asian nations will probably follow China’s decision to ban contaminated waste, so deepening the problems for the Australian industry. Thailand has already indicated it will ban foreign plastic waste by 2021.“We’ve seen the Malaysians put in temporary bans and we’ve seen other south-east Asian countries start talking about the impacts of the influx of recycling,” said Mr Barker. “This is an absolute risk and a pressing issue for us now.”Additional reporting by David BloodTwitter: @JamieSmythF"

49;WM;Waste Management;2018-12-05T04:31:30Z;Businesses find appetite to cut food waste;Tech start-ups are helping to change the throwaway culture;Food waste was not a problem when the forerunner of Baldor Specialty Foods, one of North America’s largest fresh produce distributors, began trading as a pushcart in downtown Manhattan a century ago. Before the advent of landfill sites and refrigerators, customers would generally eat all the local fruit and vegetables they bought rather than throw it away.“There wasn’t this idea you could put it in a bag, throw it on to a kerb and make it somebody else’s problem,” says Thomas McQuillan, vice-president of strategy, culture and sustainability at Baldor.Today the food company — which processes about 544 tonnes of fresh produce a week at its plant in the Bronx — is using technology to help it return to its waste-free past. Baldor, which makes products such as carrot sticks and melon balls, has developed a software platform for its restaurant and grocer customers to track inventory, buy fresh food and measure waste, helping to reduce surplus.Weather-tracking technology allows Baldor to adapt where it buys quickly, reducing the risk of ruined produce. The company continually measures the temperature of produce in transit and is developing edible, plant-based packing to preserve it for longer, reducing unrecyclable waxed paper packaging.Awareness about the volume of food wasted in people’s homes has grown in recent years, and many food businesses are also now taking action.$1.2tnValue of the food thrown away around the world every yearThe industrialisation of food production after the second world war, ­followed by the “green revolution” — when technology, fertilisers and pesticides increased yields — have meant people in developed economies live in an era of food abundance.Yet a third of the world’s food, worth $1.2tn a year, is thrown away, according to UN data. Not only does this affect the environment by increasing greenhouse gas emissions and using land and water resources, it also costs businesses money. The US spends $218bn a year — 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product — growing, processing, transporting and disposing of food that is never eaten, according to ReFED, a non-profit organisation fighting food waste.Food waste is a logistical problem. In the same way tech companies such as Amazon and Uber transformed the way objects and people move from A to B, tech start-ups are trying to help food move from field to fork more efficiently. From drones that support more precise farming to solar-powered cold storage, insects that turn food waste into animal feed to robotic food processors, the industry is ripe for innovation.More than $125m of venture capital and private equity funding has been invested in US food waste start-ups in 2018, according to ReFED.“We are just now seeing the innovation curve flex upward,” says Chris Cochran, executive director of ReFED and a former sustainability executive at Walmart. “We have had less innovation than we wanted to see and less investment to date. We are just scraping the surface of what’s possible.”$125mof VC and PE funding invested in US food waste start-ups in 2018Spoiler Alert is one such start-up. The software platform allows retailers and foodmakers to donate to food banks or sell to discounters any surplus produce that would otherwise end up in landfill.“Technology hasn’t been as lively in the food industry as in other industries and we are starting to see more appetite for it,” says Ricky Ashenfelter, chief executive of the Boston-based company.One of its biggest clients, meal kit service HelloFresh, claims to have reduced the amount of organic waste it sends to landfill by 65 per cent and has donated 1m meals to those in need with Spoiler Alert’s help.Big food companies are eyeing these start-ups for potential partnerships and acquisitions as the financial case for cutting waste becomes more urgent. During his time at Walmart, Mr Cochran said food waste shifted from being seen as a cost of doing business to a “CFO-level priority”.“Since the great recession there has been a change in market dynamics, where top-line growth has been much harder, so food companies are looking for more creative ways for increasing their bottom line and food waste has risen to the top,” he says.While technology helps businesses do this, is there a risk they will adopt technology for technology’s sake? “What worries me is there has been lot of investment from Silicon Valley and elsewhere that’s not solving the real problems,” says Danielle Nierenberg, co-founder of Food Tank, a non-profit organisation that campaigns to reform the food system.She says there are many low-tech ways to reduce food waste based on traditional farming methods, such as those used in developing countries where access to this technology is limited. For example, cutting off and eating the green tops of sweet potatoes to extend shelf life and provide extra nutrition.Baldor has also benefited from deploying simple techniques — it sells peelings to juice and soup manufacturers and turns non-edible leftovers, such as melon rinds, into animal feed. As a result, the company no longer sends any organic refuse to the landfill.Either way, the tech innovation happening in food waste is helping to drive a wider cultural change in the way people value food. “There is so much momentum right now,” says Ms Nierenberg. “I don’t think it’s an issue that’s going to go out of vogue again.”This article has been amended to show that Spoiler Alert works with HelloFresh.
50;WM;Waste Management;2018-12-05T02:50:41Z;Lynas considers legal action after Malaysia imposes new conditions;Shares in ASX-listed rare earths miner fall by a quarter;Lynas Corp said on Wednesday it was considering taking legal action against the Malaysian government over its decision to impose tough new conditions on its licence to operate in the country. The stand-off between one of the world’s only rare earths suppliers outside China and the new government in Kuala Lumpur caused shares in ASX-listed Lynas to fall by a quarter when the market opened. “This appears to be policy based on politics, not policy based on science,” said Amanda Lacaze, the Australian-listed miner’s chief executive. “However, we are confident we are well placed to manage potential changes and our long-term investment thesis remains strong.” Lynas said in a statement it would consider all options, including legal action. The review of Lynas is the latest reassessment of projects launched under Najib Razak, the former Malaysian prime minister, by Mahathir Mohamad, the new prime minister. Mr Mahathir has criticised Mr Najib for poor governance amid the scandal surrounding the state investment fund 1MDB, from which an alleged $4.5bn has gone missing. The US, Japan and other western nations consider the Lynas plant in Kuantan, Malaysia as strategically important because it is one of the few suppliers of processed rare earths outside of China. Rare earths, a group of 17 elements, are widely used by the electronics and oil and gas industries. They are also critical for magnets used in wind turbines and electric cars. Rare earth demand is expected to increase more than 8 per cent this year due to rising sales of electric cars, according to consultancy Roskill.Late on Tuesday Malaysia’s ministry for energy said in a statement it would impose two new pre-conditions for Lynas’s licence renewal in 2019, including that the miner must export all the radioactive waste generated by its A$1bn ($731m) processing plant in Kuantan. The ministry said it was concerned with the risk from the accumulation of 450,000 tonnes of low-level radioactive residues without a viable solution to manage it.Lynas has been the subject of a review by a parliamentary committee over its radioactive waste management practices and its impact on the environment. The company said the committee’s report found its operations were “low risk” and compliant with applicable laws.But the ministry pointed to increasing risks to the local community as the amount of waste residue grew at the Kuantan plant, which has been in operation since 2012.Dylan Kelly, an analyst at CLSA, an investment group, said Lynas would have to continue to operate under political uncertainty but added that the cost of sending the waste back to Australia should not be insurmountable. “The cost impact should be neutral due to the rehabilitation bond already paid by Lynas. The question is whether the waste material can be shipped back to Australia in time to meet the September 2019 licence renewal,” he said. 
51;WM;Waste Management;2018-11-30T18:14:55Z;Investors Chronicle: Pennon, Greggs, Thomas Cook;Companies analysis from our sister publication;Impressive performance in the current cycle and a rapidly growing waste business underpin our buy call, along with a prospective yield of 5.4 per cent, writes Tom Dines.As the current five-year regulatory cycle approaches its end in December of next year, the water companies are pushing their credentials in the hope the regulator will look favourably on their draft business plans in its initial assessment at the end of January.Pennon’s plan was awarded “enhanced” status for the current cycle, and management is keen to repeat that success. These half-year numbers should help, with the group achieving its highest ever customer service score and a cumulative return on regulated equity — a key metric for water utilities — of 11.8 per cent.The future performance of the water business now sits in large part with the regulator, but while it is making its assessments, waste management business Viridor looks to be performing well. Cash profits reached £78.4m in the first half of the year — equivalent to 27 per cent of the adjusted total, up from 23 per cent in the same period last year. Most of Viridor’s returns come from its energy recovery facilities, which have been ramping up rapidly. Three out of four new facilities are now operational, generating a 29 per cent increase in profits in the period.Management remains confident in the long-term prospects for this part of the business, forecasting a capacity gap of more than 7m tonnes for energy recover facilities by 2030.Bloomberg puts the consensus earnings per share forecast at 52.2p for the March 2019 year-end, from 50.9p in full-year 2018.Greggs is clearly defying the odds when it comes to high street retailing and we expect it to do well over the festive period.Shares in baker Greggs rose by as much as 13 per cent after the group revealed that strong sales growth had continued from the third quarter into October and November. As part of a trading update, the group revealed total sales growth of 9 per cent over the eight weeks ended November 24, with company-managed shop like-for-like sales up 4.5 per cent. That underlying performance beat management’s expectations, prompting improved full-year adjusted pre-tax profit guidance of £86m, up from £82m.This performance was in direct contrast to the wider issues blighting the UK high street. October marked another month of declining visitors to town centres as consumers continued to head online. The vacancy rate is also at a 15-month high, after several brands disappeared from the high street this year.While there is still a lot to play for before the end of the year — especially as retail enters its peak trading season — it’s encouraging to see sales performing strongly against tough comparatives. Brokerage Peel Hunt also said the bakery’s Christmas ranges had “landed well” — retail speak for “resonated with customers” — but work had also been done to reduce queueing times and convert new customers into sales. As analysts there argue, it is not that visitors to the high street are making a dedicated trip to Greggs, but rather that potential customers find the products appealing, the service helpful and the environment conducive to a quick and convenient purchase.Despite a lack of detail on margins, a good like-for-like sales performance has inevitably fed into this, as has a tight grip on operational costs. As such, Peel Hunt followed the company’s lead, marking up current-year pre-tax profit forecasts to £86.7m and full-year 2019 profit forecasts from £85m to £89m.While the brokerage says the next six weeks are “crucial”, it admits it got “carried away” with Greggs’ sales slowdown earlier this year, describing the weak spring/summer season as “no more than a blip”.The shares have lost roughly 70 per cent of their value over the past 12 months and now trade at 35p, or just five times forward earnings.It’s been widely reported that a warm summer discouraged Brits from seeking sunshine abroad. In fact, most UK-listed tour operators have blamed heatwave-induced staycations for subdued growth in the latter part of the year. But for Thomas Cook, the situation is so dire that it has prompted a second profit warning in the space of just two months, only days ahead of full-year results. Ultimately, the company decided to cancel its full-year dividend.Despite a 6 per cent rise in like-for-like sales to £9.58bn, underlying operating profit fell by nearly a fifth to £250m, missing analyst expectations by 10 per cent.Most of this shortfall came from an £88m decline in tour operator profits, dented by heavily discounted late bookings after Brits were less inclined to book last-minute summer getaways. But the miss also included £28m of “legacy and non-recurring charges” to underlying operating profit, which included a write-down of historic hotel receivables, £4m-worth of flight disruption costs and £10 in “transformation” costs.Now, Thomas Cook has set itself some “strategic priorities” for the coming year, which include addressing the poor performance in the UK tour operator business and better management of capacity and operational flexibility. Cost savings are also on the agenda, as is a focus on selling higher-margin own-brand hotels and holidays.September’s profit warning also blamed the recent weather for discouraging holidays abroad. But this second update, released three days ahead of the group’s annual results statement, is more worrying.Indeed, the £28m charge could have been classified as a one-off item if the problem was exceptional, but it made a last-minute shift into the reported figures instead. An £80m increase in net debt to £389m was also higher than some expected, which management blamed on delayed bookings. A free cash outflow of £148m wasn’t ideal either, partly a result of a slow start to the winter booking season.Momentum investing has stopped working. Having massively outperformed the FTSE 350 in the 10 years to August — rising by more than 250 per cent against the index’s less than 50 per cent gain — my no-thought momentum portfolio has lost more than 20 per cent since then, more than twice as much as the index has fallen.In part, this is because almost all stockpicking strategies have had a hard time. Because a few big stocks such as AstraZeneca and Royal Dutch Shell have beaten the market in the past three months most shares have underperformed market indices, which are weighted by market capitalisation. Because of this, most stockpickers have underperformed the market. According to Trustnet, only 27 of 253 unit trusts in the all companies sector have outperformed L&G’s index fund since August.This, though, doesn’t explain why momentum has done so badly as to underperform every one of those 253 funds.Nor can the blame be placed upon one stock or sector doing badly, Momentum’s failure has been evenly spread across many stocks. Premier Oil, Burford Capital, Softcat and Oxford Biomedica have all done badly recently.So, what can explain momentum’s terrible performance?One possibility is simple bad luck. The standard deviation of returns on momentum relative to the FTSE 350 since 2004 is such that the underperformance we’ve seen in the past three months has a 1 per cent chance of occurring. That seems very unlikely. But there have been 56 non-overlapping three-month periods since I began the portfolio, so there’s an almost 50:50 chance of such a loss occurring once in this time.There is, however, a much more troubling possibility. Perhaps investors wised up to the merits of momentum investing in the summer. If so, they would have bid up the prices of momentum shares too much, with the result that they became overpriced and so subsequently fell.There’s a precedent for this. In the 1980s, for example, investors realised that small stocks had beaten the market for decades. So they piled into them, with the result that they underperformed the market for the following 10 years. This fits a pattern. John Cotter and Niall McGeever at University College Dublin have shown that several stock market anomalies have weakened or disappeared in recent years.If this is the case, it should trouble all stockpickers. It means that any hitherto good strategy can suddenly fail because investors have wised up. It also means that we cannot trust fund managers’ track record. Good past performance might be because the manager has followed a strategy to which investors have now cottoned on to, causing his holdings to become overpriced.Although this explanation seems plausible, it suffers from a problem: why should investors only have wised up now? We’ve known for years that momentum works. The first solid evidence for it was published in 2002 by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman and lotsof corroboration has followed. Why should it have taken so long for investors to cotton on?The answer might be that they’ve been scared to do so because momentum investing is in fact risky. It’s just that this risk has materialised recently.Victoria Dobrynskaya at Moscow’s National Research University has pointed out a curious feature of momentum strategies – that they tend to underperform the market a lot when the market itself does badly. They have high downside betas. The historic success of momentum investing, she believes, is at least partly a compensation for taking on the risk of losing a lot when the market falls.The fact that momentum has done badly recently when the market itself has fallen is entirely consistent with this. And there have been many other times when momentum has underperformed a falling market, such as in the first three months of this year.If this is the case, then momentum should outperform again when the market stabilises.Or will it? One difficulty I have with this story is that there is one obvious period when momentum did not underperform a bear market: the crash of 2008-09. If momentum did not do especially badly then – when pretty much all other risks materialised – can we be confident that it really is especially risky? And if momentum holds up in truly terrible times, why should it pay out such a huge risk premium in normal times?What we have here, then, is a genuine puzzle. We just don’t know whether the failure of momentum investing is permanent or temporary.In truth, though, this is not just a story about momentum investing. The same problem, at some time or other, afflicts all stockpicking strategies. All suffer periods of underperformance: value investing, and Warren Buffett, did badly during the tech bubble, for example. Only with hindsight can we tell for sure whether the underperformance is temporary or not. But of course investors need foresight rather than hindsight. It is devilishly hard in real time to distinguish between the investor who has the courage to stick with a proven strategy and the stubborn fool who carries on in the face of contrary evidence.Chris Dillow is an economics commentator for Investors ChronicleThe Financial Times and its journalism, including Investors Chronicle content, are subject to a self-regulation regime under the FT Editorial Code of Practice: FT.com/editorialcode

The waste, which was impounded by customs officials, was declared as “plastic synthetic flakes” but was found to contain rubbish including batteries, bulbs, used dextrose tubes, electronic equipment and nappies. Environmental campaigners on Thursday staged a protest outside South Korea’s embassy in Taguig City, metropolitan Manila, holding signs saying “Please take your garbage back” and “Philippines is not rich countries’ dumpsite”.“We are concerned that plastics that are difficult or are costly to recycle in your country are being dumped in low and middle-income countries such as the Philippines in the guise of ‘recycling’,” the Ecological Waste Coalition of the Philippines, a non-governmental organisation, wrote to the South Korean ambassador in a letter seen by the Financial Times.China, formerly home to the world’s largest recycling industry, last year cut off most imports of plastic, paper and other waste, upending the global recycling industry as prices for scrap plastic and paper collapsed and rich countries hastened to find new places to send their waste.An FT investigation confirmed a spike this year in the flow of waste into south-east Asian countries led by Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. “We are seriously disturbed by this latest dumping incident, which is not the first from South Korea,” said Manny Calonzo, an adviser to the EcoWaste Coalition. “We do not have the capacity to handle additional waste materials because we ourselves are facing a serious garbage challenge, so we are totally against this dumping practice.” According to EcoWaste, a separate 5,000-tonne shipment of mixed waste, declared as “solid granular particles of wood chips and synthetic resin”, arrived at the Philippine port of Cebu in February 2017 and was returned to South Korea on the order of customs and port authorities. The Philippine Department of Environmental and Natural Resources this week vowed to move quickly on the latest rubbish shipment, “We will not let this issue drag on,” Philippine media quoted a DENR official as saying. This year, authorities in Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand have all taken steps to restrict imports of foreign waste, after finding hazardous and non-recyclable materials mixed in some shipments. Thailand plans to ban all imports of plastic waste from 2021. Twitter: @JohnReedwrites
53;WM;Waste Management;2018-11-08T08:57:39Z;Profit warning sends shares in Renewi down nearly a fifth;;What investors in waste management company Renewi must have deemed rubbish results sent shares down nearly a fifth on Thursday, to the bottom of London’s main market.Three days after announcing its chief executive would step down to become chief operating officer at turnround specialist Melrose, Renewi warned on full-year profits and said profit before tax for the six months to September 30 had fallen 7 per cent, despite a 1 per cent rise in revenue.Shares in the Dutch recycler fell 17 per cent in early trade in London.Renewi said it had been notified on Wednesday by regulators that its treated soil required further analysis before the company could continue to supply cleaned soil to the market.As a result, Renewi said it did not expect to resume full soil production at its ATM soil treatment facility this financial year, which would reduce operating profits by €3m per month.“We will limit production until the situation is resolved and this will reduce expected profit for the current financial year,” the company said.However, Renewi said trading for the period had been in line with expectations, “against a strong result in the prior period.” It said demand for recycling services was increasing, helped by “a clear environmental need, increasing regulation and customer pull.”
54;WM;Waste Management;2018-11-05T10:00:25Z;Recycling alone will not solve the plastic problem;Manufacturers must develop and use more ecological packaging;Plastic, a durable, malleable, customisable material that is easy to manufacture, is arguably the definitive 20th century “mod-con”. It has proved irresistible to consumers and manufacturers who have been complacent about the collateral damage it causes the environment. But the tide — now awash with an additional 8m tonnes of plastic entering the oceans annually — is slowly turning.The scale of the environmental problem is staggering. More than 6.3bn tonnes of plastic waste has been produced since the 1950s, more than half of which was produced in the past 16 years, and plastic production is expected to double again in the next 20 years. Despite higher recycling rates, large amounts of plastic leak into the environment. Estimates suggest there were will be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050 and there is evidence that it is present throughout the human food chain. An ecologically and technologically superior replacement for many uses of plastic is long overdue.Consumers have become avid recyclers. Yet this is not as good an outcome as it seems. Even when plastics are recyclable and put in a recycling bin, the majority still ends up in landfill or incinerators causing huge emission problems, or ends up in the sea.Recycling is a complex, expensive, low-margin business. It is made harder because, although 95 per cent of people in the US and EU markets recycle, only about 30 per cent recycle carefully enough for it to be usable. Even more responsibility lies with manufacturers who pay no direct penalty for choosing to use materials like black plastics and polystyrene, which are uneconomical or impossible to recycle.While the US and EU governments have preached recycling at home, they have for the most part outsourced it to countries with looser regulatory environments. This is no longer an option. China, long the largest recipient of countries’ unwanted recycling, closed its doors to low quality shipments last year. Initially it was displaced to other countries in the region. Their governments are now also fed up with the west’s persistent nimbyism and are looking set to follow China’s suit.Companies and governments are being forced to do things differently. In the past week, the European Parliament announced a ban on single-use cutlery, cotton buds, straws and stirrers from 2021 and declared that all non-replaceable plastic be reduced by 25 per cent by 2025. More than 250 businesses, governments and other organisations have signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Signatories want all plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable within seven years.Nevertheless, growing demand for alternatives to plastic is running ahead of the scientific breakthroughs. These are needed to ensure the environmental impact of replacing it is a net positive. One popular proposition — using paper instead of plastic where feasible — could decrease the amount of natural carbon storage available (at least while trees regrow). This exacerbates global warming, a more pressing problem.Having turned consumers into keen recyclers, governments must ensure recycling works. This will require an internationally joined-up regulatory environment that ensures manufacturers bear the cost of using non-recyclable or uneconomical materials.Equally, consumers should continue to demand a circular plastic economy. This would be a world in which unnecessary and eco-unfriendly plastic is eliminated, all plastic packaging is 100 per cent reusable, recyclable or compostable.

55;WM;Waste Management;2018-11-02T05:00:58Z;Plastic is less than fantastic, Mr Hammond;A challenge for the chancellor: help address the ongoing recycling calamity;"It was a Budget for hard-working journalists. The chancellor’s late start and long-winded speech on Monday meant that by the time he finished, the FT had less than three hours to write, edit and produce a 20-page Budget special.There were no scary financial shocks for the wealthy — although there was one for me. With less than an hour to deadline, one of my teeth fell out.A troublesome crown came loose as I was chewing over the impact of income tax changes. “I can’t deal with this now,” I thought. So I just pretended it hadn’t happened. I popped the tooth on my keyboard and carried on typing.I then emailed my dentist, and by 10.30am the next morning I had a gleaming temporary gnasher. It was as if it had never happened.Looking back at the Budget, I get the same sense of disbelief. For the chancellor to spend money he may well not have on a feel-good income tax cut is a massive gamble — and shows how much the Conservatives fear a general election.No Brexit deal has been done, the rosy forecasts could evaporate as quickly as they appeared and the promise to “end austerity” has a hollow ring when billions of pounds of welfare cuts are still working their way through the system.Fighting the rising tide of plastic waste was another issue that came to the fore in the Budget. I know readers care deeply about the environment, both in your personal lives and investment choices. The rise of “ESG” investing — standing for environmental, social and governance — has been a huge story this year.A consultation into a “plastic tax” has been launched, which would impose a levy on all packaging that does not include at least 30 per cent recycled material by 2022, but the chancellor stopped short of a “latte levy” on disposable takeaway cups.One of my most-read columns this year calculated the return on investment on a reusable coffee cup. My drip-free reusable KeepCup has more than paid for itself since then. It cost nearly £13, but nets me a 50p discount in some coffee chains.It has also solved another minor middle class annoyance. As a Waitrose & Partners loyalty card holder, I’m entitled to a daily free coffee. However, the queue in the branch near the FT office has often been enormous. Not any more! Now that the supermarket has decreed that customers have to bring their own reusable cup, it’s easy peasy.This is part of a wider pledge to cut packaging waste and find alternatives to black plastic — commonly used for posh ready meals and premium fruit and veg — which is notoriously hard to recycle. That’s good. But even if you pride yourself on faithfully rinsing out cans, trays and yoghurt pots, I have some bad news — recycling is no longer the answer.Once collected, our recycling is shipped around the world. China had been the centre of the global recycling trade, but a year ago, decided to stop taking most of it. Experts say this has created a “global crisis” in plastic waste. As the FT reported a few weeks ago, collection bags emblazoned with the names of London councils have been found dumped in Malaysia. We simply cannot carry on as we are.“Zero waste” campaigners say rather than rely on recycling, we should look to the other Rs — refuse, reduce, reuse and rot.Many environmentally sustainable ideas are also pleasingly thrifty and old fashioned. Buying loose fruit and veg in a paper bag; brewing loose leaf tea instead of using tea bags (which contain plastic); putting scraps on the compost heap and taking the bottles back to the shop to get the deposit.“Make do and mend” was the money-saving mantra of my grandparents. I support the grassroots movement of consumers fighting for the “right to repair” items such as iPhones and washing machines rather than chuck them away and buy new ones.Previous generations had no choice. Their thriftiness was driven by a lack of cash. I find that my worst excesses are driven by the need for convenience.I am cash rich but time poor. I can order my shopping online and it will arrive the next day swaddled in packaging, having been driven to my door in a Diesel van. Even worse? Takeaway food, which is either covered in mounds of plastic, or greasy cardboard that cannot be recycled. I am trying to mend my ways.Even if I haven’t got a lot of money, I could buy a £5 dress online — the subject of a furious debate in Parliament this week on the sustainability of fast fashion. Our disposable attitude towards cheap clothing means that 400,000 tons ends up in landfill every year, and washing all those man-made fibres means plastic is leaching into waste water.Do sustainable choices have to be expensive? Natural fibres cost a lot more. But by buying fewer, more sustainable items and keeping them for longer (with the odd darn) we could be better off and so could the planet.I am fascinated by the rise of zero-waste shops. One of London’s biggest — Bulk Market — is set to reopen in new premises in Hackney this month, after crowdfunding more than £20,000 from supporters. Shoppers bring their own jars and containers, then weigh and fill them with all kinds of items from dried goods to olive oil and even craft beer and gin. Back in the day, the Body Shop used to do this for dewberry bubble bath.Slapping a tax on plastic is one way of addressing the problem. But if, in his next public outing, Mr Hammond can come up with a way of encouraging good behaviour as well as penalising bad, we could see such schemes proliferate — along with the investment opportunities that go with them.Claer Barrett is the editor of FT Money.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

So too — assisted by shifts in the recycling industry — are the Irish company’s bosses. Europe’s biggest cardboard packaging maker has reported a 7 per cent jump in third-quarter underlying revenue. Muscular operational gearing meant pre-exceptional ebitda rose 27 per cent to €1.13bn.Just as well. Some investors were angered this summer when Smurfit dismissed a bid from International Paper. Given the recent dip in the US group’s share price, the offer would be worth about €36 per share right now. That is still a 20 per cent premium to Smurfit’s Dublin-listed stock.The board was right to send IP packing. Three important factors are working in favour of an independent Smurfit. First, ecommerce packaging may make up only about 10 per cent of its sales, but the segment is growing by about the same amount each year.Second is sustainability. Smurfit makes hardly any of the plastic containers whose debris choke the oceans. The UK government’s vow this week to introduce a plastic tax exemplifies the trend towards paper-based recyclables.Third, China’s decision to stop processing much of the world’s waste has trimmed the cost of cardboard for recycling. Those lower input prices helped Smurfit bolster ebitda margins by 290 basis points to 16.9 per cent.Smurfit’s cautious approach to expansion in a globally fragmented sector is commendable. The latest bolt-on acquisition, the €133m purchase of a Serbian packaging business, combines local contacts with Smurfit’s heft. A big global footprint can mean dipping your toes into choppy waters, however. Caracas has seized Smurfit’s Venezuela operation, triggering a €66m writedown.Smurfit’s margins nudged higher in the US, but there are fears that overcapacity there may hit Europe by 2020. Such snags are more than amply reflected in a 30 per cent share price discount to a global basket of peers.

58;WM;Waste Management;2018-10-29T18:46:24Z;UK to introduce plastics tax for packaging by April 2022;Levy will apply to products not made of at least 30% recycled material;The UK plans to introduce a plastics tax on all packaging that does not include at least 30 per cent recycled material, a move welcomed by the industry as a “much-needed change”.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said this would “transform the economics of sustainable packaging” by driving demand for recycled materials and discouraging production of single-use packaging with no recycled content.“We must become a world leader in tackling the scourge of plastic littering our planet and our oceans,” the chancellor said.The tax on the production and import of plastic packaging will be introduced by April 2022, alongside a reform of the current system of recycling credits, known as the Packaging Producer Responsibility System, which have previously been subject to manipulation.However, the chancellor stopped short of introducing a much-anticipated “latte levy” on disposable coffee cups, saying this would “not at this point deliver a decisive shift” away from disposable packaging.The government’s decision to go for a plastics tax rather than a latte levy was welcomed by industry figures.“He has recognised that a systemic change is required,” said David Palmer-Jones, chief executive of UK recycling at Suez, the French industrial group. “They are going to tackle this in a profound way, not straw by straw.”Under the new proposal, which will now go out for consultation, plastic packaging that contains at least 30 per cent recycled material will be exempt from the tax. The size of the levy has yet to be determined.The measure is expected to drive up demand for recycled plastic, a market badly hit over the past year by China’s crackdown on imported plastic waste, which removed the world’s biggest buyer of plastic scrap from the market.The plastics tax announcement comes a few weeks before the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs publishes a new resources and waste strategy, which is expected to push for producers to pay more to manage packaging waste from their products.Rupert Haworth, sales and marketing director at Recycling Technologies, a UK-based plastics recycler, said the company was “encouraged” by the reform of the recycling credits system. He noted that only a fraction of the plastic used in the UK was recycled domestically because there was limited infrastructure for processing material once it was sorted.The Packaging Producer Responsibility System has had the unintended side-effect of encouraging more plastic waste to be exported because of the way the credits are structured.The system has also been manipulated by exporters in some cases, and the Environment Agency recently said it was investigating fraud allegations.The government also said in the Budget that it could consider a tax on incineration, which in conjunction with the existing tax on landfill could drive up recycling by making it more economically attractive.“In the long term the government wants to maximise the amount of waste sent to recycling instead of incineration and landfill,” the Budget noted.

60;WM;Waste Management;2018-10-25T04:07:41Z;Why the world’s recycling system stopped working;China’s refusal to become the west’s dumping ground is forcing the world to face up to a waste crisis;"As Robert Reed examines a mountain of trash piled three storeys high, a thin white plastic bag catches his eye. He fishes it out and holds it up. “That is a problem plastic,” he says gravely. “These get stuck in the machines, and there is no market for them.” He gives it a little wave and lets it float back down on to the heap.We are standing inside the largest recycling facility in San Francisco, which takes in household waste, sorts it and produces tidy bales of material at the end. Broken glass crunches underfoot as Reed, a 20-year veteran of the industry, explains with pride that this plant, owned by local waste-management company Recology, is the most advanced of its kind on the West Coast, using lasers, magnets and air jets to process 750 tonnes each day. “See all this paper?” he says, approaching the mound of waste and gesturing to an Amazon box. “We’ve started to get a lot more of this because of all the online shopping.” Some of the materials sorted here are valuable, such as aluminium cans, steel and cardboard. But others are worthless, like coffee-cup lids or black plastic food trays.As we reach the end of the sortation centre, bale after bale of sorted plastic looms up. From here it will be sold to processors, often in Asia. China was by far the biggest customer last year. More than 270 million tonnes of waste are recycled across the world each year, according to the World Bank — equivalent to the weight of 740 Empire State buildings. Since the introduction of kerbside household recycling in the 1980s, recycling has been promoted as the environmental answer to humanity’s growing amounts of rubbish. It has also developed into a $200bn industry globally, according to the Bureau of International Recycling. The images accompanying this feature are from a series by Kadir van Lohuizen, who has been documenting how six megacities — Jakarta, Tokyo, Lagos, New York, São Paulo and Amsterdam — manage or mismanage their waste since 2016Companies and brokers have lined up to buy this waste and turn it into new products: a kind of straw-into-gold process that can at times be remarkably profitable. At the centre of the system is a brisk global trade in scrap materials shipped around the world. But this year, all that changed.On December 31 2017, China, previously the centre of the global recycling trade, abruptly shut its doors to imports of recycled material, citing the fact that large amounts of the waste were “dirty” or “hazardous” and thus a threat to the environment. The prices of plastic scrap collapsed, as did the price of low-grade paper. Suddenly, the lucrative trade that had sprung up shipping recyclables around the world was in crisis. The new policy, called the “National Sword”, was so drastic that when it was first announced many people in the industry did not believe it would actually be implemented. China and Hong Kong went from buying 60 per cent of the plastic waste exported by G7 countries during the first half of 2017, to taking less than 10 per cent during the same period a year later. “It really changed the world, in a way,” says Reed. “China was the world’s biggest customer for paper and plastic.”Using publicly available trade data, the FT has traced the exports of plastic and paper scrap from G7 countries, revealing a dramatic increase in the flows of waste into south-east Asia following the China ban. More than three dozen industry executives, policy makers, scrap traders and environmental advocates across the US, Europe and Asia were interviewed for this piece. The investigation found an industry undergoing unprecedented disruption, with the very purpose of recycling thrown into question. While it has grown and often profited as consumers have become more aware of the environmental costs of landfill, the sector has long had an unsavoury side. This has been exposed by the National Sword policy, as an industry plagued by allegations of smuggling, corruption and pollution has suddenly been thrust into the spotlight. China’s ban has also laid bare the uncomfortable economics behind household recycling, and triggered a profound re-examination of the practice — one that many say was long overdue. This is a “moment of truth” for the recycling industry, says Don Slager, chief executive of Republic Services, the second-largest waste-management company in the US. He estimates his group alone will lose out on $150m revenue this year due to China’s National Sword policy. Eric Kawabata, general manager for Asia-Pacific with TerraCycle, a US-based recycling company, says the China ban has created a “global crisis in plastic waste”. Japan, where he is based, was a big exporter to China before the ban. “Now all this trash is building up in Japan and there’s nothing to do with it; the incinerators are working at full capacity,” he says. Technically, China does still accept some forms of scrap, but it has set such a high bar for the cleanliness of the materials that can be imported that most people in the industry refer to it as a “ban”.In the US, many companies have had to send recycling to landfill because there is nowhere else to put it, a painful reversal after decades of growth in recycling programmes. The US exported 30 per cent less plastic scrap in the first half of 2018 compared with a year prior, according to FT data, with much of the material ending up in landfill instead. “Recycling is like a religion here,” says Laura Leebrick, head of government affairs at Rogue Disposal & Recycling in Southern Oregon. “It has been meaningful for people in Oregon to recycle, they feel like they are doing something good for the planet – and now they are having the rug pulled out from under them.”After the China ban, Rogue Disposal & Recycling started to limit the types of materials it accepts from households: no more plastics (except for milk jugs), no more glass and no more mixed paper (such as junk mail and cereal boxes). With China out of the market, the cost of managing the recycling programme has tripled, Leebrick says. Globally, about half the plastic intended for recycling is traded overseas, according to a recent study in Science Advances. That percentage is even higher on the US West Coast – California exports two-thirds of the stuff tossed into household recycling bins. Many cities that previously received revenue from their recycling programmes now have to pay hauliers to dispose of the material instead. At the beginning of 2017, a bale of low-grade mixed plastics could fetch $20 per tonne in California, but a year later it cost $10 to dispose of it.The National Sword policy “challenges us to admit that recycling isn’t free”, says Zoe Heller, assistant policy director at the California state recycling agency, CalRecycle. “What this is really bringing up for California, the US and the rest of the world is that there has to be a paradigm shift in how we think about recycling globally.”No one knows this better than Steve Wong, who was once the ­plastic scrap king of China. His empire accounted for about 7 per cent of China’s total plastic scrap imports, with assets that he estimates were worth around $900m. But today he is facing debts instead, after liquidating factories and other properties. The circles under his eyes suggest it has not been an easy few years. Based in Los Angeles, the Hong Kong-raised, British citizen is always on the road. “Life has become difficult,” he says. “I heard about the Chinese ban . . . but I didn’t expect things would turn out to be very harsh, very difficult for recyclers.” Wong’s career has tracked China’s emergence as the world’s recycling hub. As the country became a global manufacturing powerhouse in the 1990s and 2000s, its factories created a vast source of demand for raw materials. This presented a ready market for the products that come out at the end of the recycling process – for example, the plastic pellets made from recycled material that can be turned into the soles of shoes or thousands of other everyday items. The increasing demand coincided with the growth of recycling in the western world. A quirk of the global trade system also helped: the ships that set out full of “Made in China” goods often returned home with very little in them. Here was an opportunity to fill their containers with recycling scrap. China’s earliest recycling companies made fortunes taking advantage of this. The country’s first female billionaire, Zhang Yin, built her company, Nine Dragons, by importing paper from the US and operating mills at home. China’s combination of ready demand, cheap labour and lax environmental regulation made it ideal as the world’s recycling hub.Together with Hong Kong, it imported $81bn worth of plastic scrap between 1988 and 2016, according to the study in Science Advances. However, the mood shifted several years ago, as China got serious about cleaning up its environment. The recycling industry fell out of favour, due in part to corruption and poor environmental practices, but also because Chinese officials didn’t want the country to be seen as the world’s dumping ground. “If things are imported, they call it yang laji – foreign trash – but their own [waste], even if it is not such good quality, they call [it] resources,” Wong points out. China also wanted to get a handle on its own waste-management systems. Poorly run recycling plants that dumped wastewater and contaminated the environment kept popping up, despite the government’s repeated efforts to clean up the sector. “China finally realised that it was a net deficit to their country to take this scrap,” says Jim Puckett, director of the Basel Action Network, a non-profit focused on the hazardous waste trade. “The harm to the groundwater and the harm to the air, those have big economic costs.” In 2013, China introduced a policy called “Green Fence”, which tightened existing regulations on recycling, and Wong says that was when his company started losing money. When National Sword arrived, things became even worse. “I know people who have gone bankrupt,” he says. Some Chinese scrap traders have even ended up in jail as part of the country’s efforts to clean up the industry. “I’ve been told I shouldn’t go back.”Wong still has a hand in the trade and usually wakes up before dawn to work the phones. On the morning we meet, he has already bought two containers of gasoline tanks salvaged from old cars, and 60 ­containers of plastic covering that had been used on vineyards. “Every day I make some deals,” he says, even if they may be much smaller than what he was used to. He has become cynical about the sector, however. “The ones who are left are poor, or they are scammers,” he says.With China’s door closed since the beginning of the year, much of the plastic scrap has flowed to south-east Asia instead – where it has triggered a new type of environmental crisis. Out of China’s 1,700 licensed importers, at least a third have relocated to south-east Asia, Wong estimates. The region has been inundated with plastic scrap in far greater quantities than it can handle.In the span of just a few months, Malaysia has become the biggest importer of plastic scrap in the world, with a volume that is now twice that of China and Hong Kong. Between the first half of 2017 and the first half of 2018, Vietnam saw its imports of plastic scrap double, while shipments to Indonesia rose 56 per cent, according to data compiled by the FT. The country that has seen the biggest percentage increase of all is Thailand, where imports surged 1,370 per cent. At the port of Laem Chabang on Thailand’s eastern seaboard, the sun beats down on a busy six-lane highway and a railway freight line. This is the kingdom’s busiest port, and a principal gateway for free trade with the outside world – a showcase for Thailand’s export-driven economy. But this year the port has gained notoriety among Thai environmentalists for another reason: as the main entry point for record imports of plastic, electronic waste and the world’s other rubbish. In May, police swooped on terminal C3, where they searched seven containers and found electronic waste – hazardous if not disposed of safely – falsely declared on customs forms as plastic. As imports have risen, they have been met with a growing backlash, and south-east Asian governments have been trying to curb the amounts of waste they take in. In Thailand, the crackdown has included a series of such raids on scrap-processing facilities, dump sites and ports. The Department of Industrial Works, which oversees waste management, told the FT that plastic imports would be banned within two years. Most of the plastic has been entering the country in violation of rules set by the ministry, says Banjong Sukreeta, a deputy director. “We found that importers were importing plastic scrap not only for use in their own factories, but [they] resold it and sent it to other factories to process,” he says. “That’s against the rules.” As the police raid at Laem Chabang revealed, some importers were falsifying customs declarations, marking containers as holding plastic scraps as a front for smuggling electronic waste. “On our inspections of plastic, 95 per cent violated rules and didn’t pass inspection,” Banjong says. Meanwhile, hundreds of scrap-processing facilities have sprung up near the port, often triggering complaints from locals about the pollution they produce. One woman keeping tabs on these plants – not all of which are fully legal – is Penchom Saetang, the head of Ecological Alert and Recovery Thailand, a non-profit group. She counts more than 1,300 companies involved in recycling, landfills or processing electronic waste in the eight provinces around the port. “When we talk about recycling, the concept is good and the objectives are good,” she says. “But if the recycling industry is good, why do America, Europe, Korea and Japan have to export to other countries? Can you answer me that?”It’s a question more and more people are asking, as governments across the region try to figure out how to respond. After bales of plastic piled up at ports in Vietnam this spring, the country declared it would not “become the landfill of the world” and stopped issuing licences for imports of paper, plastic, metal and other waste.Malaysia has also been fighting a string of illegal recycling factories that have emerged to process the plastic that China didn’t want. Earlier this month, minister Yeo Bee Yin said the government was freezing imports of plastic waste. A recent investigation by Greenpeace Unearthed discovered British recycling in Malaysian dumps – including recycling sacks from local councils Hammersmith and Fulham and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Many of the new factories that have sprung up to take the scrap embody some of the trade’s worst characteristics. “We call them ‘the cowboys’ in the industry,” says Max Craipeau, a French plastics trader in Hong Kong. “They do business in a very bad manner. These guys are now typically bankrupt in south-east Asia because the government shut down their operations.” A “cowboy” operation usually dispenses with any environmental controls, he explains, such as wastewater treatment facilities. The plastic recycling process involves washing the materials, producing wastewater full of contaminants, and heating up the plastic to produce pellets, which can release chemical additives and emissions into the air. In Thailand, such shady recycling facilities have become the target of national outrage. Earlier this year, police raids were broadcast live on television, stirring a national debate about plastics and the surge in electronic waste – old computer parts, keyboards and phones. Amid cassava fields in the village of Thathan, on Thailand’s eastern seaboard, blue tarpaulins barely conceal heaps of electronic waste exposed to the open air. Local residents say trucks full of e-waste began arriving shortly after New Year – 10 or 20 a night. By April, the factory’s Chinese and Thai owners, He Jia Enterprise, had begun burning plastic e-waste to extract copper from it, blanketing the fields with noxious smoke that made some villagers feel faint. “It’s one of those smells that stays inside your nose and makes it feel sore,” says Panpuch Srithat, a local resident who runs a small business. A double-length truck bearing wire trundles through the village as she speaks. “They bring stuff nobody wants into our country,” she continues. “They only gain and gain. And who loses? Our country loses.”Electronic waste is far more toxic to process than most household plastic, because it contains a range of harmful substances, including heavy metals such as lead. But the factors that allow e-waste to find its way into the countries that are least able to deal with it safely are the same as those that have allowed the tide of unwanted plastic to sweep across south-east Asia this year. Environmental advocates such as Puckett, the head of the Basel Action Network, see it as evidence of a failure in the global trade system. “This takes place because of free trade rules where you can stick things on a boat and take them to a place where those controls are not as high,” he says. As for the He Jia factory managers, they say they have done nothing wrong. The factory changed ownership in April, after the outcry. General manager Winaaithorn Rakkbuathong tells the FT the plant is following all environmental regulations and trade laws. He denies the factory has been dumping wastewater into the ground – an accusation raised by villagers – and says all workers wear protective gear, including glasses, masks and gloves. “Have you ever heard of the Basel treaty?” he says, with an obliging smile and a nod of the head. “The Basel Convention says you can export and import waste for disposal.” It’s one of those smells that stays inside your nose and makes it feel sore . . . they bring stuff nobody wants into our country. They only gain and gain. And who loses? Our country losesIn fact, the text of the Basel Convention is not exactly what Winaaithorn describes. The treaty, which was created in 1989 to regulate the trade in hazardous waste, says e-waste can only be exported to developing countries with their consent. However, it does not regulate trade in plastics, and there is a growing debate within Thailand and around the world about whether these measures are enough. “People have been shipping goods left and right, without checking whether they can recycle that quantity or not,” says Surendra Borad Patawari, chief executive of Gemini Corporation, a plastics and steel trading company in Belgium. “We should be obliged to check: do they [the importers] have recycling facilities?”More regulation may be on the way: earlier this year, Norway introduced a proposal that would add some types of plastic waste to the list of the materials regulated under the convention. If approved, shipments of certain plastic wastes would require prior approval from the recipient countries. Ola Elvestuen, the Norwegian environment minister, told the FT that the Basel Convention should be used to “get better control of the flow of problematic waste” around the world. “Massive amounts of them [plastic waste] are being traded, and a lot of them are mixed – it is contaminated, it is waste that is difficult or impossible to recycle, and that we need to get better control of,” he says. Norway’s proposal has already gathered support from more than 20 countries, although the EU opposes the move, as do many scrap traders. Adina Adler, head of international relations at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries in Washington DC, argues that the policy would stifle trade. “Scrap is not rubbish, it is not trash, it is a valuable input,” she says. “If Norway’s proposal is approved, it could set a precedent for more [restrictions] . . . A lot of the developing world does not have recycling capabilities. So to the extent that they can collect it, they will ship it to another country.” Some worry that a trash trade war may be brewing, as more and more countries shut their doors to scrap. “We are living in a time of nationalism, and these bans are also a part of that,” says Tom Szaky, chief executive of TerraCycle, referring to the steps taken in south-east Asia.The ripple effects of China closing its borders to our trash are only now becoming apparent. One consequence is a wave of new investment in scrap-processing facilities in the developed world. Now that China no longer wants to be the destination for the world’s recycling, the burden is shifting back to more developed countries such as the US, EU and Japan. “In the long term it will prove positive, because we will have to focus more on our own recycling capacity,” says Karmenu Vella, European commissioner for the environment. He estimates that an additional 250 sorting facilities and 300 recycling plants will be needed by 2025. For companies that make the necessary machines, sales are booming and order books have developed a backlog. The same thing is happening in the US – and many of the investors there are Chinese. Unable to meet their demand for paper pulp or plastic pellets at home, China’s biggest recycling companies are purchasing mills or plants in America. Nine Dragons, China’s biggest maker of paper and cardboard, recently announced it is buying two paper mills in the US, and plans to invest $300m in the facilities. Other Chinese recycling companies have invested in recycling plants in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Kentucky. China’s new rules are also forcing American scrap traders and producers to do more of the dirty work themselves, to meet the very high standards that China will still accept. George Adams, chief executive of SA Recycling, one of the biggest scrap metal traders in the US, says he recently installed a new line to wash aluminium waste before it is sent to China. “You can eat off my aluminium, it is that clean,” he says. Similar changes are taking place elsewhere: the Recology facility in San Francisco recently spent $3m installing a new optical sensor that will reduce the impurities in its bales. As for the traders, while many have gone bankrupt or left the industry, a few have capitalised on the change. One of these is Craipeau, the Hong Kong-based trader, who has shifted his focus to selling plastic pellets – which are not covered by the waste ban – back into China.People have been shipping goods left and right, without checking whether or not the importers can recycle that quantity“Overnight, China has transformed itself from being the world’s largest processor of plastic scrap to being the world’s largest importer of plastic pellets,” he explains. Demand for plastic pellets is higher than ever because manufacturers still need them. Craipeau currently works with a recycling plant in Indonesia, and is planning to open new ones in Poland and the US.Meanwhile, many household recycling programmes have found ways to continue, although sometimes in a different form. “This China thing is causing me a bit of heartburn in 2018,” says Slager, the chief executive of Republic Services. “But on another level I am frankly elated, because it is giving us a reason to wake up and fix this part of the business.” One priority is cleaning up the recycling stream to stop people putting dirty trash in their recycling bins, he says.Do you have any questions for Leslie Hook or ideas for improving the world's broken recycling system? Drop them in the comments below. Leslie will be responding to your thoughts and questions throughout the day.The world has produced more than 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste since the 1950s – making plastic one of the largest man-made materials on the planet, behind steel and cement. Of that volume, more than half was produced in the last 16 years, amid a global boom in single-use, disposable plastic, according to an academic paper, Production, Use and Fate of All Plastics Ever Made.Roland Geyer, the author of the study, says the National Sword policy was a wake-up call. “I think that plastic recycling hasn’t really worked before the China ban,” he says. Even before the ban, only 10 per cent of the plastic in the US was being recycled. “Just making a bit more effort with the recycling is not going to cut it.”For decades, policy makers have focused on increasing the collection of recyclables and raising the “diversion rate” – the percentage of household waste that gets diverted from landfills or incinerators. But more people are saying that has been focusing on the wrong thing. “We have not been successful at recycling. After 40 years of trying, we have not been able to make it work,” points out Ellen MacArthur, the yachtswoman who went on to launch an environmental group, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which has worked on reducing plastic waste. “It needs a systemic change,” she says. The root problem is the pattern of linear consumption that the world’s consumers have become accustomed to: taking resources from the natural world, using them, disposing of them. She believes the solution is the “circular economy”, which reuses resources rather than consuming them. Her eyes light up as she describes what this would look like. The single-use plastic packaging that lines supermarket aisles today could be reimagined: a fifth of packaging could be reusable, like a bottle that is refilled. And half of the packaging could be redesigned with recycling in mind. Better packaging design will help, but others advocate even more extreme measures. Back at the Recology facility in San Francisco, Reed admits at the end of our tour that 20 years in the industry has made him a “zero waste” advocate. “I never buy any of this stuff,” he says, gesturing to a bale of clear plastic sandwich containers. Instead, he shops in bulk, bringing his own bottles and sacks to special stores that sell food and household products by weight. It’s a lifestyle that has long had advocates in California and has recently gained traction in Europe, with the number of bulk stores in France and Italy surging over the past year. “One of the most important lessons we’ve learnt from zero waste is that a lot of the solutions are in the past,” Reed says. “Just ask yourself, what was it like when your grandparents were alive? They didn’t have single-use coffee cups, didn’t have water bottles. And yet they survived – thrived, in fact.” What happens to the milk carton you throw in your recycling bin? Details vary by region and government but often the path is broadly similar: once collected, household recycling is sorted into bales, which are then sold on to be processed into material. A bale of cardboard will go to a special mill, where it is cleaned and broken down to paper pulp, which will be used to make new paper products.The collection company sorts the items and sells some materials — the ones that have value — on to brokers, or to plants that will do another round of sorting and cleaning. The material will be sold on for further processing until it eventually reaches the end customer: a manufacturer that needs the material as a feedstock for its products. Plastics are one of the hardest materials to recycle. There are dozens of types of plastics in everyday use, which must be separated before recycling. After sortation, the bales are sent to a recycling facility to be further washed and cleaned.This is where the process gets much trickier. Take a plastic water bottle, which is typically made of PET, one of the more valuable types of plastic. When the bottles arrive at the factory, they are washed and dunked in chemicals to get the labels off, then chopped into bits. A flotation pool is used to separate the lid plastic from the bottle plastic. Three different materials come out at the end: lid flakes, bottle flake and labels.The final step is to “extrude” the flakes, or melt them down into pellets. This requires energy to heat the flakes, and can emit harmful chemicals into the air, due to additives in the plastic. The pellets are then sold on to manufacturers who use them as a feedstock.It is possible to do all of this in an environmentally friendly way: treating the wastewater correctly, disposing of chemicals properly and making sure harmful emissions don’t escape. Done right, this uses less energy and resources than virgin material. But if shortcuts are taken, the consequences can be devastating.Leslie Hook is the FT’s environment correspondent; John Reed is the FT’s south-east Asia correspondent Data investigation by David BloodAdditional reporting by Ryn JirenuwatFollow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

61;WM;Waste Management;2018-10-25T03:00:49Z;5 things you can do to cut plastic waste;Small changes in your everyday habits can make a difference;"Making small changes in your daily habits can reduce your waste footprint right away. Fixing the root causes of waste — with initiatives under way to use durable packaging or redesign packaging so that it can become valuable recycling — will take much longer. So in the meantime, here are a few things you can try.Avoid buying things that are overpackaged, or items that cannot be recycled. Plastic packaging represents 26 per cent of all plastic produced, and only 5 per cent of plastic packaging gets recycled. When you are shopping, avoid things such as black plastic trays — these can’t be recycled because the sensors that separate plastic can’t detect black. Avoid packaging that is complex and made from more than one material, such as a paper sandwich wrapper with a clear plastic window, which can’t be recycled. And learn to politely decline when you are offered something that comes with waste packaging, such as a free food sample on the street, or a conference swag bag. “Plastic packaging is not designed to be recyclable; it is designed to be waste,” says Ellen MacArthur, the yachtswoman turned environmentalist.In rich countries, a third of the waste stream is food and green waste, and in poorer countries that figure is even higher. Composting the food left over from your kitchen doesn’t only save space in the landfill, it can also generate rich, nutritious soil and fertiliser. And separating food waste yields a drier waste stream for the rest of your rubbish, which can then be incinerated more easily, or landfilled with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. If your city doesn’t offer a composting collection at your house, consider storing your food waste in the freezer before taking it to a drop off, or getting a worm bin if you have room for one.When you do recycle, do it right. Rinse out containers before putting them in, and keep it loose — don’t nestle things together. The items accepted by your local scheme will vary widely so it is worth checking to make sure you are putting the right stuff in. In most areas, you should remove the cap from a bottle and toss it in the garbage (it is made from a different type of plastic than the body, and most facilities can’t process bottle caps). Cardboard boxes can be flattened, and tissue paper goes to landfill. Most important, try to keep your recycling dry, as getting it wet will make it much harder for the paper products to be recycled.Carry your own bottle for water, and take your own bags to the supermarket. But just as important, try to buy second-hand items when possible. Before you rush to buy a new steel water bottle on Amazon, hunt around the cupboard or your local charity shop to see if there is one there. Purchasing fancy stuff with the purpose of avoiding waste is often counter-productive, because whatever you buy will consume resources and end up being disposed of. Cotton tote bags are a good example: producing a new one requires a lot of water and energy, and results in carbon emissions. A study by the Danish government found that an organic cotton bag has to be used 149 times to have the same climate impact as a plastic bag, which is lighter and easier to produce. “The real solution is moving away from disposable systems all together,” says Tom Szaky, chief executive of TerraCycle, a US-based recycling company.If you are feeling ambitious, check out what some “zero waste” advocates are doing. These people re-engineer their lives to produce almost no waste at all: their trash from an entire year can fit into a small jar. Although some may find the zero-waste lifestyle too extreme, you can always try out some of the methods and see what you think. To get started, try shopping in bulk: find a store where you can bring your own food containers and buy basic foodstuffs. You can also buy fruit and veg from a farmers’ market, or sign up for a CSA box (community supported agriculture) to avoid packaging. “Living simply is at the core of the zero-waste lifestyle” says Bea Johnson, a zero-waste expert and author of Zero Waste Home."
62;WM;Waste Management;2018-10-14T03:45:10Z;Thailand to ban foreign plastic waste from 2021;Move to turn back tide of scrap flowing into country since China halted imports;Thailand plans to stop all imports of foreign plastic scrap by 2021 as it joins other south-east Asian countries looking to stem an influx of waste products that used to be recycled in China. Fleshing out details of the ban, which was initially announced in June, government officials told the Financial Times that Thailand needed two years to implement the policy.China, formerly a leading recycler of waste from rich countries, halted most imports of plastic rubbish and electronic scrap, such as keyboards, screens, wires and other components, in January. “The amount coming in has increased since China banned plastic,” Banjong Sukreeta, deputy director of Thailand’s department of industrial works, said. “We will ban it within two years.” China’s ban has led to surging imports of rubbish from Japan, North America and elsewhere into neighbouring countries, notably Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, and complaints about pollution from the facilities set up to process it. In July Vietnam’s government announced it would stop issuing licences for imports of paper, plastic, metal and other waste as imported scrap piled up at its ports, saying it wanted to “keep the country from becoming a dumping site”. In the same month Malaysia revoked the import permits of 114 factories that processed plastic waste after complaints about pollution from local residents. Officials said Thailand needed two years to implement the ban as some recently granted import licences ran until 2021. It also needed time to set up an efficient system for sorting its own plastic waste, which was more expensive to process than imported scrap because it was often poorly cleaned and sorted. “We don’t have an efficient collection system for domestic waste,” Rintawat Sombutsiri, director of industrial waste management in the department of industrial works, said. “We need two years for our pollution control department to set up a system for collecting plastic waste.” Thailand’s growing mountain of foreign rubbish has inflamed public opinion recently after pollution complaints from local communities prompted a series of high-profile police raids at ports and processing plants.Scores of new sorting and recycling companies, some with Chinese shareholders, have set up in Thailand in the past year in response to Beijing’s decision to move away from recycling foreign waste. Electronic waste plants, which process rubbish at low cost using migrant workers from Myanmar and Cambodia, have sparked particular concern among local residents worried about air and water pollution.Mr Rintawat, the Thai official, said that Thailand’s environment and industry ministries had agreed to phase out e-waste imports “from now, without a grace period”.Of seven companies that had been authorised to import the material to Thailand, five have had their import licences suspended for violations of the law, he said. One of the seven companies’ licences had expired, and one was still valid because the company was running its business legally.“For importing e-waste, there should not be any loophole for importing illegally,” Mr Banjong said.Additional reporting by Ryn JirenuwatFollow John Reed on Twitter: @JohnReedwrites
63;WM;Waste Management;2018-10-04T20:48:15Z;Delays to disposal of NHS hospital waste spark Cobra meeting;Emergency committee convenes after alarm is raised over private contractor;The government convened its emergency committee after environment chiefs discovered a private contractor had not disposed of hundreds of tonnes of hospital waste, including human remains, quickly enough.Following a report in the Health Services Journal, it emerged that the Environment Agency had raised the alarm at the end of July that too much waste from around 50 National Health Service trusts was being held in waste storage and treatment sites by Healthcare Environmental Group.One person familiar with the situation said that at no point had any member of the public been in danger, since the waste was being stored safely, but it was not being processed or disposed of within the correct time limits. Insiders also said that only a very small part of the waste included body parts.However, insiders confirmed that Matt Hancock, health and social care secretary, held a meeting of Cobra, the government committee that deals with emergencies, last month and allocated £1m as a contingency fund to support affected NHS trusts.Labour hit out at the “staggering revelations”. Jonathan Ashworth, shadow health and social care secretary, said: “I’m disappointed the health secretary didn’t inform parliament last month.”He called for a statement from ministers in the Commons next week.Healthcare Environmental Group attributed the reduction in incineration capacity to ‘ageing infrastructure, prolonged breakdowns and the reliance on zero waste to landfill policies’It is understood that the Environment Agency made several attempts to force the operator to comply with the required standards and is considering further action against the company. For now, Healthcare Environmental is still collecting public waste.Healthcare Environmental said it had highlighted the reduction in the UK’s high-temperature incineration capacity for the past few years. In a statement on its website, it attributed this to “the ageing infrastructure, prolonged breakdowns and the reliance on zero waste to landfill policies, taking up the limited high-temperature incineration capacity in the market”.Over the past year, this reduced incineration capacity had been evident across all of the industry and had affected all companies, it said. “Healthcare Environmental has been in discussion with the environmental regulators and has consistently highlighted these issues, whilst we have maintained service to all our clients. There has been no disruption to our customers’ services whilst we have been dealing with this issue,” it added.It was “working closely with our various disposal sites, including utilising our own £13m new waste-to-energy facility to reduce the volume on site, whilst maintaining services.” All waste was contained and processed within licensed facilities in full co-operation with the relevant authorities. “HEG is dedicated to resolving this issue, as and when incineration capacity becomes available. In the interim, all our facilities are operating normally whilst we work with our various partners across the UK,” it added.The health and environment departments, the Cabinet Office, NHS Improvement and the Environment Agency have all been involved in the attempt to resolve the problems. Contingency plans have been drawn up but have not yet needed to be activated. These would involve storing waste in specialist trailers that would be provided by the government.A government spokesman said it was watching the situation closely and had made sure that public services — including NHS trusts — had contingency plans. “There is absolutely no risk to the health of patients or the wider public,” he said, adding: “Our priority is to prevent disruption to the NHS and other vital public services and work is under way to ensure organisations can continue to dispose of their waste safely and efficiently.”Kathy McLean, chief operating officer and executive medical director of NHS Improvement, said: “The NHS has contingency plans in place for clinical waste and patients should be assured that their care will be unaffected.”
64;WM;Waste Management;2018-09-24T16:29:26Z;Giving the green light to impact investing in environmental projects;Investors are taking a more hands-on approach to satisfy a growing range of financial goals;"In May, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, gave an unusual blessing. It was at the dedication of a rainwater garden at the US capital’s Mount Olivet Cemetery, a joint venture between the Catholic Church and The Nature Conservancy, the US non-profit organisation. The garden will soak up stormwater that would otherwise run off the cemetery’s hard surfaces and end up in local rivers.The garden is part of an initiative called District Stormwater that is designed to prevent billions of gallons of stormwater from polluting rivers. With partners and investors such as insurer Prudential Financial and New York-based impact investment company Encourage Capital, it taps into Washington DC regulations requiring developers in certain districts to build green infrastructure, such as grass roofs, parks and street plantings. Where this is not possible, developers can buy stormwater retention credits from projects in districts not covered by the regulations — such as the cemetery — which have nonetheless invested in green infrastructure.District Stormwater is among a growing number of financial mechanisms, from green bonds to insurance products, that bring private sector capital into the business of environmental conservation. Investors’ goals vary; some look to make a direct impact, such as the avoidance of carbon emissions, the restoration of ecosystems or the conservation of water supplies.At Bridges Fund Management, which has offices in London and New York specialises in sustainable and impact investing, the Bridges Sustainable Growth Funds includes companies that are tackling waste. One of its investments, World of Books, has developed a technology platform and the Ziffit “scan and send” app, with which surplus books from bookshops and charities can be resold or recycled rather than put in landfill. However, Bridges requires more than ideas for tackling environmental problems if it is to invest — the firm seeks companies that also have the potential to expand rapidly. This was the case with World of Books. “By the time we invested, they’d built up a profitable and fast-growing business,” says Michele Giddens, a Bridges partner and co-founder. “And it’s done at enormous scale — you’re talking about hundreds of thousands of books a day.”Others take a system-wide view of environmental impact. This is the approach of Encourage Capital, whose investments range from sustainable seafood companies to projects generating carbon offset credits sold in California’s carbon market. “With the work we do there’s always some kind of relationship to stakeholders, including governments, non-profits and consumers,” says Jason Scott, a co-managing partner at Encourage.The important thing is how our investment can drive changeHe cites the company’s investments in sustainable seafood, where he says use of regulatory tools, such as limited access fishing permits, allows fisheries to demonstrate that stocks are being restored and their seafood is being produced sustainably. This means it can be sold for higher prices, generating bigger tax revenues for government. “The really important thing to us is how our investment can drive change in the system,” says Scott.A question for some investors is whether the promised impact is being delivered. For example, a recent boom in green bond sales — law firm Linklaters revealed a 9.4 per cent rise year on year in the first quarter of 2018 — prompted industry observers to call for third-party verifiers of green bonds to be regulated in the same way as the credit rating agencies in debt markets.Scott argues that a critical part of verification is the due diligence conducted up front. Before making any investments, he says, Encourage ascertains whether an environmental problem can be addressed both effectively and profitably using business models and private capital. If not, it moves on. “When we do the research to figure out the different ways of approaching a problem, we look at which of those could generate commercial and investment returns and also maximise impact,” he says.After commissioning research into investable strategies that might address the billions of tonnes of plastic waste polluting the oceans, for example, Encourage decided not to invest. “It doesn’t mean we wouldn’t pursue it in the future if there was a more favourable investment environment,” says Scott. “We’re very interested in the subject and we’re trying to figure out if there’s good investment strategy.”In some cases, impact investments are a means of harnessing private capital to pay for conservation activities that cannot be funded by philanthropy alone. The Nature Conservancy’s NatureVest unit approaches this by forming partnerships to develop initiatives such as the District Stormwater project.“We’re not in the business of maximising returns,” says Mark Tercek, The Nature Conservancy’s chief executive. “We’re in the business of maximising conservation outcomes. But we tell investors that they can help us achieve our goals — and get their money back and a get return.”Given the scale of global environmental problems, Tercek believes financial innovation will be critical if more private capital is to flow into what he calls “investing in nature”. “We need these new ways of doing things,” he says. “Because as important as philanthropy is, it’s insufficient to get the full job done.”In 2015, armed with only a 3D printer, Mauricio Cordova developed his prototype for Faircap, an affordable portable filter for plastic bottles that makes water containing bacteria safe to drink. His breakthrough came at an innovation camp in the grounds of a French château. “We were co-living and co-working,” says Cordova, a Peruvian with a background in economics. “It was very inspiring.”The filter is designed to address a lack of access to clean water and plastic waste resulting from single-use bottles. However, to pursue his mission, Cordova has not set up a non-profit organisation. With £88,000 in seed funding from the UK’s Humanitarian Innovation Fund, Faircap has been created as a community interest company that will generate revenue and, he hopes, make a profit.In the developed world, the company is targeting the outdoors market — campers, hikers and so on. Demand for the filter could also grow if countries start banning single-use plastics, such as water bottles. Profits will be used to supply poor communities in developing countries with filters in partnership with organisations such as Oxfam. Cordova hopes to attract socially minded consumers through a buy-one-give-one model that allows them to donate a filter to a humanitarian organisation.The first step is to track the product’s impact on health and plastic waste reduction, which Faircap is doing with Oxfam’s help. “The product might work, but if people don’t use it, it won’t make an impact,” says Cordova. “That’s why we’re doing the field testing to see what end users think about it.” If the filter proves popular, private investment will be needed to scale up the business. “We’d like to grow, because the main idea is to have an impact,” he says.When Julie Corbett, president and founder of Ecologic, looked for investors for her sustainable packaging company, which produces paper bottles from recycled materials, she realised it would take more than venture capital.“Venture funding is very well suited for software and brand building, but it’s not very capital intensive,” says Corbett, who had the idea for recyclable packaging after her daughters’ school in Berkeley, California, introduced a zero-waste policy in 2008. “To solve these big environment problems, particularly in packaging and materials, it requires manufacturing. Nothing can be made without big machinery and that’s very expensive.”Ecologic, which supplies bottles for cosmetics group L’Oréal, created a water-resistant paper bottle whose interlocking design makes it durable without the need for glues. Its interior liner, made from food-grade recycled plastic, is 60 per cent thinner than most plastic bottles.Having come up with the design, the company needed to produce the bottle in sufficient volumes to make it commercially viable. “In 2013, it became clear we needed to invest in our own factory,” says Corbett.The answer was to secure impact investments from companies such as DBL Investors, as well as from foundations and the Californian state government, which through its CalRecycle initiative offers grants or low-interest loans to organisations that are developing new ways of waste management.With impact investors, says Corbett “everybody’s in it together, while venture capitalists are hedging their bets, hoping one or two companies are winners”.However, she believes the market needs to expand so that more funds are available to companies that want to address social and environmental problems. “People who take early risks early — there’s not many out there and I wish there were,” she says. “It has exploded, but it’s still a very nascent market.”More examples of impact projects are identified each year in the FT/IFC Transformational Business Awards.

65;WM;Waste Management;2018-09-17T04:00:26Z;Suez group backs UK energy-from-waste power as landfill space shrinks;French group plans generating station as uncertainty rises over waste treatment;Suez, the French utility, is to invest more than £100m in a new energy-from-waste power station in the north-east of England as it seeks to capitalise on the growing demand for alternative ways in which to process waste.The company plans to build a new plant near Billingham in Stockton-on-Tees which will serve the public sector as well as commercial customers in the north-east and Scotland. Once operational in 2022, the plant will generate about 25MW of electricity, enough to power the equivalent of roughly 30,000 households. It will have enough capacity to process 200,000 tonnes of residual — non-recyclable — waste a year.David Palmer-Jones, chief executive of Suez recycling and recovery in the UK, said the UK “has a shortfall in vital, non-landfill waste-treatment capacity”.The amount of available landfill space in the UK has fallen dramatically in recent years. Tax levies have been successful in shifting waste materials away from landfill — and into energy from waste facilities — but the industry says the decline in landfill has outpaced the delivery of alternative infrastructure. The UK had thousands of landfill sites in the 1990s but by 2020 it is estimated there will only be about 50.Suez already operates several other energy-from-waste facilities in, among other places, Suffolk and Cornwall.The investment will go ahead despite the uncertainty over the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU at the end of next March. Mr Palmer-Jones said Suez was making preparations for a hard Brexit and was “scenario planning” for “the risk that we, as an industry, are forced to re-shore the 3.5m tonnes of residual waste that the UK exports to northern Europe”.While it remained in the interests of both Britain and its EU neighbours to continue to “trade freely” in waste resources, Mr Palmer-Jones warned that the UK had “insufficient infrastructure and rapidly reducing landfill capacity, particularly in the south-east, to handle an abrupt influx of 3.5m tonnes more waste”.In such a scenario, he added, the limited landfill space in the south-east would be filled quickly and result in its transport northwards to seek alternative landfill.“At worst we could see up to 400 large truck loads a day, seven days a week, clogging up our roads hauling waste to landfill. Most of the extra traffic will hit the main road arteries running from London and the south-east heading to the Midlands and north,” he said.This article has been corrected: the new plant in Stockton-on-Tees will generate about 25MW of electricity, not 25GW.
66;WM;Waste Management;2018-08-13T02:26:32Z;KKR steps up India presence with stake in Ramky Enviro;$930m deal reflects growing private equity activity on the subcontinent;KKR is taking a majority stake in Indian waste management company Ramky Enviro Engineers in a deal valued at nearly $1bn.The transaction, announced on Monday, involves the US group investing $530m in the business in a transaction valued at a total of $930m.It is set to be one of the largest buyouts in the country and comes as private equity steps up its activity in India.In the past in India, as in Asia generally, private equity focused on taking minority stakes, often in listed companies, rather than enter into true control deals.India’s emergence in recent months as a top destination for international investment firms such as KKR, Blackstone, TPG and Warburg Pincus reflects in part the chill over money flows between the US and China as a result of trade frictions and geopolitical tensions.In the first half of this year there were 22 private equity-backed deals in China with an aggregate deal value of $3.8bn, while in India there were 67 such transactions worth $9.1bn, according to data from Prequin.That is in contrast with 2017, when China attracted $12.3bn in total, almost double the $6.5bn that went into India.The Ramky deal, like many in China, is piggybacking on government priorities.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is stepping up “its focus on environmental management through its ‘Swachh Bharat’ (Clean India) mission, an initiative to reduce pollution and improve critical sanitation infrastructure”, the two parties said in a statement.KKR’s capital will help Ramky scale up the business both at home and abroad. In addition, Ramky has infrastructure and real estate businesses that need capital. Ramky’s shareholders will retain a minority stake.KKR’s investment will come from the $9.3bn Asia fund it raised last year, which was at the time the largest fund targeted at the region.KKR’s record in India and Asia generally has been so strong that its head of Asia Joe Bae was named one of two successors to KKR’s founders, Henry Kravis and George Roberts.“In the last 12 months or more, the size of deals has grown materially,” said Rupen Jhaveri, KKR’s managing director in Mumbai. “The top three deals in our pipeline are valued at between $400m to $800m.”Large investment firms’ enthusiasm for the country has little to do with strong macro tailwinds. Private sector investment is close to zero, while direct foreign investment in the country was just $6bn in the second quarter, according to data from the International Institute for Finance.Moreover foreign investors have been net sellers on the Bombay Stock Exchange this year, said Gavekal Research. India’s balance of payments deficit has widened as oil prices rise, while the trade deficit last quarter was the highest in five years.The heightened activity of the buyout firms therefore owes more to the absence of a vibrant domestic risk capital market, the near-paralysis of banks whose lending to corporate India has largely been constrained by high levels of non-performing loans, and the high cost of capital.“Recently the availability of capital has become even worse,” said one sovereign fund investor in KKR. “Private equity is stepping into the breach.”
67;WM;Waste Management;2018-08-05T22:00:26Z;Asia plastic is choking the world’s oceans;More than 80% of marine plastic pollution comes from the continent;"The recent death of a short-finned pilot whale in Songkhla, southern Thailand, triggered a bout of long-overdue national anguish. The creature, discovered in June, was filled with 85 plastic bags that it had mistaken for food. Endangered finless porpoises, Irrawaddy dolphins and turtles have also been recent casualties of plastic ingestion in Thai waters.A video of British diver Rich Horner swimming through dense shoals of plastic waste off the Indonesian resort island of Bali went viral in March. Appalled viewers watched as Mr Horner, along with a lone manta ray and the occasional fish, become enveloped in cascades of plastic bags and wrappers.And near Mumbai, a dead whale recently washed ashore from the Arabian Sea, killed — like its cousin in Thailand — by ingested plastic. The city’s famous Marine Drive is blighted by tonnes of washed-up waste after high tide. In the absence of an effective municipal response, locals often take it upon themselves to clean up.Such ominous incidents are finally triggering awareness of the environmental catastrophe caused by plastic waste. The UK, Chile and China are among countries moving against the profligate use of plastic bags, while companies such as Starbucks face mounting pressure to ban plastic straws.Nowhere is the need for action greater than in Asia, the source of more than 80 per cent of the plastic that ends up in the world’s oceans. But in most of the region, efforts to tackle the pollution are inadequate or nonexistent.Theresa Mundita S Lim, who was appointed executive director of the Asean Center for Biodiversity in April, acknowledged that her group was spurred into action this year only after the scale of the region’s problem was highlighted by Ocean Conservancy in Washington.“Our efforts to protect marine biodiversity started to become more proactive this year after some [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] member states were identified as top marine pollutants,” she told the Nikkei Asian Review.In the 2017 report, Ocean Conservancy found that “Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam dump more plastic into the oceans than the rest of the world combined.”Alarming statistics are not hard to come by. A similar report by Science magazine in 2015 listed these countries, along with Sri Lanka and Malaysia, as among the world’s worst plastic polluters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature found that “more than a quarter of all the world’s marine plastic waste may be pouring in from just 10 rivers, eight of them in Asia”.Research shows that between 8m and 13m tonnes of plastic are dumped into the global marine environment annually. A recent UN Environment Programme report, “Single-use plastics: A Roadmap for Sustainability”, estimates the damage to the global marine ecosystem at $13bn annually.South-east Asia has seen some of the fastest economic growth rates in the world, and production of plastic has boomed accordingly. But consumption has outpaced waste management.The hospitality industry has spread to the region’s remotest beaches — areas that are least able to deal with tourist detritus. Travellers expect plastic containers of soap, shampoo and body lotion, throwaway toothbrushes and shower caps. There are plastic water bottles in every room and straws in every drink.Rubbish is collected by local authorities who have few funds and even less knowledge about how to recycle properly. The waste often goes into municipal landfills and dumps that are unprotected from heavy rains, mudslides and flooding. A significant portion later washes out to sea from rivers.A case in point is Ngapali beach in Myanmar’s troubled Rakhine State, which was named the best beach in Asia by TripAdvisor in 2016. Development has been largely unregulated, so rubbish bags are piled up along a river. During the monsoon, the bags are swept out to sea, then dumped back on the foreshore. “I fear Ngapali could be destroyed by these environmental problems,” Ohnmar Khin, who runs the luxury Sandoway Resort, told Nikkei.Consumer habits and overpackaging make matters worse. In a single day, the average Singaporean uses 13 plastic bags while the city-state as a whole goes through 2.2m plastic straws. Thais use a more modest eight bags a day, which amounts to more than 500m each week in Bangkok alone.Indonesia reportedly uses 10bn plastic bags annually, though this may be a very conservative estimate. Official efforts to tackle the problem have failed. A three-month trial in 2016 that introduced a fee for plastic bags in several big cities reduced their use by 55 per cent, but customer complaints against the 200 rupiah (1.4 cents) charge thwarted an extension.Americans and Europeans use more plastic per capita than people in Asia but recycling and waste disposal practices are generally more effective. And while the dark side of plastic has become evident, many of its applications remain essential to health, hygiene, and convenience.Debi Goenka, the founder of Conservation Action Trust, an Indian NGO, says that India, with its massive 1.3bn population, has less plastic waste per capita than more advanced economies, but great difficulty managing it. “Our consumption patterns compared to the rest of the globe are pathetic, but we are getting to that stage now,” he told Nikkei.During a three-month expedition to Antarctica in early 2018, the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise confirmed the presence of microplastics in the water, snow and ice, and sighted larger pieces of waste from the fishing industry. Old buoys, nets, and tarpaulins float among the icebergs.“Even the ‘world’s last wilderness’ is contaminated with microplastic waste and persistent hazardous chemicals,” Greenpeace campaigner Louisa Casson reported.The prognosis is bleak. The UK-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation expects there to be more plastic than fish in the oceans within three decades. Experts say all seabirds will have ingested plastic by 2050, and 600 marine species will have been harmed.“Plastic is not the major driver of fisheries decline, but in a precarious situation it contributes unnecessary pressure,” said Jerker Tamelander, who runs the coral reef unit at the UNEP in Bangkok. “Even if the fisheries were sustainable, plastic would be a significant problem because the volumes are so vast.”Part of the problem is abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear, or ALDFG. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, so-called ghost nets make up 10 per cent of marine litter. There are an estimated 640,000 tonnes of fishing nets lost or discarded at sea, mostly made from heavy nylon. These can travel thousands of kilometres, and continue “fishing,” or smothering reefs, for centuries. It has been estimated that 80 per cent of ALDFG found around Australia originates in south-east Asia.On dry land, south-east Asia’s plastic waste problem has been aggravated this year by ewaste from used electronic devices and old white goods that contain large amounts of hard plastic, particularly in the casings. Hard plastics in electronic components are often treated with brominated fire retardants, many of which have been banned in the US and Europe after studies found links to a variety of serious health problems.China, the world’s largest commercial processor of ewaste from home and abroad, implemented a ban on imports from the US and Europe this year. It is overwhelmed by what it once hoped would be a remunerative industry. Ewaste imports in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia have surged since.Shunichi Honda, a UNEP officer in Japan, believes that efforts need to be made to stimulate local processing capacity of all waste if the goals of a 1989 UN treaty, the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, are to be achieved.“Some countries in Asia do not have proper facilities for ewaste disposal,” Mr Honda told Nikkei. “We really have to think about economic incentives, and how a country can deal with ewaste itself.”Asean is only belatedly waking up to this dire environmental crisis. In early July, the grouping’s secretariat in Jakarta inadvertently confirmed its laggardly response with a press release titled: “Asean joins movement to beat plastic pollution”.Ms Lim noted that Asean has no official campaign or regional mechanism to compel its 10 member states to address the problem. “The pollution cannot be addressed at the national level alone, as marine debris moves across political boundaries,” Ms Lim said.She hopes senior environment officials meeting in Singapore later in the year will “formalise the adoption of coastal and marine biodiversity protection as a priority for the centre”.But, for now, the collective response to the plastic problem in south-east Asia is inchoate, inadequate and unco-ordinated.Brunei has plans to ban plastic bags outright by 2019, and some vendors in the Philippines have mounted a Bring Your Own Bag campaign. Malaysia has moved against polystyrene containers and promoted recycling of household waste, but households continue to use shopping bags for trash that goes into landfills in the absence of incinerators.Thailand has a number of plastic awareness programmes, yet many of its fuel stations continue to woo motorists with free water in large, single-use plastic bottles.The shellfish farms of Sriracha, the Thai seaside town that gave the world its eponymous hot chilli sauce, are awash with plastic. Inland, dogs and monkeys rummage through overturned garbage, scattering plastic refuse to the winds.It is estimated that Thailand fails to manage more than a third of the 27m tonnes of waste it generates each year. Much of this ends up in rivers and canals that flush into the sea, particularly during the monsoon — up to 60,000 tonnes each year, the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources estimates.The “pristine” resort island of Koh Tao has a 45,000-tonne garbage mountain. Phuket’s Maya Bay, where the Leonardo DiCaprio film The Beach was filmed, has been closed for four months to recover from tourism excesses and pollution. Koh Larn off Pattaya receives 10,000 visitors per day and has accumulated 50,000 tonnes of rubbish.Other countries have been precipitate in their approach. Maharashtra, which accounts for about 15 per cent of India’s gross domestic product, is the 20th Indian state to introduce some form of plastic ban. On June 23, it imposed a blanket ban on plastic bags, bottles, disposable cups, plates, cutlery, wrappers and polystyrene containers.With companies such as Coca-Cola and Amazon banging at its door, the state government relented a week later on bottles of drinking water over 200ml, medical packaging, wrapping materials thicker than 50 micrometres and garbage bags. Most shops in Mumbai, the state capital, are so far complying with the ban, and offer paper or textile bags at the checkout.Between 1970 and 2016, Singapore saw a sevenfold increase in its solid waste generation to 8,559 tonnes a day. With only one landfill option, it opened one of the world’s largest incineration plants in 2000 with a capacity of 4,320 tonnes a day. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which built the facility in just 38 months, has since opened a regional base in Singapore and sees significant business opportunities in the region.Waste-to-energy incinerators have the virtue of congregating bulky waste and reducing it to ash using self-generated power; surplus power generated by steam turbines can then be sold to the national grid. As landfills become fuller, more incinerators are likely to appear in the region.Thailand operates incinerators in Phuket, Songkhla and Phitsanulok, but not Bangkok. Last year, the country generated 171 megawatts from waste, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of its total 10,013MW. The modest target for 2036 is 550MW, or 2.8 per cent, according to the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency.Properly designed and operated incinerators can burn off plastics at the correct temperatures, handle dangerous byproducts such as dioxins and nitrous oxide, and filter out other noxious fumes. On the negative side, they produce carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming.Mr Tamelander believes incinerators should not be regarded as a panacea. “As a transition strategy to a lower waste society, incinerators certainly have a role to play,” he said. “We must absolutely reduce waste generation, increase recycling — and effectively stem the flow of fuel to those incinerators.”Better management and more efficient recycling will clearly be core to resolving the world’s waste plastic crisis. According to the National Environment Agency of Singapore, the recycling rate for plastics in 2017 was just 6 per cent out of 763,400 tonnes of plastic waste disposed.Globally, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates only 14 per cent of plastic is recycled, and that between $80bn and $120bn is lost each year to one-time use. The foundation estimates that a third of all plastic packaging leaks into ecosystems.Plastics contain chemicals, heavy metals and compounds known to be harmful to humans, but the consequences of eating from a manifestly contaminated food chain are still unclear. And this is where the longest lasting effects of today’s plastics crisis come into view, according to Michael Gross, an Oxford-based science writer.“Seabirds with stomachs full of plastic waste and turtles entangled in plastic bags have become symbols of the marine litter problem, but the impact at the smaller, less visible scale may be even more severe, and science is only just beginning to explore this problem,” he said.Mr Tamelander says microplastics are routinely found in tissue samples of filter feeders such as mussels and in the flesh of fish, but more research needs to be done to determine “to what extent that is a human health hazard”.“Fish-sourced plastic in humans constitutes an additional vulnerability, an additional pressure above and beyond what we already have,” he said. “Does it cause us greater harm? There are more questions than answers, and I am not sure the answers will be the ones we want.”Additional reporting by Erwida Maulia in Jakarta, Rosemary Marandi and Ken Koyanagi in Mumbai, Cliff Venzon in Manila, Gwen Robinson in Bangkok, Justina Lee in Singapore and CK Tan in Kuala LumpurA version of this article was first published by the Nikkei Asian Review on August 1 2018. ©2018 Nikkei Inc.

68;WM;Waste Management;2018-07-15T12:17:02Z;Adidas vows to use only recycled plastics by 2024;Sportswear brand plans to stop using virgin polyester for all shoes and clothing;Adidas is planning to use only recycled polyester in all its shoes and clothing within the next six years in a push to increase the sustainability of its supply chain.The shift would see the world’s second largest sportswear brand, which launched the first mass-produced running shoe made from recycled water bottles in 2016, target 5m in sales of recycled footwear this year and 11m in 2019.Last year, it sold 1m pairs of its recycled Ultraboost Uncaged Parley trainer, which are currently offered at €179.95 on Adidas’s German online site.“Our goal is to get rid of virgin polyester overall by 2024,” Eric Liedtke, head of Adidas’ global brands, told the Financial Times. He said about 50 per cent of the material used in the 920m individual items Adidas sells is polyester, adding: “With those kind of volumes, we cannot make the transition overnight.” Recycled polyester is 10-20 per cent more expensive than “virgin” materials, and even if Adidas meets next year’s target of 11m recycled pairs of shoes, it would account for just 3 per cent of its annual footwear production.But industry experts believe the price gap between recycled and new plastics will close in the coming years as more companies shift to renewables and suppliers increase their ability to produce recycled materials in large quantities.“Prices will come down as we develop more capacity to collect, clean and process used plastics,” said Brenda Haitema, who leads supply chain operations at Thread International, which makes fabric from recycled plastics used by brands such as Marmot, Timberland and Adidas subsidiary Reebok.Adidas’s move comes as more brands embrace recycled materials, in part to burnish their green credentials and increase their appeal as an anti-plastics movement has swept across the UK and Europe.Clothing brands including Patagonia and H&M already use recycled polyester in certain items and fashion brand Stella McCartney has promised to stop using virgin nylon by 2020.Adidas has been experimenting with making kit from recycled plastics for several years. In 2012, its uniforms for volunteers at the Olympic Games in London were made from re-used water bottles. Mr Liedtke said price difference is one of the main reasons the group is taking six years to become entirely reliant on recycled plastic.“We have to make sure we take right-sized bites so that we can maintain our current margin structure,” he said. “We can absorb some costs every year, but we could not absorb it all in one year.”A 2016 paper by the World Economic Forum stated that at least 8m tonnes of plastics end up in the sea every year. It warned that by 2050, there might be more plastics than fish in the sea.Environmental lobby groups welcomed the Adidas plan. “I’m happy to see that industry leaders like Adidas are working towards change, but we need to continue,” said Erin Simon, a director at the World Wildlife Fund.Orsola de Castro, co-founder and creative director of Fashionrevolution.org, an NGO campaigning for a more sustainable fashion industry, said that “any attempt to replace virgin polyester with recycled [plastic] has to be welcomed”. However, she stressed that garments made from recycled plastics still have their downsides. “Any polyester fabric presents a lot of problems in terms of after care, as it sheds micro fibres, which are the greatest cause of plastics pollution in the oceans.” “Ideally, the products would be marketed as, ‘Made from recycled polyester, but if you don’t really need it, don’t buy it’.”Additional reporting by Leslie Hook in London
69;WM;Waste Management;2018-07-09T15:48:28Z;Starbucks jolted higher after plastic straw phase-out plan;;It pays to be green.Starbucks shares received a much needed jolt on Monday after the company revealed plans to phase out plastic straws from its 28,000 stores worldwide by 2020 in a move that will eliminate more than 1bn of the drinking devices each year.The stock rose 1.9 per cent in morning trade versus a 0.7 per cent rise for the broader S&P 500.The move will see the Seattle-based coffee purveyor join a growing list of companies and countries that have announced plans to eliminate single-use plastic straws and cutlery in an effort to reduce waste and protect the environment.A strawless plastic lid, which has already been in use for a number of Starbucks drinks including Draft Nitro and Cold Foam beverages in the US and Canada, will now become the standard for all iced drinks, except for the Frappuccino. That latter will be served with a straw made from paper or a compostable plastic.“By nature, the straw isn’t recyclable and the lid is, so we feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,” Chris Milne, director of packaging sourcing for Starbucks, said in a statement.In June, McDonald’s said it would begin phasing out plastic straws in some European markets, and would roll out paper straws in the UK and Ireland.That followed the announcement of plans by the UK and EU to ban the use of single-use cutlery, plates and straws that, alongside discarded plastic fishing gear, researchers estimate account for 70 per cent of all marine litter.Seattle, where Starbucks is headquartered, implemented a plan to ban plastic straws on July 1.Despite Monday’s bounce, Starbucks shares are still down more than 13 per cent since mid-June, after growth forecasts for China and the US underwhelmed and amid news that its chief financial officer will retire later this year.Photo: Starbucks
70;WM;Waste Management;2018-07-09T04:00:25Z;Brands benefit from jumping on the plastic ban bandwagon;Companies want to win eco points with consumers but can face unintended consequences;For many, the shocking footage of albatrosses feeding ocean-blown plastic to their chicks, in the BBC’s Blue Planet II television series, marked the moment last year when simmering concerns over plastics pollution boiled over.As consumers threatened boycotts, retailers and fast-moving consumer goods brands scrambled to occupy the high ground. In January, the UK supermarket chain Iceland pledged to go plastic-free on its own-label range, and Pret A Manger doubled its discount for customers bringing re-usable cups to 50p.By April the bandwagon was rolling. Over 40 companies — including Tesco, Lidl, Marks and Spencer, Waitrose, J Sainsbury, Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola — signed the UK Plastics Pact to ditch unnecessary and problematic single-use packaging by 2025.Since then, Swedish multinational furniture retailer Ikea has promised to remove single-use plastic globally from its products and its restaurants by 2020. But will the rising tide of pledges help the planet — and the fortunes of companies making such commitments?While brands rightly fear being labelled as environmentally unfriendly, there are potential downsides to kicking a plastics addiction. According to consumer research company Kantar TNS, people still make choices based on quality and price at the checkout even though packaging has now overtaken wages for developing country producers and carbon footprint among UK shoppers’ top concerns.“While there are good intentions . . . there’s a job of educating to be done because right now consumers haven’t crystallised the problem beyond ‘plastic is the enemy,’” says Eve Dixon, UK managing director of consumer, retail and lifestyle at Kantar TNS.Using their brands to nudge consumers towards better habits may earn businesses, some brownie points from green campaigners who have criticised them in the past.As part of its 2030 sustainability goals, P&G is looking for ways to stop its packaging ending up in the oceans. Virginie Helias, vice-president of global sustainability, says this involves efforts to curb pollution and collaborations to address the inadequacy of waste management infrastructure in large parts of the world.While public concern about plastic pollution has been high in Europe, much of the waste enters the oceans in developing countries.In Europe, P&G has made a point of using its brands to engage consumers with its environmental goals. For example, in 2017, it ran a campaign in France to turn beach plastic litter, collected by volunteers, into Head & Shoulders shampoo bottles. The campaign — which is now being extended internationally — supported a commitment that by the end of 2018, 90 per cent of P&G shampoo bottles sold in Europe will contain 25 per cent recycled plastic.Right now consumers haven’t crystallised the problem beyond ‘plastic is the enemy’This had some benefits for the Head & Shoulders brand. According to Ms Helias, shoppers at the supermarket chain Carrefour, where the bottles launched, told researchers that they viewed the brand more positively.There is a risk, however, that some consumers will become disenchanted if brands do not do enough. Like other signatories to the UK Plastics Pact, P&G aims to make plastics greener through a combination of recycling, re-use and composting, rather than switching to other materials. For some, this falls recklessly short of the radicalism needed to stem the build-up of littered waste, which could see more plastic by weight than fish in the ocean by 2050.Observing that a mere 14 per cent of plastic packaging globally is collected for recycling, Louise Edge, ocean plastic campaigner at Greenpeace, urges companies to commit to yearly use reductions. “Given the amount of plastics coming on stream, it’s clear that recycling won’t fix the problem.”In promising to make all its own-brand products plastic-free by 2023, the supermarket chain Iceland has earned praise for its boldness. “We’re doing the right thing, but we’ve some massive challenges,” says Ian Schofield who manages Iceland’s own-label products and packaging. Switching to alternative packaging will require Iceland and its suppliers to invest in new machinery, adding costs that it has promised not to pass on to consumers, and it has yet to find replacements for some plastics films.Ditching plastic, or switching to alternatives, also runs the risk of worsening other ills such as food spoilage and carbon emissions associated with climate change. Sander Defruyt, who leads an initiative on plastics at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, warns that while replacing plastics sometimes makes sense, “it’s not a blanket solution”.As science advances, the environmental trade-offs inherent in manufacturing choices are becoming more apparent. This raises awkward questions over how to respond when emerging evidence casts doubt on processes and products previously considered environmentally sustainable. For brands that claim to be environmentally friendly the stakes are especially high. “They will rightfully be scrutinised to a much greater degree,” says Chris Moody, chief global design officer at the consultants Wolff Olins.The outdoor-wear business Patagonia faces this dilemma. It built its identity on environmental activism and led with the use of recycled plastic bottles in fleeces. Now it — along with other apparel makers — is challenged by evidence that tiny synthetic fibres, shed in the wash, are polluting the oceans and entering the food chain.Matt Dwyer, senior director of materials innovation at Patagonia, says the company has tried to tackle the problem by funding academic research and updating customers through blogs and in-store advice. It is also investigating technologies to minimise fibre loss.“It’s something where we said, ‘we don’t want to be surprised, so let’s make sure we have the answer,’” he says.Explore this year’s interactive BrandZ ranking of the world’s 100 most valuable brands, compiled by Kantar Millward Brown, part of the WPP advertising group
71;WM;Waste Management;2018-06-14T03:00:42Z;Plastic waste export tide turns to south-east Asia after China ban;Calls grow for recycling at home as more nations impose restrictions;The UK’s exports of plastic waste to south-east Asia have surged this year following China’s crackdown on waste imports, in a trend that industry executives say may be unsustainable.The latest HM Revenue & Customs statistics show that exports of plastic waste to Malaysia tripled during the first four months of this year compared to last year, making it the single biggest destination for British plastics. Exports to Thailand rose fifty-fold in the four-month period, while those to Taiwan rose more than ten-fold.The shift underscores how the global market has changed after China — which was previously the world’s biggest importer of plastic waste — decided to close its borders last year.China’s imports of UK plastic waste fell 97 per cent, while Hong Kong’s dropped 71 per cent during the four-month period, according to the figures.Britain exports a significant amount of its plastic waste because it does not have enough recycling infrastructure to process it domestically, and because its system of recycling credits, known as “packaging recovery notes”, effectively pays exporters to take the rubbish.Current recycling policies target the share of plastic waste that gets recycled, but do not take into account where the recycling takes place, or the end market for the recycled product.And despite growing public concern about ocean plastics, the British government has not introduced policies to stimulate investment in the languishing domestic recycling industry.Jacob Hayler, head of the Environmental Services Association, a London-based industry group, said the government should create demand for recycled plastic in the UK rather than just try to increase the supply of plastic waste that goes into the recycling bin.“We absolutely need more investment in infrastructure here in the UK,” he said. “China was a huge destination which will be very hard to replace.”Britain’s total exports of plastic waste fell slightly during the first four months of this year, declining from 243m kg last year to 215m kg this year, a drop that reflected the near-total shutdown in Chinese imports.David Palmer-Jones, chief executive of recycling and recovery in the UK for Suez, the French waste and water utility, said the volatility in the global market for plastic scrap could present a “perfect opportunity” for the country to invest more in recycling infrastructure at home.“There is a great opportunity for that resource to stay in the UK, to have it upcycled, washed, flaked, granulated, and then you are producing the base plastic resource, which is then moulded to create the product,” he said.The government is expected to publish a Waste and Resources Strategy later this year, and ministers have spoken about some of the policies it may contain, including a bottle deposit return scheme.But environmental advocates say the latest export data illustrates the disconnect between the anti-plastic headlines and the fact that consumption of single-use plastic is still increasing.“Sweeping our waste under someone else’s carpet is not the solution to Britain’s plastic problem,” said Fiona Nicholls, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “Instead of just moving our plastic scrap around the globe, we should turn off the tap at the source.”Ocean plastics activists have also warned that plastic waste is more likely to end up as marine litter in south-east Asian countries with poor waste management infrastructure than if it were handled in the UK.The surge of rubbish is already prompting a backlash in some places that have been unable to cope.Several ports in Vietnam — which saw a 50 per cent rise in UK plastic waste imports this year — are suspending imports of plastic waste at the end of this month owing to a backlog of containers filled with the material.Malaysia, Britain’s top destination for plastic waste, is currently reviewing its policies for plastic scrap imports, according to the trade publication Resource Recycling.And Poland, the second-largest European destination for UK plastic waste, has also said it is cracking down on waste imports following concerns about a “trash mafia” that has been linked to dozens of large fires at landfill sites.Mr Hayler said it was positive that Britain had been able to find new markets for its plastic waste, rather than simply sending it to landfill, which has happened in some other countries following the China ban.“We have managed to find new markets to send the material to, so they will still be recycling,” he said. “One of the questions marks is how sustainable this will prove to be over time.”A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “Our ambition is to handle more of our waste in the UK.

Compared with the fetid waterways choked with rubbish in his native Cartagena on Colombia’s Caribbean coast, the canals, streams and rivers of New England seemed blissfully clean.“The contrast was startling,” he says. “Cartagena is bathed in water, it’s a city of little islands, and yet the Cartagena I grew up in was dirty. All the waterways were polluted.”After moving back home, Mr Rodríguez decided he wanted to help clean up Colombia. In 1996 he took out a loan of $100,000 and founded Grupo Sala, the waste management company he still runs as chief executive. The acronym stands for Soluciones Ambientales para Latinoamérica — Environmental Solutions for Latin America. “I gave it a grand name but the truth is I started by working from a tiny office in Bogotá,” he says with a smile. “As an entrepreneur you always have to think big.”Since then, the company has ballooned in size, even if it has yet to live up to the geographical implications of its grandiose name — it operates only in Colombia, save for a small operation across the border in Panamá. However, Grupo Sala’s 24 companies employ 3,100 people who collect 895,000 tonnes of solid waste as well as handling drinking water management and industrial waste disposal.The company has attracted investors, the latest being Veolia, the French waste management group, which bought an 80 per cent stake owned by Acon, a private equity group, and Mr Rodríguez’s remaining 20 per cent stake at the end of last month for an undisclosed sum. Mr Rodríguez remains president and chief executive.Grupo Sala collects tonnes of rubbish from Colombia’s streets, installs portable toilets in poor rural communities with no access to running water, incinerates hospital waste and disposes of effluents from Colombia’s oil industry.For anyone who has lived in Europe or North America, its operations might seem quite mundane. Using wheelie bins to collect rubbish, for example, is hardly revolutionary. But in a country such as Colombia, where environmental awareness is in its infancy and where regulations governing waste disposal are lax and often ignored, it has been transformative.Mr Rodríguez recalls how in Cartagena it used to be standard practice to leave bags of rubbish out on the street. Dogs would rip them open at night. Homeless people would rummage through them for food. “It was quite common to see kids playing football in the streets, barefoot, [surrounded by] bags of trash,” he says.Grupo Sala introduced the concept of mechanised container collection. People were given bins that could be emptied directly into the back of refuse trucks. “We faced some resistance at first because people didn’t want the containers in front of their houses,” he says. “But we won them over.” These days, 40 per cent of Grupo Sala’s urban rubbish collection services are mechanised.Mr Rodríguez’s latest passion is for portable toilets. He wants to install them in hundreds of villages in some of the country’s remotest areas. Again, it is hardly a groundbreaking concept, but in Colombia it could make a huge difference. In rural communities, many houses simply have no toilet. People dispose of their excrement in septic tanks or, worse still, bag it up and throw it over the back wall. Grupo Sala is running a pilot scheme in Bolívar state in the north of the country where it has installed portable toilets in a small community and is monitoring their impact. Mr Rodríguez hopes the project might serve as an example to the rest of the country.People had no concept of the need to protect the environment. They thought the planet’s resources were infinite. Thankfully, that’s changedHe also highlights the need to import technology from elsewhere. For example, on a trip to Europe he discovered a system developed by AMB, a Belgian company that uses microwaves to decontaminate potentially harmful medical waste. Mr Rodríguez brought the technology to Colombia and installed it at two hospitals.Sitting in his office in Bogotá, he says one of the major challenges of being an entrepreneur working in public services is dealing with local politicians. “You have to offer them a trophy — something that allows them to take some of the credit for a project and which will show them in a good light,” he says.He is also increasingly interested in energy generation. He wants companies in Colombia to pay twice as much as they do at the moment to dump their waste in landfill sites, and for the extra money to be used to subsidise the generation of electricity from biomass. He estimates that 60 per cent of Colombia’s urban waste could be used to produce energy.Although he acknowledges it has sometimes been hard to convince Colombians of the need to take their environmental responsibilities seriously, he says things have improved since he founded Grupo Sala.“Back in 1996, people here had no concept of the need to protect the environment. They thought the planet’s resources were infinite,” he says. “Thankfully, that’s changed.”
73;WM;Waste Management;2018-06-10T15:57:56Z;Oil groups stand by bets on out-of-favour plastics;Petrochemicals push expected to pay off even if more products are banned;Some of the world’s biggest energy companies say a backlash against plastics will not derail the industry’s big bet on petrochemicals, as traditional oil groups seek new revenue sources amid expectations of a shift away from fossil fuels.Companies from Royal Dutch Shell to Saudi Aramco are funnelling billions of dollars into petrochemicals complexes as they bank on growing demand for the materials used to make items such as plastic packaging, washing detergent and home insulation.But a public outcry in Europe over plastic pollution in oceans has led to unprecedented measures to tackle waste, including a ban on single-use cutlery, plates and straws.John Abbott, downstream director at Shell, who oversees the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemicals divisions, said even if all one-time use plastics were eliminated globally it would only reduce demand for chemicals by 3-4 per cent.“Is it an important issue? Yes. Is it a societal issue? Yes. Do we need to address it? Absolutely. But it’s not going to significantly impact our view of the supply and demand fundamentals of chemicals,” he said in an interview.Mr Abbott said that while single-use plastics would “inevitably” be banned, proper waste management was just as important for preventing marine debris.BP said in its annual energy outlook published in February mounting environmental concerns over plastic pollution and any knock-on impact on petrochemicals demand could trim 2m barrels a day off oil consumption by 2040 — or 2 per cent of current demand.If you look at buildings, whether you live in a hot or a cold climate, you need insulation: that’s all chemicals . . . the amount of plastics that are used in cars to reduce their weight is incredibleCrude is refined into naphtha and other oils which are then put through petrochemical crackers to produce the basic building blocks for making plastics. But plastics are also made using natural gas liquids as a feedstock.Industry and petrochemicals used 17.4m barrels a day of oil in 2016 and is expected to increase by more than 35 per cent by 2040 should governments continue their current energy policies, the International Energy Agency said in its annual oil outlook.“Single use plastics could peak early as early 2020s, but plastics for other use will continue,” said Stephen Zinger at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “There are a tremendous amount of objects that use plastics that are not going to be disrupted.”Dario Scaffardi, chief executive at Italian refiner Saras, echoed these views at an industry conference in London this week, saying the oil used for petrochemicals to make single-use plastics is “not material at all”.Pedro Antonio Merino Garcia, head of research at Spanish energy major Repsol, also made similar remarks. Even if petrochemicals demand growth slows as government policies, such as those towards plastics, take effect, “the underlying trend should continue for many, many years.”Oil companies have sought to expand their chemicals arms to capture growing demand from the world’s emerging middle classes, such as in Asia and Africa, who are buying more products such as LCD televisions and foam mattresses.Energy majors are also trying to get more value from each barrel they produce and secure demand for their crude in the future when the growth in oil consumption is expected to peak.Mr Abbott said a push to reduce the energy intensity of cars, homes and household appliances would also propel chemicals demand. “Chemicals demand is actually being driven by the energy transition,” he said.“If you look at buildings, whether you live in a hot or a cold climate, you need insulation: that’s all chemicals . . . the amount of plastics that are used in cars to reduce their weight is incredible,” he added.The view echoes industry lobbyists who argue that plastics materials are saving more resources than used for its production, contributing to sustainability and environmental protection.The world produced 335m tonnes of plastics materials in 2016, from thermoplastic polyurethanes to adhesives and coatings, according to lobby group Plastics Europe. This was up 4 per cent from the prior year.
74;WM;Waste Management;2018-06-06T03:00:26Z;Could we dump the very idea of garbage?;Concern over the growing volume produced by cities is driving radical thinking;Consider the rubbish bin: relatively little has happened to replace or disrupt it in recent decades.However, over time the volume and value of the trash that the world produces surged — and as a result tech companies and start-ups see waste management as a sector ripe for disruption.The value proposition is already clear: the World Bank calculates that by 2025, we will be producing more than 6m tonnes of rubbish a day, almost double the levels of 2010. The cost of dealing with all that garbage will reach $375bn by 2025, according to the bank.Municipal waste is usually out of sight and out of mind, but this year it has come to the forefront of environmental concerns in Europe and the UK, where there has been a public outcry over the damage caused by plastics in the oceans.The EU has proposed unprecedented measures to tackle marine litter, including a ban on plastic cutlery, plates and straws by 2021. Meanwhile the UK has vowed to eliminate unnecessary plastic waste by 2042, with many supermarkets planning to cut plastic packaging much sooner.“A lot of the things that people have been talking about for 10 years are finally happening,” says David Palmer-Jones, chief executive at Suez Recycling and Recovery UK, a subsidiary of the French utility company. “The policies being discussed now are far more radical than I’d ever imagined,” he adds, referring to the UK.Even beyond the recent anti-plastic measures, big problems remain for waste management infrastructure, an area that has suffered from chronic under-investment from cash-strapped municipalities. Making waste management systems more efficient and cost-effective and boosting recovery rates for recyclables will require new policies and a higher level of investment.The changes coming to the world of waste management have not gone unnoticed in the technology sector. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has elaborate plans for a new waste system that will be part of a futuristic development on the Toronto waterfront to be built by its subsidiary, Sidewalk, from 2020.Autonomous robots will ferry waste through tunnels beneath the Quayside “smart city” neighbourhood. In every kitchen will be a macerator that will grind up a household’s organic waste before it is sent off to a nearby anaerobic digester, a machine that turns food waste into compost.In addition, sensors in every bin will measure how much waste a household generates, calculating the garbage bill accordingly, so residents pay for exactly the amount they throw away. The developers expect that these systems will cut the amount of waste going to landfill by 90 per cent from current levels.While systems such as these can boost the efficiency of waste collection, other tech companies are working on more fundamental ways to solve the problem of growing waste.At TerraCycle, a New Jersey-based recycling start-up, chief executive Tom Szaky says he is trying to eliminate the idea of waste altogether. “Waste is a modern idea. It’s only been around really for 70 years,” he says, pointing to the advent of consumer culture in the early 20th century as a turning point.“Recycling is not the solution to waste, it is just a temporary band-aid,” he adds. “The solution is to move to a world where garbage doesn’t exist. That’s where we need to get to.”While that may seem like a self-defeating idea for a company that makes money from recycling, TerraCycle is already working on a way to eliminate household waste altogether.Mr Szaky plans to accomplish this by introducing a new system of reusable containers for common household items, called the “Loop” system, which is scheduled to launch in Paris and New York next January.Loop works in much the same way as the classic milk delivery, in which glass milk bottles are brought to the customers’ doorstep and later reused by the company. However the new system would apply to a wide variety of products, from toothbrushes and shampoos to ice-cream and cleaning products. All of these will be delivered in high-end, durable containers which can be returned, cleaned and reused.“Imagine the milkman now, but for everything in your life,” says Mr Szaky. “By switching from disposability to durability, you don’t just solve waste, you change the way people consume.”As tremendous changes sweep across the global waste management industry, eliminating the humble trash can altogether may just be the most ambitious goal yet.
75;WM;Waste Management;2018-05-28T17:20:34Z;EU plans to ban plastic straws, cutlery and plates;Officials say move part of a wider strategy to spur investment in new types of packaging;Brussels plans to ban a range of plastic items, including single-use cutlery, plates and straws, by 2021 with new rules that mark increasingly ambitious efforts by the EU to reduce marine pollution.The European Commission is proposing a ban on 10 products that, together with discarded plastic fishing gear, account for 70 per cent of all marine litter. Officials said the move was also part of a wider strategy to create a market for recycled plastics and spur investment in new types of packaging in the bloc.“Plastic can be fantastic, but we need to use it more responsibly. Single use plastics were not a smart economic or environmental choice,” said Jyrki Katainen, commission vice-president responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness. The initiative announced on Monday would ban plastic items – such as cotton buds, cutlery, plates, straws, drink stirrers and sticks for balloons – that the commission believes can be easily replaced using more sustainable materials. For the remaining top 10 single-use plastic products — such as food and drink containers — the rules aim to limit their use while alternatives are developed. The EU move is the latest in a series of similar policies implemented by governments across the world as concerns have grown over plastics polluting oceans and damaging marine wildlife.From New York, which is considering a ban on plastic straws, to the UK, where the country’s biggest supermarkets have vowed to eliminate unnecessary plastic packaging by 2025, retailers and politicians are taking increasingly bold steps to cut plastic use. Kenya last year imposed laws under which people selling or using plastic bags risk four years in prison or heavy fines.However, some industry groups argue that the focus on banning specific items such as straws puts the focus in the wrong place, and could be a distraction from less glamorous but equally important policy changes, such as more investment in waste collection and recycling systems.Kim Christiansen, head of PlasticsEurope UK, which represents European plastics manufacturers, said the group supported the goal of reducing marine litter, but did not believe that bans of specific products were the best way to achieve that.“Plastic product bans are not the solution and will not achieve the structural change which is needed to build the foundation for a sustainable, resource-efficient economy,” said Mr Christiansen. “We would urge the commission to avoid shortcuts.”But Mr Katainen said the bans would create an “opportunity for Europe to lead the way, creating products that the world will demand for decades to come”.Packaging is the biggest single use of plastic, accounting for more than a quarter of global demand, according to a study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.The commission estimates that Europe generates 25.8m tonnes of plastic waste annually, of which less than 30 per cent is recycled, 31 per cent ends up in landfills and 39 per cent is incinerated. Packaging firm Tetra Pak recently defended plastic straws but also pledged last month to launch a paper straw for its popular juice boxes by 2019.Campaigners welcomed the initiative but said further action was necessary. The commission’s proposal was “a leap forward in tackling plastic pollution” according to campaign group Rethink Plastic, but they added it was “just a beginning” and stressed the need for specific reduction targets for food containers and beverage cups in EU states.The new rules also require member states by 2025 to collect 90 per cent of single use plastic drinks bottles, a target that Mr Katainen said “will also help to generate the necessary volumes for a thriving plastic recycling industry”. Producers will be required to contribute to the clean-up and recycling costs of balloons, cigarettes, food containers, lightweight plastic bags, wet wipes and plastic fishing gear. In addition, there would be new labelling requirements for sanitary towels, wet wipes and balloons. The directive requires the approval of parliament and member states, which officials hope would happen within a year. As written, the bans would come into force two years after the proposals are adopted by parliaments. 
76;WM;Waste Management;2018-05-25T04:00:38Z;Tetra Pak plans fightback in war on plastic straws;Packaging giant says alternatives to juice cartons can be more damaging to environment;Packaging giant Tetra Pak is planning to lobby politicians and regulators about the benefits of plastic straws despite pledging last month to launch a paper straw for its popular juice cartons by the end of this year.In a letter seen by the Financial Times, Charles Brand, Tetra Pak’s head of sales and marketing, told customers the paper straw announcement had been made to address “the rising tide of negative public opinion towards plastic straws and government drives around the world to reduce their use”.However, he added: “For our own part, we will continue to make the case to politicians, regulators and environmental groups that the plastic straws attached to portion-sized carton packages serve an entirely functional purpose.“We will also maintain our argument that, from an environmental perspective, their impact is significantly lower than most liquid food packaging alternatives.”Plastic straw crackdowns have mushroomed since David Attenborough’s BBC series Blue Planet II jolted fresh life into the war against plastic pollution late last year.The UK government, the Hilton hotel group, the Costa Coffee chain and the city of Seattle are among those calling time on plastic straws, which are blamed for littering the oceans and harming marine life.A Tetra Pak spokeswoman denied inconsistency in the messages the company was giving the public and its customers. She said Tetra Pak shared the public’s concerns about plastic waste and was working “full speed” on paper straws, even though its products only accounted for a small percentage of the global straw market.While the new paper straw should be ready by the end of 2018, she said it would take more time before the company could industrialise its production and make it commercially available.Mr Brand’s letter explains that although paper straws sounded relatively straightforward, there were “significant challenges” to making them work on Tetra Pak cartons.They have to be strong enough to pierce the box, as plastic ones do, and withstand an “aggressive distribution chain”, he wrote. The company must also develop a non-plastic wrapper for the straws to keep them clean.In the meantime, Tetra Pak would accelerate efforts to educate people to push the straw “back in the pack” once the carton was empty, so straws could be collected and recycled.Major British businesses including J Sainsbury, Tesco and Unilever UK have all pledged to strip unnecessary plastic from their shelves by 2025 but the challenges of the Tetra Pak straw highlight how difficult it could be to reach these goals.Supermarkets are struggling to find a replacement for packaging such as the cling film wrapped around cucumbers, which extends their life, and some environmental advocates have questioned whether eliminating plastic wrap might inadvertently expand the carbon footprint of fruit and vegetables.Plastic has qualities, including durability and its light weight, that are difficult to recreate with other materials, and packaging is the single biggest application of plastic, accounting for more than a quarter of plastic demand worldwide, according to a study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Most plastic packaging is used once and then discarded, according to the study, with only 5 per cent recycled.Redesigned bottles could make straws obsolete / From David Massumi, Männedorf, Switzerland
77;WM;Waste Management;2018-04-25T23:02:51Z;Big business in UK pledges to cut plastic packaging;More than 40 companies commit to ambitious plan to tackle pollution;More than 40 companies in the UK have pledged to strip unnecessary plastic from their shelves by 2025, in the most ambitious business-led plan yet to fight plastic pollution and change packaging standards.The new UK Plastics Pact, which has backers including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, Ocado, Marks and Spencer, Unilever UK and Procter & Gamble UK, will cover around 80 per cent of all plastic packaging on Britain’s supermarket shelves, according to estimates provided by the signatories.The pledge stands to accelerate the pace at which the country shifts away from single-use packaging that ends up in landfills at a time when the public is increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of plastic pollution in the oceans.The government has previously announced a long-term plan to reduce plastic waste over the next 25 years.But businesses have largely been much quicker to respond to the public outcry that was sparked in part by the images of pollution in the BBC’s Blue Planet II series.“Reducing the damage caused by plastic is one of the most challenging issues society can address,” said David Potts, chief executive of Morrisons, which also joined the Plastics Pact. “We’re in an important position to make changes to our packaging.”New measures such as selling loose fruit and vegetables and paper rather than plastic straws, or allowing consumers to bring their own containers to the meat counter, may sound like small steps. But they have the potential to add up to big changes for the plastics industry.Packaging accounts for around 40 per cent of plastics demand in Europe, according to a study by the European Commission. Campaigners estimate that in the UK, less than half of plastic packaging currently gets recycled.We don’t have to shift away from plastics. What we have to do is shift the mentalityThe companies that have signed the UK Plastics Pact have agreed to several targets, including removing unnecessary packaging and changing the designs of their products so that all packaging can be recycled, composted or reused.They are aiming for 70 per cent of plastic packaging to be recycled or composted by 2025, compared to the current rate of 46 per cent.Marcus Gover chief executive of Wrap, a non-profit group that organised the Plastics Pact, said the initiative was about finding new ways to make sure plastic was reused or recycled.“It is all about changing the system of how plastic works, to make it more circular. The UK is world-leading from that point of view. That’s at the heart of all this, plastic is not rubbish, it is a valuable material.”But Mr Gover also acknowledged that changing packaging designs and consumer behaviours would require time and money, as companies look for substitutes for blended plastics that cannot be recycled. This will be particularly difficult for plastic containers that, for example, are designed to cope with being put into the freezer or the oven.While the participating companies declined to comment on how much they were prepared to spend to meet the targets, analysts said investing heavily in new packaging technologies could hit supermarkets’ already razor-thin margins.However, Bruno Monteyne, European food retail analyst at Bernstein, said supermarkets were nevertheless likely to benefit from economies of scale because they were acting in concert.“The fact that they are doing it together means it might not be as expensive as it would have otherwise been,” he said. “If everyone has the same cost increase, then everyone will pass on the same cost to the consumer.”The government has proposed a bottle deposit return scheme and a ban on plastic straws and stirrers as steps toward limiting plastic waste. The government has already banned plastic microbeads and introduced a mandatory 5p charge for plastic bags at shops.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, gave Wrap a £9.6m grant in the past financial year.Michael Gove, the environment secretary, praised the Plastics Pact, saying: “Our ambition to eliminate avoidable plastic waste will only be realised if government, businesses and the public work together. Industry action can prevent excess plastic reaching our supermarket shelves in the first place.”Nevertheless, critics have cautioned that the fight against plastic packaging risks overlooking some of its benefits, including the fact that it helps keeps food fresh for longer.Edward Kosior, managing director at Nextek, a recycling consultancy, said the real challenge will be to change the consumer behaviour that has come to rely on the convenience of cheap, disposable plastic products.“We are going to have to rethink all of that, and we will have to reprioritise,” he said. “We don’t have to shift away from plastics. What we have to do is shift the mentality.”Additional reporting by Laura Hughes and Precious Adesina
78;WM;Waste Management;2018-04-22T15:28:29Z;Stop our oceans choking on a plastic overdose;Governments and companies must act globally to clean up the seas;"Rarely has a global environmental issue aroused public and political concern more rapidly than plastic pollution of the oceans. Images of litter-coated beaches on once idyllic islands — and sea creatures entangled in lethal debris or poisoned by plastic pieces mistaken for morsels of food — are forcing governments and companies into overdue action to reduce the estimated 8m tonnes of waste plastic that find their way into the oceans every year. So too is alarm about the almost invisible threat of tiny microplastic particles and fibres, resulting mainly from the disintegration of larger items, which may pose a toxic time bomb for marine life and eventually humans too.This initial drive for action must not only be maintained but intensified in the years ahead. The threat to our oceans is too great to release the political pressure even if plastic pollution falls out of the news.Unfortunately it will not be practical for the foreseeable future to remove more than a small fraction of the trillions of plastic pieces in all shapes and sizes that are already fouling the oceans. Yes, beaches and estuaries should be cleaned — and it is worth supporting projects to extract plastic from places where currents concentrate floating debris such as the notorious Great Pacific Garbage Patch — but purifying the oceans on a global scale is an unrealistic technical challenge.Policymakers should therefore focus their efforts on rapidly reducing the flow of fresh material into the ocean, by increasing recycling and restricting non-essential uses of plastics. This will require a huge change in behaviour by the world’s consumers, pushed by government regulations such as mandatory deposits on plastic bottles, charges for plastic bags and coffee cups, and bans on certain products, such as the one proposed last week by Theresa May, UK prime minister, on plastic straws and cotton buds. At the same time the manufacturing and retail sectors must go further and faster than most have announced so far to phase out unnecessary plastic packaging.Even so, millions of tonnes of plastic will still need recycling every year for the time being. Product designers have an important role to play in the creation of a “circular economy”, making it simpler to separate different components at the end of their life and identify different plastic ingredients.A priority for research is to improve recycling technology. A hint of what might be possible came last week when an international team announced the discovery of an enzyme that can break down PET, the polymer used to make bottles; it was extracted from bacteria evolving to eat waste plastic in Japan. The next big EU research programme could lead the way by adopting plastic-free oceans as a “grand challenge”.All these actions must take place on a global scale, since most plastic reaches the sea from the developing world and particularly from the larger Asian economies. That may mean transferring money and even technology to help poorer countries handle the huge recycling job that they face.Fortunately plastic pollution, unlike climate change, is an environmental cause without a vociferous band of sceptics denying the scientific consensus that action is needed urgently. In that respect it is more like the 1980s crisis over the destruction of the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. Then international agreement quickly banned the non-essential use of ozone-destroying CFC chemicals in aerosols, fridges and elsewhere. The battle against unnecessary plastics will not be so straightforward but we can draw some encouragement from successful phase-out of CFCs 30 years ago.Waste plastic can be a valuable commodity / From Rudolph Kalveks, London, UK"
79;WM;Waste Management;2018-04-21T03:00:31Z;Banning straws not enough to solve plastic pollution, May warned;Waste management and fouling of oceans are the core priorities, critics say;Politicians know the art of uniting against a common enemy, and when Theresa May faced the Commonwealth heads of government earlier this week, she picked a prime target: plastics. Plastic pollution has become a top environmental concern in the UK, and the prime minister said she was prepared to ban plastic straws and coffee stirrers as she urged Commonwealth nations to join a new alliance to fight ocean pollution. The fight against plastics has been gathering momentum since Blue Planet II, a BBC series, highlighted the problems with marine pollution in December. This prompted the UK government to commit to eliminating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042, and to new measures such as a bottle deposit scheme. “Definitely the UK is taking a very bold approach to plastics right now. It is very visible,” said Kim Christiansen, regional director for PlasticsEurope, an association of plastics producers. “It is a high-profile issue here in the UK, and higher than I think you would find in other European countries.”The EU has also introduced new goals on plastics and recycling, and its plan to recycle 55 per cent of municipal waste by 2025 — rising to 65 per cent by 2035 — was approved by the European Parliament earlier this week. France banned plastic cups and cutlery two years ago, and the EU introduced a plastic bags directive in 2015 that requires all EU members to limit plastic bag consumption. Plastics have become an environmental issue because production of the material has increased 20-fold in the past 50 years. About a third of the plastic produced ends up being dumped in the environment, rather than being recycled or put in landfill, according to a study by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation. Cotton buds, plastic straws, things like that — they are low-hanging fruit. We need a systemic approach, and that would be much more challenging for the governmentPlastic does not biodegrade, which is what makes it good for storing food. But this becomes hugely problematic when it ends up in the ocean, where it breaks down into smaller pieces that are consumed by marine wildlife, often with fatal effects. But even while the issue has galvanised the British public, experts disagree about whether the UK government is focusing its efforts in the right place. “Cotton buds, plastic straws, things like that — they are low-hanging fruit,” said Ferran Rosa, waste policy officer at Zero Waste Europe, a non-profit based in Amsterdam. “We need a systemic approach, and that would be much more challenging for the government.”Chris Cheeseman, a professor of materials resources engineering at Imperial College, said: “It is missing the point, and it’s not going to do anything to reduce plastics in the ocean, which must be the ultimate aim.“Banning plastic straws or plastic stirrers is just nonsense really, against the huge problem with waste management in developing countries,” he added.Critics say the ban is a distraction from much more difficult policy changes that are needed to fix the plastics recycling system in the UK.The UK generates around 3.7m tonnes of plastic waste each year — of which around a third is recycled, with the rest going to landfill or incineration. Most of the recycled plastic is exported to recycling plants in developing countries, because the UK has limited recycling capacity.You can solve the problem in the oceans by solving the plastic problem on land. If you make plastic valuable on land, it will stop people from throwing it into the oceansThe amount of plastic recycled is limited by, for example, different rules between rubbish collection zones — the UK has more than 300 waste collection systems. And its system of recycling credits, known as “packaging recovery notes”, creates an incentive for waste to be exported, which can imply a higher environment footprint.“You can solve the problem in the oceans by solving the plastic problem on land,” said Adrian Griffiths, chief executive of Recycling Technologies, a Swindon-based manufacturer of plastic recycling systems. “If you make plastic valuable on land, it will stop people from throwing it into the oceans.”But while the policy debate continues, plastic straws are already starting to disappear from the high street and shops. Consumers are shunning plastics and companies are vying to announce anti-plastic policies. Supermarket Morrisons has stopped sourcing plastic straws and plastic-stemmed cotton buds for its stores. Fast-food groups such as Pret are replacing plastic straws with paper straws in their shops from this summer. “It’s a very, very powerful issue . . . in the UK in particular. As we are an island nation, we all grow up fairly close to the oceans,” said Jeremy Darroch, chief executive of Sky. The broadcasting company recently launched a £25m venture fund to invest in plastics research and related start-ups, including looking at ways to take plastic out of the supply chain. The public shift against plastic has happened so quickly that it has created a backlog of demand for non-plastic alternatives. “We’ve actually been struggling to keep up with demand,” said Sam Walker, business development manager at Biopac, a supplier of eco-friendly packaging based in Birmingham. “We have to ration what people take, to maintain our stock,” he added, pointing to paper straws as one product that had become so popular the company was rationing sales.

A recent study revealed 8.5bn plastic straws are disposed of every year in the UK.“Plastic waste is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world, which is why protecting the marine environment is central to our agenda at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting,” said Mrs May.“The UK government is a world leader on this issue, and the British public have shown passion and energy embracing our plastic bag charge and microbead ban, and today we have put forward ambitious plans to further reduce plastic waste from straws, stirrers and cotton buds.”Mrs May will also urge Commonwealth countries to sign up to the newly formed Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance this week. The British government has committed £61.4m to the initiative to develop new methods for preventing and cleaning up plastic waste.It comes after the government vowed to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 and launched a 25-year plan to improve the environment.Michael Gove, UK environment secretary, will launch the consultation on banning single-use plastics later this year.In recent months, Mr Gove has announced plans to force thousands of small retailers in England to charge 5p for plastic bags and introduced a ban on the microbeads used in facial scrubs and toothpaste.He has also announced a consultation on the introduction of a deposit system for plastic bottles and cans, but he faced criticism on Wednesday over a “lack of urgency” in efforts to introduce such a scheme.Speaking to the Commons environmental audit committee on Wednesday, Mr Gove said he hoped the deposit scheme would become law by 2020.Mary Creagh, the committee’s chairwoman, responded: “It is disappointing that having announced the deposit return scheme last year, the government will not be bringing in this vital part of tackling plastic waste until 2020 at the earliest.”Drastic plastic / From Jonathan Price, London, UK
81;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
82;WM;Waste Management;2018-04-13T09:46:28Z;Why glass milk bottle deliveries are back;As concern over plastic pollution rises, a pint-sized revolution is taking place on doorsteps across the UK;"It’s 6am and there’s a peachy tint to the sky above Southfields. The streets are silent save for the whirr of our electric motor and the gentle clink of glass bottles as we navigate a pothole.I’m nearing the end of a round with Ian Beardwell, a surviving member of what many assume to be a dying breed: the great British milkman. He has delivered to these streets in south London, six days a week for the past 27 years. Both his father and uncle were milkmen before him and he still remembers the first pint he ever delivered with his dad. “It was Christmas Eve, 1978, in Colliers Wood,” he recalls. “I was nine years old and there was six inches of snow.”Despite the early hour, Beardwell is in a positive mood. “I’ve not felt so upbeat in 10 years,” he tells me as the float coasts to a halt and he leaps out, grabbing a couple of bottles of semi-skimmed and walking up to a house to collect the empties.He has reason to be cheerful. Back in the 1980s — perhaps the heyday of the milkman — about 90 per cent of the milk consumed in the UK was delivered to the door. Two years ago that stood at just shy of 3 per cent. Yet just as the tradition of the doorstep delivery was about to be consigned to history, a surprising resurgence has occurred.Beardwell, who is one of 1,100 milkmen working for the doorstep delivery service Milk & More, has picked up almost 70 new customers in the past six weeks on his round alone, he says, with 90 per cent of them wanting milk in glass bottles.We pull up outside a nursery school. “This is how local and personal the milkman gets,” he laughs as he places a digit on the fingerprint recognition pad at the door before carrying the heavy crate of 30 pints of organic whole milk upstairs and returning with the empties. “They now have 150 pints a week in glass instead of 45 plastic bottles, so that’s a big change for them,” he says.But it could have been so different. The glass milk bottle very nearly disappeared a few years ago when the country’s largest bottling plant (owned by Dairy Crest) in Hanworth, south-west London, was on the brink of closure. After Müller, the dairy business, bought out Dairy Crest in 2015, it reversed the plan and decided to invest in the company’s Milk & More business, the UK’s largest milk delivery service, which covers everywhere south of Manchester.“We are seeing a quiet revolution,” says Milk & More chief executive Patrick Müller, whose first act was to retain the “iconic” glass bottle. “We have in the past four weeks seen 7,000 new customers with 90 per cent of those having glass bottles. Traffic to the company’s website has doubled.”Many point to the “Attenborough effect”: demand has increased since the broadcast of David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II television series last autumn, which highlighted the effect of plastic pollution on the world’s oceans.Milk & More offers what Müller calls “a farm shop on wheels” with more than 200 locally sourced premium products (as well as normal and organic milk, it stocks free-range eggs, biscuits, bread, bacon, organic cheese and veg), which can be ordered online up to 9pm the night before and be waiting on your doorstep by 7am “like magic”. This year, Müller is investing a further £20m in the Milk & More business, revamping IT, upgrading machinery and — most visibly — from this month rolling out a new fleet of more than 200 electric floats to replace many of the older diesel vehicles used on longer rural rounds. “David Attenborough has reignited people’s love of the great British milkman,” he says.Yet most of the investment in Milk & More was put in place well before Blue Planet II aired. What did Müller — who is Swiss and recalls visiting his local farm as a boy to collect milk in buckets — spot in the ailing business?“We saw three general trends,” he says. “Customers want to know what they’re eating and who produced it. People are environmentally conscious and want to do their bit to reduce plastic waste. That’s why we kept the glass bottle and decided to keep the factory open. It’s great packaging. And finally, community values are becoming more important. The human touch and the sense of community are becoming more important in today’s world.”Beardwell agrees. On a recent round, he interrupted a burglary and sat with the victim until the police arrived; he has also returned a lost chihuahua to its owner north of the river and has found the keys to countless expensive cars lying in the street that he has posted back through the right letter boxes. Last week he even reunited a laptop with its owner — an exhausted doctor who had left his bag on the street at the end of a long night shift.Milk & More and other larger dairies are not alone in recognising the effect that discerning, ethically and environmentally conscious consumers are having on the doorstep milk delivery business.Stephen Hook, 52, milks an 80-strong organic herd of Holstein Friesian cows on 180 acres near Hailsham in East Sussex where his family have farmed for more than 200 years. His cows produce about 16,000 pints a week — half of which is used to produce cream, butter, yoghurt, ghee and labneh. The remaining 8,000 pints are delivered on one of six growing local rounds within a 10-mile radius of the farm or sold at farmers’ markets in London. More innovatively, Hook has also pioneered a next-day courier service to deliver his raw (unpasteurised and unhomogenised) milk to customers’ doorsteps nationwide.This service filled a gap, he says. By law, raw milk can only be bought from the farm where it is produced, which is no good if you don’t live near a dairy herd. Hook stepped in with a solution. His milk is chilled to 2C, put into plastic two-pint bottles and packaged in insulated boxes that keep the milk below 8C for up to 48 hours. These are then delivered to customers as far away as Scotland the following day.“People are starting to understand raw milk more and they don’t necessarily like the milk they are buying from supermarkets, which is increasingly processed,” Hook says. “The consumer is starting to source milk from a farm where they can see the cows and know the provenance of their milk.”Hook himself drinks a pint or two a day of what he calls “the original superfood”. A Food Standards Agency report in March noted that there has been “a fivefold increase in the volume of RDM [raw drinking milk] production in the UK from around 610,000 litres in 2012 to 3.2 million litres in 2017”. The number of registered RDM producers in the UK has also increased from 108 in April 2014 to 168 in January 2018.“A milk round run by a farmer is fantastic because the consumer receives the produce straight from the farm and gets it as fresh as fresh can be. Nothing can beat it coming straight from the farm within 24 hours,” Hook says. “It’s not just about the food, it’s about the connection the consumer has with the farm they’re getting their food from.”He is crowdfunding to buy 70 acres of marshland near his farm. Donors get no equity — just the warm feeling that comes with contributing to the survival of an organic farm. A regular at the Stoke Newington farmers’ market in London gives him £10 towards the fund each week, Hook says. Clearly, many consumers love to know where their milk has come from and to be connected to it in a way they simply can’t be with supermarket milk.Perhaps inevitably, the doorstep delivery has also been given something of a millennial twist for a generation increasingly embracing a dairy-free and vegan lifestyle.On April Fool’s Day last year, Jamie Chapman posted flyers around Hackney, east London, about a spoof dairy ban — the stunt was to launch Mylkman.co.uk, his homemade, dairy-free nut-milk brand. Chapman, 33, was determined that any business he created would be environmental and ethical (10 per cent of profits go to Greenpeace) and to that end he makes between 1,000-1,500 bottles a week of the milk (including almond, cashew, pistachio and coconut) himself.Initially he delivered it by bike in reusable glass bottles and his round grew by word of mouth as he visited superclubs, yoga classes, vegan cafés and attended talks on a plant-based lifestyle and the zero-waste movement. Delivering personally to early adopters (mainly “early-thirties, health-conscious women into yoga and mindfulness”), offered Chapman a perfect opportunity to get to know his customers and test new products.David Attenborough has reignited people’s love of the great British milkmanAlthough he still delivers his nut milks himself (he can load his US-style beach cruiser bike with up to 60 litres at a time), he now also uses Farmdrop, a local and organic food delivery service operating in London, Bath and Bristol, to deliver to doorsteps across the capital. In March, Planet Organic started stocking his milk and this month he will roll out his doorstep nut-milk delivery service to Bristol and Brighton. Oxford and Cambridge are next on his list.Back on Beardwell’s old milk float, we’re coasting to a halt outside number 29 (two green tops). He’s got two more houses left, then it’s back to the depot in Wandsworth to unload the empties. Just as I’m about to say goodbye, a woman jogs over. “How can I get your milk? It has to be in glass . . . ” Beardwell laughs and adjusts his cap. Another happy customer?Photographs by Luke StephensonFollow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

83;WM;Waste Management;2018-04-10T03:00:28Z;KPMG bans plastic cups in push to reduce pollution;Environmental initiative taken in response to pressure from accountancy firm’s staff;KPMG has become one of the first leading companies to remove plastic cups from its UK offices in response to pressure from staff to adopt a more proactive approach to protecting the environment.The “big four” accounting firm has already removed all plastic cups from around the water coolers in its Manchester office, where it first trialled the initiative. KPMG’s 1,100 Manchester-based staff have instead been provided with reusable water bottles. The success of the Manchester trial — where 900 employees have so far taken up the offer of a reusable water bottle — means the firm now plans to extend the scheme across its UK network by September.KPMG estimates that it currently uses 3m plastic cups for water a year at a cost of £60,000. It expects to recover the cost of providing reusable water bottles within 18 months of rolling out the scheme nationally. Staff who misplace their water bottles or choose not to use one will be able to “rent” a recyclable paper cup for around 50p, according to Sarah Lindsay, environment manager at KPMG. On the first day plastic cups were removed from the Manchester office, fewer than 10 employees requested a paper cup, she added. The decision to stop using plastic cups came after the BBC aired the documentary series Blue Planet II last year, which prompted a number of KPMG staff to question the firm’s approach to the environment and, in particular, its use of plastic. The series, which drew millions of viewers, highlighted how plastic is damaging the world’s oceans, with 8m tonnes of plastic waste entering the marine ecosystem each year. Theresa May, the prime minister, has pledged to eradicate avoidable plastic waste by 2042. KPMG additionally plans to remove plastic cups from its hot drinks machines, although it is in the process of deciding whether to switch to paper or compostable plastic alternatives. The firm uses another 3m plastic cups in its hot drinks machine annually.KPMG has also begun removing plastic cutlery from its regional offices, with 260,000 plastic items taken from its supply chain so far this year. If that project is successful, the firm will remove plastic cutlery from its larger offices as well. Ms Lindsay said the decision to ditch plastic cups was accelerated by China’s announcement last year that it would no longer accept some plastic imports — including recycling waste — from overseas. Last year two-thirds of Britain’s plastic waste was exported to China, she said, so the policy change has made it difficult for UK recycling companies to adapt. “This has caused a huge headache for the waste industry: that was another supporting factor in why this was a good time to change,” she said. Few large companies have publicly made similar commitments to eradicating plastics from their offices, although the BBC has promised to scrap single-use plastic cups and cutlery by 2019. In February, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office became the first government department to announce a ban on single-use plastics across its operations by 2020. The FCO also raised its so-called “latte levy” from 10p to 50p to encourage staff to use their own mugs instead of disposable ones. Meanwhile, fast-food chain McDonald’s has pledged to remove plastic straws from across its UK restaurants.Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace, the environmental group, said: “KPMG's commitment is the latest in what is becoming a global trend for businesses to eliminate throwaway plastic. Plastic can be found throughout the world’s oceans, from whole bottles and pieces of packaging to tiny microplastics.”“We all need to stop thinking of plastic as a disposable resource. A huge reduction in the amount of single-use plastic packaging we're producing and using is vital.”

Last year revenues grew 7 per cent (3.7 per cent on a like-for-like basis across company-managed stores), but profits fell 4 per cent as the group pursued its target to invest £100m by 2020.Unsurprisingly, Greggs shares have failed to find momentum but this did not stop chief executive Roger Whiteside from netting £250,000 via a 20,601-share sale.Mr Whiteside also spent just over £41,000 on 3,477 new shares, and was joined by finance director Richard Hutton who spent £13,540 to top up his stake.C Directors buying shares after a major announcement is often viewed as an attempt to signal confidence to the market.In the case of waste management group Augean (AUG), however, the price spike that followed full-year results last month showed the market had a fair amount of confidence already.The purchases made by executive chairman Jim Meredith and two non-execs should therefore be taken as an indicator of future growth.*placing/tender/open offer ♥spouse/connected party
85;WM;Waste Management;2018-03-31T05:04:25Z;Nigerian designers put urban waste to sustainable use;Entrepreneurs see treasure in trash, but scaling up is a challenge;"Lagos, the largest city in Africa, is home to as many as 20m people. Imagine interminable traffic, a thousand car horns honking simultaneously, calls to prayer, church megaphones blaring high-pitched sermons — and a whole lot of rubbish.More than 10,000 tonnes of waste are generated daily, according to authorities. Attempts by successive governments to solve this problem and improve the city’s aesthetics have failed.Jennifer Uchendu, the founder of environmental sustainability platform Susty Vibes, says this mega city requires a “disruptive” solution that uses waste in a way that helps the economy.Upcycling — the process of transforming waste into items of higher value — could be part of the answer to this, Uchendu argues. “Young people and women in particular are seeing this business that requires very little capital, and an element of creativity . . . coupled with the ability to provide an alternative way to manage waste.”Olabanke Banjo, 27, works at an advertising agency. As a child, she would repurpose earrings into brooches and pendants or use them to embellish her bags and shoes. A couple of years ago, she noticed that her neighbours were about to discard a pile of used tyres that had been sitting in their garden. Reviving an old habit, Banjo asked for them.By May that year, the entrepreneur had transformed the discarded items into ottomans and coffee tables which she sells under the brand name Cyrus45 (see examples inset). “I just couldn’t accept that nothing else could be done to the tyres except trash them,” she says. “So I asked them to give the tyres to me; it was the match that ignited my passion for turning used tyres into ultra-modern furniture pieces.”Banjo sources old tyres for free, or for a little cash, from other people, roadsides, vulcanisers or refuse dumps. She has seen demand from Delta, Enugu and Oyo states as well as the capital, Abuja. “Our goal is to upcycle at most 500 tyres in a year”, she adds.During a visit to the UAE a few years ago, Olamide Ayeni-Babajide went on a shopping trip for home decor and later realised the goods were made of recycled corn husk.“I was not only surprised, but I saw an untapped opportunity for me to start my own waste remodelling business in Nigeria,” she says. “I started with PET plastics, corn husk and paper waste before venturing into using discarded car tyres to make sustainable eco-friendly furniture.”Ayeni-Babajide, 35, and her two full-time employees also collect magazines, straws and wood to make panelled mirrors, study chairs and bar stools and side stools.Her business, Pearl Recycling, offers cash to hotel staff and event planners to pick up waste after partygoers. The company also offers “trash for pay”, where clients receive a partial discount on products in exchange for usable household waste.It started in Lagos but now has trainees that have started recycling hubs in Oyo State and Abuja, says Ayeni-Babajide. “Our vision is to have our trainees at all the 36 states of Nigeria remodelling waste materials produced from these states.”In Abuja, artist Ifesinachi Nwanyanwu runs a gallery dedicated to environmentally themed art. Later this year, he will be visiting Lagos to be part of the annual One Environment Hybrid workshop that brings together artists, scientists, environmentalists and innovators to discuss sustainability.Nwanyanwu says he uses “all waste and organic materials” including wood, metal, old CDs and computer motherboards. “When I conduct workshops in different cities, the organisers take us to the [local] waste site, and we will do that in Lagos this year.”Nigeria’s designers are not constrained to their home turf. Yinka Ilori uses old furniture to create vividly colourful pieces for both the Lagos and London markets.Those seeking to make a business out of upcycling can have a tough time raising funds to scale up. Banjo’s products received a boost of publicity after she exhibited at a government-organised business fair last year. However she has yet to win outside investor backing, so is supporting Cyrus45 with personal funds and sales.Yomi Jemibewon, a founding partner at Lagos-based private equity firm CardinalStone, says early-stage investment, where it exists, is focused elsewhere, on the country’s tech sector.Jemibewon recommends that budding upcyclers seek commercial backing from established companies, by supplying them with a product line. “Then investors like us see that better structured, higher-scale business that they are part of [and] we can provide capital with some of it allocated to that product line,” he adds."
86;WM;Waste Management;2018-03-27T21:58:17Z;UK eyes deposit system for plastic bottles and cans;‘Reverse vending machines’ could offer refunds for recyclable drink containers;Consumers buying single-use plastic drinks bottles and aluminium cans will have to pay a deposit, under a plan proposed by the government, to encourage more recycling.Michael Gove, environment secretary, said the scheme, which is subject to a consultation, will impose a fixed upfront charge that will be refunded to those who return the cans or bottles for recycling.The environment department estimates the British public uses 13bn plastic bottles every year, of which more than 3bn are either sent to landfill, incinerated, or left to litter the UK.Mr Gove said: “We can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment — killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats. It is absolutely vital we act now to tackle this threat and curb the millions of plastic bottles a day that go unrecycled.”“We have already banned harmful microbeads and cut plastic bag use, and now we want to take action on plastic bottles to help clean up our oceans.”In the UK alone, it is claimed that the sum of single-use plastics thrown away each year would fill the Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times over.The consultation is expected to look at the use of “reverse vending machines”, which could see the public insert used disposable drinks containers into a machine in return for their money.The government pointed out that Sweden currently has an upfront 8p deposit scheme and Germany charges consumers 22p before any empty bottles and cans are returned.The government has said it would only introduce measures where the costs to businesses and consumers are “proportionate”.Theresa May, prime minister, has vowed to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 and warned the government is prepared to “ take action at every stage of the production and consumption of plastic”.Philip Law, director general at the British Plastics Federation, said: “We welcome the announcement about a deposit return scheme and the fact it is going to include all materials, which should boost recycling rates for all drinks containers.“As the experts on plastics, we will be a constructive and supportive partner to the government as this is developed because, as ever, the devil is in the detail.”Jo Jacobius, director of British Bottled Water Producers, added: “I am supportive of any scheme that encourages responsible recycling of plastics, metal and glass containers.”“I would, however, also like to see stronger encouragement of action against needless or excessive plastic packaging on other consumer goods in food and non-food sectors.”Bill Bryson, author and former president of Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: “Future generations will look back on this decision as a piece of supremely enlightened policymaking, and one that raises the prospect of the world’s most beautiful country becoming free from drinks container litter at last.”
87;WM;Waste Management;2018-03-26T11:13:38Z;Smurfit rejects second bid from International Paper;US group says combination of two makes ‘compelling strategic and financial rationale’;Smurfit Kappa has rejected a second bid from International Paper of the US as the world’s biggest paper company by sales presses Europe’s largest cardboard box maker to enter takeover talks.Saying it had made several fruitless attempts to engage with Smurfit Kappa, International Paper argued that the combination of “two highly-complementary businesses has compelling strategic and financial rationale”.It said talks should quickly begin between the two groups.Dublin-based Smurfit Kappa said on Monday that International Paper had submitted a revised cash-and-stock bid on Thursday evening that values Smurfit Kappa stock at €37.54 based on the American company’s closing share price on Friday.The shares, up from €28.62 before the first International Paper bid in early March, were down 2.13 per cent at €34 in Dublin on Monday morning.The Irish company’s board has unanimously rejected the new bid, saying its stakeholders were better served by pursuing its future as an independent business.“The revised proposal also fundamentally undervalues the group and remains significantly below the valuations set by recent industry transactions,” it said.Liam O’Mahony, Smurfit Kappa chairman, said the new bid did not offer shareholders “much more than compensation” for the fall in International Paper’s share price since the first approach was made public.International Paper shares closed at $58.94 on March 5, the day before Smurfit Kappa said it had rejected the company’s first unsolicited approach. The stock had dropped amid weakness in global markets to $50.14 by the close on Friday.But the US company insisted on Monday that the revised offer was priced “at a material premium to both undisturbed and all-time high share prices” and held out the prospect of $450m in cost synergies from the combined groups.“Notwithstanding the rejection, International Paper believes the revised proposal provides the best immediate and long term value for Smurfit Kappa shareholders,” it said.International Paper said the second bid represents a premium of 31.2 per cent to Smurfit Kappa’s share price before the first bid was made public and valued the Smurfit Kappa stock at €39.71 based on the US group’s pre-bid price.Tony Smurfit, Smurfit Kappa chief executive and grandson of the company founder, has previously dismissed reports that the company was willing to enter talks with International Paper if it increased the offer above €40 per share.Mark Sutton, chairman and chief executive of International Paper, said the raised bid was attractive for the shareholders of both companies.“We believe our revised proposal is responsive to the views of Smurfit Kappa shareholders and provides a sound basis upon which to secure a recommendation from Smurfit Kappa’s board,” he said.International Paper foresees annual cost synergies of $450m per annum by the end of the fourth year after a deal, saying these could be derived from sourcing, supply chain and operational savings as well as reductions in administrative expenses.Such synergies are an important consideration for International Paper’s own shareholders as they assess the bid for Smurfit Kappa.David O’Brien, head of industrials research at Goodbody in Dublin, said such synergies appeared reasonable and argued that more dialogue between the companies would have been expected at this point.“The synergy number from International Paper will certainly be attractive to their own shareholders. It looks achievable, falling within the historical range of synergies for deals of this size.“I’m a little surprised that Smurfit Kappa haven’t engaged at all despite the raised offer from International Paper. Even in the intervening period, they haven’t actually sat down face to face.”David Holohan, chief investment officer at Merrion stockbrokers, said Smurfit Kappa’s response appeared to have “softened somewhat” by arguing that the second bid remains significantly below valuations in recent industry transactions.This suggested Smurfit Kappa would enter talks if a bid met similar multiples, he said.“Now Smurfit Kappa is seeking to extract the most value it can. The likely next step is that International Paper may tweak its offer once again with a higher cash offer and increased synergies,” Mr Holohan added.“However, the main impediment for a deal now is the broader stock market weakness, which is negatively impacting International Paper’s share price, and which management have no control over.”

Officials said last year that the amount of single-use plastic thrown away annually in the UK alone would fill the Albert Hall a thousand times over.The damage caused by plastic, which is extremely durable, has garnered significant global attention. Each year more than 8m tonnes enters the world’s oceans.Chewing gum, which is made of synthetic rubber, could also be taxed. A Treasury spokesperson said it was seeking views from everyone and nothing was being “ruled in or out” as part of the call for evidence.Industry representatives broadly welcomed the call for evidence. “Any material that can be only used once — whether derived from plastic or anything else — has no place in the future and should be reduced,” said Philip Law, director-general of the British Plastics Federation.But, he warned, “we must not lose sight of the broader point that there are many positive uses for plastic in our society — from our hospitals to food security”.Helen Munday, chief scientific officer of the Food and Drink Federation, said it recognised that “more needs to be done to reduce litter and drive up recycling across all materials, including plastics”. But she said that any action should “take full account of the important role of plastics in protecting and preserving food products throughout the food and drink supply chain”.Rebecca Newsom, senior political adviser at Greenpeace UK, welcomed the move but said there should be more pressure on “supermarkets and food giants to cut down the amount of throwaway plastic they put in circulation”.Additional reporting by Michael Pooler and Shari Daneshkhu
89;WM;Waste Management;2018-03-05T12:14:53Z;Gabon accuses Veolia of causing severe pollution;French waste group and central African state trade accusations after seizure of 35 sites;The government of Gabon has stepped up its feud with Veolia, accusing the French water, waste management and energy group of causing widespread “severe pollution” at several operating sites in the central African nation.Last month, the Gabon government seized 35 sites operated by Veolia through its Gabonese subsidiary. Antoine Frérot, Veolia chief executive, responded angrily, saying his company would sue for breach of contract and arguing that the “expropriation” would damage the cause of long-term foreign investment in Gabon and the rest of Africa.But Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet, prime minister of the oil-rich country of about 2m people, countered that his government was “dismayed” by what he called “Veolia’s irresponsible attitude” and failure to comply with environmental standards. “The African continent is not a dumping ground,” he said.Gabon has accused the French company, which manages water, electricity and waste management in several African nations and nearly 50 countries internationally, of ignoring repeated warnings to clean up its act.“Public complaints were registered as early as December 2016 in multiple locations,” said Mr Issoze-Ngondet. Inspections since the expropriation had revealed “chronic pollution of soil on-site, as well as nearby lakes and rivers” in 17 sites operated by Veolia.Negotiations to improve Veolia’s performance had broken down when the company walked out last year, the prime minister said.In what has become a fierce public relations battle, Helman le Pas de Secheval, spokesman for Veolia, described the prime minister’s accusations as “highly questionable given that no government inspection agencies reported any alleged environmental damage until after the government’s illegal seizure of Veolia’s assets in Gabon, despite having carried out at least ten inspections in the last 10 years.”He said that Veolia, through its local company, met all World Health Organisation sanitary requirements, which exceeded Gabon’s own standards.“That the government will now attempt to attract other foreign investors to this industry is inconceivable,” he said. “Veolia was, until just weeks ago, one of the largest foreign employers in Gabon, and after a half billion euros of investment in the water and electricity sector had raised Gabon to one of the highest levels of water access on the continent.”Lee White, director of Gabon’s National Parks Agency, disputed Veolia’s account, saying he had taken a helicopter to one of the company’s sites in Lambarene on the Ogooue River in western Gabon last month. He found a generator spewing a “fountain of diesel” into the river via a trench. “If you look at Veolia’s website, they look all squeaky clean. But what I saw was shocking.”The dispute, said Mr White, was partly about the terms of the outsourcing contract between the government and Veolia. “You have the same situation in the UK when Carillion went into administration and there were renewed calls for utilities to be returned to public management,” he said.He estimated it would cost up to $100m to repair the sites, some of which he said were decades out of date. “I think that the senior management of Veolia do not have an inkling of the horror of their facilities in Gabon.”Mr Issoze-Ngondet denied his government had starved infrastructure of funds, saying it had invested about $1.5bn in water and electricity over the duration of the contract. It had approved what he called “an unprecedented” 14.9 per cent increase in rates in 2009.The prime minister said that Gabon would manage water and electricity supplies for an interim period, but hoped to put the contract out to a new international tender within a year. The government still saw public-private partnerships as a “sound model”, he said.

But only 20 per cent of this waste is properly recycled, according to a UN report. It estimates that €55bn ($65bn) of valuable metals and plastics were thrown away in 2016 — more than the gross domestic product of many countries.Most of these refrigerators, computers and TVs are dumped in landfill sites or exported — often illegally — to countries with lax regulations and cheap labour forces such as Cambodia and Ghana, where valuable materials are extracted by burning or brute force, releasing toxic chemicals and metals.“Ewaste is a massive problem,” says Mr Mattravers, the general manager of the Hong Kong plant, a government-funded joint venture between Alba, a German waste management company, and Integrated Waste Solutions Group, which is controlled by the Chengs, one of Hong Kong’s wealthiest families.Hong Kong’s 7.4m people generated an average of 19kg of ewaste each last year, one of the highest rates in Asia, although less than the 25kg produced in the UK and the 19.4kg generated in the US.About 80 per cent of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory’s waste is exported to developing countries, ostensibly for re-use but often to be broken up in an unsafe manner.Some of the ewaste that remains in Hong Kong is dealt with in a similar fashion at little-regulated dumps near the border with mainland China.To tackle the problem, from August, the Hong Kong government will charge importers of electronic goods a levy that goes towards funding the Alba plant and a free collection service for ewaste.The need for change is clear at Yee Kuk Street, in Hong Kong’s ramshackle Sham Shui Po district, the heart of the informal recycling industry.As night falls, traders arrive to load old washing machines, TVs and other goods into container trucks for export or break-up in Hong Kong.Muhammad Babar, one of the traders, says that half of the goods are refurbished and exported to places such as Southeast Asia and Africa, while the rest are broken up “with hands and hammers”.Mr Babar is unaware of the risks of dismantling refrigerators and TVs in this way. But he fears that the new government scheme will damage the incomes of poor people such as himself, who can earn HK$10-HK$20 ($1.30-$2.60) from each large item they pick up.Jim Puckett, executive director of the Basel Action Network, an ewaste NGO, says governments and manufacturers have a responsibility to stop this activity and pay the full cost of proper disposal.At the Alba facility, LCD TV screens are removed from their casings by a robot arm in a controlled atmosphere to ensure that all of the potentially harmful mercury contained within can be extracted.Workers at the plant, which started operations in October, have to check which of nine different chemicals are used in each refrigerator or air conditioner before they can remove and store them.Even simple washing machines need to be disassembled with care so that the concrete blocks used to weigh them down can be disposed of properly before the steel casing is shredded.Mr Mattravers says the key to progress is not just more recycling facilities but better collection services.Vanessa Gray of the International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency that monitors ewaste, says more countries are following the lead of places like the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden by implementing legislation to require proper disposal of ewaste.But she says it is “more difficult for large countries with dispersed populations”. Although two-thirds of the world’s population is covered by some form of ewaste legislation, the recycling rate is still running far behind, at only 20 per cent.The Basel Convention, which is meant to restrict the cross-border movement of hazardous waste, has been signed by 186 countries. But there is no enforcement mechanism.Mr Puckett says the Convention is undermined, like many other international agreements, by the failure of the US to ratify it.“It’s a big problem that one of the world’s most wasteful countries is not part of this treaty,” he says.China, by contrast, has just taken a step forward. It has banned the import of low-grade waste and intensified border controls to stop smuggling, causing backlogs of waste paper, plastics and electronic goods at dumps in Hong Kong and around the world.“As China clamps down other countries will have to do it properly,” says Mr Mattravers.But with the ewaste problem expected to worsen as more products become wired for internet connectivity, Mr Puckett is calling on manufacturers to redesign goods so that they last longer and are easier to repair or dismantle.“It’s all about designing for what society really needs,” he says.Additional reporting by Nicolle Liu
91;WM;Waste Management;2018-02-12T13:32:29Z;Cobalt in old smartphones could be used to power EVs, Umicore chief says;Carmakers are growing increasingly anxious about securing cobalt supplies;Global car makers who are scrambling for supply of battery metal cobalt could instead turn to the millions of old smartphones lying in our drawers.Recycling of the estimated 1.6bn in old phones could provide cobalt to meet demand from millions of electric vehicles, according to Belgium-based Umicore, one of the largest producers of battery materials, who expect it to become a growing source for the industry.“There is an amazing mine of cobalt that is totally untapped,” said Marc Grynberg, chief executive of Umicore, which produces cathodes for electric car batteries.Mr Grynberg says around 10 per cent of global cobalt production goes into smartphones, which is “lost forever.”Carmakers are growing increasingly anxious about securing supply of cobalt, a silver-grey metal that doubled in price last year. Over half of the world’s cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo before it is sent to China to be refined for use in batteries.Last year Volkswagen issued a tender for five years supply of the metal as it plans to become a world leader in electric cars.There are around 1.6bn phones languishing in people’s drawers, according to Dutch company Fairphone, which recycles old phones.“We have billions of dismissed end-of-life smartphones …. That could be utilised to power millions of electric vehicles. Millions,” Mr Grynberg said. “If there is one thing that needs to be done in the first place starting now is to make sure there are mechanisms in place to motivate people to return their disused smartphones.”These could include a non-refundable deposit on the purchase of a phone, Mr Grynberg said. Only around 5 to 10 per cent of smartphones are collected for re-use and recycling, he said.“Recycling does exist and does work, it is collection that doesn’t work,” he said.Cobalt demand from EVs is set to rise from to 95,000 tonnes by 2026 from 12,000 tonnes last year, according to consultancy CRU.There will be enough cobalt to meet electric car demand over the next few years, but recycling will start to make up a growing portion of supply in a decade, Mr Grynberg estimates.In two decades recycled cobalt will be “a significant portion” of Umicore’s feed material, he added.Umicore’s shares have risen by 18 per cent year-to-date to a record high of €47.(This post has been updated to correct the share price.)
92;WM;Waste Management;2018-02-08T04:00:40Z;What’s the return on investing in a reusable coffee cup?;Discounted drinks mean you can soon recoup the cost of buying your own cup;"Skinny mocha. Flat white. Cortado. Dirty chai latte. Or an extra-shot grande Americano? Choosing the type of coffee you want is hard enough. Now, the focus has switched to the choice of cup you drink it from.It is estimated that 2.5bn takeaway coffee cups are thrown away every year in the UK, and they are practically impossible to recycle. Gulp.More environmentally conscious coffee connoisseurs choose to bring their own reusable cups for baristas to fill — and many chains are encouraging them by offering discounts.But these discounts vary hugely, and there are as many types of cup as there are types of coffee bean. So which is the best buy and what kind of return on investment could coffee lovers potentially obtain?The cost of reusable cups ranges from £1 (for a lowly Starbucks reusable beaker) all the way up to $149 (£108) for the Ember Bluetooth-enabled travel cup, which can keep your choice of beverage at a constant temperature for up to two hours. Only available in the US, it is controlled via a smartphone app and can be customised with a 24 carat gold “halo lid” and a recharging coaster.A solution for a problem that few of us experience, you would have to be seriously wired to think that buying one of these was a good idea. Yet a prolific coffee drinker could break even on their investment if they used it 220 times in Pret A Manger.How is this possible? Anxious to boost their green credentials, most of the big coffee chains offer discounts of up to 50p per hot drink to encourage consumers to bring their own reusable vessels. Some sell their own too.So, as well as being better for the planet, using a reusable cup could also be better for your bank account.The good news is that all the coffee shops I tried were happy to fill any reusable cup I brought along with me. So long as your cup is clean and has a suitable lid, you can use one coffee shop’s branded reusable cup in a rival chain.However, not all of them offer a discount. There is not a bean to be had from chains including Eat, AMT, Delice de France, Caffè Ritazza, Pumpkin Cafe or Camden Food Co.However, Pret and Patisserie Valerie offer the most generous discount of 50p per hot drink to those who bring their own cups (Pret will soon start selling its own). This means a cup of Pret filter coffee — which has been faithfully priced at 99p for a decade now — can be yours for just 49p.Caffè Nero is technically the next best. Its loyalty card (now also available via a contactless tap-and-pay phone app) gives you one point per coffee purchased. For every nine you buy, the tenth coffee is free. But if you take a reusable cup, Nero doubles your points. So if you bought five regular cappuccinos at £2.35, the free drink would effectively save you 47p per coffee, plus you would carry over one loyalty point.Costa, Starbucks and Paul, the French sandwich chain, all offer a discount of 25p. Paul also has a loyalty card (La Carte Noire) with a free coffee and croissant when you sign up, then your tenth coffee free. Ooh la la! Benugo offers a 10 per cent discount. Even Greggs — which sells surprisingly good coffee for the price — will knock 20p off.How many coffees it will take to earn back the value of your investment also depends on the type of cup you choose.The Starbucks basic reusable cup costs £1 — and it looks it. Some of my contacts on social media complained that the cups cracked easily. Better, then, to invest in a cup with a stoppable, leakproof lid that’s robust enough to survive the rigours of commuting and being repeatedly stuffed into a handbag.Collapsible cups like the Pokito (£15) and the Jerrybox (£10) take up less space in your bag. But heavier, non collapsible cups with intricate locking systems such as the Contigo (between £20 and £30 depending on size and colour) are guaranteed leak-free, and will also keep your coffee warm for hours.For the hipster in your life, there’s the KeepCup (bright mix and match colours, cork thermal bands and choice of a glass or plastic cup) ranging from £10 to £25.Cups made from bamboo fibre, such as Ecoffee, are another option at around £12. Patterns include a William Morris range. Who knew that choosing a cup could be so complicated? Yet only 2.5 per cent of Londoners are supping from reusables, according to data from payment platform Yoyo.The cheapo Starbucks cup will pay for itself after four discounted coffees in the chain, or two in rivals Pret and PatVal. But your future investment returns also depend on its lifespan.The dedicated coffee enthusiast could substantially boost their investment returns by playing ‘coffee arbitrage’If you sink £10 into a sturdier reusable cup, it will take 20 coffees to pay back (assuming the 50p discount). If you drink five coffees a week — or 260 cups a year — after you’ve paid for the reusable cup, you could save a cool £120.But you are still spending rather a lot of money on coffee. Based on the full £2.45 price of a Pret regular cappuccino, that’s an outlay of £637 a year (or £507 with the reusable cup and associated discount).The dedicated coffee enthusiast could substantially boost their investment returns by playing “coffee arbitrage”. The price of an espresso is usually cheaper than a white Americano (in Pret, £1.65 vs £1.99). So buy the espresso in your renewable cup, and get the 50p discount. Then replace the thermal lid, walk back to your work kitchenette, and top up with free boiled water and milk there. You may think this is a lot of effort to go to. Yet I am bringing you this tip because colleagues in the FT office are already doing it.For the super thrifty, of course, there is the option of bringing in a good old fashioned mug and a cafetière. This is the Money team’s favoured route. I even get 20 per cent off ground coffee in Waitrose (it’s one of the “picks” on my loyalty card) and of course there’s a free in-store coffee too, which I will sip from my reusable cup as the caffeine jitters propel me across the bridge to the FT office.Claer Barrett is the editor of FT Money; claer.barrett@ft.com; Twitter: @Claerb"
93;WM;Waste Management;2018-02-01T08:30:17Z;Rail stations to install drinking fountains;Government aims to promote refillable water bottles and cut plastic waste;Network Rail is set to introduce drinking fountains at all main UK railway stations as part of government efforts to encourage the public to carry refillable water bottles.Thérèse Coffey, the Suffolk Coastal MP, has written to the state-controlled track infrastructure company and urged it to build more fountains at its stations.The move comes as the government cracks down on environmentally damaging single-use plastics that are used in takeaway food packaging, including throwaway coffee cups. The recent BBC documentary series Blue Planet II highlighted widescale damage to the oceans caused by plastics.Ms Coffey’s letter to Network Rail, which was sent in December, was cosigned by Paul Maynard, the rail minister. She is also writing to operators of airports and motorway service stations in a bid to convince them to follow suit.Network Rail said: “We are supportive of having water fountains in our managed stations and will be looking to see how we can take this forward.” The company is looking at each station separately and assessing the feasibility of introducing fountains.Speaking earlier this month, Ms Coffey said: “The world has woken up to the consequences of a disposable society. I have written to retailers, coffee shops and transport hubs across England asking them to provide free water refills to customers, and I’m delighted that many chains, including Starbucks and Pret, have already given this commitment to customers.“True change requires a collective effort and I urge everyone to take advantage of the many water refill points that will be available.”Philip Hammond, chancellor, used his Budget in November to promise an investigation into how the tax system could be used to curb single-use plastics. He announced a consultation that could see consumers face new taxes on takeaway food packaging, including disposable coffee cups.These cups are rejected by most paper recycling facilities because they have a plastic inner lining.UK prime minister Theresa May also announced plans last month to extend the 5p plastic bag charge to all high street shops in England to reduce pollution and waste, and tackle the UK’s “throwaway culture”.Mrs May said the government was prepared to “take action at every stage of the production and consumption of plastic” and set a target of eliminating avoidable plastic waste by 2042.Michael Gove, environment secretary, is also looking at the potential use of a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles.Last week, it was announced that a network of 20 new drinking fountains are also set to be installed across London this summer under a pilot scheme led by Sadiq Khan, the capital’s Labour mayor.Jo Jacobius, director of British Bottled Water Producers, said: “PET and glass bottles are fully recyclable.”She added: “It is also important to remember when thinking about bottled water, that British bottlers of natural waters act as important stewards of the UK countryside as they fiercely protect the land from which the water is sourced.”
94;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-27T08:00:26Z;Call to step up coffee cup recycling in battle on plastic waste;Collection of disposable cups must be improved, says UK paper mill chief;"Bosses at the James Cropper paper mill recently received an unusual item in the post: a single used paper coffee cup.The anonymous — but environmentally conscious — sender had heard the plant in Cumbria was one of just three facilities in the UK that could recycle the plastic-lined cups.Phil Wild, Cropper’s chief executive, said it showed two things: that the public is eager to recycle; and current collection arrangements were not good enough.“It shouldn’t cost the price of a stamp to recycle a coffee cup. It should become standard practice — something we do without thinking — and we’re confident we can achieve this,” he said.The issue of waste leapt to the top of the political agenda this month after the BBC’s Blue Planet documentary series highlighted how plastic is choking the world’s oceans, with some 8m tonnes of plastic waste entering the marine ecosystem each year. Theresa May, UK prime minister, pledged to eradicate avoidable plastic waste by 2042.Only about one in 400 of the 2.5bn disposable cups used each year in the UK are recycled, according to MPs. The paper cups are lined by a thin layer of plastic to waterproof them but because it is hard to separate, they cannot enter recycling systems and are either burnt or buried in landfill. Politicians have called for a 25p “ latte levy” on each to reduce their use.Meanwhile, the EU has set a target to increase plastic packaging recycling from less than 30 per cent to 55 per cent by 2030.James Cropper, founded in 1845, has the technology to help. What it lacks is the cups to recycle.The facility began accepting used cups in September 2017 and can process up to 500m annually. But in four months over the past year it has processed just 10m. On a recent visit, the conveyor belt feeding cups into a container that separates out the plastic stood idle for much of the day.Richard Burnett, who is in charge of the process, says he should soon be busier. “With all the publicity recently we have been inundated, from businesses to local people to coffee chains,” he said.“It just needs everyone in the supply chain to do something different. It is not an insurmountable problem.”But so far only McDonald’s, Costa Coffee and Selfridges have signed deals with Cropper.The company has invested millions in a production line that strips the plastic lining out of the cups so that it can be processed by regular recycling facilities. The company buys the used cups, which are made of high quality pulp that can be reused to make products such as bags once the plastic has been stripped out. Veolia, the waste company, collects, cleans and sorts the cups and bundles them together on a pallet to ship to Cumbria.Cropper’s “cupcycling” products range from simple bags — including Selfridges distinctive yellow paper bags — to a packaging material called colourfom, which is a recycled alternative to plastic and polystyrene that is used by Lush, the cosmetics firm, for some bath oils.Mr Wild hopes that it could soon encase smartphones, cosmetics and toys. “It is sustainable, recyclable and biodegradable. Over 90 per cent of the market is still using plastic. And single use plastics are now an environmental ‘no no’,” he said.But change can be slow — and expensive. McDonald's began installing recycling collection units for coffee and soft drink cups in 2015 and now has them in more than 1,000 of its restaurants, with about 200 still to go. It declined to say how much it has spent.A string of other companies — from Coca-Cola to Unilever — have recently pledged to find alternatives to plastic or at least recycle more, driven by consumer demand.The experience of the drinks carton industry may offer an example of how to increase coffee cup recycling. The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment (ACE UK), which includes companies such as TetraPak, a decade ago set up a recycling system to cope with a growing problem with waste cartons.The 3bn cartons sold annually in the UK also have a plastic layer. Through a mix of kerbside collection by local authorities and designated collection bins, the industry has increased levels of recycling — though it does not have audited figures of volumes. Ten years ago 6 per cent of local authorities collected cartons, compared with 92 per cent today.ACE pays a subsidy for loads of used cartons, which are sent to a paper mill near Halifax. From January 1 the facility has been able to handle cups too. Operating on an overall 2 to 1 mix of beverage cartons and cups it could process about 640m cups a year.There are currently 382 coffee cup recycling points in 97 local authority areas in the UK. ACE is hoping the 263 local authorities who run kerbside collections for cartons will soon include cups too.Some 14 paper cup makers and takeaway chains have agreed to help fund the system. They include Caffè Nero, Costa Coffee, Greggs, Pret A Manger and Starbucks.It just needs everyone in the supply chain to do something different. It is not an insurmountable problem“It is not an insoluble problem. We have a recyclable product. It takes time. We need infrastructure in big buildings like office blocks,” said a spokeswoman for ACE. Half of coffee cups are disposed of at work.Still, kerbside carton collection costs approximately £82 per 1,000 households, according to WRAP, the waste charity.The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the onus was on cup makers to change their design to remove the “scourge” of plastic.Cllr Martin Tett, the LGA’s environment spokesman, said: “Coffee cups are made of paper coated with a plastic layer which can contaminate other materials put out for recycling. This creates an extra cost for councils and can reduce overall recycling.“We have long called for industry to step up and show more responsibility in tackling this issue, and councils would be keen to work with producers and discuss how the design and recycling of coffee cups can be improved.”"
95;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-25T11:49:51Z;Gove to press supermarkets over ‘appalling’ excess plastic;Environment secretary encourages shoppers to buy local;Michael Gove, the UK environment secretary, vowed to push British supermarkets on their use of excessive plastic packaging – part of a broader crackdown by Theresa May’s government on avoidable plastic waste.Mr Gove encouraged British shoppers to buy products from independent retailers, arguing that shoppers invest in the local economy when they buy produce from smaller high street shops.“While I have no wish to undermine Asda, which is an admirable retailer, I find that when buying meat the best thing to do is to go to one’s local butcher – in order to buy locally and to invest in the local economy”, he said in the House of Commons.His comments came in response to a question from Ian Lucas, a Labour MP, who accused supermarkets of using “appalling” amounts of plastic and follow a promise by the government to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042.The prime minister Theresa May has called on supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles — with non-packaged items. Speaking earlier this month, she said the government is prepared to “take action at every stage of the production and consumption of plastic”.Mrs May also announced a consultation on “single-use” products that could see consumers face new taxes on takeaway food packaging, including disposable coffee cups. Plans to extend the 5p plastic bag charge to all high street shops in England as part of an effort to tackle the “throwaway culture” have also been announced this year.Last week the UK grocer Iceland, citing the “scourge” of pollution, promised to eliminate plastic packaging from its own-brand products by the end of 2023.
96;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-24T05:01:06Z;The problem with plastic;From the stomachs of baby seabirds to the depths of the oceans — plastic pollution is everywhere;"As Jennifer Lavers of the University of Tasmania began her talk at Berlin’s Falling Walls conference in November, operatives from the city’s garbage contractor dumped a hundred 60-litre sacks of plastic waste around the stage.Speaking from behind the barrier of trash, the Australian marine ecologist told the audience: “This rubbish is equivalent to just two days of consumption by the [750] individuals in this auditorium.” Then she showed shocking photos she had taken on uninhabited Henderson Island in the south Pacific, one of the most remote places on earth.Beaches that were covered with pristine sand in the 1990s are today littered with plastic debris, washed up from countries around the Pacific Rim and beyond — an estimated 37 million pieces, weighing 18 tonnes.This is just the tiniest snapshot of our problem with plastics. Every year an estimated eight million tonnes of the material flow into the oceans. And, over the past few months, there has been a huge increase in public and political concern about this marine pollution, to a level where it is approaching climate change as an environmental issue.In the UK, Sir David Attenborough’s TV series Blue Planet II has made a big impact, drawing attention to the harm done to creatures that become entangled in plastic or eat fragments that they have mistaken for real food. In one heart-rending sequence, Lucy Quinn of the British Antarctic Survey shows the plastic bags regurgitated by a wandering albatross chick on South Georgia. That bird is still alive but Quinn, close to tears, then shows the decaying corpse of another young albatross.“Unfortunately there was a plastic toothpick that has gone through its stomach,” she says. “Something as small as that has managed to kill the bird. It’s really sad to see.”While many people have only recently become aware of the global plastic pollution crisis, others have been wrestling with it for years. One such is Mandy Barker, the Leeds-based photographer whose images illustrate this article. “I grew up in Hull and spent a lot of time on Spurn Point nature reserve,” she says. “Returning each year, I was shocked to find the amount of rubbish building up there.”Since emerging as a professional photographer in 2011, Barker has focused her work on plastic pollution, drawing material from beaches and harbours around the world and from a voyage to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch— an ocean current that traps exceptionally large amounts of floating debris. Her approach is to reveal unexpected beauty in plastic pollutants, which she often photographs as if they were rare and precious sea creatures. “I want to stimulate an emotional response in the viewer, using the contradiction between an initial aesthetic attraction to the images and a subsequent awareness of the harm these objects are doing,” Barker says.Richard Thompson, head of the International Marine Litter Research Unit at the University of Plymouth and a leading researcher into ocean plastics, was initially uncertain about Barker’s work. While he appreciated the “beautiful artistic representations of litter in the sea”, he was not sure what they added to the global plastic debate. But now he recognises their positive impact.While welcoming the new sense of urgency worldwide, Thompson is somewhat puzzled about why interest is surging now in an issue that has preoccupied him for so long. “There is a snowball effect, as media stories build on each other,” he reflects. “People who live far from the sea are beginning to realise that they share responsibility for marine litter.”Malcolm David Hudson, a marine ecologist at Southampton University, adds: “I think it is becoming clear to scientists and, increasingly, to the public that we are getting close to various tipping points within natural systems, as a result of plastics in the oceans.” Tipping points are sudden, substantial and sometimes unstoppable changes — for instance in key marine food chains — that would result from the cumulative effect of more subtle changes. For Lavers, the key point is that “the problem is building up so quickly that people can no longer deny its existence. That’s why we are talking about it now.”While large pieces of plastic waste are all too visible on beaches and in the ocean, toxicologists are sounding an urgent alarm about the smaller fragments, known generally as microplastics, whose dimensions are measured in fractions of a millimetre. Many microplastics come from the disintegration of plastic debris but some are manufactured as “microbeads” to add a slightly abrasive character to health and beauty products, including toothpastes and exfoliating creams. “Nurdles” are another source; these are tiny pellets used to make plastic products, which find their way into the sea through spills and mishandling.Fish and birds eat microplastics, which often look like perfect bite-sized morsels of real food, by mistake. Inside the gut they act as poisons, both through their physical presence and because they release toxic chemicals — including internal molecules involved in the plastic manufacturing and external toxins such as DDT and PCBs — that they have absorbed in the sea.Lavers carries out most of her research on Lord Howe Island, 600km east of the Australian mainland. She is particularly concerned about the flesh-footed shearwater, a seabird that forages for food on the surface of the Tasman Sea and inadvertently brings microplastics back to its chicks instead of the intended plankton.“When we started monitoring these birds more than a decade ago, the proportion containing plastic was already 70 per cent. Now it’s 100 per cent,” she says. “Every single bird on Lord Howe Island contains plastic.” Analysis shows that baby birds fed more plastic by their parents have shorter wings and poorer health.Lavers found 225 pieces of plastic in the stomach of one three-month-old chick, weighing 10 per cent of its body mass. That would be equivalent to an average human carrying about 6kg-10kg of plastic. “Imagine having to take your first flight out to sea with all that in your stomach,” she says. “Around the world, seabirds are declining faster than any other bird group.”The number of marine species — fish, mammals, birds and invertebrates – known to be adversely affected by plastic waste has risen from around 260 when the first assessment was carried out in 1995 to 690 species in 2015 and 1,450 now, according to Lavers.Scientists at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh released research this month showing that the shores of Scapa Flow in the Orkneys contain as much microplastic pollution as the Clyde and Firth of Forth: about 1,000 tiny particles and fibres per kilo of sediment. “The fact that a relatively remote island has similar microplastic levels to some of the UK’s most industrialised waterways was unexpected – and points to the ubiquitous nature of microplastics in our water systems,” says Mark Hartl, the project leader.Although there has been concern about eating seafood contaminated with microplastics, there is no evidence that consumption has reached levels likely to affect human health. Toxicologists remain more concerned about other harmful chemicals such as mercury in fish. “Microplastics are an insidious long-term problem,” Hudson says, “but we have to be careful not to promote scare stories.”Dealing with plastics could have two parts: cleaning up what is already in the oceans (an estimated five trillion pieces of plastic, according to Lavers) and stopping more from getting in. Marine scientists, however, say the overwhelming priority must be prevention: cutting quickly the flow of those eight million tonnes every year — as much as half of it carried by rivers.Although there is a role for removing plastics, from low-tech beach clean-ups to a high-tech proposal to extract the plastic floating in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the pollution is dispersed too widely across the oceans for a large proportion to be removed in this way.The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a leading anti-waste charity, estimates that international clean-ups could not deal with more than 0.5 per cent of plastics entering the seas. “Yes there are technological clean-up solutions, like big mechanical booms sweeping around in the middle of the ocean,” says Thompson, “but there is a danger of us being distracted from the priority of stopping plastics getting into the oceans.”That means changing both consumer behaviour and product design — to discourage non-essential use of plastics, particularly for packaging, and making it far easier to recycle the plastics that are used. “Plastics are not the enemy,” Thompson adds. “They are wonderful materials. What matters is what we choose to do with them. It is not about doing without plastics but doing things differently.”A growing army of environmental campaign groups, such as London-based OneLess, is demanding government action on plastics. Suggestions include clamping down on single-use plastics, such as water bottles and coffee cups, and facilitating recycling. This month has seen political anti-waste initiatives such as one by Theresa May, who promised to tackle “one of the great environmental scourges of our time” with a programme to eliminate plastic waste by 2042, and another by the EU to ensure that every piece of packaging is reusable or recyclable by 2030. Environmentalists say far more urgency is needed.Thompson believes the biggest gains would come from compelling manufacturers to design recyclability into their products, transforming the traditional linear economy (make, use, dispose) into a “circular economy”. Where packaging is essential, it should be simple and easily identifiable, so that recycling plants with automated sorting machinery do not face a perplexing plethora of different materials mixed or bonded together.While the personal-care industry is phasing out microbeads, concern is growing about another ubiquitous micropollutant: plastic fibres. Analysis shows these to be present in streams, rivers, lakes and seas worldwide, as well as household drinking water. Their main source seems to be clothing and textiles made from synthetic fibres, which become detached in washing machines and are not filtered out by water-treatment plants.Mandy Barker is so worried about plastic fibres that she is making them the focus of her next photographic project. Hudson, too, sees them as a greater threat than microbeads: “We have only recently realised that fibres from clothing might be important,” he says, “and there are other issues that are not really on the agenda yet, like plastics washing off roads from road markings and cars.” Even so, Hudson expresses optimism about the prospects for fighting plastic pollution. “Two years ago the whole issue was completely under the radar,” he says. “Now it is on the global agenda and everyone is talking about doing something about it.”If Jennifer Lavers gives a follow-up talk several years from now, she may find a lower barrier of bags surrounding her on stage, as the war on plastic waste takes effect. But it will take decades before plastic debris stops defiling pristine beaches and poisoning marine wildlife. “When I go back to Henderson Island in a few years’ time, I’m afraid the pollution of its beaches will be even worse than today,” she says, “and the same will be true for all the world’s remote islands.”Clive Cookson is the FT’s science editor‘Beyond Drifting: Imperfectly Known Animals’ is published by overlapse.com.

It raised the stakes in the latest battleground for consumers’ wallets.A pledge by the US beverage company, which uses 120bn bottles a year, to collect and recycle the equivalent of all its packaging by 2030 comes as a number of large consumer groups announce commitments to reduce packaging and make more of it recyclable.Makers of everything from crisps and drinks to shampoo and laundry detergent are responding to growing public alarm about pollution as a younger generation, deemed to be more environmentally aware, becomes the biggest spending group. In addition, documentaries by Sir David Attenborough, the British naturalist, and others, have alerted people to the level of plastic in our oceans and its destructive impact on wildlife. The war on plastic is now “part of a marketing plan” for consumer goods companies says Ali Dibadj, analyst with Bernstein. “Millennials in particular are a target of these companies. And millennials are broadly looking for opportunities to do good in the world, not just financially.”Climate change was the number one issue that voters aged 18-28 wanted politicians to prioritise, according to a poll from BrightBlue, a UK centre-right think-tank. In a YouGov poll, 59 per cent of Americans under 35 said they care about how their habits affect the environment, compared with 39 per cent of those age 55 and older.The trend stretches beyond recycling plastic. Brands that promote themselves as “natural” or “green”, such as Seventh Generation, a Vermont maker of plant-based cleaning products, have gained market share in recent years. Unilever last year bought Seventh Generation, a move the Anglo-Dutch group said would help it “meet rising demand for high-quality products with a purpose”. Erik Solheim, executive director of the UN’s environment agency, welcomes companies’ new-found enthusiasm for recycling as a “climb to the top rather than a dive to the bottom”.“Both business and government have been sleepwalking up to now,” he says. “Just a couple of years ago there was very little action on plastic and packaging. Now there’s been a sea change.”If one product is more sustainable than the other, they’ll choose it, but they don’t want to pay more for itMcDonald’s, which last week announced goals to make all of its packaging from renewable or recyclable sources by 2025, says packaging waste is the top environmental issue customers have asked the company to address. Just 10 per cent of McDonald’s restaurants offer recycling, which the world’s largest restaurant chain plans to raise to 100 per cent by 2025.Iceland, the UK grocer, citing the “scourge” of pollution, promised last week to eliminate plastic packaging from its own-brand products by the end of 2023. Evian, the water brand owned by Danone, pledged to make all of its bottles from recycled plastic by 2025. Companies are unveiling these strategies just as governments are stepping up their intervention. Theresa May, the UK prime minister, this month set a target of eliminating avoidable plastic waste by 2042, as part of a 25-year plan to improve the environment. The EU said last week it would ensure plastic packaging within the bloc would be recyclable by 2030.James Quincey, president and chief executive of Coca-Cola, which also aims to make all of its bottles with an average of 50 per cent recycled content by 2030, says the new targets will be an integral part of the company’s business model. He intends to use his trip to the World Economic Forum at Davos this week to encourage other businesses to make similar commitments. “Consumers around the world care about our planet and they want and expect companies to take action,” he says. Unilever, Mars, PepsiCo, Marks and Spencer and Procter & Gamble are among companies that have made similar commitments. Nestlé last year teamed up with rival Danone to help build a greener plastic bottle, made from waste such as sawdust or cardboard. Unilever, which has had a target since 2010 of doubling its sales while halving its environmental footprint, set a goal last year to make the plastic it uses recyclable or reusable by 2025.The maker of Sunsilk shampoo, Axe deodorant and Surf detergent, says 2bn people use a Unilever product every day. It buys 2m tonnes of packaging a year, but says it has managed to cut back, citing a “28 per cent fall in the amount of packaging waste per consumer since 2010”.P&G, whose brands include Tide detergent and Gillette razors, has set a goal of ensuring90 per cent of its packaging is recyclable by 2020, and says it is well on its way. One of the big challenges in converting the remaining 10 per cent is “flexible packaging”, such as the plastic film for paper towel rolls, or small sachets of individually packaged shampoo, says Steve Sikra, director for solid waste management at the US group. This is especially problematic in developing countries, where low-income consumers tend to buy individual sachets of shampoo or soap. To tackle this, P&G is offering discounts and coupons to encourage people to recycle, while also backing investments to build recycling facilities in countries where there are none. “If one product is more sustainable than the other, they’ll choose it, but they don’t want to pay more for it,” says Mr Sikra. “That puts the onus on companies.”John Sauven, of Greenpeace UK, says Coke should be more ambitious, citing Iceland’s 2023 deadline. Ben Jordan, head of environmental policy at Coke, justifies its target date by saying much of the collection “is not within our control”.“The most advanced collection systems typically bring in bottles at the 80 per cent collection rate,” says Mr Jordan. “But you’ve got a large part of the world with very little visible management structures at all.”Coke has not calculated how much investment will be required to meet its goals, but it has spent $2bn over eight years on its last major environmental campaign, water replenishment, according to Mr Jordan. The company made $40bn in annual sales and $6.5bn in profits in 2016. Research in 2015 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charitable groupthat promotes environmentally-friendly business models and a so-called circular economy, found that 40 years after the introduction of the recycling symbol on packaging, only 14 per cent of such packaging was collected and only 2 per cent actually recycled. Rob Opsomer, the foundation’s head of systemic initiatives, says: “Not every company is saying what Coke is and not every company is going far enough, but we’ve seen a significant change from 18 months ago.“There will be greenwashing efforts but we see those big companies are truly changing the way they look at this issue.”A global army of scavengers gathering plastic waste will be key to Coca-Cola to meeting its target of collecting and recycling 100 per cent of its packaging by 2030, writes John Aglionby in Nairobi.Ben Jordan, head of environmental policy at Coke, says so-called informal systems will be one of the pillars of its strategy. The others are government-run and owned infrastructure and industry-owned infrastructure.“More recycling happens where you have a formal infrastructure, whether that’s government- or industry-run,” he says. “But if you look at an apples-to-apples comparison of the percentage of bottles and packaging coming back, [the different systems] are currently equal.“We aren’t going to be collecting those bottles physically in most markets. We’re going to be partnering.”Scavengers will also not be paid a premium to collect Coke bottles, Mr Jordan insists.“In many places there’s enough inherent value in the product for that to be the incentive,” he says. “People make their livelihoods by collecting the highest-value material from the garbage, including from New York City apartments.”He recognises, however, that consumers “need motivation” to recycle. Coke is therefore considering incentives such as scan-and-win programmes, in which consumers will be entered for prize draws when bottles are returned.John Sauven of Greenpeace UK believes Coke’s policy will motivate scavengers. “I don’t have a magic bullet solution but if something has value, and Coke bottles now do, it will be collected.”But Rob Opsomer at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation says a focus on scavengers is not the solution.“The most effective thing to do is for these major companies to positively engage with governments on recycling systems,” he says. “Is the most effective thing really for every company to do its own little thing?”In the longer term companies should “go beyond recycling”, says Mr Opsomer.“It’s absolutely critical we recycle the packaging; it’s more critical we reduce the packaging we’re putting into the market in the first place,” he says. “Can we get products to people without using all this single-use packaging?”"
98;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-19T17:42:12Z;Coca-Cola joins push to cut plastic waste;Beverage giant, which uses 120bn bottles a year, pledges to step up recycling effort;Coca-Cola has pledged to tackle a global “packaging problem” by cutting waste, as consumer giants intensify efforts to address the issue of plastic contaminating oceans.The beverage company, which uses 120bn bottles a year, says it will collect and recycle the equivalent of all its packaging by 2030. It will also aim to make all of its packaging with an average of 50 per cent recycled content by the same date.“If left unchecked, plastic waste will slowly choke our oceans and waterways,” James Quincey, Coke’s chief executive, wrote in a blog post. “We’re using up our earth as if there’s another one on the shelf just waiting to be opened . . . companies have to do their part by making sure their packaging is actually recyclable.”Currently, recycled material accounts for less than 10 per cent of the company’s plastic bottles, compared to nearly 50 per cent for cans. Coke said it would invest in developing better packaging, adding that the initiatives “could lead to cost savings”.It will also be experimenting with different collection techniques for recycling its products, including backing government and industry efforts and building networks of “scavengers” in some markets.Europe produces 25m tonnes of plastic waste annually, of which two-thirds is used in packaging. In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastics thrown away each year would fill the Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times over, Theresa May said this week. Governments have stepped up their intervention. The EU this week called to make all packaging in the bloc recyclable by 2030, while Theresa May earlier this month promised to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 to tackle “one of the great environmental scourges of our time”. The world’s largest maker of fizzy drinks is setting more ambitious targets as its peers in the consumer goods industry also move to address the plastic problem. McDonald’s this week said it would make all of its packaging from renewable or recyclable sources by 2025. Also this week, UK grocer Iceland, citing the “scourge” of pollution, promised to eliminate plastic packaging from its own-brand products by the end of 2023. Danone-owned Evian pledged to make all of its plastic bottles from only recycled plastic by 2025. Unilever, Mars, PepsiCo, Marks and Spencer, and Procter & Gamble have made similar commitments. Coke has been restructuring itself to focus on building brands rather than the low-margin bottling business of its drinks. The company targets $3.8bn in cost savings by 2019.The Atlanta-based company earlier this month overhauled its no-calorie Diet Coke with four new flavours, in a bid to win over millennials and consumers opting for more natural-sounding choices. 
99;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-18T11:57:24Z;In defence of plastics;The material, in and out of favour for years, was once the hero of the age;There can be no doubt that we have fallen completely out of love with plastics. UK environment secretary Michael Gove’s war on plastics and the EU’s recent announcement that it will make all plastics produced in the bloc recyclable by 2030 have made that official. Emotive images of distressed sea life and of disgusting plastic debris washed up on our shores are beamed daily into our living rooms. Combined with vociferous campaigns in the media about the evils of plastic coffee cups, straws and packaging, they have helped to reinforce our firm belief that plastics are enemy number one where the environment is concerned. And, of course, they are.And yet it is worth remembering that, although plastics have been going in and out of favour for many years, there have been times when they were the heroes of the age. In the 19th century, plastics brought the excitement of possessing goods within the reach of nearly everyone. Standing in for semi-precious materials — jet, amber, jade and ivory among them — early plastics made it possible for many more people to indulge in luxury goods than would otherwise have been the case. As well as democratising the thrill of wearing glamorous jewellery, playing billiards would not have been the same in the late 19th century as the balls were made of celluloid — despite being highly combustible.Jump to the early 20th century and the close relationship between plastics, mass production and new technologies was strongly reinforced. Bakelite made electric plugs possible and quickly became the material of choice to clothe new high-tech goods such as radios and gramophones, transforming them from items of furniture into symbols of the modern age. Indeed, a couple of decades later, the French cultural critic Roland Barthes celebrated the magical qualities of plastics, referring to them as the “stuff of alchemy”.But it was in the years after 1945 that plastics met high culture and coincided with the democratic ideals underpinning the “good design for everyone” movement. The most progressive implementation of that ideal took place in Italy, where such mundane products as lemon squeezers and waste bins suddenly aspired to the status of art objects, so sleek were their sculptural forms and so vibrant their colours. Working with the designer Gino Colombini, the company Kartell was at the forefront of the campaign, while plastics manufacturing techniques were soon enhanced to make it possible to create the all-plastic chair. Colourful examples were created by Italian designers Cesare “Joe” Colombo, Vico Magistretti and others. Stylish additions to both the interior and exterior landscapes, they sat like jewels in chic, modern living rooms and outside fashionable cafés.And then it all went wrong. The oil crisis of the early 1970s meant that while plastics were still cheerful, they were no longer cheap. The environmental movement gained traction at the same time and plastics’ cost, combined with the problem of their disposal, stripped them of their democratising potential and their links to the utopian concept of modern design. All was not lost, however, as a handful of innovative designs showed that plastics could be recycled and still form the basis for equally beautiful objects.Fast forward to the present and the EU’s commitment to making all plastics recyclable. Perhaps it should be less about hating plastics and more about making them work for us. No one would want to challenge the current concern for the detrimental effects of plastics on the environment. Perhaps, though, taking note of how easily yesterday’s friend can become today and tomorrow’s enemy, we should focus less on the negative, become more inventive and look to our designers to reimagine the possibilities of recycled plastics. They have done it before.The writer is professor of design history at Kingston University and the author of ‘The Plastics Age’
100;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-16T17:03:36Z;EU wants all plastic waste to be recyclable by 2030;Funds offered for innovation to improve reuse but tax seen as complicated;Brussels wants to create an EU market for waste plastic and make all such packaging in the bloc recyclable by 2030 to encourage a so-called circular economy.Jyrki Katainen, the European Commission’s vice-president for jobs and growth, said only 6 per cent of plastics in the bloc were recycled and that common quality standards would increase the amount of material that industry could reuse. “We don't have well-functioning plastic waste markets, [because] the quality standards are different and the supply of recycled plastic is smaller than it could be,” he said.The commission promised €100m for new technologies and innovations and restrictions on so-called microplastics, under 5mm. It will also propose ways to cut down on single-use plastic items. It expects to make legally binding proposals to the parliament and member states in May. Mr Katainen said a plastics tax, raised last week by Günther Oettinger, the budget commissioner, was a “fascinating idea” and was being considered but would be “quite complicated” to implement.Europe produces 25m tonnes of plastic waste annually, of which two-thirds is used in packaging. Only 5 per cent of the value of the output was recovered so between €70bn and €105bn was lost to the economy every year, Mr Katainen said.The strategy published on Tuesday builds on a binding EU target that by 2030 the bloc must recycle 55 per cent of plastic packaging, up from 30 per cent today.This rate is expected to drop after China banned imports of plastic waste, meaning the bloc may be forced to incinerate or dump plastic. Beijing’s import ban created “a positive crisis coming on global plastic markets” and “an excellent opportunity to create a single market for secondary plastic and plastic waste”, Mr Katainen said.Environmental organisations welcomed the EU strategy as a good first step but highlighted the need for the bloc to binding targets. Delphine Lévi Alvarès, of the Rethink Plastic Alliance, said laws were needed “to drastically reduce the consumption of both single-use plastic items and packaging within this commission’s term”. The EU plastics sector generated €350bn of sales in 2015 and employed 1.5m people.
101;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-15T04:21:40Z;China recyclers grind to halt amid crackdown on imported waste;Plastic piles up in US and Europe as Beijing takes a harder line on pollution;For years the smell of melted plastic permeated the Chinese village of Luwang, where dozens of workshops processed imported waste. Now the village is relatively odourless, caught up in a crackdown on recycling of imported plastic that is causing waste to pile up at ports in the US and Europe.“We used to import plastic rubbish from Britain . . . but now customs won’t let it in,” said Zheng Min, who was guarding the village’s government office in east China’s Shandong province. Government inspectors swept through the village last May, he added, shuttering its recycling companies.“All our development has been dependent on plastic. Some people made millions from recycling and developed large companies. Now it’s all gone. I never expected the government to take such measures,” he added.This month China began enforcing rules banning the import of 24 grades of solid waste, including mixed paper and plastics. The country imported more than 7m tonnes of plastic scrap in 2016, according to the China Scrap Plastic Association, accounting for more than half of all the waste plastic exported globally that year.Due to a lack of recycling capacity, “low-end plastic items still have no alternative outlet other than landfills and incineration in [many] exporting countries”, said CSPA president Steve Wong in a statement.Britain alone has shipped 2.7m tonnes of plastic waste to China since 2012, according to Greenpeace, the environmental campaign group, with British officials admitting that there was no alternative market for such a high volume of waste.Some US companies would have no choice but to let waste pile up in American warehouses or car parks because alternative markets for recyclables such as Indonesia were still “nascent”, said the US National Waste & Recycling Association, a trade group.The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery said about a third of the recyclables collected in the state had been exported to foreign markets, with most going to China.The ban on imports and the closure of small plastic processors in places such as Luwang is a reflection of Beijing’s harder line on pollution, and the fact China is generating more plastic waste itself, reducing the need for imports.But domestic waste comprises only a quarter of recycled inputs to China’s domestic plastic industry, meaning companies will face a shortfall in supply, potentially pushing up prices, according to the CSPA. As a result China’s larger recycling companies are in the process of moving production to Southeast Asia.In Luwang, described as a “scrap collector’s paradise” in Chinese media and where villagers have been processing waste for three decades, recycling yards lay silent and empty behind locked gates and most working-age locals have left the village.The local government paid villagers a subsidy worth 30 per cent of the cost of their equipment in return for closing, said Mr Zheng.“Those who had their own businesses before, now have to leave the village to find paid work. They will earn Rmb2,000-Rmb3,000 ($310-$465) a month, compared with Rmb5,000-Rmb10,000 a month before,” he added.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson and Gregory Meyer in New York
102;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-10T22:34:40Z;Theresa May targets plastics in war on ‘throwaway culture’;Tories recast green goals with crackdown on ‘scourge’ of avoidable waste;Theresa May has vowed to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042 as part of a UK government crackdown on disposable items that are damaging the environment.The prime minister will on Thursday use her first high-profile speech of the new year to urge supermarkets to introduce plastic-free aisles — with non-packaged items — as she sets out the Conservative party’s 25-year plan to improve the environment.The government is to “take action at every stage of the production and consumption of plastic”, she will say. It will also announce a consultation on “single-use” products that could see consumers face new taxes on takeaway food packaging, including disposable coffee cups.Plans to extend the 5p plastic bag charge to all high street shops in England as part of an effort to tackle the “throwaway culture” will be confirmed.Mrs May will describe the issue as “one of the great environmental scourges of our time”.“We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals, untreated, into rivers was ever the right thing to do,” she will say.“In years to come, I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly.”In the UK alone, the sum of single-use plastics thrown away each year would fill the Royal Albert Hall 1,000 times over, the prime minister will claim.2042Year by which Mrs May intends to have eliminated all avoidable plastic wasteThe Conservatives are keen to boost their environmental credentials after their poor performance in last year’s general election, in which large numbers of younger voters who back green causes voted for the Labour party. Recent polling commissioned by Bright Blue, a centre-right think-tank, found that climate change was the issue that voters between the ages of 18 and 28 wanted politicians to prioritise.Sam Hall, senior research fellow at Bright Blue, said: “Increasing public concern about the environment in part reflects the UK’s changing demographics, with polling showing that younger people tend to be more supportive of green policies.“But it also reflects the fact that the environment and the economy are not in opposition, as ever cheaper clean technologies and sustainable, efficient business models are now major drivers of economic prosperity.”Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, rejected the received wisdom that people cared about the environment only when “everything else is fine”.“Despite the Brexit turmoil and growing worries about the economy, public concerns about the environment seem more mainstream than ever before,” he said.The government’s new 25-year target comes seven years after David Cameron’s coalition published a white paper setting out its ambition to be “the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than it inherited”.Mrs May will pledge £10m for education programmes, and confirm that the UK’s international development budget will be used to help developing countries reduce plastic waste and establish protected “blue belt” marine areas.Polling [shows] that younger people tend to be more supportive of green policiesEnvironmental groups broadly welcomed the message but said the government had missed an opportunity to introduce deposit return schemes for plastic water bottles.Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “The most glaring gap is support for deposit return schemes. These are tried and tested ways to keep plastic bottles out of the environment and have strong public backing, yet there’s no trace of them in the government announcement.”The proposals were sharply criticised by Labour, which said the Conservatives’ “environmental record is one of failure and broken promises”.Sue Hayman, shadow environment secretary, said: “They have cut support for renewables, put us on course to miss climate targets, voted against key environmental protections and allowed air pollution to escalate into a public health emergency on their watch.“This plan, years behind schedule, is a cynical attempt at rebranding the Tories’ image and appears to contain only weak proposals with Britain’s plastic waste crisis kicked into the long grass.”
103;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-09T20:15:03Z;All shops set to charge for plastic bags;England to follow Wales and Scotland in extending 5p scheme under new plan;Thousands of small retailers in England could be forced to charge 5p for plastic bags under government plans to tackle Britain’s “throwaway culture”.Under a scheme first introduced in 2015, all retailers in England with more than 250 workers are legally required to charge at least 5p for plastic bags, and donate extra proceeds to charitable causes.On Thursday, the government will announce plans to consider extending the current policy to all high street shops in England. All retailers in Scotland and Wales are already required to charge 5p for plastic bags.In England, the added 5p charge reduced the use of plastic bags by more than 80 per cent in the first year it was implemented by large retailers.Last year, Tesco stopped selling 5p carrier bags and instead started selling a “bag for life” — made from 94 per cent recycled plastic — at a cost of 10p per bag.James Lowman, chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said the 5p carrier bag charge was an effective way of significantly reducing the number of bags in circulation.“We have long campaigned for the charge to be extended to all retailers in England, as is already the case in Scotland and Wales, and would welcome steps to make the charge universal,” he said.Addressing ministers in cabinet on Tuesday morning, Michael Gove praised the 5p charge. The UK environment secretary, who arrived at the meeting with a reusable coffee mug, said the government was “determined to tackle the throwaway culture which plastics encapsulate”.Theresa May, prime minister, is expected to call for an end to the “profligate” use of natural resources in a speech later this week, as she sets out the government’s 25-year plan to improve the environment.Mrs May told the cabinet on Tuesday that the government had “a clear belief in conserving what is good and standing up against the profligate use of resources, whether that is public money or natural resources”.The prime minister’s spokesman said she had assured colleagues that the 25-year plan would send “a strong message to the public about the government’s commitment to be the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better state than it inherited”.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mrs May said: “People often think about environment issues and wonder whether the government can have an impact on that.“If you just look at one thing that we’ve done, in 2015 we introduced the 5p charge on carrier bags, on plastic bags. Actually we now see nine billion fewer plastic bags being used. It’s making a real difference.”A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “We are taking significant steps to tackle plastic waste, taking nine billion plastic bags out of circulation with our carrier bag charge and introducing a ban on plastic microbeads.“Our latest figures show the 5p plastic bag charge has been an enormous success in changing consumer behaviour by reducing use by 83 per cent.”
104;WM;Waste Management;2018-01-08T05:00:30Z;Europe’s half a million landfill sites potentially worth a fortune;Waste can now be mined for metals and to create fuel;In a village 60 miles east of Brussels, a Belgian company is fighting to launch an experiment with the future of rubbish disposal. Group Machiels, a waste management company, wants to excavate millions of tons of decades-old waste buried in one of Europe’s largest landfills and turn it into renewable energy and building materials.“The sheer number of landfills in Europe is mind-boggling,” says Rolf Stein, chief executive of Advanced Plasma Power, which manufactures the technology that Machiels plans to use at the Remo landfill site. “Why do we need to dig deep into the depths of South Africa and South America and Australia to get crude oil when you have got [waste] materials here not far below the ground [that can be repurposed for energy]?”People have been mining waste from landfills to recover materials or remove pollutants since at least 1953. Now, however, there is a growing body of researchers and businesses like Machiels that want to go further and do “enhanced landfill mining”. They see rubbish as an untapped resource and want to create a business model that would turn landfills into the parks and housing developments of the future.The Remo site plans to use a technology called plasma, which heats waste to high temperatures and turns it into a renewable gas. Plasma is already used in several locations around the world to convert new waste into energy, without it needing to go to a landfill. With existing landfill sites waste can be pulled out and filtered for metals and recyclable materials. The remaining material is gasified into a fuel, and the residues from this process are converted into “plasmarok”, which can be used as a building material.If successful, enhanced landfill mining could recycle millions of pounds’ worth of metals and generate fuel for use in cars, homes and industrial plants.“If Remo demonstrates it could be possible, then people would start taking [the potential of landfill mining] seriously,” says Stuart Wagland, an energy lecturer at Cranfield University, researching converting buried plastics into oil and gas through thermal treatment.Enhanced landfill mining for energy sources has been trialled in some other countries, including the US, but remains uncommon and at an early stage of development.There are more than half a million landfills around Europe, according to estimates by Eurelco, a landfill mining consortium. Inside Remo, there are more than 18 million tonnes of waste. Machiels wants to recover half for building materials and half as energy, which could provide power for 200,000 homes over the next 20 years, before turning the site into a nature park.“Don’t waste the waste” is their motto, says Yves Tielemans, who manages the group’s landfill mining project.Machiels also owns landfills in Chile and would look to mine their contents, too, if the Belgian effort is successful.Keeping rubbish in the ground has an environmental and financial cost, says Mr Wagland. Sites have to be monitored to avoid contaminants from rubbish leaking into groundwater, and they also give off greenhouse gases, such as methane.Mr Wagland says that he expects to see an uptake “in the next five years” in Europe of enhanced landfill mining. He looked at four sites in the UK and found they contained significant stores of industrial metals like aluminium, copper and lithium, the demand for which has increased dramatically over the past few years. “What we need is government support to be able to do a demonstration of this — and show that it can be done.”Local communities may take some convincing about landfill mining projects. Machiels is currently involved in a legal battle at the Belgian high court, following opposition from some local residents.They hope to have an answer on whether they can go ahead by next year.Maurice Ballard, head of the local residents’ association, says that he and most locals now support the technology in principle, but some remain fearful that the mining process will affect their quality of life and local environment.“If all precautions are taken, I think this technology must have the chance to be installed,” he says. “Because we cannot afford any more to leave all those raw materials in landfills and import material from foreign countries — that time is over.”He adds that it’s not just about the technology: “The arguments [of the residents that oppose this] are not based on scientific information but on emotional information. They don’t want to see landfills reopened and they are scared that they will live in an area with dust and stench and traffic.”“Wherever we go in Europe, [including in Belgium] we are struggling to get the social licence to operate,” says Peter Tom Jones, president of Eurelco. “[At Remo] this is leading to major delays — that’s in a way very sad because the environmental credentials have been proven.”If Remo gets approval, other businesses will be watching to see if extracting and repurposing waste can be sufficiently profitable to give investors a return.Machiels is confident that the economics will work in the case of Remo, but each landfill site will be different, depending on their contents. Mr Wagland estimates that about 25 per cent of Europe’s landfills could be profitably mined.“We are still at the stage where researchers are showing the benefits from a technology perspective,” says Mr Jones. “But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating: Eventually you need to convince investors to invest in landfill mining in general — this is not happening yet.”We asked readers, researchers and FT journalists to submit ideas with the potential to change the world. A panel of judges selected the 50 ideas worth looking at in more detail. This second tranche of 10 ideas (listed below) is about meeting growing needs for energy and resources. The next 10 ideas, looking at ways to change education and information management, will be published on February 5, 2018.
105;WM;Waste Management;2017-12-13T04:00:31Z;Plastics ban set to frustrate recycling exporters;Councils and industry face dealing with waste no longer bound for China;A ban from Beijing on importing low-grade waste will affect roughly half the plastic that the UK currently sends to China for recycling, according to the waste industry.Britain has become dependent on China for low-cost recycling to meet its environmental targets and has shipped 2.7m tons of plastic waste to China and Hong Kong since 2012, according to a report by Greenpeace, the environmental campaign group.But in July, China told the World Trade Organization that it intended to halt the import of 24 grades of plastic, textiles and paper, which it said were often contaminated with dirty or hazardous material. Plastics, including PVC and polyethylene, will be covered by the ban, as well as mixed batches of paper and cardboard.The consequences could be dramatic both for waste companies and local councils, according to the minutes of a meeting in September between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and representatives of the industry.The exchanges, obtained through a freedom of information request by Greenpeace, show that as much as 50 per cent of plastic waste exports will not meet China’s new criteria.“Tonnages involved would be in the region of 70,000 to 80,000 per quarter of plastic packaged waste . . . No alternative markets are available for these quantities of waste . . . Storage levels within the UK will become tight quickly,” according to a handout from Defra circulated at the meeting.In an email thread between the meeting’s attendees, released as part of the FOI, an employee of IWPP, a paper waste disposal company, said: “I simply cannot stress enough the impact this will have on the industry supply chain if these changes are brought in their current form.”In the same thread, an employee of 360 Environmental, a waste consultancy company, claimed that the UK exported 264,729 tonnes of plastic to China last year, more than a third of total plastic exports.That waste may now need to be “landfilled, incinerated or stockpiled here”, said Libby Peake, senior policy adviser for think-tank Green Alliance.Adam Read, a spokesman for Suez, a waste processing company with 70 local authority clients, said: “Over decades, market forces have pushed re-processing activity to Asia, but we are now seeing the tap can be turned off.“The changes in China should be a wake-up call for the UK government to re-shore this valuable activity by setting clear, high-reaching sustainability ambitions that closely align industrial and environmental policy.”Suez, whose clients include the cities of Bristol and Aberdeen, has been exporting to alternative EU and Asian markets since April as well as exploring the possibility of using the material for fuel and chemical production, he added.Some companies, such as Veolia, which manages the waste of local authorities including Haringey and Birmingham, already process all the recycling they collect in the UK and Europe.Local councils are already trying to adapt. Local authorities in Norfolk, which collectively send 38,000 tonnes of material to Asia each year, said they were altering the way they sorted their materials in an effort to meet the new Chinese grading requirements and had invested £8 million over the past ten years in their systems.Other key destinations for UK recycling exports are Vietnam, which imported 32,000 tonnes of plastic waste last year, and India, which imported the same amount over the same period, according to Greenpeace research.Ms Peake of Green Alliance added: “In the short term, other markets, including Vietnam and India, will be able to pick up some of the slack, but these will soon be saturated and, in the long term, these countries also will not want to be saddled with poor quality material.”Defra said: “We are continuing to work with the waste industry and the Environment Agency to understand the impact across the sector of the Chinese government’s proposed restrictions on waste imports.“We are also looking at ways to process more of our recycling at home as part of our resources and waste strategy.”The UK announced in last month’s Budget a review of taxes or charges on single-use plastics such as takeaway cartons and packaging in a bid to reduce the impact of such waste on marine life, a problem highlighted in the BBC programme Blue Planet.Meanwhile, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is reviewing the potential use of a deposit return scheme for bottles, and this week called for the aid department to increase spending on cutting plastic pollution in oceans.The consequences of the new ban are already being felt. There have been 39 arrests so far in China for attempts to import illegal waste, while in Hong Kong, paper waste is being piled up in the streets because it can no longer be taken to the Chinese mainland.
106;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
107;WM;Waste Management;2017-12-04T11:24:11Z;The costs of nuclear secrecy;;The identification by external monitoring centres of an unexpected concentration of nuclear-related material in the air above Khazkhstan and across the region at the end of September was initially denied by the local and Russian authorities but has now been partially admitted in a statement from Roshydromet, the agency responsible for monitoring radiation in Russia. However, the source of the emission of ruthenium 106 ( a radioactive form of the rare heavy metal) has not been explained.Given the history of the region, the absence of an explanation can only undermine confidence at a time in the industry when the future of nuclear power is already in doubt because of its cost. The authorities that control the plant at Mayak, owned by the Russian state company Rosatom, should come clean, and allow open international scrutiny.Secrecy is the enemy of trust, and no part of the energy system is more vulnerable to both secrecy and mistrust than nuclear power. Never mind that nuclear is safer measured by output against the number of people killed or seriously injured than any other form of energy supply. Never mind that the levels of protection around nuclear facilities are many times greater, and more expensive than for any oil or gas operation. The distrust remains and is compounded by each new incident.The Mayak facility in the southern Urals was built in the late 1940s as part of the Soviet programme to match American nuclear capability. The area subsequently became a centre of reprocessing and of civil nuclear power. Environmental protection was not, to put it mildly, the top priority. No waste disposal facility was built until 1953, with even high level waste initially simply being dumped into local rivers and Lake Kyzyltash.In 1957 a radioactive waste container exploded at the site near Kyshtym – an accident judged by some to be among the three most serious in the world’s nuclear industry.The shocking thing about the Kyshtym disaster is not just that it happened but that no one was told. Some of the local community were temporarily evacuated but soon returned to their homes and were apparently told that there were no risks. No report of the incident was published until a paper was published by the New Scientist in 1975. Even then the story was initially denied by the Soviet authorities. The full truth is probably still not known.Ruthenium 106 is not highly dangerous – although the French authorities have said if a leak on this scale had occurred in their country local communities would have been evacuated immediately.The problem is that we not know the cause of the latest leak or the condition of the whole complex of facilities around Mayak. The area is closed – one of network of closed cities created by the Soviet authorities in the 1950s and 60s. The partial news about what happened is only emerging because emissions from the leak or explosion or whatever happened were so substantial that they could be monitored from outside the country.The incident matters for two reasons. First, nuclear power remains a significant source of energy supply across Europe. Even if no new nuclear stations are built because the costs are too high, dozens of old stations will remain operational for many years. Most are well managed but some are showing signs of ageing.Second, and even more important, the earth’s atmosphere does not recognise national borders. The impact of an accident soon spreads. Europe is close to the former Soviet states, many of which contain nuclear facilities built decades ago. Are they safe? In many cases we cannot know because, like Mayak, they are closed.Secrecy in the nuclear business is not limited to the Russians, of course. EDF will not tell us what has gone wrong at Flamanville, their flagship new nuclear plant in northern France which is years behind schedule and billions of euros over budget. At Sellafield, the UK’s major centre of nuclear activity, there is still a culture of secrecy.The nuclear industry does not seem to realise the damage this does.The modern nuclear industry, including companies such as Rosatom, is highly professional in most respects, but not in communication. Overall, the safety record is good. But distrust creates a competitive disadvantage for the whole business. Without full and open information the inevitable regulatory response to each concern is to add more rules and more costs.That is why the industry is in relative decline in Europe and the US and recovering very slowly in Japan. It is growing only in areas such as China, where public scrutiny is limited or ineffective, but in an internet age even the most oppressive regimes cannot impose a blanket of silence when things go wrong.Nuclear power ought to be have a significant role in the global energy mix. But it will only achieve that potential if the industry changes its ways.
108;WM;Waste Management;2017-11-22T08:49:03Z;Opening Quote: Thomas Cook’s margins go south;;Thomas Cook, the FTSE 250 tour operator, has been offering so-called Black Friday discounts a few days early, according to tabloid newspaper bargain hunters. And, given every Friday from now until May is forecast to be largely black from 3:00pm to the following 2.55pm, one can see the appeal of £200 off a sunshine break. But such early price cutting is normally a warning sign, according to broadsheet newspaper profit-warning hunters. So does it mean red ink, rather black, for the company?Not so, Thomas Cook said this morning, as full-year revenues showed good growth: rising 9 per cent to £9bn on a like-for-like basis, adjusted for foreign exchange – against analyst estimates of £8.5bn.And it says the outlook for holiday bookings to the Middle East and North Africa has continued to recover, reporting “good growth to Turkey and Egypt” despite terrorism worries depressing sales in recent years. Thomas Cook has also added some new routes to its airline operations following the collapse of rival Monarch earlier this year.As a result, underlying earnings rose by £24m, or 8 per cent, to £330m. Thomas Cook put it down to increased customer demand and customer satisfaction. Performance was strongest in the group’s Continental Europe and Nordic divisions.However, competition in the UK is taking its toll – and perhaps explains those Black Friday offers.After four consecutive years of profit growth, margins in the UK business declined due to a tougher pricing environment, especially for holidays to Spain. Overall, the full-year gross margin fell by 1.3 percentage points to 22.1 per cent.Thomas Cook has work to do here, and it had already implemented plans to return the UK tour operator business to “its former profitable growth trajectory”. HSBC analysts recently calculated that even a 50 basis points improvement in margin has the potential to increase earnings per share by more than 5 per cent in FY2019.Still, analysts seem to have packed their sunglasses already. This week, Panmure Gordon ditched its “sell” rating on Thomas Cook shares. Earlier, HSBC initiated its coverage of the group with a ‘buy’ – arguing that is the “recovery/ value play” in the sector trading at a near 50 per cent discount to its rivals.Biffa, the waste management group, sets it horizons a little lower: its idea of a picture postcard landscape features more energy from waste plants.At a recent analyst session for the launch of its review of UK waste industry – called “The Reality Gap” – management repeated that it sees a continuing need for EfW plants in the UK. And this morning , Biffa said its EfW project feasibility assessments were “progressing as planned”. More news will be given in its annual results, next year.Its half year results also showed a strong performance in line with expectations, as net revenue rose 8 per cent to £482m.Underlying earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation therefore rose 7 per cent to £76m – ahead of Peel Hunt forecasts of £71m-£72m.That leaves the group’s shares trading on 6.5x FY2018E EV/EBITDA multiple.And, finally, in Westminster today, a dull grey-haired man in a grey suit is expected to stand up, speak for 53 minutes, take three sips of water, use the word ‘million’ 28 times, make four references to ‘student loans’, promise 300,000 new homes, reduce the stamp duty charged for buying them, bemoan the UK’s useless productivity, attempt to avoid a Brexit economic “cliff edge”, and later be sacked by his boss.

109;WM;Waste Management;2017-10-10T04:01:24Z;My First Million — Jacqueline O’Donovan, waste disposal tycoon;Work was my escape from postnatal depression;"Jacqueline O’Donovan, 49, has achieved recognition in a male-dominated industry — construction waste. In 1990 she became managing director of O’Donovan Waste Disposal Ltd, based in Tottenham, North London, after restructuring the business to continue the legacy of her father Joe, who founded it in 1959.Ms O’Donovan left school at 16 and a few months later her father died, leaving her and three older siblings with the task of scaling down and running the business. When she took on the company at 19, turnover was £175,000. By 2016, that had risen to £19m, while the 12-strong workforce of 1988 has today expanded to 160.Did you think you would get to where you are?
No, I did not, because I was not academic. I left school with O-levels in maths, art and child development, and thought that I would be a childminder. My father’s death at 51 left us in shock and turmoil, and for a while I looked after my mother. As she slowly recovered, I would spend the odd day in the office, which later became six days a week. I had to learn as I went along, taking night courses on road haulage and waste management.I still cannot believe it when people recognise me in the street from The Interview, on Channel 4 last year, when I was looking for a business manager. If my father had not died so young I would have married in my early 20s, had a large family and stayed at home.When you had made your first £1m did you want to slow down?
We made our first £1m profit in June 2015. I did not buy champagne because I don’t drink, but I did announce it to the family, who were ecstatic. It was a “wow” moment for us and confirmation that our hard work had paid off.Born

In North London with her mother and son, Joseph, 18The figure was not about the money, but the achievement, bearing in mind that a lot of people assumed that when Dad died the business would go with him. I am driven, but I did not recognise it until recent years. I could not possibly slow down, because I have not fulfilled my vision yet. When I think I have made it I am going to buy myself something extravagant, probably a Boodles ring.What is the secret of your success?
It is keeping our feet firmly on the ground, and remembering that six of us lived in a one-bedroom flat in Kilburn until I was five years old. If we had not all pulled together from the time of my father’s death …I don’t think it would have worked. We trust each other implicitly. My brother Michael is chief executive. He purchases the assets and looks after the demolition arm of the company. Anthony and Caroline are operations directors. My sister is in charge of skip hire, and Anthony oversees our five depots.What was your best preparation for business?
It was being exposed to my father’s business from the age of 11. I socialised with the workers, I listened to their conversations, observed how my father operated, and saw the paperwork. When I actually had to go in and get down to it, I was familiar with the surroundings. My dad used to give me pocket money for cleaning his office.Do you have time for personal financial planning?
I see my financial adviser from St James’s Place four times a year. He tells me what stage my investments are at and offers suggestions. I make the decisions and don’t see him for another three months. He was recommended by my compliance director three years ago. I invest in premium bonds, unit trusts, Isas, and currency. My PA, Bríanán, deals with my household finances. I have no time for it.What is your basic business philosophy?
I consider the staff as our biggest asset, not the depots or the vehicles. We have a very low staff turnover, and many have been with us for years. I am heavily involved with training. Having left school myself with few qualifications I have always wanted to help others excel.Our logistics supervisor, who came from the Army and joined us 20 years ago as an HGV driver, has taken numerous courses to expand his knowledge of the field and the industry. An Albanian worker with very little English and no qualifications joined us 15 years ago. He is now a waste supervisor, overseeing more than 40 staff.What was the most challenging period of your career?
When I had my son just over 18 years ago, I suffered postnatal depression, which ended my marriage. We did not have the technology of today, so the only way to continue working was to go into the office for a few hours a day. I did not feel totally myself again until four years later, by which time my condition had slowly resolved itself, without medical intervention. Without doubt, the work was my escape.Do you want to carry on till you drop?
Yes, I do. I am not the type of person who lunches or enjoys shopping. The business is my life and my passion. In 10 years’ time I would like to have doubled the size of the fleet and gone nationwide with the depots, and diversified into clinical waste and hazardous waste. Our current focus is construction and demolition waste. There are a lot of people in this industry but I don’t think they come anywhere near us in terms of service, compliance and road safety.Have you made any pension provision?
Yes, I have a pension because I knew my father had one, so I assumed it was a good idea, and joined a scheme when I was 20. Eight years ago I converted my pension to a Sipp [self-invested personal pension] that I use to acquire commercial property across the UK and Scotland. This should hopefully increase the final payout.Do you believe in giving something back to the community?
Very much so. We support and sponsor numerous charities, fun days and community school events. A team of us will take a heavy goods vehicle to a school, where I explain my journey and my passion for road safety. We make young people aware of the dangers of HGVs.Between 2014 and 2015, 58 per cent of cyclist fatalities and 23 per cent of pedestrian fatalities in London involved an HGV. Our team allows the children to sit inside the lorry to see how it works, and identifies the driver’s blind spots, because I believe education is key.I have been part of a working group liaising with the manufacturers to improve the design of the lorry cab. In March 2016, we were the first UK company to buy direct vision skip-loaders, where the passenger door is fully glazed, exactly like a bus door. That means the driver has a clear view of what is on his near side. The whole vehicle sits lower on the road so the driver can make eye contact with cyclists.Do you allow yourself the odd indulgence?
I like nice holidays, especially in Dubai, where anything you want is brought to you. I hate shopping, but I do buy the odd handbag and shoes to match.Do you believe in leaving everything to family?
I believe charity begins at home. I have done so much work for good causes in my lifetime, I would expect my son to choose his own charities and follow my example, but I will also remember my wider family and my friends. I am out four nights a week at charity events that either I personally endorse or the company does. The cause closest to my heart is RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, founded in 1992.Your most prudent investment?
Three years ago, during the crisis in the Spanish economy when British expats were leaving in droves, I bought a property near Estepona. It is a three-bedroom apartment that overlooks the sea. I only bought it because the pound was worth €1.40. I paid the equivalent of £260,000, and it is now worth £650,000. I let my family and friends use it, but for me it is primarily an investment.How have you survived the recession?
We were affected along with the construction industry, so I cut back wherever I could. I was scrutinising every area of expenditure, even diesel use. Anyone who wanted a pen had to come to me for it, and we stopped using first class postage. I did not make anyone redundant, but when people left or retired I did not replace them, so everybody had to work longer hours. Turnover went down by 15 per cent, but ironically our profits went up, because I had streamlined everything and there was no wastage."
110;WM;Waste Management;2017-09-07T07:05:44Z;"Opening Quote: Ashmore’s rewards; Bovis rebuilds; Biffa cleans up";;Ashmore’s shareholders have always had to accept there is little it can do about the external environment. As an emerging markets fund manager, it is at the mercy of market sentiment. So those investors have endured share price falls on Donald Trump’s election to the US presidency and fears of protectionist trade measures, concerns over Chinese economic growth, and persistently low oil prices. But finally, this year, they have seen net inflows into Ashmore’s funds for the first time since 2014. And this morning’s full year results reward their patience.Full-year inflows of $1.9bn plus positive market performance of $4.2bn mean assets under management have now reached $58.7bn, delivering net revenue of £258m – an increase of 11 per cent year-on-year. Net management fees came in at £222m, up 13 per cent, against a Barclays forecast of £230m. A stronger US dollar against sterling more than offset a reduction in the aggregate net management fee margin from 55 basis points to 52.With Ashmore’s overall margin rising from 62 to 65 per cent – based on earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation – that generated 23.7p of earnings per share against a UBS estimate of of 22.9p – an increase of 31 year- per cent on-year.So, now, the question is how long can sentiment remain this positive, and how much can Ashmore benefit while it does?Its outlook statement suggested “recovery has further to go”, as “there remains substantial value available across the emerging markets asset classes, in absolute terms but also relative to developed world assets”.Chief executive Mark Coombs noted that clients should be looking to invest more in these assets:Ashmore’s focused strategy means it is in a strong position to continue to deliver superior investment performance and to benefit as investors raise their allocations to Emerging Markets from underweight levels.Bovis Homes shareholders, by complete contrast, have to hope that there is lots it can do to improve its customers’ internal environments – and exploit a benign external environment. As a UK housebuilder, it has been at the mercy of negative customer sentiment towards its unfinished cement. So its investors have had to endure share price falls as the company compensated homebuyers for shoddy build quality.But, finally, it has an incoming chief executive willing to tackle these problems. Greg Fitzgerald. former chairman of rival builder Galliford Try, said this morning that the first half of 2017 has had to be “a period of stabilisation and strategic reorganisation”.Since he started, in April, he has visited nearly 100 Bovis developments to devise a new strategy of much more disciplined volume growth – as it was a rush to build too many houses that caused those quality problems – a greater focus on customer satisfaction.In the meantime, though, this has meant a hit to profit, as the company has had increased build costs and more operating structure than it needed, given its reduced building volumes. It also took an additional £3.5m one-off customer care provision in the first half, to deal with all remaining customer issues by the end of 2017.Operating profit before exceptional costs in the first half fell by 23 per cent from £64m to £49m.Now the work begins on:Mr Fitzgerald said:The Group’s strong balance sheet and valuable land bank mean we are well set to provide the stable returns to shareholders that their patience and support have deserved.And, finally, waste management group Biffa appears to profiting nicely from improving everyone’s environment. Its trading update this morning said it “continued to deliver solid organic and acquisition revenue growth”, and profit had been lifted by strong operational performance and cost control – including the delivery of acquisition synergies.In July, Biffa completed the acquisition of O’Brien Waste Recycling Solutions Holdings Limited, a provider of waste and recycling solutions in the North East of England, for £35m – and, with a strong balance sheet, it now plans more deals.Cleaning up in every sense.FT Opening Quote, with commentary by Matthew Vincent, is your early Square Mile briefing.

111;WM;Waste Management;2017-08-24T11:07:54Z;John Laing suffers profits fall after hit on waste projects;Net assets grow despite £25.5m writedown on waste investments in north of England;Infrastructure group John Laing suffered falls in profits as it was forced to take a multimillion-pound hit on its long-troubled waste projects in the north of England. The group highlighted problems surrounding the Greater Manchester waste disposal projects, where it is trying to avoid a legal battle with local authorities, in half-year results reported on Thursday. “Our job isn't to spend our time in court fighting local authorities. The private sector has to provide solutions not problems, so even if it comes at a cost to us, it is better to draw a line and move on . . . I am sure that Manchester will be back in the market and we want to be ready when that happens,” said Olivier Brousse, John Laing’s chief executive. The company said it had reached an agreement on the investments with Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority, which saw it book a reduction in their value of £25.5m compared with their valuation at the end of December. In arriving at the agreement to exit the contracts, John Laing said it “took the view that the alternative could have been long and costly legal proceedings with an uncertain outcome for the valuation of its two investments”.Partly as a result of the Manchester impairment and partly due to a large positive foreign exchange movement in the first half of last year, pre-tax profits fell 66 per cent on a year-on-year basis. However, the company did manage to increase its net asset value by 2.3 per cent from the start of the year.John Laing’s Manchester waste investments represented 8 per cent of its total investment at the end of last year and, while painful, the group “should still have made a small profit on the contract as a whole, and we do not see other assets as similarly affected”, said Peel Hunt’s Andrew Shepherd-Barron. Mr Brousse emphasised that the company’s investment pipeline remained healthy at £1.9bn over the next three years, and that it remained on track to meet its full-year guidance of £200m for both investment and realisations. Mr Brousse also added that John Laing was becoming an ever less UK-focused company. “We are becoming more of an American company, more of an Australian company.”John Laing’s share price was down 1.4 per cent to 303p in mid-morning trading but is up 12 per cent in the year to date while the FTSE All-Share index is up 4.5 per cent.The group was established in 1848 as a building company based in Carlisle in north-west England and has grown to become a major infrastructure company.
112;WM;Waste Management;2017-08-24T06:45:30Z;John Laing grows net assets despite Manchester Waste writedown;;John Laing was forced to take a £26m hit on its long-troubled Greater Manchester Waste projects in half-year results reported on Thursday, but the British infrastructure group still managed to increase its net asset value by 2.3 per cent compared to the same period last year.The company said it had reached an agreement on the investments with Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority which saw them book a reduction in their value of £25.5m compared to their valuation at 31 December 2016.In arriving at its decision to enter into an agreement with Manchester Waste, John Laing said it “took the view that the alternative could have been long and costly legal proceedings with an uncertain outcome for the valuation of its two investments.”Olivier Brousse, John Laing’s chief executive, said:It has been an active year so far and I am pleased to report growth in NAV, after taking into account the reduction in value on our two Manchester Waste investments. We have made good progress on investment commitments and disposals and are on track to achieve our full year guidance on both fronts.According to Barclay’s, the Manchester Waste investments represented 8 per cent of John Laing’s total investment at the end of last year.However, while admitting that the Manchester Waste loss was disappointing, Peel Hunt’s Andrew Shepherd-Barron said that John Laing has “done 100 projects and this is just one… if they take another provision that hurts a bit but it’s only one project out of a hundred”.Mr Shepherd-Barron said “the £26m hit – against their own valuation rather than cost, means they should still be getting out with a small profit according to our estimates – it is not entirely unexpected and means that they exit cleanly”.The company reported £111.3 of investment commitments and £151.3 of realisations, in line with its full year guidance of close to £200m in both cases.John Laing’s share price is up 13 per cent year to date while the FTSE All Share index is up 4.5 per cent.Reporting by David Keohane
113;WM;Waste Management;2017-08-02T04:02:17Z;Fix your iPhone — and everything else;The growing consumer movement fighting for the ‘right to repair’ ;"When was the last time you repaired something? The ethos of “make do and mend” may strike some readers as old fashioned. It is fair to say it reached its zenith at a time of national crisis. My parents — born in the early 1940s — can remember postwar rationing, which continued well into the 1950s. They are programmed not to throw anything away. My dad once boasted he was wearing a pair of woollen hiking socks that were older than me. It wasn’t that he couldn’t afford another pair. There was a certain pride in looking after one’s possessions and, if necessary, prolonging their life with a stitch or two (in time, to save nine).This spirit was also apparent in children’s TV programmes when I was growing up. Who can forget the thrifty mice from Bagpuss, whose squeaky voices chorused “We will fix it” as they repaired damaged antiques retrieved by Emily, the mysterious child shopkeeper? Or the Wombles of Wimbledon Common? (Altogether now: “Making good use of the things that we find / Things that the everyday folks leave behind”). Back in the day, if a kitchen appliance went wrong, you called the local repairman. Nowadays, you just whip out your smartphone and order a new one.Globalisation has given us cheap imports, resulting in price deflation and a vastly shortened replacement cycle. New products are so cheap, it is generally uneconomic to pay someone to fix things if they break. Over time, we have gradually lost the skills passed down by previous generations of fixing things ourselves. But the backlash has begun, as I discovered recently when I attended a “restart party”. The concept of this growing movement is simple: to “fix our relationship with electronics”. People with broken printers, laptops, fans, vintage record players and other gadgets queued to enter a marquee in our local park where volunteer “fixers” showed them how their possessions could last for years longer with a simple repair. Organised by the Restart Project, a London-based social enterprise, the objective is not just saving money — it is also about saving the planet. Restart party hosts around the world have saved an estimated five tons of electronic items from being thrown away. This sounds impressive — until you realise that we are projected to create 50m tons of waste from electrical goods globally in 2018. These figures have been crunched ahead of the first international “Fixfest” in October, where makers, designers, activists and tinkerers will gather in London to spread the word about why repairing matters. Restart party organisers are frustrated that about half of the objects people bring along to their events cannot be successfully repaired. Things nowadays are not built to last. Walking around in a pair of 30-year old socks might be good for the planet, but it is not good for businesses that want to sell you more socks (or for a UK economy propped up by consumer spending). And so the concept of “built-in obsolescence” was born. I had my last iPhone for several years, investing in a Speck hard case to protect the screen from cracking and installing all of the maddening software updates. Then the battery went.The principle that consumers should not be deliberately prevented from making basic repairs to their purchases strikes me as unassailableIf the phone is still in warranty, Apple will replace the battery for free. If it is out of warranty, it will charge a minimum of £86.44 (you can practically hear the salesperson in Carphone Warehouse saying “for that price, wouldn’t you rather have a shiny new phone?”) Yet you can buy the batteries yourself online for about £13 (they are the size of a stick of gum). Armed with a pentalobe screwdriver, you are just one YouTube tutorial away from fixing the phone yourself. There are armies of “wombles” online nowadays spreading the word about how to fix things instead of throwing them away. There is even a Twitter hashtag #SOSRestart, where people post photos of troublesome objects in the hope of drawing on collective repairing wisdom. The US website iFixit.org styles itself as the free repair manual of the internet, with how-to content from videos to digital instruction manuals. Its community of more than 600,000 members demands the “right to repair” the things they buy. “Once you’ve paid money for a product, the manufacturer shouldn’t be able to dictate how you use it,” the site says. “But that’s exactly what some manufacturers intend to do. It’s common practice to refuse to make parts, tools and repair information available to consumers and small repair shops.”This, iFixit says, is fuelling disposable culture. Recycling, though, is not always the answer: while it is better than throwing things away, it argues, the sheer volume of electrical waste makes it unsustainable in the long term and “not as nearly as ‘green’ as manufacturers want you to believe”. In the US state of Nebraska, a “fair repair” bill recently attempted to take on the mighty consumer electronics companies and agricultural equipment makers which cite safety, security and intellectual property risks as reasons for withholding spare parts, manuals and software secrets needed for DIY repairs. The bill failed. But the principle that consumers should not be deliberately prevented from making basic repairs to their purchases strikes me as unassailable. And who knows? It could be just the sort of populist message to appeal to a certain publicity-seeking president in need of a positive story.Claer Barrett is the editor of FT Money; Twitter: @Claerb; claer.barrett@ft.com"
114;WM;Waste Management;2017-07-19T12:17:10Z;UK issues coded warning to Brussels over nuclear waste;Britain highlights right to dispatch atomic material to Europe after Brexit;Britain has put the EU on notice that it has the right to return radioactive waste to the bloc after it leaves, in an attempt to increase the UK’s negotiating clout on the vexed issue of nuclear regulation.UK officials hope raising complex questions over what should happen to Britain’s stockpile of radioactive materials — some of which originate from EU countries including Germany, Italy and Sweden — will convince Brussels to take a co-operative approach to the nuclear issue.“It might just be a reminder that a boatload of plutonium could end up at a harbour in Antwerp unless an arrangement is made,” said one nuclear expert who has advised the government.Britain has imported spent nuclear fuel from the rest of Europe since the 1970s for reprocessing at the state-owned Sellafield plant in Cumbria — producing reusable uranium and plutonium, but also radioactive waste.A paper setting out the UK position for Brexit negotiations stressed the right “to return radioactive waste . . . to its country of origin”, in what one British official described as a coded warning to Brussels about the EU’s interest in reaching a consensus.The paper also highlighted the responsibility of EU countries for some “special fissile materials” — the most dangerous and tightly-regulated types of nuclear substances, including plutonium — derived from imported spent fuel. Almost one-fifth of the UK’s 126-tonne stockpile of civilian plutonium at Sellafield comes from overseas.Nuclear regulation has become one of the knottiest issues in the early stages of negotiations about the UK exiting the EU because Britain must disentangle itself from the Euratom treaty governing the civilian use of atomic technology in Europe.Leaders of the UK nuclear industry are lobbying the government to find a way of remaining part of Euratom or, if that proves impossible, to negotiate an extended transition deal to allow time to establish a new regulatory system.However, either of those options would require continued jurisdiction by the European Court of Justice — something Theresa May, UK prime minister, has so far resisted.Those arguing for Mrs May to compromise have highlighted the threat of disruption to UK supplies of nuclear fuel, reactor parts and medical isotopes used in cancer treatments if Britain fails to reach a deal with Brussels.However, UK negotiators are attempting to exert their own leverage by highlighting the potential costs to the EU of a disorderly British exit from Euratom.While the EU position paper on Euratom deals with basic issues over ownership and separation, the UK response stresses the “strong mutual interest in ensuring close co-operation in the future”.Similar tactics are being used by British diplomats across a range of areas in the first stage of divorce talks, from the status of the European Investment Bank to the EU’s ownership of radioactive testing kit at Sellafield.EU diplomats said they had noted the veiled threat on nuclear waste: one joked that they would have “the coastguard ready”.Nuclear waste was among topics discussed by EU and British negotiators in Brussels on Tuesday, but an official involved declined to offer a detailed account.Francis Livens, director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute at Manchester University, said the UK’s right to return nuclear waste was already enshrined in commercial contracts under which spent fuel was imported to Sellafield. However, plutonium extracted from the spent fuel posed a trickier problem, he added.A plant built at Sellafield to recycle the plutonium into new nuclear fuel was closed in 2011 after only a decade of operation because of technological flaws and weak demand. This has left the UK sitting on the world’s largest civilian stockpile of plutonium, stored as powder in flasks at a heavily guarded building at Sellafield.A new plant would be required to either resume recycling of the plutonium into nuclear fuel or to turn it into a form that could be safely returned to its country of origin as waste. “We’re going to have to build something very expensive to deal with this plutonium whichever option we choose,” said Prof Livens.Separating UK plutonium from that derived from imported spent fuel — and assigning responsibility for the costs of storing and eventually processing it — promises to be a complex challenge for Brexit negotiators. Under Euratom law, all special fissile material within the treaty area is considered commonly owned — including plutonium.“Reprocessing is like a sausage machine. You put in some British fuel, then some Japanese, then some Belgian,” said Prof Livens. “You can’t point to a single atom and say, ‘that’s Belgian’.”The UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said negotiations would focus on the “legal ownership not physical location” of nuclear materials. What happens to materials once ownership has been settled “will be a matter for the owner and the UK to agree on commercial terms,” it added.David Davis, the UK Brexit secretary, has hinted at the potential for Britain to negotiate associate membership of Euratom. But, while Switzerland has such a deal covering research co-operation, an association agreement covering safeguarding of fissile materials or trade in nuclear materials would be legally unprecedented.
115;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Shared toilets as the path to health and dignity;Where one household, one latrine is unrealistic, shared facilities are a huge advance;"Mollar Bosti is a crowded slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, home to 10,000 people — garment workers, rickshaw drivers and small traders, all living side-by-side in tiny rooms sandwiched together along narrow passageways.With the land subject to monsoon flooding and no municipal services to speak of, the people of Mollar Bosti have been struggling with a very real problem: what to do with an enormous and growing amount of human faeces.Traditionally, their “hanging latrines” consisted of bamboo and corrugated metal structures suspended on poles above the ground, allowing waste to fall into a soup of mud and trash below. Residents tell stories of rooms flooded with smelly muck during monsoons; outbreaks of diarrhoea and fever would quickly follow.But conditions have improved for much of the slum. With the help of a local NGO, the residents negotiated permission for improvement from a private landowner and mapped out areas of need. Today, they proudly show visitors their pristine, well-lit community latrines and water points. They report fewer problems with flooding and disease.beyondbrics is a forum on emerging markets for contributors from the worlds of business, finance, politics, academia and the third sector. All views expressed are those of the author(s) and should not be taken as reflecting the views of the Financial Times.With neither the space nor the money for a toilet for each household, these well-cared-for latrines have provided an effective solution along the way to good sanitation for everyone. But we fear these kinds of community latrines are under threat from dwindling investment.How to effectively provide sanitation in fast-growing slums and informal settlements is a growing problem worldwide. More than half the world’s population now live in towns and cities; by 2050, it will be two-thirds. An estimated 668m city dwellers around the world do not have access to decent, private toilets; in many cities, options include the use of plastic bags as “flying toilets”, or using a comparatively isolated place like a railway track at dusk.Given this urgent need, and given that 369m urbanites already depend on shared latrines of varying quality as their only option, we are calling on governments, donors and development partners to agree criteria for acceptable shared latrines, to prioritise investment in new ones and to improve those that already exist, as the essential stepping stone to better public health and prosperity for those living in poverty.A wider vision of the global sanitation crisis is contained in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which include a goal of delivering access to a decent toilet for every household by 2030.The severity of the challenge is clear. The crises of Ebola and Zika show us that in this globalised world, poor sanitation only exacerbates public health emergencies.The question is how to address it. Ultimately, everyone deserves that gold standard of a toilet for each household. But city planners, policymakers and donors should resist the temptation of focusing their efforts and funding on those who are easiest to reach, rather than tackling the greater challenge of serving the poorest and most marginalised.This cannot be left to individual communities and grassroots NGOs alone. The economic returns and public health gains from such interim solutions for the world’s “bottom billion” who are currently without sanitation will be far greater than delivering gold-standard service to a few, most of whom already have another, if less than perfect, option.It is true that shared toilets are not all good toilets. Built badly and managed poorly, they are dirty, smelly, fill up quickly and may be unsafe to use. But well-managed shared toilets create cleaner, healthier spaces, and are designed, cleaned and maintained in a way that ensures safety and dignity, particularly for disabled people and for girls and women: properly lighted, in well-planned locations, with stalls that lock.Decent shared toilets, along with the provision of clean water and good hygiene practices, provide dignity, create healthier, more productive communities, improve children’s attendance at school, and ultimately improve economic growth.They also save lives. An estimated 289,000 children under five die around the world each year — that is one child every two minutes — from preventable diarrhoeal illnesses linked to dirty water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene. As much as 50 per cent of child malnutrition is linked to chronic infections that could be prevented with clean water, decent toilets and handwashing with soap.The ambition of the UN’s SDGs to deliver safe water running from household taps and safely managed private toilets is clear, and is intended to drive the political will and financing required.Little more than a century ago, before household toilets became the norm, in New York, London, Paris and many other cities it was common to see tenement outhouses and neighbourhood privies. While these were far from a perfect solution, they played an important role in helping to prevent diseases spreading throughout these ambitious, fast-growing cities, and were a step towards further improvement.We are asking governments, planners and donors in today’s equally ambitious and fast-growing developing cities to borrow a page from that history book: recognising that where private toilets are not yet an option, well-managed shared sanitation can set cities up for further progress. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The health and wealth of these nations depends upon it.Tim Wainwright is chief executive of WaterAid; Neil Jeffery is chief executive for Water & Sanitation for the Urban Poor and Guangzhe Chen is senior director, water global practice, at the World Bank Group."
116;WM;Waste Management;2017-06-22T05:01:58Z;Manufacturers grapple with goods’ green impact after sale;Companies are trying to cut environmental damage caused by consumers’ use of products;A molecule that speeds the breakdown of laundry soapsuds is helping to save water in South Africa. The technology not only saves time on washday chores but by reducing rinsing it also cuts water wastage in a country currently gripped by a drought.SmartFoam was developed by Unilever and is used in the consumer goods company’s Sunlight 2-in-1 Handwashing Laundry Powder. It is one example of a growing range of technologies and strategies being created as companies respond to the awkward reality that some products’ biggest environmental impact occurs once they are in the hands of consumers.Businesses wanting to reduce the side effects of consumer use often turn to education and awareness campaigns. When Unilever launched Sunlight 2-in-1 in 2016 in Tembisa, near Johannesburg, it also ran a campaign to educate residents on how to save water.Consumer education is not an easy task, however. After all, business has largely worked to persuade people to buy more, not less.“The marketing and advertising industry has spent 50 years educating the consumer the other way — that single use is good and convenience is everything,” says Peter Hopkinson, professor of innovation and environmental strategy at the University of Bradford School of Management in the UK.Meanwhile, companies trying to address their consumer-related environmental footprints are becoming increasingly aware that persuasion only goes so far. Recycling is a case in point. Consumers with busy lives will not necessarily take time to navigate complicated recycling rules that, for example, require different types of plastics to be disposed of in different bins.“They’re unable to differentiate and the labelling is very complex,” says Richard Kirkman, technical director at Veolia, the water and waste management group.Technology can help. For example, Veolia is developing ways of separating and cleaning different plastics. However, another way to help consumers cut down on waste is to rethink the business model.New retail systems can make it easier for consumers to return or recycle packaging and other materials while allowing companies to retrieve and reuse those materials, enabling them to cut back on the resources they use. “What I see all the time is companies looking for product and service innovations that deal with these multiple challenges,” says Prof Hopkinson.He cites Splosh, a cleaning, laundry and health and beauty products company. The UK business has developed refillable bottles and sachets for its products, some of which are created by adding water. The sachets, designed to fit through letterboxes, can be sent back for refills.Prof Hopkinson says the system offers a big advantage: “You get the active ingredient in a sachet, so you’re not transporting lots of water around the country.”This underlines another challenge faced by consumer goods companies: the fact that many products require heavy consumption of water or energy. One solution is to re-engineer products so that they use less of these resources, as Unilever has done. However, this is not always possible. “If you look at the humble tea bag, the big issue is boiling a kettle,” says Sally Uren, chief executive at Forum for the Future, a UK sustainable development non-profit organisation.“It’s not just the water but the energy required to boil the kettle. That in-use impact dwarfs the impact of, say, logistics.”This demands a change not only in the design and development of consumer goods but also in systems and infrastructure — and that requires collaboration. “There are the manufacturers and the brands, the consumers and ourselves completing the circle,” says Mr Kirkman, of Veolia. “Everyone has got to do their bit.”Ms Uren agrees. “Our behaviours are really hard to change, so we need to redesign the product to minimise its environmental impact. But more critically, we need to think about the system around the use of the product.”Forum for the Future has, for example, been working with sanitary ware manufacturers and water companies on developing a bathroom in which taking a shower would use less water at lower temperatures, consuming less energy.When it comes to energy use, the ultimate solution is to provide consumers with power that is generated from renewable sources.This may lead to consumer goods companies expanding into new types of commercial activities. For example, Marks and Spencer has entered the energy supply business. M&S Energy is the result of a partnership between M&S and SSE, a UK renewable energy provider.Ms Uren sees system-wide industry shifts as critical to sustainable consumption. “If all your energy is renewable it doesn’t matter how you use your products,” she says. “We need to see catalytic change in entire systems.”
117;WM;Waste Management;2017-06-16T14:22:53Z;Share the love, peace and peanut butter;An app for surplus food means that no Coke is left unfinished;I was having dinner with some friends recently when one of them said he had just done something idiotic.He had come home from the shops in his smart north London neighbourhood to find he had mistakenly bought a jar of smooth peanut butter when no one in his house will eat anything except crunchy.Then his wife said it didn’t matter because they had put the jar on Olio and it had been snapped up in a matter of minutes.There was a pause as the rest of the table absorbed this information. “What’s Olio?” I finally asked, which proved a blunder.Olio is a phone app that any decent environmental journalist should have known about. It connects people who want to chuck out food with those who want to come and get it.You take a photo of your unwanted nosh, list it on the app and arrange a mutually convenient pick-up time with anyone who wants it.I had heard about these neighbourhood “sharing revolution” ideas, where people lend their car or power drill to someone up the street. I never realised I knew anyone sharing food.I was wrong. My friends described a slew of stuff that strangers had pitched up to collect from their doorstep via Olio, which has recently branched into non-food.An old cat-door, shorts, ancient software and now the peanut butter.“It’s millennials hating waste,” they said, explaining they had first heard about the app from their daughter, who is in her 20s.This sounded plausible for their millennial, if not others I could think of, and I did dimly know that about one-third of the world’s food is wasted or lost every year, squandering vast amounts of water, energy and cash.But that left a lot of unanswered questions about Olio. How big is it? How is it funded? Is someone making money out of it?I decided to have a look myself and signed up for the app.This produced a dispiriting automated email that said: “Thank you for being a part of The Local Sharing Revolution! We think you’re awesome”, followed by an emoji of a pair of clapping hands.I pressed on to discover something far more baffling than anything my friends had told me. Their peanut butter was just the half of it.Among the 12,209 other “Olioers” the app said were lurking within 5km of my home in north London, one was giving away a can of Carnation evaporated milk with a warning that its best before date was May last year: the sales pitch was “can’t imagine it ever goes bad”.Someone in Finchley Road had a toffee doughnut, another offered a jar of foie gras. A third was turfing out a bottle of “virtually full” Tesco malt vinegar, “best before June 2013”.Then I saw a photo of a large, half-empty bottle of Coca-Cola. The Olioer said her flatmate had bought it and was about to chuck it.“I don’t drink soda, so would be nice for someone who does to take it away,” she said.This seemed extraordinary.Were people really bothering to hoof around town to pick up half empty bottles of flat Coke? Or even the more appealing items on display?They were doing just that by the thousand, said Tessa Cook, a former managing director at the Wonga payday lender who co-founded Olio two years ago with Saasha Celestial-One, a friend from Stanford University business school. (The latter is the daughter of Iowa hippies.)Ms Cook told me that Olio has more than 200,000 signed-up users, 89 per cent of them in the UK — and mostly outside London — including 11,000 volunteers who actively spread the Olio word.They tend to be aged between 25 and 44 and female. Collectively, they have shared more than 250,000 items of food.The app is still “pre-revenue”, Ms Cook said. But not for long if she, and presumably Olio’s venture capital investors, have their way.Olio has so many “super-users”, pouncing on items as soon as they appear online that plans are afoot to create some sort of premium subscription system, so you can pay a modest fee to get first dibs on new stuff before everyone sees it.Ms Cook has a theory about why her app is popular. She thinks that humans are hard-wired to share but the modern economy and the shift to nuclear families in big towns and cities make this hard. Enter Olio.I have no idea whether she’s right. But I hope she and Ms Celestial-One can keep it going. The world has enough apps to share cat photos and bird games.

118;WM;Waste Management;2017-06-15T03:07:10Z;Biffa’s expanding waste line has appeal;Energy strategy set to exploit a capacity gap in UK’s rubbish industry;Last week, Britain’s new political power brokers — the Democratic Unionists — had their policies described by one commentator as “basically just the Bible, with fortnightly bin collections”.So, this week, before they finalise a deal with Theresa May’s minority government, they might want to consult Biffa. As one of Britain’s leading waste management companies, it regularly advises local government on optimal bin collection frequency. And, on Wednesday, it showed those who kept the faith during a messy flotation what greater efficiency can deliver: a doubling of underlying pre-tax profit and a maiden dividend of 2.4p a share.Biffa doesn’t, as yet, provide domestic refuse services in Belfast. But its results suggest that it would have a good chance of either winning the business, or buying the company that did. Net revenues were up 8.3 per cent, to £899m, in the year to March 24, with 3.3 per cent of that growth organic and 5 per cent acquired.New business wins help Biffa make more profitable use of its fleet. With more than 1,000 trucks already driving down British streets, making more collections (“infilling capacity” in bin-person speak) flows through to its bottom line. Biffa’s industrial and commercial waste division demonstrates this most clearly: 5.9 per cent organic revenue growth delivered a forecast-beating 41 per cent rise in underlying operating profit.Acquisitions can also be margin enhancing. Last year, the group completed five deals, which increased industrial and commercial sales by 3.1 per cent, but raised margins 70 basis points, to 7.4 per cent, thanks to better than expected synergies.Biffa needs both sources of profit growth as its existing energy business declines. With less waste going into its landfill sites, less gas is being produced — compacting the division’s profits by 13.3 per cent, to under £30m.However, the new “Energy from Waste” plants it is evaluating with US-listed Covanta are a whole new kettle of rotting fish. They can potentially exploit a capacity gap that exists in the UK waste management industry: more rubbish than current infrastructure can convert into fuel or energy.For Biffa, the risk would clearly not be security of supply but execution, given other groups’ failures with relatively new EfW technology.For Biffa investors, then, as they contemplate both acquisitions and capital investment, the question is much like that faced by wheelie-bin owners every 14 days: does it really have the capacity?With net debt reduced to £246m, or 1.8 times earnings, Biffa certainly has enough room for more low-risk bolt-on deals. With investment in each new EfW plant modelled at £50m by Numis analysts — assuming a 60/40 debt/equity split and other consortium partners — this looks manageable, too.That would allow the company to use its free-cash flow to fund higher dividends: up to 10p a share, on some estimates. One act of recycling that no one could complain about.KPMG: could do betterEnd of year exams often throw up surprises, writes Kate Burgess. That is as true for auditors as it is for students.This year, PwC got top marks from the beancounters’ review board — aka the Financial Reporting Council. The FRC inspected 27 PwC audits and defined 25 as good or needing nothing more than a tweak or two. The other two needed only a little revision and none needed amending significantly.PwC seems to be like the smart kid in the class who is often in detention, but still performs best in exams. The firm — the UK’s biggest auditor — tops the list of number crunchers undergoing FRC enforcement investigations, including probes of its audits of IT group Redcentric and retailer BHS.However, PwC seems to have taken last year’s school report to heart and done better. The FRC’s goal is that 90 per cent of audits should need zero or minimal amendments by 2018. Only PwC has met that target.Big Four rivals EY and Deloitte lag a little. KPMG, for the second year in a row, lags behind a lot. About 35 per cent of KPMG’s audits marked by the FRC needed to be improved. It got just 15 out of 23 right. The examining board’s enforcement team is also probing its audit of Rolls-Royce and the Co-operative Bank. That puts KPMG in the B-stream alongside the smaller BDO and Grant Thornton. Next year, it really must do better — or the Big Four may become the Big Three.Coming up ShortEllis Short, whose Sunderland Football Club has been relegated from the Premier League with £100m of outstanding borrowings, would appear to have a sense of irony. Or a total lack thereof. He has just launched a $2bn fund to invest in the distressed property debt market. One wonders who will manage it. Mr Short made five attempts to lure David Moyes to Sunderland, only for hapless touchline supremo’s tenure to end in resignation. So he is technically available again . . .matthew.vincent@ft.comAudits: kate.burgess@ft.com
119;WM;Waste Management;2017-06-14T15:49:23Z;Biffa dragged into loss by cost of its flotation;Waste management company signals further acquisitions as revenues rise 6.8%;Biffa swung to a loss last year as the cost of its stock market flotation hit the waste management company’s balance sheet.Biffa, which collects, processes and disposes of waste and recyclables for 2.4m UK households, slid from a £2.9m profit to a £18.7m pre-tax loss for the year to March 24.The company was hurt by £29m of exceptional costs as a result of its initial public offering, which struggled to get off the ground in the wake of Britain’s decision to leave the EU.With the IPO costs stripped out, the company’s pre-tax profits more than doubled, from £21.2m to £45.1m. Revenue increased 6.8 per cent to £990.4m, helped by five acquisitions worth £25.7m last year, including of Cory Environmental Services.Biffa rejoined the stock market on October 17 at 180p a share, giving it a market capitalisation of £450m. On Wednesday, Biffa’s shares remained stable at about 195p.Biffa has an 8 per cent share of the UK’s recycling and waste collection industry. It handles about 6.6m tonnes of waste — approximately a third of which is converted into energy and sold back to Britain’s National Grid for use as electricity in 250,000 homes.Ian Wakelin, chief executive, said the company was poised to make further acquisitions following a wave of consolidation in the market, which is grappling with increasing complexity and high barriers to entry.Kier Group, the FTSE 250 construction and environmental services company, exited the industry last year after warning that it would take a £33m loss on its recycling business in the 2016 financial year.£29mExceptional costs resulting from Biffa’s IPOThe London-based Closed Loop, Britain’s biggest plastic bottle recycling plant, was also put into administration last year but has since been acquired by Veolia, the French waste management company.Just 50 per cent of UK recycling and waste collection is privatised and Biffa expects the market to expand as the government’s austerity measures drive greater outsourcing of cleaning, waste and recycling collection services.Although the environmental benefits of recycling are well accepted, much of the progress has been driven by legislation from the EU, now in question following the Brexit vote.The proportion of waste that is recycled has been gradually rising, from 40.4 per cent in 2010 to 44.3 per cent last year, according to statistics from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. The government has a target of 50 per cent by 2020.Biffa, which started collecting from London’s coal-fired power stations 100 years ago, was taken over by hedge funds Angelo Gordon, Avenue Capital Group and Sankaty Advisors in 2013 after running into trouble following a heavily leveraged buyout.The company had previously been owned by Severn Trent, but was demerged in 2006 and taken private in 2008 by Global Infrastructure Partners and Montagu Private Equity.Andrew Shepherd-Barron, analyst at Peel Hunt, said: “A substantial acquisition since the IPO would have been welcome, since bolt-ons are the lowest risk and most likely highest-rewarding investment opportunity. But the pipeline is meaningful, hence we are optimistic on developments this year.”
120;WM;Waste Management;2017-05-04T07:21:56Z;Brussels plans to saddle UK with EU nuclear waste;Britain’s impending split from Euratom indicative of complexity of Brexit;Britain will be on the hook for large volumes of dangerous radioactive waste — some of it imported from the rest of Europe — under proposals by Brussels to transfer ownership of a range of nuclear materials to the UK after it leaves the EU.Almost 130 tonnes of plutonium stored at Sellafield in Cumbria is among the nuclear material that would formally shift to UK control, according to draft documents issued by Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator.All “special fissile material” — forms of uranium and plutonium used in nuclear fuels and some of the resulting waste — within the EU are technically owned by Euratom, the pan-European regulator of civilian nuclear activity.Mr Barnier’s provisional negotiating position calls for a Brexit agreement to “ensure, where appropriate, the transfer to the United Kingdom” ownership of “special fissile material” currently controlled by Euratom within the UK.Such an agreement would make the UK legally responsible not only for its own nuclear material but also reprocessed spent fuel imported over several decades from Germany, Sweden and elsewhere for recycling at Sellafield.“What was a joint European legacy now becomes a UK home brew, with potentially dire economic consequences for the UK given the sheer expense and weight of this radiological inventory,” said Paul Dorfman, honorary senior researcher at the Energy Institute at University College London.What was a joint European legacy now becomes a UK home brew, with potentially dire economic consequences for the UK given the sheer expense and weight of this radiological inventoryThis view was dismissed by others who said the transfer of ownership would not make any practical difference because Euratom’s ownership existed only in theory.“Euratom has the right to sequester fissile material in extreme circumstances but it is a historical throwback reflecting the world as it was when the treaty was negotiated in the 1950s and there was a threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union,” said Timothy Abram, professor of nuclear fuel technology at Manchester university.Mr Barnier’s proposal for the UK to assume “all rights and obligations associated with the ownership of [fissile] materials or property transferred” is seen in Brussels as a necessary housekeeping exercise to remove Euratom’s claim on nuclear fuel used in UK power stations as well as uranium isotopes used in radiotherapy.But it highlighted the uncertainty facing Britain’s nuclear industry — responsible for about a fifth of domestic electricity generation — in the run-up to Brexit. Euratom is a separate legal entity to the EU but is governed by EU institutions and the UK government says it has no option but to leave both at the same time.A UK government spokeswoman said: “Leaving Euratom is a result of the decision to leave the EU as they are uniquely legally joined.”She added: “The UK supports Euratom and will want to see continuity of co-operation and standards. We remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry.”As well as nuclear fuel and reprocessed waste, the UK would also take ownership of Euratom property used to safeguard the material, such as inspection and monitoring equipment, according to the EU proposals.The negotiation directives, which are subject to the agreement of the 27 remaining member states, were published on Wednesday as Mr Barnier set out his hardline opening position for talks with London.Although formal ownership of imported waste would pass to the UK, Prof Abrams said it would not remove Britain’s right to compensation for the cost of reprocessing and storing it under the commercial terms agreed with the exporting countries.The UK has struck deals with Germany, France, Sweden and the Netherlands in recent years to take permanent responsibility for some of the plutonium derived from the reprocessing of imported spent fuel. The government said at the time that this was a mutually beneficial arrangement that removed the need to transport one of the world’s most radioactive materials back to the country of origin.Britain has been wrestling for years with the question of what to do with the roughly 126 tonnes of plutonium stored at Sellafield — the world’s largest civilian stockpile. About a fifth of it stems from imported nuclear waste. The plutonium is kept in sealed flasks in a heavily guarded building designed to withstand being hit by an aircraft and costs an estimated £80m a year to store and protect.The UK spent £1.4bn in the 1990s on a plant to recycle the plutonium into nuclear fuel but the Sellafield facility was beset by problems and closed in 2011. Various proposals have been floated to spend billions more on alternative approaches to recycling, although some people favour writing off the stockpile as waste.
121;WM;Waste Management;2017-05-01T04:00:30Z;It is time for Europe to face its nuclear challenge;;This post is co-authored by Shahin ValléeThe energy market in Europe is being radically transformed by formidable forces, but governments and companies alike are so far failing to adapt to a changing world. Some of the greatest risks lie in the nuclear sector. The scale of the challenge suggests that only a pan-European approach can produce viable solutions but can the continent, in the wake of Brexit, deliver the necessary co-operation?Three principal factors are at work:The response to the common challenges has been disparate and unco-ordinated.Over the next decade, France must begin to decommission and replace its low-cost but ageing fleet of nuclear reactors. The cost of decommissioning is being downplayed but is estimated at about €54bn for 58 plants, of which only €23bn has been set aside by Paris-based utility EDF. This figure takes no account of the recent announcement by the French nuclear waste management authority that Cigeo, the used-fuel disposal plant, will on its own cost €25bn.The replacement plan relies on the EPR technology, a jumbo 2,300MW plant that has yet to be proved technically and economically viable. The problems at Flamanville, where the first EPR is already years behind schedule and billions over budget, have not been resolved and the schedule for construction now stretches into 2020. The commitment to the EPR over the last decade ignores the fact that the economics have moved against big projects with huge up-front capital costs. Simpler plants like the 1,100MW Atmea, and even smaller factory-built power generators of around 200MW are needed if nuclear power is to remain competitive, to work alongside other sources of energy production and capable of being easily decommissioned.Germany has vowed to close its remaining nuclear plants by the early 2020s. Renewables have grown but fossil fuels led by coal continue to supply the bulk of the country’s power. It is unlikely that even with rapid progress in storage and renewable efficiency, Germany can live without energy from extra coal, natural gas or nuclear power imports. It has set aside €38bn to decommission 17 reactors and has just agreed a scheme that shares the cost between public sector and utility companies, but decommissioning innovation, know-how and technology remains in its infancy.For now, the UK remains committed to new nuclear plants as part of its low-carbon energy strategy but concern about the cost, competitiveness and financing given the weakness of companies such as EDF and Toshiba have grown and alternatives are being explored. Similarly, decommissioning Britain’s stations built four to five decades ago presents unresolved financial and technical questions. The initial estimate from the UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority suggests the total bill could amount to as much as £117bn.Finally, east European countries face the task of decommissioning their Soviet-era Russian-built nuclear reactors. In the absence of established provisions or local funds, the costs of decommissioning and disposal of waste will inevitably fall on the EU’s richer members.Dealing with these problems requires a level of co-operation across Europe that goes well beyond current plans for an “energy union” designed by the European Commission. Published estimates show the scale of the problem but, given the industry’s track record, the final numbers seem certain to be higher, not least because the standards of decommissioning have not been agreed. Nor is it clear who will do the work. European experience and expertise in nuclear decommissioning is minimal, technological innovation has been undermined by a fragmented supply chain and the delay in developing a base of reliable skills can only add to the costs. As things stand, much of the decommissioning work could be picked up by companies from outside Europe.What is obvious is that taxpayers or consumers, or both, will have to foot the bills. The companies involved — from German utilities to French suppliers — do not have the capital to absorb the costs. They are undercapitalised, with low profit margins and poor credit ratings. Their position will inevitably weaken further given the changes taking place in the market.The status quo is unsustainable. The risks are too high for ageing nuclear plants to be just closed and abandoned. Reliance on technology that is proving expensive and difficult to bring on stream, in particular the EPR, will soon lead governments and energy users to choose alternative technologies. In the absence of clear decisions on smaller reactors, the next generation of plants will be developed by non-European companies and the global nuclear industry will become ever more dominated by Russia, Korea and China.The only way out is co-ordinated action, as European countries came together to rescue the aeronautical industry and form EADS/Airbus. The aim should be to create a set of new and viable enterprises that can manage both decommissioning and developing the next generation of reactors compatible with a growing share of renewable energy. In parallel, governments must agree to put in place the funds for a managed programme of decommissioning delivered to clear and consistent standards. It is difficult to see how this can be achieved other than through public-private co-operation.This should be at its core a tripartite effort between France, Germany and the UK — but Brexit, and in particular Britain’s exit from the European nuclear agency Euratom, complicate the development of such an initiative.Brexit, however, does not alter the reality of the challenge and should not stand in the way of critical European co-operation. A coalition of the willing is essential and should start with a full and transparent assessment of the real decommissioning costs for each country and an evaluation of the adequacy of current provisions and plans. In parallel, there should be a comparable assessment of the viability of existing technology to meet the needs of countries that want or need to renew their nuclear sectors.New enterprises should then be established that have both state and private shareholders, but are run commercially without day-to-day political interference. Their remit would be to develop the technology and skills to deliver a safe, cost-effective process of decommissioning and design the next generation of nuclear reactors fit for energy markets in which renewables will become the dominant source of supply. This will also give Europe a gigantic global economic opportunity. Even with further life extensions, at least half of the world’s currently operating 440 nuclear reactors will need decommissioning and potentially replacement within the next two decades. The market for that work will run to many hundreds of millions of euros.The prize is considerable. But winning it will require an acceptance that the status quo is unsustainable, that decommissioning cannot be forever kicked into the long grass and that if the European nuclear sector is to survive it has to adapt to the new economic realities.This is a moment for radical policy action. For the incumbents and those with vested interests change will be uncomfortable. Brexit will make co-operative dialogue more difficult. But there are key moments when policy makers have to accept that change is imperative.Shahin Vallee is an economist specialising in European affairs and a former economic advisor to Emmanuel Macron
122;WM;Waste Management;2017-04-28T05:07:57Z;Waste not: how cities can improve sanitation;Rather than expending precious resources, toilets can produce them;"Sanitation is essential to human progress. Not only does it symbolise growth and advancement, it empowers people and communities to grow and advance.According to the World Health Organization, every $1 invested in sanitation yields, on average, $5.50 in economic returns. This is because a lack of sanitation often results in cycles of contamination and infection that impose a heavy cost on human, economic, and environmental health. Adults fall sick and can’t work and provide for their families. Children have to weather brutal bouts of diarrhoea and pneumonia just to reach the age of five. Communities with poor sanitation end up impoverished in numerous other ways.It’s hard to imagine the nature of this situation without seeing it. That’s why Bill Gates recently created Talking Toilets, a 360 video that puts you face to face with the consequences of poor sanitation, and opens your eyes to possible solutions.When those solutions are in place, the difference for communities couldn’t be more dramatic: healthy and productive residents; more children growing up, attending school, and reaching their full potential as adults; a social environment that is more vibrant and full of potential, as well as more appealing to businesses.beyondbrics is a forum on emerging markets for contributors from the worlds of business, finance, politics, academia and the third sector. All views expressed are those of the author(s) and should not be taken as reflecting the views of the Financial Times.The fact that fecal pollution persists in many developing countries isn’t proof that governments don’t care. Rather, it’s an indication that conventional solutions, such as sewer systems and centralised treatment plants, require levels of upfront capital and ongoing maintenance that few municipalities can afford. Such approaches also require large amounts of water and electricity to operate, which can be difficult in countries where shortages of each already are concerns.Fortunately, governments around the world are improving sanitation with innovative non-sewered solutions that are more flexible and affordable — often at one-seventh the cost of sewers. The city of Warangal, in the Indian state of Telangana, is a good example of non-sewered sanitation managed right. In March 2016, following a comprehensive study of sanitation gaps in the city, the government established India’s first regulatory framework for sanitation at the municipal level.While it’s true that conveniently located household toilets are important for personal dignity and safety, city leaders know they represent only one link in an extensive, often ignored, fecal sludge management chain. This chain extends from point of use and safe containment to point of treatment and safe disposal. If any links in the chain are missing or faulty, then the sanitation outcomes of their entire city are imperilled. Through their regulatory framework, Warangal’s leaders have taken steps to ensure their city’s sanitation is comprehensive and complete.For example, officials know it isn’t enough to empty and clean pit latrines on a regular basis. The people doing the work also need to be protected against contamination. So, they drafted regulations requiring safety gear for sanitation crews. The government also knows that when toilets aren’t built properly, they leak contaminants into the nearby environment — increasing residents’ risk of infection and decreasing residents’ propensity to use them. So, it established licensing requirements for masons and constructors, ensuring toilets were built to specifications.Since then, Warangal’s regulatory standards and enforcement mechanisms have helped define roles and responsibilities, setting the terms of engagement across their fecal waste management value chain. They also have helped catalyse local industry to expand the range of sanitation products and services on the market. Yet the Warangal approach is only one of many options for policymakers to explore.In some cases, a public government-provided utility is still the best-fit option. In other cases, municipalities structure markets so that sanitation services are carried out by for-profit ventures, or even public-private partnerships. This is because entrepreneurs and commercial enterprises can engage and innovate in ways governments often can’t. Innovation drives competition, helping to progressively lower costs and transfer savings back to consumers. It also provides something that local economies need to prosper: jobs.In Senegal, Kenya, and elsewhere, businesses large and small are generating job opportunities across the fecal sludge management chain. One example is Sanergy, which provides and maintains pay-per-use toilets for communities in the slums of Nairobi. Each toilet is owned by a franchisee. Sanergy has now launched over 1,000 facilities through 500 franchisees, who serve 50,000 residents daily. Sanergy also employs 200 people to build, install and safely empty the toilets and process their contents into organic fertiliser for commercial purchase.Turning waste into useful goods will be a necessity in the future, as the global population and the demand for water, electricity and strategies for climate resiliency continue to rise. The ultimate goal for sanitation providers and innovators, therefore, is to fully transform how we view, manage and even leverage fecal waste to improve health, bolster economies and accelerate human progress. This is the goal all of us must join together to achieve.At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we’re working toward this goal by directing innovation towards new approaches to sanitation that don’t rely on sewers — from new business models and technologies that support the collection, transport and treatment of waste to a fully reinvented toilet. In the future, many toilets won’t flush waste away to be treated elsewhere; they’ll treat waste on-site. Prototypes developed as part of our “Reinvent the Toilet Challenge” showed it’s possible to recover clean water from human waste and convert the rest into something useful, like electricity and biological charcoal. So instead of expending precious resources every time you use the bathroom, you’ll be producing them.In the meantime, there is a lot that governments can do now to improve sanitation for their residents, rich and poor. Regulations that specify safety and function, as well as enable and incentivise commercial sanitary ventures, are straightforward actions that don’t require upfront capital and ongoing financing. These efforts not only make sense; they make dollars and cents. Importantly, they are helping cities and countries across the globe harness the potential of billions of people, rather than waste it.Brian Arbogast is director of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.@beyondbrics"
123;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Apple makes “closed loop” recycling pledge;;"Apple has pledged to one day manufacture its iPhones and other devices entirely from recycled materials, as it looks to reduce its use of on “conflict minerals” and other environmentally damaging resources.
Publishing its annual Environmental Responsibility report on Wednesday, Apple said it wanted to “one day stop mining the earth altogether”.“It sounds crazy, but we’re working on it,” Apple said in the report. “We’re moving toward a closed-loop supply chain. One day we’d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products.”However, Apple’s head of environmental policy, Lisa Jackson, has admitted that the company does not yet know when or even how it will achieve this goal.“We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” Ms Jackson, a former head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview with Vice News, broadcast on Wednesday evening.As a first step, Apple hopes to encourage more of its consumers to return their iPhones when they upgrade to a new handset, as it ramps up its own recycling capabilities. Its in-house disassembly process, featuring a machine it designed called “Liam”, can currently take apart up to 2.4m phones a year. The company sold 75m iPhones in its the quarter ending in December 2016 alone.“It’s an experiment in recycling technology that’s teaching us a lot, and we hope this kind of thinking will inspire others in our industry,” Apple said in its report.Apple already uses 100 per cent recycled tin for the main logic board of its iPhone 6S and it is “experimenting with ways” to recover cobalt from its devices’ lithium-ion batteries, it said.The electronics industry has faced criticism from human rights organisations over its extensive use of so-called conflict minerals, including tin and cobalt, mined from sites controlled by violent militias in the Democratic Republic of Congo and nearby areas.In a recent report on the environmental impact of smartphones, Greenpeace estimated that in 2014, less than 16 per cent of global e-waste was recycled while “much of the rest likely went to landfill or incinerators, or was exported”.“The intricate design of smartphones presents a particular challenge for safe and efficient recycling,” Greenpeace said of the industry in general. “The current production and consumption model for most electronics remains inherently unsustainable, relying on finite materials, extracted and processed using chemically intensive processes and dirty energy to make short-lived products, designed for obsolescence.”Apple’s latest environmental report shows that 96 per cent of the electricity used in its global facilities, such as offices and retail stores, came from renewable energy, up from 93 per cent a year ago and 60 per cent in 2012. It is also pushing its suppliers to use more renewable power.“Apple is the only major smartphone manufacturer who has committed to extend its commitment to be 100 per cent renewably powered to its product supply chain,” Greenpeace said in its report earlier this year."
124;WM;Waste Management;2017-03-27T16:24:59Z;Recycling industry looks to claw best from Brexit;Waste companies see opportunity for rethink after Britain leaves EU;Three miles outside Bicester, tucked between green fields in the Oxfordshire countryside, is a peculiar building, bigger than two football pitches and known locally as “the fish” — because of how it looks from the air. Each day, 70 trucks rattle their way to its door, carrying household rubbish to this 11-hectare site and dumping it in a giant bunker, where it is mixed by a mechanical claw.Waste is burnt at temperatures of up to 950C to produce electricity, while the gas produced is treated to remove pollutants.But how the UK deals with its rubbish has for decades been shaped by European directives. Policies that govern waste-to-energy plants such as this one, and the wider recycling industry, could change after Britain leaves the EU.Europe has a five-point “waste hierarchy” that ranks different methods of dealing with rubbish according to what is best for the environment.Public bodies and businesses have to prioritise efforts to reduce waste, then reuse items, followed by recycling, “recovery”, and finally disposal. Waste-to-energy plants qualify as “recovery”and are considered better for the environment than sending rubbish to landfill sites, which release harmful methane gas.Under EU rules, such as the 1999 Landfill directive, Britain has reduced the proportion of municipal waste dumped in landfill sites from 80 per cent in 2000-01 to 20 per cent in 2014-15, according to Policy Exchange, a think-tank.Meanwhile, the proportion of waste that is recycled has been gradually rising, from 40.4 per cent in 2010 to 44.3 per cent last year, according to statistics from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs department (Defra). The government has a 50 per cent target by 2020.Europe has had a “massive impact” on waste policy, says Richard Howard of the Policy Exchange. But the aims of European waste policy are becoming increasingly unclear, he believes, adding that Brexit provides an opportunity for a reassessment of what the government is trying to achieve.Since 2014, the European Commission has been working on a “circular economy” action plan with new targets for increasing recycling and reducing landfill waste. “I am not suggesting that this is the highest priority of Brexit,” Mr Howard says. “But we need to put some effort into thinking what do we do post-Brexit on all of these areas.“I think it is unwise to just go, ‘Oh well, we’ll just stick with what we’ve got,’” he added. “It’s better to sit down and go through it from the first principle and say: ‘What are we trying to do and why?’” The EU system has produced some odd outcomes. Policy Exchange calculates that £900m has been spent since 2011 on shipping British waste to continental Europe to be burnt in waste-to-energy plants there.Building more waste-to-energy plants in the UK would avoid this, but investors say they need “long-term stability” in government policy.“We want to make sure that whatever we are delivering now, there is an opportunity for us post-Brexit,” said Susan Davy, finance director of Pennon, the company that owns the £205m Oxfordshire site, as well as recycling facilities across the UK. Key among the industry’s questions are how the UK will design future targets in areas such as recycling and landfill — or whether European goals will be maintained.Industry leaders also want to know if loans from the European Investment Bank — which are an important source of funding for companies that build waste-to-energy plants — will be replaced.More than 10 per cent, or £380m, of Pennon’s gross debt is provided by the EIB. Whether that funding will be matched by the UK government after Brexit was “something we are very keen to understand”, Ms Davy said. Defra said: “Our ambition is to be the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better state than we found it while securing the best deal for the country as we leave the EU.”

But for 21m people in Bangladesh, it could be a death sentence.Water pollution is a grave concern in the country, caused by sources including runoff from textile factories and the unsafe disposal of human waste. According to UN-Water, 80 per cent of global wastewater is dumped without treatment, causing a number of risks to human health and the environment. In low-income countries such as Bangladesh, typically only eight to 10 per cent of human waste is treated.That is why the government of Bangladesh is seeking new ways to collect and treat the estimated 1.47bn litres of human waste from pit latrines that are being dumped locally each year, polluting the environment and allowing dangerous pathogens to spread to water sources, causing illness and infection.While Bangladesh has made much progress in rural sanitation, with over 40m pit latrines being built in recent years, collecting and removing this waste is still an unsolved challenge. How much will safer systems cost, and who is going to pay for them? Until now, we did not know.beyondbrics is a forum on emerging markets for contributors from the worlds of business, finance, politics, academia and the third sector. All views expressed are those of the author(s) and should not be taken as reflecting the views of the Financial Times.Today, on World Water Day, a study published in the journal PLoS ONE and funded by the Government of the Netherlands has revealed a new system that could dramatically reduce removal costs for poor households struggling with large volumes of human waste — known as fecal sludge — and could catalyse profitable businesses dealing in its collection and conversion to useful products.In Bhaluka subdistrict, pit owners typically pay between $4 and $6 to have their latrine emptied, usually every three to four years. The sludge is emptied manually, on an ad hoc basis, and deposited nearby as no central treatment facilities exist yet. The process is inefficient and unsafe.Our study shows that the least costly method of collecting sludge and transporting it to a central location for treatment would entail a household in Bhaluka paying US$13 every time a full pit is emptied, around 14 per cent of monthly income. However, spreading this cost in the form of a monthly subscription for an improved waste removal system would cost households just $0.31 a month — roughly what the pit owner would spend on a mobile phone contract. This amount would cover manual or mechanised waste removal, as well as transportation by truck to a central location for treatment.Besides the vast environmental and health benefits that safe removal of fecal sludge would offer, this new system could pave the way for the business of waste removal to boom. In one district alone it is estimated that between 300 and 600 new jobs could be created. By signing up thousands of pit owners to a monthly subscription, waste removal services would ensure a steady flow of capital that could be invested in improving their equipment and efficiency. As the service improves, more households will sign up, kick-starting a virtuous circle. With total economic losses from inadequate sanitation in Bangladesh alone estimated to be $4.2bn each year, the new approach could go a long way to reducing the economic drag created by inadequate waste management.In addition, the system would centralise consistent volumes of fecal sludge, which can be turned into profitable by-products such as fertiliser and fuel. Pilot projects in Gazipur have shown the potential for human waste to be treated and turned into high-value compost for plantations growing non-edible commodities such as rubber and cotton. Now that the technical viability of producing this compost has been proven, further work can get under way to determine the cost of producing it at scale, and the price it could fetch on the market.Another critical step will be analysing the costs that would be involved in setting up and running a central treatment plant. Now that costs involved in the transportation link have been determined, a treatment plant could now be set up on a pilot basis and analysed in the same manner.Bangladesh is sitting up and taking notice of these findings. The first policy framework for fecal sludge management has now been produced and a scheme to pilot the system will be scheduled in the near future.Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated places on the planet; an approach that proves effective in this context could offer important lessons for other countries grappling with similar wastewater issues. This study not only has the potential to transform lives in Bangladesh, but could also provide a blueprint for revolutionising sanitation systems across the rest of the developing world, relieving rural households of the burden of fecal sludge for good.Soumya Balasubramanya is an economist at the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka.

126;WM;Waste Management;2017-03-16T17:41:37Z;Eon to lift share capital by 10% ahead of payments on German waste storage;;Eon, the German utility, is to increase its share capital by about 10 per cent or up to €1.35bn to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of major payments to a newly-created state-run fund to cover the cost of dealing with Germany’s nuclear waste.Eon said it would increase its share capital by around 10 per cent, raising it from €2,001,000,000 to €2,201,099,000 by issuing 200,099,000 ordinary shares. The purpose, it said, was to strengthen the company’s equity and liquidity basis.The price range of the placement is €6.71 to €6.83 per share, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a separate statement.The new shares, which will carry full dividend rights starting from January 1, 2016, will be offered exclusively to institutional investors by means of a private placement, using an accelerated bookbuilding process which will be launched immediately, Eon said.It said the final placement price and the proceeds from the issue would be made public once the price had been fixed. It said delivery and settlement is expected to occur on or about March 22. Eon added that as part of the transaction it had agreed to a 6 month lock-up period for any transaction related to its shares.The capital raise is part of a package of ambitious measures designed to reduce Eon’s debt by €7bn. They include asset sales and the axing of 1,300 jobs.Eon has been a victim of Germany’s green energy revolution, known as the Energiewende, which has battered generators of conventional power. The country has seen a huge ramp-up in wind and solar power, which has squeezed energy produced from gas and coal out of the market. Electricity prices have also fallen, making some traditional power stations uneconomic.Eon announced earlier this week that it made a net loss of €16bn in 2016 — the largest in its history.Eon and its rival RWE have responded to the crisis in the power sector by splitting themselves in two. Eon hived off its fossil fuel power plants into Uniper, which floated on the Frankfurt stock exchange in September. RWE pooled its grid, renewables and retail businesses into a subsidiary, Innogy, which debuted in Frankfurt a month later.Eon and RWE have also been hit hard by Germany’s decision in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disastter to switch off all its nuclear reactors by 2022. Berlin announced last year that nuclear operators would have to pay €23.6bn into a new nuclear waste storage fund — much more than they had provisioned for.Eon says it will have to chip in €10bn — €2bn more than it expected to pay.The company this week unveiled plans to lower its debt from €26.3bn at the end of 2016 to about €20bn. It said options include selling some of its shares in Uniper, in which it still owns a 46.65 per cent stake, transferring its stake in the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline into a pension fund, divesting non-strategic businesses and issuing a scrip dividend.The company also said it would lower annual costs by €400m by 2018, resulting in the loss of 1,300 jobs — 1,000 of them in Germany.
127;WM;Waste Management;2017-02-28T07:24:46Z;Interserve suspends dividend to ‘enhance liquidity’ after waste bill soars;;Construction and services group Interserve says it will leave “no stone unturned” in its efforts to untangle itself from troublesome waste contracts with the minimum of damage, but the troubles of recent months have still forced it to suspend dividend payments to investors.The company has swung to a £94.1m pre-tax loss for 2016, against a profit of close to £80m in 2015. Revenues held up well, and in fact grew a little to £3.24bn. But it says “Brexit uncertainties”, higher wage bills, and swelling costs relating to an ‘energy from waste’ plant in Glasgow have hit hard. Earlier this month, the company revealed that early estimates of a £70m price tag for exiting the project were too low. It switched to £160m, knocking shares by some 22 per cent.Today, chairman Glyn Barker said:We have undertaken a detailed and thorough analysis of the situation and made a reasonable, prudent assessment of the potential outcomes. I must stress, however, there remains a range of possible outcomes and it will be some time before we have full visibility of the actual final cost of resolution.CEO Adam Ringrose said the decision to suspend the dividend was “difficult”, noting:While liquidity available to the group is adequate, having put in place new banking facilities that expand and extend our debt capacity, the Board has a medium term objective to reduce our overall indebtedness and enhance liquidity levels further whilst continuing to invest in our core businesses.
128;WM;Waste Management;2017-02-22T09:45:31Z;RWE posts €5.7bn loss and scraps dividend;Utility takes big writedown on German power plants and European assets;RWE unveiled a loss of €5.7bn for 2016 and scrapped its dividend for the second consecutive year as the crisis in Germany’s energy sector deepened.The annual loss was largely due to a massive writedown of €4.3bn on its German power plants, as well as assets in the UK, Netherlands and Turkey. The announcement on the dividend comes almost a year to the day after it scrapped its payout for 2015. However, the utility said it expected to be able to pay a dividend of €0.50 per share for 2017 and at least maintain that level in subsequent years. In early morning trading in Frankfurt the shares were down 1.9 per cent at €13.25.Like other German utilities, RWE has been hit hard by the country’s Energiewende, its radical shift away from nuclear and fossil fuels towards renewables. Energy generated from wind and solar has squeezed conventional power out of the market, leaving many coal and gas plants struggling to turn a profit.RWE and its rival Eon responded to the crisis by splitting themselves in two. Eon hived off its power stations into a new company, Uniper, which listed in Frankfurt in September. RWE placed its green energy and grid businesses into a new subsidiary, Innogy, which floated a month later.However, RWE’s loss shows that prospects continue to look bleak for the sector, despite the restructurings.RWE said it had also been hit by the German government’s decision last year to make the utilities pay €23.6bn towards the final storage of nuclear waste — much more than they had provisioned for. The companies had set aside €17.4bn, but the government imposed a 35.5 per cent “risk premium”, which will free them of any future liabilities on waste storage.RWE said it would pay its share of the clean-up bill — €6.8bn — by July 1 this year. That figure includes a risk premium of €1.8bn, which it said would be included in its 2016 financial statement through an increase in nuclear energy provisions. It added the €1.8bn was one of the reasons for the €5.7bn net loss for 2016.RWE said it had decided to pay the whole amount of €6.8bn this year “in order to indemnify itself from largely politically induced disposal risks and avoid a high, disadvantageous interest burden”. The company said that despite the problems in the energy sector it had reached its operating targets for 2016, posting earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of €5.4bn — a figure it said was at the upper end of the ranges forecast by the company in March last year. It also said it had reduced net debt by €2.8bn year-on-year to €22.7bn.RWE said its board would propose suspending the 2016 dividend for owners of common shares, and put forward a payout of €0.13 per share for holders of preferred shares. Markus Krebber, chief financial officer, said the regulations on nuclear waste disposal were “sensible, but require a great financial effort from RWE”.“Although the decision did not come easily to us . . . we do not see any room for paying a dividend on common shares for fiscal 2016,” he said. He added that through its reorganisation and “enormous cost savings”, RWE had set the stage for reinstating the dividend “in the next and subsequent years”.
129;WM;Waste Management;2017-02-20T17:22:09Z;Interserve shares lose a third as waste project costs rise;UK support services group increases provision on business turning rubbish into biogas;Shares in Interserve fell by almost a third on Monday after the British support services and construction company revealed it had sharply underestimated costs on its business that derives energy from waste.Interserve, which employs 80,000 staff running businesses including probation services and healthcare at home, raised the provision on its failed waste division from £70m to £160m.Most of the charge is linked to a plant in Glasgow, which is designed to turn rubbish into biogas that will provide electricity to the National Grid. Interserve had been hired by Viridor, the waste collection company, to build the £154m plant but the project was hit by substantial delays and difficulties with subcontractors. Interserve was dismissed from the job last November.The company said previously that it would pull out of the waste-to-energy sector. That involved quitting another six waste-to-energy contracts with revenues worth more than £400m.Interserve said on Monday that it expected “a lengthy period of litigation” over its sacking from the Glasgow plant. It also warned it could be harder and take longer than expected to get money back from third parties as its main gasification subcontractor, Energos, was in administration.Some analysts doubted the updated provision was sufficient. Joe Brent, analyst at Liberum, said: “We can have no confidence the provision is adequate.”He added that Interserve “faces a whole range of trading challenges”. These include the increase in the national living wage, which could push up labour costs, and its domiciliary care business, which has been hit by cuts in local authority funding.Adrian Ringrose, the longstanding chief executive of Interserve, announced his plans to leave the company last year but is staying until a replacement is found.Along with other construction companies such as Mears, Carillion and Mitie, Interserve has been shifting its focus from construction to more profitable support services work, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of the business.But some support services companies such as Capita and Mitie have come under pressure in the wake of Britain’s decision to leave the EU as clients held off on making decisions to sign up to long-term contracts.Interserve said the losses on the energy-from-waste contracts had increased its average net debt from £390m in 2016 to an expected £450m in 2017.As a result it has arranged new banking facilities totalling £66m. The company now has a debt facility of £573m, a figure “which we consider is adequate to meet all of our existing and anticipated future commitments”. Interserve said.The shares fell 31 per cent to 228.8p.
130;WM;Waste Management;2017-01-26T05:02:54Z;Maggots help MBA student find wriggle room in the recycling market;‘Weird idea’ uses larvae to fill gap with a green food waste business;The co-founders of a Cambridge recycling technology start-up have found themselves working with thousands of unappealing business partners.The four, who met as students at an environmental hackathon organised by Cambridge university’s entrepreneurship club, hit on the idea of turning unwanted food into animal feed by feeding scraps to an army of black soldier fly larvae.It was a concept that Joe Halstead, the biologist of the group, saw in action at his parents’ pig farm in Devon. The ravenous larvae are not easy on the eye but Halstead had seen how they could transform food waste into fertiliser and wondered what other useful products they could make.The team needed a business plan to turn the idea into a commercial reality. Fortunately one of their number, Matt McLaren, was studying for an MBA at the university’s Judge Business School. His alma mater had also recently started a three-month incubator programme for early stage ventures, called Accelerate Cambridge.“I knew a lot of the staff involved in the programme, so the week after I graduated from my MBA I went up and asked if we could join,” McLaren says. The team was accepted and a month after joining Accelerate Cambridge in October 2015 had formally incorporated a company named Entomics. “We saw that there was room to turn what we thought was a cool backyard concept into a proper business,” says McLaren. “Being accepted on to the Accelerate Cambridge programme was a big step for us and was critical in gaining access to a wide range of mentors and coaches that pointed us in the right direction.”Although McLaren already had a network of friends and supporters from among his MBA classmates, whom he could tap for useful business tips, the Accelerate staff could offer connections with senior executives at multinational companies with bases in Cambridge, such as AstraZeneca and Microsoft. This was particularly useful for advice on the practical challenges Entomics faced, such as setting up a research and development facility. “It was in a way free consulting,” says McLaren.Judge offered the Entomics team free working space to develop their idea but while the founders were grateful, the desks were unsuitable for the prototyping and laboratory work necessary to develop a recycling operation. “Unlike software developers, we cannot sit at home on laptops,” McLaren notes.Fortunately, Halstead had contacts at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (Niab), a plant science research company, which was opening a facility just outside Cambridge and offered the Entomics team free space to set up their research and development laboratory.Another fruitful partnership has been with the retailer J Sainsbury, which agreed to provide out-of-date food. This has enabled Entomics to manufacture its first commercial product, an animal feed, which it is selling to pet supply wholesalers. The arrangement came about after McLaren spoke to the manager of his local store about what Entomics was doing. “I think he was interested because it was a bit of a weird idea,” he says.McLaren says he is thankful for the range of skills he acquired during his MBA that are helpful in his role at Entomics, but he admits that he has been forced to learn new skills quickly as an entrepreneur. The MBA class network has been helpful. “I am constantly calling up my former MBA classmates for advice on . . . different subjects ranging from finance to engineering to law,” he says.Keep up to date with a selection of the most relevant FT articles to help with your education and future career.Entomics has yet to seek equity backers, surviving on the savings of the founding team, competition prize money and grants. Its largest single offer of financial support was a £60,000 cheque from Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Local Enterprise Partnership, a regional development body.A serious equity round will be needed to achieve the company’s big goal for 2017, building its own pilot plant for new product development, such as converting waste into biodiesel. This is an area where the practical skills the team learnt during their time on the Accelerate Cambridge programme will come into their own, says McLaren.“It is . . . practicalities like do you have the right financials on your [presentation] slide deck that mean you don’t walk into a meeting . . . unprepared,” he says. “It is a good way to enter the scary world of investors.”There was a time when you could clearly identify a computer company. Either they sold metal boxes filled with microprocessors or employed programmers to write code.Then the internet arrived and everyone became part of the technology industry, from shops that only sold stuff online to courier companies whose customers can trace their delivery using a GPS signal. The problem is that with each improvement comes irritating jargon that jars.Financiers who used to call themselves something recognisable, such as an insurer or investment fund, are now called fintech entrepreneurs. Those who were once teachers or trainers are in the “edtech” business. Cleantech is not, as you might assume, some sort of digital bath flannel, but the moniker now adopted by businesses involved in what could be seen as environmentally friendly services, such as solar power provision. Agritech has been created to describe the web-savvy farmer.Such descriptors seem to be popular with those most desperate to hype a business plan. If you have an idea that obviously improves our lot you do not need such jargon.The only hope is that one day, someone calls us all out on this lazy bandying around of the word ‘tech’ with the sensible point that almost every company has, or needs to have, some form of digital support. We cannot reach that day soon enough.
131;WM;Waste Management;2017-01-16T03:49:53Z;How do jewellers capture every last particle of gold dust?;An ingenious industry is turning workshop waste into profit;"In a basement on London’s Hatton Garden, a small production team is heating a furnace to 2,000C — a temperature that will obliterate most materials placed within it. Each day, here at precious metals refiner Mastermelt, the furnace is fed a diet of objects collected from jewellers’ workshops — full bags from vacuum cleaners, used wet wipes, blunted sandpaper and even old carpets — in the hope that when the ashes are processed, thousands of pounds’ worth of gold, platinum and more will remain.“We always tell people, don’t throw anything away,” says Gary Williams, a director at Mastermelt, who the previous week paid out £17,000 to a jeweller who had been casually stockpiling the general detritus a workshop produces. “He’d just been saving all this stuff and didn’t realise what it was worth.” Mastermelt makes its money by taking a commission on the value of the scrap metal refined, as well as charging for processing.Part of Mr Williams’ job is to educate jewellers on the financial rewards of hoarding every waste-attracting object and sending the haul — known as a sweep — to a refiner to be melted down and the precious metals reclaimed. Most jewellers will be astute enough to collect hard scrap, also known as lemel, which includes filings caught in animal skins hung beneath workbenches for this very reason, or clippings from claws cut to size when setting a diamond in a ring. Once weighed, the value of this scrap can be easily ascertained, and Mastermelt has an app that can be downloaded to give jewellers access to live prices.But the precious metal they cannot see may bring in surprising amounts of money too. The grinding, filing and buffing required to create jewels by hand or machine send microscopic clouds of precious dust into the air; the dust can land anywhere and be easily transported as it sticks to shoes and clothing. “We went to a workshop in Birmingham and right at the front of the building was a big 4ft sq coconut mat,” says Mr Williams. “Every single person coming in and out of the building walked over that mat, and had been doing so for seven or eight years.“They didn’t think it was worth anything as it wasn’t in the workshop, but they let me take it away. We swept up the dirt and processed it and it came to quite a few thousand pounds.” Another surprise source was a pair of chair covers from a shop in Hatton Garden which were so choked with platinum dust that Mastermelt paid out £3,000 after processing them.Mr Williams has a vault of stories about reclamation and its valuable surprises, but most of them are kept inside the trade. “People don’t really like it being talked about as this is their Christmas bonus,” he says. “Whatever money you make from reclamation is cash flow for your business. It’s found money.”Timing is important in making sure a reclamation is as profitable as possible. First, a jeweller must ensure they have accumulated a large enough sweep to make a profit. Stuart Wibberley, sales director at Cooksongold, another refiner, says processing carries a flat fee of about £300 “whether you have 30 bags or 300”. (Mastermelt says its fees are variable, typically about £4 per kilo processed.) Then there are metal prices: Mr Williams says Mastermelt was “inundated” after the vote for Brexit in June, when the gold price spiked from $1,265 per oz the day before to $1,316 per oz the day after.***Reclaiming precious metal waste has always been a cornerstone of a jewellery workshop’s routine, but the practice has rarely been as sophisticated as it is today. “It really was considered a bonus in the trade,” says Mark Brittain, whose family business, Brittains Marking, creates complex tools for the luxury jewellery industry.He ran the company, which was founded in 1850, from the 1970s until the early 2000s, when he retired from the jewellery trade. He now operates a commercial property business in Birmingham.Mr Brittain recalls old-fashioned sweet jars being filled with tiny coils of metal, a byproduct of engraving cufflinks. The owner of one particular London jeweller that Brittains Marking worked with in the 1980s kept all the engraving scraps that were not requested by customers — Mr Brittain says some clients were indeed savvy enough to ask for theirs back — and cashed it in once a year to fund a cruise aboard the QE2 luxury liner.This was during what some in the trade call “the Brylcreem days”. Jewellery workers were said to slather their hair with that pomade so that they could run their hands, covered in precious metal dust, through it, later retrieving the gold or silver. Mr Brittain has stories of such practices, and Winchester jeweller Jeremy France, whose twice-yearly sweeps at the workshop in his store yield between £6,000 and £8,000 a time, jokingly refers to an industry expression that “we don’t employ people with sweaty hands or turned-up trousers,” both ideal for accumulating valuable dust.Four flights above the jewellery boutique of David Morris on Bond Street, polisher Dave Wadeson, who has been in the business for 40 years, says he once saw floorboards glittering in a workshop when he was an apprentice.“When [the workshop] was taken over by Bentley & Skinner, they took up all the floorboards and the amount of lemel embedded in them was incredible — they found piles of fine grain around the edges,” he says.When Mr Williams worked at wedding ring manufacturer Brown & Newirth, the business moved workshops around 1990 and dismantled its five-storey wooden staircase, which was so impregnated with precious metal that it looked like the “glitter in a marble kitchen top”. It turned out to be worth tens of thousands of pounds — enough to pay for a new staircase and the workshop’s moving costs.And at Cooksongold, which claims to be the UK’s largest precious metals refiner, processing 25,000 jobs a year, Mr Wibberley recalls when a parquet floor in its own factory was ripped up and the precious metals embedded in the wood made it worth £20 per sq m.Large jobs like burning floorboards, carpets or benches tend to happen when a jeweller is moving premises or upgrading. There are less extreme options for the interim, such as specialist vacuuming services or sanding down the top layer of benches and processing the wood dust. The challenge is picking up the day-to-day waste, and it is an art that is being constantly refined — particularly by larger manufacturers with the most to gain.***New technology being introduced to these factories is actually increasing waste, requiring even greater efforts to capture it. One British jewellery manufacturer, which did not wish to be named, has invested in sealed milling machines fitted with vacuums to capture the coils and swarf (sawdust-like chips of precious metal) they dispatch at high speeds. Each has a filter that can separate materials as thin as a micron — much narrower than a human hair.In Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter is Hockley Mint, a British jewellery manufacturer with a turnover of £12m that produces up to 140,000 pieces a year. Gathering scrap and lemel at its 30,000 sq ft factory requires daily cleaning and collecting, as well as the use of localised vacuums. “One of the things we have put in place that is relatively new is that when workers wash their hands we save the paper towels they dry with,” says managing director Gary Wroe.“We got £2,000 back in a 12-month period just from the towels, and that goes straight on our bottom line.”Hockley Mint has also upgraded its windows so that blinds are now encased between panes of glass — their fabric panels were a magnet for precious metal dust — and it also has an on-site laundry to process workers’ clothes.Its biggest investment in precious metal reclamation to date has been an incinerator, which it installed 18 months ago, to melt, but not process, its sweeps. “If you send a bag of material out, you don’t know what’s coming back,” says Mr Wroe, who adds that the value of precious metals it is collecting has increased since taking over its own incinerating.***His concern is one shared by many in the industry. Looking at the accumulation of sludge from settlement tanks placed beneath sinks, grimy mop heads and all manner of other dirt and waste collected in a sweep, it is impossible to estimate how much money has accrued, although there are ways to guess.Jewellers expect to lose metal during the production phase and so will plan for it. At David Morris, the target is a maximum loss of 5 per cent, although its craftsmen believe the working figure is 1 per cent or 2 per cent, providing a guide for what could be reclaimed.We have sticky mats at the doors to get the dust off people’s shoes as they leave the buildingHockley Mint uses scales to give as accurate a forecast as possible. “We measure in and measure out, and keep records so we know approximately what we should get back,” says Mr Wroe.For others, guesstimates are based on experience, and this can lead to friction between jeweller and refiner when discrepancies arise. “Some people have expectations based on history but they haven’t got a complete understanding of what’s going on,” says Mr Williams. The gold price might have changed, he suggests, or the weight of material being processed could be similar but the contents disparate. “In this industry, trust is a big factor,” he says.But that trust goes both ways. Sweeps can take weeks to process and refiners will sometimes advance money based on the expected yield, which can give less scrupulous jewellers an opportunity to run a ruse. “I heard a story about a sweep where the processor took the job, gave the customer an advance based on history and when they looked in the sweep bag, the bottom of it was newspapers,” says Mr Williams.Cooksongold offers its clients advances at its trade counters in London and Birmingham. The business is part of the German Heimerle + Meule group and much of its refining is done at the group’s plants in Spain and Germany. This adds to the processing time, so it will do a pre-melt in London to ascertain what it is sending to Heimerle + Meule.Processing its own pre-melted metal would be the next stage in Hockley Mint’s reclamation journey, but it is one that Mr Wroe has yet to commit to. “That’s a different skill and we’d have to bring the expertise in, so we’d have to work out whether it would be worth it.”While Mr Wroe’s approach to reclamation is far more advanced than many other workshops, he is nonetheless resigned to the fact that he will never catch it all. “We have sticky mats at the doors to get the dust off people’s shoes as they leave the building, otherwise the streets of Hockley would be paved with gold,” he sighs. “And the council should definitely check the sewers.”"
132;WM;Waste Management;2017-01-11T09:13:00Z;Interserve shares climb on falling debt levels;;Shares in Interserve rose over 8 per cent in early trading after the UK support services and construction company said its full year results would be in line with expectations while its debt position would be better than previously guided.Shares rose 23p to 346.5p. The company said its UK construction performance had been “disappointing” but said this would be “broadly offset” by improvements in international construction and equipment services sales.The trading update contained no news on the replacement for long standing chief executive Adrian Ringrose who quit in November “to pursue the next phase of his career”.But the company announced the appointment of Gareth Edwards, a partner with lawyers Pinsent Mason as a non-executive director.Interserve, which is based in Reading and employs 80,000 people worldwide, provides construction and support services to various industries including transport, energy and defence.Shares have recovered strongly since dropping to 276p in May last year, their lowest level in more than 13 years after reporting difficulties at a energy from waste contract in Glasgow.Cost over-runs and delays at the project which Interserve undertook for renewable energy and waste management company Viridor, forced it to take a £70m charge. It subsequently announced in August it was quiting the sector.In Wednesday’s statement, Interserve said the cash outflows caused by its exit from the sector was more than offset by stronger collection and other measures to improve working capital management.As a result the company said it expected the net debt position as at December 31 to be in the range £270m – £280m which it said it was “better than previously guided”.

However, Pennon’s statutory profit before tax fell 4 per cent, to £102.4m. The company booked a £10.7m charge due to restructuring costs, and a £15m hit from movements in the value of financial derivatives.Market moves also had an impact on the company’s defined benefit pensions deficit, which almost tripled, from £40.9m to £115.6m. Lower bond yields increase pension funds’ liabilities, as they make it more expensive to buy a guaranteed stream of income.Pennon announced a £252m investment in a new energy recovery facility, which the company said will add to an expected “significant increase” in earnings from its ERF businesses.It also announced a 6 per cent increase in its interim dividend, to 11.09p per share.Chris Loughlin, Pennon chief executive, said:Pennon has delivered a good performance in the first half of 2016/17 across its water and waste businesses.We believe Pennon is well positioned for the future and is on track to meet management expectations for the full year 2016/17.
134;WM;Waste Management;2016-11-18T05:30:02Z;The Trump factor: can infrastructure rebuild your investments?;UK and US governments need the private sector to help finance projects;"Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised Americans he would spend “double” that promised by his rival, Hillary Clinton, on rebuilding the country’s infrastructure.This was the only campaign pledge he mentioned in his acceptance speech. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” said Mr Trump. “We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.”His election, and his subsequent speech, finally persuaded markets that fiscal stimulus, or government spending, is now in vogue, while letting central banks do all the work is not. Infrastructure, as a spending project, makes sense. The US has chronically underspent on infrastructure over the years, but they are not the only ones. While the American Society of Civil Engineers has projected a $1.44tn funding investment gap between 2016 and 2025 on infrastructure, consultancy McKinsey estimates that $57tn is needed globally by 2030 to finance infrastructure projects.Mr Trump is not the first politician in recent months to promise infrastructure spending. In the UK, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is expected to announce a boost for infrastructure projects in his first Autumn Statement this month. Both UK and US governments expect and need the private sector to step in and help finance projects, potentially creating a large opportunity for retail investors. So what are the potential gains — and pitfalls — of putting your money into a different kind of bricks and mortar?Broad churchInfrastructure covers the basic physical and organisational structures and facilities — buildings, roads, power supplies — needed for a society to operate, according to the dictionary definition. Investors, however, attach a few more elements to it.“We have a set of tests where we’re looking for businesses with stable and predictable cash flows,” says New York-based Jorge Rodríguez, global head of infrastructure debt at Deutsche Asset Management. “Generally they’re monopolistic, they have high barriers to entry. Perhaps in London you can fly from half a dozen airports but you’re probably going to fly from the one closest to your house,” he said.Beyond that, says Mr Rodriguez, subsectors include energy and utilities businesses such as those providing gas, water and waste disposal, alongside those involved in improving transport. This could be building or operating motorways, airports, seaports — “everything you can get paid for operating or making available”, said Mr Rodriguez.But the term also includes “social” infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals and court rooms, as well as more specialised infrastructure that requires high levels of technological prowess. “That’s telecoms towers, and increasingly some folks are putting [broadband] fibre into that, also things like waste management systems, car parking and so on,” says Mr Rodriguez.The issue for investors looking to the US for growth is that it’s impossible to tell which of these distinct asset classes Mr Trump will prioritise. “Until we know the specifics about what type of infrastructure [he] will focus on I think different stocks will be impacted,” says Dave Mazza, of US asset manager State Street.Illiquid alternativesAt the moment, it is relatively difficult for retail investors to gain direct exposure to infrastructure, an illiquid asset class that should be held for the long term, and is better suited to pension funds, which have to meet long term liabilities.In the UK, pension funds have piled into infrastructure following years of low bond yields, encouraged by hopes that the government reforms might make it easier for them to pool assets and invest in big projects. The problem, according to pensions consultancy Willis Towers Watson, has been a lack of clarity over the expected yield when financing large projects.Pension funds are also reluctant to invest in projects that are yet to be built, which could face unforeseen problems during construction, pushing up costs and causing losses to investors. This leaves funds more keen on buying and selling existing infrastructure assets, rather than funding the building of new ones, says David Scott, partner at global consultancy firm Deloitte. “At the moment there is more capital pouring into the bucket of secondary investments,” he says.An example of the fierce competition for ready-made infrastructure investments is London City Airport, which increased in value by just under £1.8bn between 1995 and 2016. While it was bought for £2bn by a Canadian-led consortium of pension funds earlier this year, Irish financier Dermot Desmond paid just £23.5m for it in 1995.There are only really two routes for retail investors to get in on the action: through listed investment trusts, or through shares of companies focused on infrastructure. The shares can be bought directly, or held through an active or passive fund. There are a handful of equity funds holding shares in monopolistic companies that manage infrastructure, rather than build or own it, like rail operators or toll road managers.Where to investFT Money deputy editor James Pickford is joined by investment reporter Aime Williams, Lex columnist Alan Livsey and wealth correspondent Hugo Greenhalgh to discuss how to invest in toll roads, fine wines and luxury handbagsTo invest directly in infrastructure, rather than by buying shares in equity funds, there are seven UK-focused investment trusts. The largest is the UK-focused £2.1bn HICL infrastructure fund, managed by InfraRed Capital Partners. The fund has helped finance roads, schools and a high-speed rail line in the Netherlands. Its share price total return has been 46.3 per cent over three years, compared to a FTSE World share price return of 44 per cent.The second-largest, the £1.7bn 3i Infrastructure fund, focuses on investing in greenfield private-public partnership projects in the UK and Europe. Its share price total return has been 64.1 per cent over three years, compared to 16.7 per cent on the FTSE Europe. That has decreased over one year to 16.5 per cent, as its share price has pushed upwards. The fund is also relatively expensive, with ongoing charges of 1.36 per cent, which is bumped up to 2.86 per cent if the performance fee is triggered.Although the US holdings of these trusts are small at best, Simon Elliot, investment trust analyst at broker Winterflood, says US infrastructure projects “could be of interest” to some of their management boards — but warns that “any new projects are likely to be some years away from being mature enough for these funds to get involved.” The further downside is that these funds are trading on a premium to their net asset value, meaning investors will pay more for shares than the underlying assets are worth.Steven Richards, associate director at Thesis Asset Management, says he is considering “taking profits” from the investment trusts he holds and investing the money in more globally focused open-ended funds and ETFs instead. “This will get us more global exposure,” he says. While investment trusts tend to invest directly in infrastructure projects, open-ended funds will hold equity in related companies.The equity routeLazard Global Listed Infrastructure Equity and Legg Mason RARE infrastructure are two such funds, both with around a third of their investments in the US. Lazard holds shares in US companies such as Norfolk Southern, and Italian company Atlantia, while Legg Mason’s fund has stakes in Sempra Energy and American Tower Corp. There is also First State Global Listed Infrastructure, the infrastructure equity fund with the highest US exposure with just under 50 per cent invested in the US.However, wealth managers are torn on whether specialist infrastructure funds are a better bet than more general US or global equity funds. The latter may well also end up playing the infrastructure theme ahead of a hard-to-ignore “shift in economic management in the US,” says Jason Hollands, managing director at wealth manager Tilney Bestinvest.By thinking about what might happen further down the supply chain, equity managers more broadly can still get some exposure to the asset class. “If you look at what Trump was actually talking about, it’s not necessarily going to benefit operating companies that are up and running,” says Mr Richards of Thesis. “He’s talking about building roads and bridges, so you want to look beyond ‘classic’ infrastructure and look at the supply chain.”Energy, commodity and materials companies will all stand to receive a boost in business from any infrastructure spending. Simon Clinch, US equities fund manager at Invesco Perpetual, says he has been building up his exposure to these stocks through the year to capture an infrastructure theme. “Companies that will provide cement is an infrastructure theme, but also the sand that will be used to extract shale oil,” he says.If Mr Trump carries through his plan to spend “double” what Mrs Clinton had promised on infrastructure, the US construction industry should see an uplift of around 30 per cent, says Mr Clinch. Even so, he warns that just as infrastructure is a long-term investment, the benefits may not show up on the balance sheets of construction companies for quite some time.“The first time we’ll see this come through will be around 2018,” says Mr Clinch. “We’re going to take time out to understand what this means for the earnings of those companies, rather than jumping into machinery stocks or whatever.”Even then, it’s not clear whether US stocks are the best ones to jump into. Dave Mazza of State Street points out that a company doesn’t only earn dollars just because it is a US brand — and gaining exposure to the US infrastructure game through equities is a difficult game. “There’s no perfect way,” said Mr Mazza of State Street. “If you look at [US] industrials, many of those companies have a large element of overseas exposure.”On the other hand, non-US companies might be winning US construction contracts, and although Mr Trump is no fan of international trade deals, there’s nothing to say that this won’t continue. “I think a lot of what he’s saying is aimed at Asia and China,” says Mr Mazza. “We don’t have much information, but some of your larger European companies might benefit as well.”What now?For retail investors keen to invest in the UK, Mr Hammond may have something up his sleeve in his first Autumn Statement next Wednesday. The Treasury, which is keen to give retail investors access to infrastructure investing, is drawing up proposals for new “infrastructure bonds”.Discussions have already mooted the idea of setting up a new “infrastructure bank”, modelled on the state-owned British Business Bank. Although experts told the Financial Times that the new bank would be more likely to invest in “operating assets” that had already been built and needed refinancing, it could also potentially help fund new projects. This would help both pension funds and retail investors, allowing the government to underwrite some of the risks in exchange for financing.As for Mr Trump, questions remain about whether he will be able to pass the necessary bills by his fellow Republicans, many of whom, like Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, are against the idea of borrowing too much money. “Is he going to get the infrastructure spend?” asks David Stubbs, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “This is a politician that has promised everything to everyone.”What is expected to put the wind in Mr Trump’s sails, however, is the consensus from both parties on the need to renew US infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers has projected a $1.44tn infrastructure funding investment gap between 2016 and 2025.“We’re still trying to sort through what this means,” says Mr Rodriguez of Deutsche. “I won’t make any predictions. Generally there are cautionary tales in other parts of the market but on the whole infrastructure is good news for us in the US.”Investors looking for a cheaper alternative to an actively managed infrastructure funds could invest in a range of passive infrastructure funds on offer.The funds, which are exchange traded funds tracking specialist indices, buy a range of infrastructure related equities according to a specially compiled index from one of S&P, MSCI, FTSE, Morningstar, or Macquarie.S&P’s global index tracks 75 companies ranging across utilities and industrials, which make up 80 per cent of the fund, with energy stocks making up the remainder. All of the major ETF providers, including Deutsche’s x-trackers, BlackRock’s iShares and State Street’s SPDR offer funds tracking this index. Around 40 per cent of the companies held by these trackers are US companies, with the rest being European or Asian.Rival index provider MSCI has created a World Infrastructure Index, but unlike S&P’s, is more weighted towards telecommunications. Just over 42 per cent of its constituent stocks are in telecommunications companies, with its top three holdings being AT&T, Verizon and Vodafone. For investors, this might be a less helpful play on the infrastructure theme; Mr Trump has previously committed to blocking AT&T’s $85bn bid for Time Warner, while many of the European telecoms companies in this index may suffer from the dollar exchange rate.Morningstar has a newer and slightly different index — it is still built around an infrastructure theme, but is multi-asset and buys both stocks and debt in equal measure. Like S&P’s index, the majority of its investments are in utilities and industrials."
135;WM;Waste Management;2016-11-02T04:02:16Z;How spectral analysis could make food waste a thing of the past;Camera could spell the end of sniffing dodgy food;A friend taught me a trick to tell if pineapples are ready to be eaten. Tug gently at one of the spiky leaves on top and, if it comes away easily, the fruit has reached the right level of ripeness. I find this works pretty well, but for the most part, telling when food is at its peak is an inexact science of sniffing and prodding.A huge amount of food is wasted. Roughly a third of all the food produced globally — about 1.3bn tonnes — is lost each year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.Waste happens at all levels of the process — from harvesting to transport to consumers throwing away perfectly good food because it has passed the use-by date.But what if there was a smartphone app that could tell you whether food was still safe to eat?This is not completely in the realm of science fiction. Abi Ramanan, co-founder of ImpactVision, is developing hyperspectral imaging software that could tell you how fresh a piece of beef is, or how ripe an avocado, by analysing how they reflect light across the electromagnetic spectrum, beyond the range of visible light.This is the kind of technology that Nasa uses to study planets and monitor the surface of the earth. Deeper spectroscopic analysis reveals the chemical make-up of the materials. The concept applies as much to what is on a plate as what is on a planet.“Every object — an apple, bread, meat — absorbs and reflects light in a unique way,” says Ms Ramanan. Even different types of meat, from beef to horse meat, have different spectral fingerprints, so you would be able to verify the bovine origin — or otherwise — of your favoured supermarket meatball. At the moment, ImpactVision is working on how to apply hyperspectral imaging to meat production and plans to install cameras on conveyor belts in packing plants.Ms Ramanan says that analysing the infrared spectrum will even indicate the beef’s tenderness and what its acidity level is, an indicator of its eating quality. “Up to now the food industry has relied on visual inspections, destructive tests and pulling random samples off for testing,” says Ms Ramanan. “It is inexact. Our technology can tell you the pH [acidity] of every piece of meat and its tenderness without it having to be touched.”Anything that does not match the desired 5.5pH level required for steak, for example, can be pulled off the production line before it is packed and shipped. Trials have shown that the technology could greatly decrease waste in the supply chain as it can help meat producers to detect problems earlier, so avoiding costly recalls of food that might spoil if shipped.If meat can be classified more easily, it can be used more efficiently. Meat with a pH of above 5.5 can still be used for ground mince, for example, but should not be sold as steak.Bananas, for which the exact state of ripeness is crucial when it comes to transporting them, could be another product that would benefit from the technology, Ms Ramanan says.It could be used to detect contamination — such as in the case of melamine-laced baby-milk formula in China in 2008.The technology offers many non-food uses. Optina Diagnostics, based in Quebec, Canada, is using similar technology to scan people’s retinas to detect Alzheimer’s disease, while Texas-based Rebellion Photonics uses it to scan oil rigs for dangerous gasses.One day, Ms Ramanan says, the sensors will be small and cheap enough to put in a smartphone. So far, hyperspectral imaging cameras are too big and expensive for this. BaySpec, based in San Jose, California, sells handheld hyperspectral cameras for several thousand dollars a piece.But prices could fall as the market grows. Israel-based Unispectral has raised $7.5m to develop a hyper-spectral digital camera that could eventually fit into a phone.“People in Silicon Valley say this will happen in a year. Others say it will take 10 years, or never happen. I think it is somewhere in the middle,” says Ms Ramanan.At that point my days of tugging pineapple leaves may be over. We might be able to say goodbye to those inexact and wasteful use-by dates on food labels. One thing is certain — it would make photographing and posting pictures of food online more interesting.

A listing at that level will raise £212m and give it a market value of £450m, according to IFR, which earlier reported the new price level.Biffa’s decision followed on the heels of TI Fluid Systems, the auto parts maker, which on Thursday blamed volatile markets for its decision to pull its initial public offering. Pure Gym Group, the no-frills exercise group, also said earlier this week that it was abandoning its flotation because of market uncertainty, while in Germany real estate group IVG Immobilien halted plans to list OfficeFirst.Demand for new listings has waned in recent weeks, even as the UK benchmark FTSE 100 has reached record levels. But in dollar terms, the index is down after a sharp drop in sterling.
137;WM;Waste Management;2016-10-12T18:57:31Z;Biffa looks to salvage IPO with price cut;;Biffa, the waste management company, is planning to cut the price of its shares in a last-ditch attempt to salvage plans for a £270m stock market listing.Talks with bankers and shareholders were expected to continue late on Wednesday night after investors failed to raise enough demand for the shares, report Gill Plimmer and Arash Massoudi in London.People close to the talks said the owners were “absolutely determined to get it over the wire” despite the difficult market. Should the deal go ahead it will be one of the biggest initial public offerings since Britain voted to leave the European Union.Instead, it may become the second stock market listing to be pulled this month. Earlier this week Pure Gym Group said it was abandoning its flotation because of market uncertainty.Biffa — which collects, processes and disposes waste and recyclables for 2.4m households — had planned to use proceeds from the IPO to repay debt, invest in technology and make acquisitions in the industry, which has been hit by a fall in prices for recycled goods. It is likely to look at selling itself should the IPO fail.The company is based solely in the UK, where it has an 8 per cent share of the country’s fragmented recycling and waste collection industry. It handles about 6.6m tonnes of waste — approximately a third of which will be converted into energy and sold back to Britain’s National Grid for use as electricity in 250,000 homes.Biffa, which started collecting from London’s coal-fired power stations 100 years ago, was taken over by hedge funds Angelo Gordon, Avenue Capital Group and Sankaty Advisors in 2013 after running into trouble following a heavily leveraged buyout.The company had previously been owned by Severn Trent, but was demerged in 2006 and taken private in 2008 by Global Infrastructure Partners and Montagu Private Equity.Biffa is being advised on the flotation by Rothschild, while Citi, JPMorgan, HSBC and Peel Hunt are handling the IPO

VGG shareholders will receive €286m in cash and 24 per cent ownership of the combined group.Shanks will raise €130m from new debt facilities. It also announced it will raise £96m through an issue of shares in a three-for-eight rights issue.Investors welcomed the deal, with Shanks shares up nearly 6 per cent to 106.5p.The purchase will create a business with 7,500 employees and combined revenues of around €1.7bn. The enlarged group will become the largest waste company in the Benelux region, overtaking Suez of France, with a geographical footprint that covers Britain, Hungary, Germany, Portugal, France and Canada.“This is a transformational deal with a compelling industrial rationale that is fully aligned with our growth strategy,” said Peter Dilnot, chief executive at Shanks.He and chief financial officer Toby Woolrych will lead the combined group, while VGG’s head staff will support integration for a short period after the deal has been completed. The name of the merged business has yet to be decided.Andrew Shepherd-Barron, analyst at Peel Hunt, said synergies looked achievable. “It’s a deal that makes good industrial and strategic sense,” he added.The purchase comes amid a bout of consolidation in the recycling industry, which has been hit by fall in prices for recycled goods.Biffa, the UK waste management business, has announced plans to raise £270m in a stock market listing, which it will use to repay debt, invest in technology and make acquisitions in the industry.VGG is owned by former creditors as well as hedge funds Beach Point Capital Management and Capula Investment Management.Shanks was founded as a construction company in Scotland in 1880, where it was previously known as Shanks & McEwan. It was predominantly a Benelux-based company even before the merger, with about three-quarters of its revenue coming from the region. It moved into the waste landfill business in 1988.
139;WM;Waste Management;2016-09-23T10:01:37Z;Don’t throw our bins away;‘Bins show that a society has a well-funded and well-organised state, where levels of trust are high’;"A few months ago, I was walking through central London with an American friend, when he started looking for a bin — or “trash can” — to dispose of the remains of his lunch. To his irritation, he couldn’t find one.“It’s because of the IRA,” I said, explaining that three decades ago, British security forces removed most metal bins in stations and the City of London because the IRA kept planting bombs in them. In 1991, for example, a bomb exploded in a bin in Victoria station, injuring commuters as the metal turned into shrapnel.My friend was startled: he had grown up in a more innocent world, where citizens took it as a God-given right that they could dispose of their “trash”. “So what do you do with this?” he asked with distaste, waving the wrapper.I shrugged nonchalantly and realised that having grown up amid the scourge of the IRA in London, I had a different sense of “normality”. To me it seemed “normal” that there were so few bins in London — in fact, I am constantly surprised to see how many receptacles still line the streets of New York (where I now live).This is a powerful symbol of our changing times, and one that could become doubly emotive in the weeks ahead. Last week, America was left reeling after a New Jersey resident, seemingly motivated by Islamist extremism, allegedly planted homegrown bombs in locations around New York, including in a bin and near a dumpster truck.Thankfully, by the standards of modern terrorism, these bombs caused only limited damage. But since they exploded in the self-obsessed, media-saturated world of New York, they sparked endless television coverage — and shots of mangled bins.Thus far, nobody — not even Donald Trump — has responded by calling for a complete ban on bins but it may just be a matter of time. London is no longer an outlier. Tokyo took the bulk of its bins out of its subway stations two decades ago, following a sarin gas attack. More recently, Australian cities have either removed bins from train stations or sealed them shut.Some towns in continental Europe are now quietly following suit. And even in New York, where bins and dumpsters are a way of life, there are hints of a policy change. Some subway stations have removed trash cans and there are no receptacles in the immediate surroundings of the World Trade Center site.Is this a sensible step? Part of me wants to howl “no”. After all, the loss of bins is not just an inconvenience; it is also a dismal symbol of what is wrong with the modern world.Think about it. When public bins first started to become ubiquitous in modern cities, they highlighted the creation of a more civilised world. Never mind the fact that bins keep the streets clean; they also show that a society has a well-funded and well-organised state, where levels of trust are high.Losing them shows the reverse — that trust and confidence can unravel in the face of terrorism and fear. Indeed, the symbolism is so stark that I am tempted to argue that it is a mistake to “give in” by removing those bins; in statistical terms, the risk of actually dying in a terrorist bomb attack is exceptionally small.But there is another, more optimistic way to think about the issue, namely that removing those bins might just deliver some benefits. The downside of having plenty of bins available in the 20th century was that it encouraged people to toss rubbish away. If people were forced to pay more attention to it they might handle it more responsibly, reducing or recycling it. There are signs that this has already occurred: when the New York City government tried removing some bins from subway stations on an experimental basis a couple of years ago, the amount of rubbish fell by more than 50 per cent.And there is another silver lining: necessity breeds invention. After London introduced its ban on metal bins, entrepreneurs responded by producing new transparent receptacles, examples of which can now be seen in London train stations. Some engineers are going even further by creating bins with smart technology. In theory, these cannot only detect hazards such as bombs but also promote more recycling and intelligent waste management.Of course, this will not comfort anyone who is worrying about terrorist threats, or remove the sense of irritation that anybody (such as my friend) feels when they can’t throw away a lunch wrapper. But the next time you spot a bin in an urban centre, take a moment to ponder the symbolism of it all. If nothing else, this tale shows that progress does not always go in a straight line, especially when it comes to the things in life that we would rather throw away than talk about.gillian.tett@ft.comIllustration by Shonagh Rae"
140;WM;Waste Management;2016-09-15T11:55:24Z;Biffa set to raise £270m in UK IPO;UK waste management business will be valued at £1bn after October listing;Biffa, the UK waste management business, has announced plans to raise £270m in a stock market listing in October, marking the biggest initial public offering in the UK since the country voted in June to leave the EU.The company — which collects, processes and disposes waste and recyclables for 2.4m households — said it would use the IPO to repay debt, invest in technology and make acquisitions in the industry, which has been hit by a fall in prices for recycled goods. The listing values Biffa at around £1bn.The UK waste market is forecast to grow 5 per cent a year to £18.5bn by 2020, driven by the expanding population and an increase in regulation, Biffa said. It said it earned around £927.5m in revenues in the 2016 financial year while underlying operating profits were £62.5m.After stock market volatility that followed the Brexit vote delayed some listings, appetite appears to be returning. Pure Gym Group, the fitness chain, on Wednesday said it would raise about £190m in a London IPO. Software group Misys is planning to return to the market with a mooted capitalisation of £5bn and Telefónica is expected to list mobile operator O2 at £8bn-£10bn.Biffa had expected the EU referendum vote to delay the listing until spring next year but has decided to press ahead next month.The company is based solely in the UK, where it has an 8 per cent share of the country’s fragmented recycling and waste collection industry.It handles about 6.6m tonnes of waste — approximately a third of which will be converted into energy and sold back to Britain’s National Grid for use as electricity in 250,000 homes.Rubbish could come good as bin slinger heads back to the marketAlmost half of the company’s revenues come from its industrial and commercial division, where it serves customers including supermarket group J Sainsbury. But its most profitable work is in municipal services, where it collects waste for 36 local authorities in the UK.Just 50 per cent of UK recycling and waste collection is privatised and Biffa expects this market to expand as the government’s austerity measures drive greater outsourcing of cleaning, waste and recycling collection services.Biffa, which started collecting from London’s coal-fired power stations 100 years ago, was taken over by hedge funds Angelo Gordon, Avenue Capital Group and Sankaty Advisors in 2013 after running into trouble following a heavily leveraged buyout.The company had previously been owned by Severn Trent, but was demerged in 2006 and taken private in 2008 by Global Infrastructure Partners and Montagu Private Equity.Biffa said on Thursday that its offer would consist of new shares issued by the company as well as the sale of existing shares by shareholders.It is being advised on the flotation by Rothschild, while Citi, JPMorgan, HSBC and Peel Hunt are handling the IPO.
141;WM;Waste Management;2016-09-15T06:26:36Z;Biffa plans to bring rubbish to London Stock Exchange;;Just what the markets need: more rubbish.Biffa, the UK waste management business, has confirmed plans to list on the London Stock Exchange in October.The company, a stalwart of the cleaning-up industry with a 100 years of history behind it, says it made some £927.5m in revenues in the 2016 financial year. Underlying operating profits were £62.5m.It of course reckons there’s money in them there bin bags. “The UK waste market is forecast to grow at a 5.0 percent to £18.5bn by FY 20, driven by population / household growth, UK regulation requiring further separate collections and treatment and an increasingly complex supply chain, supporting Biffa’s strategic positioning,” it says.CEO Ian Wakelin said:These are exciting times for Biffa, one of the UK’s leading waste management businesses.We believe there are multiple levers for continued organic growth and margin expansion in a market underpinned by structural growth drivers which favour Biffa’s service-oriented business model. Moreover, we operate in a fragmented market providing opportunities for further highly synergistic in-fill acquisitions.
142;WM;Waste Management;2016-08-23T11:47:29Z;Recycling industry feels strain of falling prices;Plastics have suffered worst decline;In a cathedral-sized warehouse, the rubbish from 1m households is being sorted on huge conveyor belts.At the exit, ready to be carted away by truck, are large bales of plastic, which will remain in Britain for reprocessing as water bottles, and bundles of paper and cardboard, which will be shipped to China for reuse as packaging for iPhones and TVs.Two years ago Biffa, which runs the plant in north London, would have received £400 for each tonne of recycled plastic. But now — with a glut of oil on the market — it receives just £300. A bundle of recycled paper and cardboard used to cost £80 a tonne three years ago. In June it slumped to just £55, according to figures from Let’s Recycle UK, the trade website.The fall in prices for recycled goods has put pressure on every part of the waste management industry. “Recycling is a commodities business,” says Ian Wakelin, chief executive of Biffa, which collects waste from more than 2.4m households for 36 local authorities in the UK.“Everything we do competes with virgin material prices. The industry used to be happy to take the risk of commodity price volatility. But when it became clear that this was a prolonged slump, that became difficult.”Plastic has suffered most. With new plastics made from the byproducts of oil and gas production, it has become cheaper for the manufacturers of water bottles, ice cream containers and yoghurt pots to buy their raw materials new, rather than recycled.But nearly all material prices have plummeted. The price of steel cans has nearly halved over the past two years from £125 a tonne two years ago to between £45 and £70 in June, while the price of clothes in textile banks has dropped by about £100 to just £160 a tonne.For some waste management companies, the pressure has become unbearable. Although most companies earn the bulk of revenues from collecting waste, “the recycling business still needs to be profitable in its own right”, says Mr Wakelin.Kier Group, the FTSE 250 construction and environmental services company, decided to leave the industry after warning in July that it would take a £33m loss on its recycling business in the 2016 financial year.Many of Kier’s eight to 10 year contracts were agreed years ago when oil was $80 a barrel. But with the price now at $40 to $50 a barrel, Kier said it would pull out of recycling as contracts came to an end. The division “continues to be affected by the low oil price and, consequently, the price of recyclates,” the company said.The London-based Closed Loop, Britain’s biggest plastic bottle recycling plant, cited competition with virgin materials when it was put into administration in May. It has since been acquired by Veolia, the French waste management company, which can bring economies of scale to the business.Others such as Pennon, which owns Viridor, the waste management company, have mothballed plants, while many — including Cory Environmental Services, which served four local authorities, have been taken over amid a wave of consolidation in the industry. Biffa, for example, has made nine acquisitions in the past year, helping operating profits to rise from £49.1m to £62.5m in the year to March 2016.For the most part, however, the larger companies have survived by renegotiating contracts with city authorities, preserving their recycling business albeit at slimmer margins.“Every time a contract comes up we have to try to raise the price and negotiate a risk share,” says Mr Wakelin. “The one thing we don’t want is to be locked into fixed seven or eight year contracts.”Until recently, recycling could be lucrative for town halls in Britain. When commodity prices were high, recycling companies would sometimes even pay local authorities for waste that had been cleanly separated by households and business. But with prices for recycled products low, companies are passing on the costs to town halls so that they share the volatility in the market.Chris Loughlin, chief executive of Pennon, which services about 150 local authorities in Britain, expects the trend toward “sharing commodity risk and reward with clients” to increase. The past few years have been “difficult as a result of weak commodity prices”, he says.This has put pressure on town halls. Marcus Gover, chief executive of Wrap, which lobbies for the recycling industry, says it is a “challenge for local authorities”. “Councils are facing a tough time so although it’s a small part of their budgets, every penny counts. They will be trying hard to get the best price,” he says.The upside is that councils could also benefit under the risk-share model if commodity prices rise. Regardless of this, Mr Wakelin argues that the business model needs to change if recycling rates are to be driven higher and the industry put on a more sustainable basis.With concerns about Brexit and a potential recession mounting, it is an awkward time for the recycling industry to be under pressure.The environmental benefits of recycling are well accepted but much of the progress has been driven by legislation from the EU. In the UK about 45 per cent of household rubbish is recycled — up from less than 5 per cent in 2000 — but under EU targets this should rise to 50 per cent by 2020. Ultimately — at least without subsidies — landfill is always cheaper, though less environmentally friendly.Mr Wakelin is relaxed about the effects of Brexit on the industry. “I don’t think the government would row back on recycling,” he says. “I have every confidence we can work it out.”
143;WM;Waste Management;2016-07-24T23:00:03Z;Veolia gives UK £750m vote of confidence;Post-Brexit boost as French services group plans 600 jobs and investment drive;France’s Veolia is expecting to create about 600 jobs in the UK over the next five years as part of a £750m investment, in a welcome sign of business confidence in the country following the vote to leave the EU.The French water and waste management group said it wanted reassurance from the government about its post-Brexit commitment to green energy as its investment plans include schemes to convert waste material into low-carbon electricity and heat.Estelle Brachlianoff, head of Veolia in the UK, said that while the EU referendum result had not altered the fundamental appeal of the British market, she was anxious for clarity on energy policy.“Everything was thrown up in the air [by the Brexit vote] so I’m looking for reassurance that the government is going to keep the same direction of travel on green energy,” she told the Financial Times.Her comments reflect uncertainty in business circles about the implications of the move by Theresa May, the new prime minister, to merge the Department of Energy and Climate Change into an enlarged business ministry under the leadership of Greg Clark.However, Veolia’s decision to press ahead with its UK investment drive despite the political turbulence will be seen as a vote of confidence after mixed signals about the economic impact of the referendum.The closely watched Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ survey of activity in the manufacturing and services sectors on Friday showed its sharpest drop for seven years. A survey by the Bank of England’s regional agents had earlier found “no clear signs” of a slowdown.Veolia’s plans include a new agreement with Hertfordshire council to build a 33MW waste-fired power station in Rye House, 20 miles north of London, at a cost of about £270m.The scheme will add to an expected rush of French investment in UK energy infrastructure this week, with EDF, another Paris-based utility, due to give the long-awaited go-ahead to its £18bn plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset.The new plants proposed by Veolia will make a more modest contribution to UK energy needs but Ms Brachlianoff said that, in the long term, waste-fuelled power had the potential to meet 2 per cent of total demand, compared with 7 per cent from the Hinkley reactors.Incinerating waste to produce heat and electricity is not considered a fully renewable energy source but it emits less carbon dioxide than burning coal — and avoids the methane emissions that result from burying waste in landfills. Environmentalists have raised concern about air pollution from burning waste but Ms Brachlianoff said filters were able to remove dangerous particles and gases before they enter the atmosphere.Veolia already operates a 35MW plant in south-east London with the capacity to produce enough power for 48,000 homes, as well as heat and hot water for 2,500 local properties, from 420,000 tonnes of waste per annum.The French group, which employs 14,000 people in the UK, also works with businesses to recover value from industrial waste.Veolia, spun off from the Vivendi conglomerate 16 years ago, generated just over half its €25bn revenues last year from waste and energy, with the rest from water. The UK is the group’s largest market outside France, with annual sales of about £2bn.

A sixth man managed to scramble free from the rubble and was taken to a local hospital with a broken leg.The accident at Hawkeswood Metal, an iron and steel scrap recycling operation in the Nechells area of the city, happened shortly after the plant opened on Thursday morning.The fire service said the men killed were working next to a “large concrete structure containing metal” when it collapsed.A specialist team of firefighters was on the scene with heavy lifting gear and cutting equipment to recover their bodies.West Midlands Fire Service told reporters outside the gates of the plant “the scene is an extremely challenging one for us, involving significant tonnage of concrete and metals and a structure that is still unstable”.David Cameron, the prime minister, tweeted: “Shocked to hear about the tragedy in Birmingham. My thoughts are with the families of those involved.”West Midlands Ambulance Service said: “Sadly, there was nothing that could be done to save the five men.”The fire service said its control room had received reports that a person was stuck and suffering cardiac arrest.Peter Mathews, chairman at Black Country Metals, a leading metals trader, says Hawkeswood Metal is one of scores of small companies in the region which collect and sort iron and steel scrap derived from local car factories, engineering works and the demolition sector.He says Birmingham and the Black Country — historically the metal-bashing centre of the UK economy — is today home to a huge recycling industry, with the region processing an estimated 10m tonnes of scrap a year.“There are more scrap metal operations concentrated in the West Midlands than anywhere else in the UK,” he says.He says 30 years ago much of it would have gone back into furnaces in the region to make steel and other metal products but today 80 per cent of the scrap is exported in containers to China and other fast-growing developing markets.The plant was the scene of a large fire in February, when 700 tonnes of scrap metal went up in flames.According to the company website, Hawkeswood Metal Recycling processes more than 500,000 tonnes of scrap metal each year..

This is a truly transformational deal for Shanks. Our two businesses are highly complementary and a combination would create a leading Benelux waste-to-product business, with enhanced geographic coverage, capabilities and technologies as well as significant synergy potential. We look forward to working with the VGG team to finalise the terms and financing of the transaction and delivering attractive returns for shareholders in the Combined Group.

The IPO is tipped for spring 2017.Ian Wakelin, chief executive, has said in the past that he considers the stock market the right home for Biffa because of the need for investment ahead of an expected wave of consolidation, fuelled by new technologies that convert rubbish into recycled products or energy.The company has made eight acquisitions in the past year, most recently the £13.5m purchase of Cory Environmental Group’s waste collection business, which includes a number of local authority contracts.Newly disclosed figures show that operating profits rose from £49.1m to £62.5m in the year to March 2016, while sales grew 5.6 per cent to £927.5m.Based almost exclusively in the UK, Biffa has an 8 per cent share of the country’s recycling and waste collection market and employs more than 6,000 people. It handles about 6.6m tonnes of waste a year — approximately a third of which will be converted into energy and sold back to Britain’s National Grid for use as electricity in 250,000 homes.Almost half of Biffa’s revenues come from its industrial and commercial division, where its customers include supermarket group J Sainsbury, sandwich chain Pret A Manger and Royal Mail. Its most profitable work is in municipal services, where it collects waste from more than 1.5m households for 36 local authorities in the UK.Biffa started collecting from London’s coal-fired power stations 100 years ago. It was taken over by the US groups in 2013 after running into trouble following a heavily leveraged buyout.The company was previously owned by Severn Trent but was demerged in 2006 and then bought for £1.7bn by private buyers in 2008 in a deal funded by £1bn of debt.Commenting on the past year’s results, Mr Wakelin said: “We have continued to take advantage of the drive towards industry consolidation in a highly fragmented market. Biffa is a natural consolidator in the industry with the technology, scale, reputation and expertise to grow and build upon its leading and growing market positions.”
147;WM;Waste Management;2016-05-17T12:41:58Z;Workplace waste, recycling and the night they took the bins away;Leaving workers nowhere to dump their rubbish makes it harder to recycle, writes Pilita Clark;My desk at the Financial Times is mostly very dull.There is a computer and a phone, surrounded by a pile of guff I keep meaning to read and, because I am the FT’s environment correspondent, a wildlife calendar someone sent me that this month shows a photo of a large toad getting ready to spawn.But down on the floor by my right, there is something much more interesting, an object so rare and endangered I am not even sure it is legal: a bin.Actually, it is an acting bin, an empty cardboard box nicked from near the stationery cupboard, one of many makeshift containers I have used since The Great Disappearance of the sturdy metal office bins that once sat conveniently next to every desk.These all vanished one night, replaced by a scattering of communal recycling containers with bossy, confusing signs about what sort of rubbish should go where.This sort of set-up is becoming the norm in offices everywhere and, as so often with workplace innovations, it does not always go well.I know of a company where a senior employee found his personal bin had disappeared and the new recycling containers were about 20 feet away from his desk.Enraged, he threw his coffee cup, cake and a piece of fruit halfway towards the recycling station, yelling at a hapless passing building manager in charge of the new arrangements: “I could only reach that far, now you clean it up.”There is no excuse for that type of behaviour, not least because it leads to books like Who moved my cheese? and other dreary motivational literature about overcoming resistance to change.But the question of who moved my bin is worth asking because it turns out that, if you really want to improve office recycling, you should leave the bin where it is.The evidence for this is all around my office, where recycling station dissidents generally take the sneakier course of resistance that I favour.A number of colleagues use a spot on the floor next to their chair as a kind of bin-without-walls, creating a swelling mound of litter they eventually haul off to one of the authorised recycling containers, more or less hoping they have picked the right one.Another has pinched an old-fashioned metal bin, like the ones we lost, from a meeting room. The man at the desk next to me uses a box just like mine, though admittedly only because I put it there to stem the flow of empty crisp packets lobbed at my feet when aiming at my bin.I doubt any of this would surprise the people behind research by the Keep America Beautiful organisation, about how to improve recycling in the office.After studying behaviour in 34 offices in Atlanta, Boston, Houston and San Diego, the researchers concluded that you can increase the amount recycled if you put the right sort of bins next to people’s desks because it is so much more convenient.This is surprising because it is the convenience of desk-side bins that seems to have doomed them.The government of Jersey, to pick a random but typical example, specifically advises employers on its website to get rid of desk bins that make it “too easy to throw things away” and replace them with communal recycling stations.But Keep America Beautiful found that, if you put a recycling bin next to each desk, alongside a smaller rubbish container, you can increase office recycling by 20 per cent and slash contamination of the recyclable materials too. Put simply, “increasing convenience improved recycling behaviour”.This is excellent news. I have never been proud of my cardboard bin. There are two perfectly good recycling drops seven steps away from my desk and it would do me good to get off my chair-bound bottom every now and then.I could not agree more with Pope Francis, whose environmental encyclical last year berated humans for ignoring nature’s “exemplary” ecosystems and creating a throwaway culture that makes much of Earth look like “an immense pile of filth”.But I still like having my own bin.There is a broader environmental lesson here, confirmed most recently by the nearly 400,000 people lining up to buy the new, affordable Tesla electric car. Punishing polluters is fine and often necessary. But the best way to make people change is to give them something they actually want.Twitter: @pilitaclarkSarah O’Connor is away

The deal values the German group at €1.8bn including debt, said a person familiar with the matter.News of the acquisition comes in the same week that ChemChina, the Chinese state-owned group, launched a $43.8bn bid for Swiss agribusiness Syngenta, in what would be China’s largest ever overseas takeover.It also follows ChemChina's purchase of German machinery maker KraussMaffei Group for about $1bn — a transaction that underscored China’s growing interest in German industrial technology.Beijing Enterprises’ foray into Europe highlights China’s urgent need to deal with its waste problem. Beijing is surrounded by rubbish dumps so large that they have been described as the city’s “seventh ring”. Nationally, the government has plans to build 300 new waste-to-energy plants over the next three years to tackle the issue.EEW, which has developed advanced technology for filtering emissions, and was until last year half-owned by German utility Eon, is regarded as an industry leader in this field.With operations in Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, it converts 4.7m tonnes of waste a year into energy. This waste is burnt to produce district heating, steam for industry, as well as enough electricity for 700,000 households.Beyond the waste sector, China has identified the acquisition of European technology companies as a way to modernise its economy, as it shifts from manufacturing and heavy industry to services and consumption. Germany’s reputation for engineering excellence, combined with the weakness of the euro, has made its companies attractive targets. A report by EY this week said that Germany had been the most attractive destination for Chinese investment in Europe last year, with Chinese groups acquiring a total of 36 German companies, up from two in 2009. Britain was ranked second with 34 acquisitions, and France third with 20.In 2015, the largest Sino-German deal was the takeover of Hauck & Aufhäuser Privatbank by the conglomerate Fosun for $210m. But most Chinese investments are concentrated in Germany’s Mittelstand — the small and medium-sized industrial companies, sometimes referred to as “hidden champions”, that make up the backbone of the country’s economy.Traditionally, the Mittelstand has been reluctant to welcome outside investors, but that attitude has changed in recent years, as Asian groups have increasingly made forays into the German corporate landscape.
149;WM;Waste Management;2016-02-03T07:13:41Z;Shanks warns of lower profit amid commodities volatility;;Shanks Group, the London-listed waste management company, has not been immune to market volatility, particularly the continued downturn in the energy and commodities sectors.Shanks has warned that full year results are now expected to be “slightly below” previous expectations, as falling commodities prices has also affected the prices of materials that can be recycled. The company’s hazardous waste business has also been hit by cutbacks in the oil and gas sector, which accounts for around half of the division’s revenues.Said Shanks in an update on Wednesday:Whilst market conditions in the second half have been broadly unchanged in the Commercial Division, the oil, gas and electricity sectors have seen further significant price declines, with consequent direct and indirect impacts on Shanks. In addition, the sharp fall in commodity markets has had an impact on recyclate prices and offtake markets for waste recyclers.Whilst the Group continues to deliver a strong improvement in the Commercial Division, it has not been possible to compensate fully for the impact of the more challenging conditions in the Hazardous Waste and Municipal markets. As a result, the Board expects the Group to deliver a result for the year ending 31 March 2016 which is slightly below its previous expectations.
150;WM;Waste Management;2015-11-08T22:31:00Z;Extracting success from plastic recycling;MBA Polymers masters a complex process to repurpose diverse sources of waste;"To management education aficionados, MBA Polymers may sound like an elective at a top business school. In fact, it is a global plastic recycling group, and the acronym stands for Mike Biddle & Associates, rather than the business degree.“It’s not necessarily a bad affiliation,” says Mr Biddle, the founder of the company, who graduated from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1991 as a Sloan Fellow — the degree is now known as the MSx programme. Driven by the need to understand how business works, he embarked on the course to learn how to turn his idea of repurposing plastic waste from a pipe dream into a viable enterprise.

The idea
With a background in chemical engineering, Mr Biddle spotted a gap in the market in an industry that has been around for years but is not particularly innovative. He wanted to launch the first company that automated plastic recycling on a large scale from highly complex waste, containing a variety of materials such as metals, glass and various types of plastic.The process of extracting plastic from this mixture is extremely complicated because plastic is also usually mixed with other materials.As a result, most plastics end up in landfill sites or are incinerated. This meant there was a huge potential market for a company that could crack the technical challenges. On graduation, determined to launch his venture, he decided to take a risky move and leave behind a successful career with Dow Chemical.The company
MBA Polymers was launched in 1994, but the road to success was not easy with many “dark days”, he confesses. There were long hours and he earned his spurs as an entrepreneur by carrying out early research in his garage.Mr Biddle eventually assembled a team of chemical, mechanical, electrical and mining engineers, and together they invented a way to extract plastics from complex mixtures of waste.He is keeping mum about the separation method, which is covered by a mix of different patents and trade secrets, but he says this process provides an energy-efficient and cost-effective way of making plastic compared with creating new plastic from oil.MBA Polymers produces 100 per cent recycled plastic pellets that are sold to manufacturers to make new items. The pellets are used in components in Nespresso coffee machines and Electrolux vacuum cleaners. Other clients include large electronics, automobile and domestic appliance companies.The company processes about 136,000 tonnes of waste every year, and with recycling plants in the UK, China and Austria, Mr Biddle believes the company is still relatively novel. This is because the sector largely focuses on one particular product, such as bottles or televisions — what is known as “mono-streams” — and is also local in nature.Business school support
Mr Biddle credits his Sloan Fellowship for giving him some of the tools and the confidence to pursue his start-up dream. While at Stanford, he was able to work on the business plan for MBA Polymers. He hands out plaudits to both his classmates and professors for the support they gave him. One academic, strategy professor John Rick Berthold, even became a board member.Giving back
After about 20 years at the helm, Mr Biddle stepped down as president of MBA Polymers in 2014.His entrepreneurial spirit kicked in again and he founded another venture in 2015, Material Solutions, an organisation to help other clean-tech entrepreneurs develop their businesses on a faster scale by passing on his 20 years’ experience of developing a company from a garage start-up to a multinational leader.He remains a non-executive director of MBA Polymers, and describes stepping down as president as one of the hardest decisions he ever had to make. “I still care deeply about the company.”"
151;WM;Waste Management;2015-09-25T14:59:23Z;Raze or recycle: the challenge of ‘recycling’ buildings;Heritage is not just about saving the historic — gasworks, silos, even public toilets, can be ‘repurposed’ into homes;"Converting abandoned infrastructure into other uses is not new. In the 1950s and 1960s, disused warehouses and factories in Jackson Square and Ghirardelli Square, San Francisco were being sympathetically “repurposed” (to use current jargon) rather than razed to the ground.Today, it is no longer just characterful 19th-century industrial buildings that are being repurposed; architects are transforming 1960s and 1970s silos, office blocks, factories and even public toilets into desirable homes.Who would have thought that concrete silos once used to store soya beans could be transformed into swanky apartments? In Copenhagen in 2005, Dutch architect Winy Maas, director and co-founder of MVRDV, had the vision to “hang” glass apartments on to the exterior of two disused 1960s silos rather than fill up the vast interiors. “The silos’ interior space and emptiness was part of their industrial character we wanted to preserve,” says Maas of his harbourside project, Frosilo. “Heritage is not just about historic buildings but ones from more recent decades too.” For those who think 1960s buildings are ugly, Maas suggests that “the juxtaposition of difference creates beauty. Strangeness and difference are also part of the language of beauty.” Hence, modern glass and steel juxtaposed with 1960s concrete.It’s not only the aesthetic challenge that draws Maas to such projects. “For many ecological reasons — land and energy use, available infrastructure — it is better to have more intense environments than to continue the sprawl of suburbia,” he says. “If you want to intensify existing cities you have to deal with the existing built [environment].”One big urban repurposing project on MVRDV’s drawing board is the conversion of a former US army base in Mannheim, Germany, which Maas describes as “a ghost town”. On a 500-hectare site, rows of identical four-storey blocks once housed more than 10,000 Americans. Turning these abandoned apartments into desirable homes will be a challenge. “We’re looking at a catalogue of interpretations to introduce difference and character,” says Maas. Construction is due to start within the year.In the UK, developer Urban Splash has converted a 1960s office block in Birmingham, the Rotunda, into an upmarket residential tower. Although Urban Splash is best known for spacious loft apartments in 19th-century warehouses in Manchester, chairman Tom Bloxham is another champion of the potential for architecture from recent decades. “When I was growing up, people were demolishing Victorian villas because they were draughty,” he says. “We’d never dream of doing that these days yet there are 1960s buildings that are being demolished. With some loving care and attention these could be brought back to life. The problem is usually lack of maintenance.”Urban Splash has commissioned various British architects to give dramatic makeovers to dilapidated 1960s tower blocks in Leeds and Sheffield. Although not “repurposing” as such (as the end-use is still residential) it shows what can be done with a concrete jungle once deemed worthy of demolition. In Sheffield, a modernist sprawl with nearly 1,000 flats — Park Hill — is Europe’s largest listed building. It is undergoing a gradual makeover. Three hundred flats will have been completed by the end of this year. “It’s more environmentally sound to recycle these structures than to knock them down and start again,” says Bloxham. “It saves a lot of rubble going to landfill.” He cites the former 1960s Birmingham Central Library as an example of architecture that could have been repurposed rather than demolished and the much-maligned Robin Hood Gardens estate in east London as one that deserves to be saved.These monumental recycling projects come in different sizes. In Keswick, in the Lake District National Park, a housing association has recently completed the conversion of a two-storey 1960s toilet block, disused for five years, into four small one-person flats.The Keswick Community Housing Trust bought the block, valued at £120,000, from the local council for a nominal £1. Unlike, say Frosilo, where architects have made a feature of the structure’s previous life, any signs of the block’s history will be wiped clean. “We’re not leaving any souvenirs, not the gents and ladies signs or anything. We don’t want residents to be teased, saying that they live at Poo Corner or anything like that,” says trust chairman, Bill Bewley.“It’s a tricky little project — we need new stairs and have to move windows but it’s all worth it as there’s a real shortage of homes in the Lake District and most jobs are low-paid,” says Bewley.There were 17 applications to rent the four flats. An official opening will be held on September 29.It is to meet the demand for low-priced housing for young and first-time buyers that Curt Ahnstrom, chief executive of Scanprop Development, commissioned Swedish architects White Arkitekter to transform an enormous disused 1970s brick building in Stockholm. The plan is to repurpose the former Ericsson headquarters, also known as the Brick, into 1,100 apartments. This being Sweden, there will also be 4,000 bicycle spaces.The first phase is scheduled for completion in 2018. Architect David Alton acknowledges the challenge of taking the Brick, “a huge, dominant building” and turning it — and the surrounding area next to a motorway — into a desirable and liveable environment. “Housing in itself does not make up a proper cityscape,” he says. “To create a desirable place to live, work and love there needs to be other functions — businesses, shops, cafés, restaurants, high-quality parks and squares, pedestrian areas. The challenge is to take this harsh industrial building, part of our modern industrial heritage, and transform it.” The transformation will include living roofs planted with sedums and an undulating 200m roof-top running track.The American developer Two Trees is taking a similar approach in Brooklyn, New York, commissioning SHoP architects to convert the abandoned 19th-century Domino sugar refinery into housing, commercial space and public areas. Before any homes are even begun, community arts projects are taking place in and around the buildings. “New Yorkers prefer to live and work in vibrant, creative, mixed-use neighbourhoods, and they will pay a premium to do so,” says David Lombino, of Two Trees. “Cultivating arts and culture can help create those desirable conditions.”In London, the same is happening in King’s Cross, with a variety of high-profile events — most recently an open-air natural swimming pool — creating a desirable neighbourhood before the area’s regeneration is even complete. A noticeable repurposing project in the area is the canal-side gasholders. A triplet of gasholders, grade II-listed, is being repurposed into 144 residential units. The 19th-century steel work is being restored and re-erected. The three residential structures, each with a rooftop garden, will be at different heights inside their circular frames, “to reference back to what it was like when the gasholders rose and fell depending how full of gas they were”, says Chris Wilkinson of Wilkinson Eyre, the architects responsible for the gasholders project (as well as the major repurposing of London’s 1930s Battersea Power Station). The juxtaposition of the three structures inside the historic holders will enhance London’s character, says Wilkinson. “London has a good mix of old and new, it lends vitality,” he adds.So what of the future? What structures are we building today that will become redundant and ripe for repurposing? Some suggest that in cities of the future, car parks won’t be necessary as places become car-free. In the US, Savannah College of Art and Design students have designed “SCADpad” homes that fit on to a single parking space in a multistorey car park in Atlanta. At just 12.5 sq metres, they are tiny but it’s a big idea for how we might rise to the challenge of growing urban populations.The huge walls shelter pizza restaurants and cafés, tobacconists, souvenir shops, even a few apartments. This was the third century palace of Diocletian in Split, the retirement home of the Roman emperor. After the Romans fled, it was appropriated by the remaining citizens and became a walled city — one in which the walls were inhabited.The reuse of architecture has a long history. And why not? The most sustainable thing in the world is to reuse the best and biggest buildings of the past when their original use expires. Tate Modern in London (a former power station), MoMA PS1 in New York (a public school) or the new Fondazione Prada in Milan (a brandy distillery) have enshrined the behemoths of the industrial city as the natural habitat for contemporary art.It’s not just art. Hamburg’s vast, late and expensive new concert hall the Elbphilharmonie is emerging from a 1960s brick warehouse, while Turin’s former Lingotto Fiat factory has been transformed into a cocktail of shopping mall, cultural centre, office complex and high-end eating destination.If these reappropriations have become familiar, other examples underline the potential of an intelligent repurposing of all imaginable architectures. The Torre de David was a bank’s office building in Caracas that was abandoned halfway through construction due to Venezuela’s banking crisis. It was turned into the world’s tallest squat, transformed by poor citizens into a remarkable vertical city. Residents were evicted last year and the experiment ended but it illustrated the possibilities of bottom-up reuse. Perhaps the most remarkable instance is Wunderland Kalkar, a German amusement park built out of a nuclear power station. It is surely one of the weirdest places to play.The current passion for reuse might be explained by sustainability or fashion but, most importantly, it affords a sense of history and texture, taking advantage of buildings already embedded in cities. They are buildings with atmosphere, history and stories inscribed in their fabric. And sometimes sustainability isn’t just about the energy and materials saved but about the stories, craft and intelligence embodied in its walls.Photographs: Urban Splash; White View; DeAgostini/Getty; Victoria Bonn-Meuser"
152;WM;Waste Management;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
